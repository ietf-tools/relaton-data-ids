abstract:
- content: "<p>This document was prompted by a desire to allow deployments of distributed
    SASL implementations, so that all authentication can be performed in a one central
    place. It tries to fulfill the following requirements: 1) The SASL framework is
    client/server authentication, but it doesn't preclude either the client or the
    server implementations from being distributed. 2) It might be also desirable to
    proxy an authentication exchange whether it was initiated over LDAP or another
    SASL-supporting protocol. This document defines a Distributed Authentication LDAP
    extended operation, that enables applications (including LDAP proxies and gateways)
    that authenticate using SASL, to use LDAP for performing authentication, by forwarding
    the SASL authentication requests to an LDAP server.</p>"
