abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control mechanism
    for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment. This document
    introduces Faster Restart, an optional mechanism for safely improving the behavior
    of interactive flows that use TFRC. Faster Restart is proposed for use with TFRC
    and with TFRC-SP, the Small Packet variant of TFRC. We present Faster Restart
    in general terms as a congestion control mechanism, and further discuss Faster
    Restart for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control IDs
    3 and 4.</p>"
