abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years, high-bandwidth LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite networks,
    such as Starlink and OneWeb, have seen tremendous development and are gradually
    becoming an important part of the global Internet. However, due to the unique
    characteristics of satellite networks, using TCP for data transmission faces challenges
    in multiple aspects, such as high latency caused by long-distance propagation
    and high error rates due to signal attenuation. This proposal summarizes the basic
    requirements that need to be considered for designing transport layer protocols
    tailored to LEO satellites.</p>"
