abstract:
- content: "<p>One physical network can carry multiple logical networks. Moreover,
    we can use multiple physical networks at the same time in a host. In that environment,
    end-hosts might have multiple IP addresses and be required to use them selectively.
    Without an appropriate source/ destination address selection mechanism, the host
    will experience some trouble in the communication. RFC 3484 defines both the source
    and destination address selection algorithms, but the multi-prefix environment
    considered here needs additional rules beyond the default operation. This document
    describes the possible problems that end- hosts could encounter in an environment
    with multiple logical networks.</p>"
