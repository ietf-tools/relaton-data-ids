abstract:
- content: "<p>Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for, or deploying
    IPv6 into their networks. The operators often face challenges related to both
    IPv6 introduction along with a growing risk of IPv4 run out within their organizations.
    The overall problem for many of there operators will be to meet the simultaneous
    needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4 connectivity for legacy
    devices and systems with a depleting supply of IPv4 addresses. The overall transition
    will take most networks form an IPv4-Only environment to a dual stack network
    environment and potentially an IPv6-Only operating mode. This document helps provide
    a framework for Wireline providers who may be faced with many of these challenges
    as they consider what IPv6 transition technologies to use, how to use the selected
    technologies and when to use them.</p>"
