abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges provide provide end-station services to their attached end
    stations. To avoid potential frame duplication and loops, the rule that only one
    edge RBridge is allowed to be the frame forwarder of a VLAN on a shared LAN segment
    is employed by base TRILL protocol, even though there are multiple RBridges attached
    to that segment. However, in some application scenarios, for example an end station
    is multi-homed to multiple RBridges, there is a need to improve the resiliency
    and increase the available network bandwidth of the connection. This means all
    those RBriges attached to the end station can act as the frame forwarders of a
    specific VLAN. This kind of active-active connection violates the above rule.
    The violation may bring some additional problems, such as the flip-flopping of
    the nickname-MAC correspondences for such end stations in remote RBridges' forwarding
    tables, frame dropping because of failure of Reverse Path Forwarding Check(RPF
    Check) on RBridges, etc. The RPF Check problem has been addressed in [CMT]. This
    document proposes the concept of Virtual RBridge, along with the pseudo-nickname
    configuration for this Virtual RBridge, to address the above problems in accompany
    with [CMT].</p>"
