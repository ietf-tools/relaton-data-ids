abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the service-specific implementation and requirements
    for Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) of TDM circuits using SONET/SDH
    payload formats over packet networks using IP or MPLS. This draft extends SONET/SDH
    SPE emulation proposal [CEP-SPE], providing SONET VT1.5/2/3/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2
    circuit emulation. This draft also provides bandwidth saving modes for SONET STS-1
    and SDH VC-3/4 carrying tributaries or asynchronous T3/E3 signals. This proposal
    is optimized for VT level cross connect applications, for PDH to SONET/SDH emulation
    and for carrying PDH circuits across a PSN. The applicability statement for TDM
    circuit emulation (PDH and SONET/SDH) is described in [TDM- APP].</p>"
