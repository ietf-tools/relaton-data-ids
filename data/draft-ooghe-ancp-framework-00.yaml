abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access
    Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node
    (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service
    reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related and Subscriber-related
    operations. The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission
    of the information does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather
    using a direct device-device communication. This allows for performing access
    link related operations within those network elements, while avoiding impact on
    the existing OSS systems.</p>"
