abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR policy is a set of
    candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment lists with necessary path
    attributes. If an SR policy has multiple valid candidate paths, the device chooses
    the candidate path with the greatest preference value. If the chosen path fails,
    the SR policy must select another candidate path. During path reselection, packet
    loss might occur and thus affect service continuity. Therefore the candidate path
    hot-standby function occurs, the headend can compute two candidate paths, one
    is master and the other is backup, set them to the forwarding plane, and in this
    way, the switchover time is reduced. This document defines extensions to BGP to
    distribute hot-standby switch within SR policies.</p>"
