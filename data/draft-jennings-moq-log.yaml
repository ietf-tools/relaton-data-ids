    for logging in shared with the real time media and impacts the media quality.
    There is a desire to transport the logging data at an appropriate priority level
    over the same transport as the media. This allows the logging data to take advantage
    of times when the media bitrate is blow the peak rate while not impact the peak
    rate available for media. This document specifies how to send syslog RFC5424 type
