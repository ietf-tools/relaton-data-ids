abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebSocket Protocol [RFC6455] requires a new transport connection
    for every WebSocket connection. This presents a scalability problem when many
    clients connect to the same server, and is made worse by having multiple clients
    running in different tabs of the same user agent. This extension provides a way
    for separate logical WebSocket connections to share an underlying transport connection.
    Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
