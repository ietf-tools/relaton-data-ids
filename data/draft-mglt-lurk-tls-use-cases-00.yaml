abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS as been designed to setup and authenticate transport layer between
    endpoints. A lot of applications are using TLS in order to set communications
    between the applications end points. As long as applications end points and transport
    end points were combined into the same host, application authentication could
    be combined with the transport authentication. As the current internet is decoupling
    the transport and application layers, such model may not be applicable anymore.
    In other words, TLS authentication cannot be handled on behalf of the application
    authentication. This document describes use cases where the authentication of
    the transport layer differs from the authentication performed at the application
    layer.</p>"
