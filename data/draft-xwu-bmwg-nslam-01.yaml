abstract:
- content: "<p>While the networking technologies have evolved over the years, the
    layered approach has been dominant in many network solutions. Each layer may have
    multiple interchangeable, competing alternatives that deliver a similar set of
    functionality. In order to provide an objective benchmarking data among various
    implementations, the need arises for a common abstract model for each network
    service layer, with a set of required and optional specifications in respective
    layers. Many overlay and or underlay solutions can be described using these models.</p>"
