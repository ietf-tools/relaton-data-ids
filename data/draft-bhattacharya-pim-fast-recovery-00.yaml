abstract:
- content: "<p>When a PIM router reboots, either because of uncontrolled failover
    or because of ISSU, it needs to reconcile the PIM entries. For this, rebooting
    router sends PIM hello with new GenId. In reponse, neighbors send a new hello
    and replay PIM J/P message. Regardless an application maintaing full mroute states,
    the rebooting route must wait for this replay to complete only after which it
    can mark the oif reconciliation complete. This process is undeterministic today.
    This draft proposes a new mechanism to achieve a faster reconcilaition time. For
    this a new Hello option and a new message type has been introduced.</p>"
