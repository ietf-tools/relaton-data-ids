abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6443 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia'
    describes how devices use the Internet to place emergency calls and how Public
    Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) handle Internet multimedia emergency calls natively.
    The exchange of multimedia traffic for emergency services involves a Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) session establishment starting with a SIP INVITE that negotiates
    various parameters for that session. These calls involve a person, who uses the
    interactive media to communicate with the PSAP. In some cases, however, the transmission
    of application data is all that is needed, and no interactive media channel is
    established. Examples of such environments include alerts issued by a temperature
    sensor, burglar alarm, or chemical spill sensor. Often these alerts are conveyed
    as one-shot data transmissions. These type of interactions are called 'non-interactive
    emergency calls'. This document describes use of a SIP MESSAGE transaction containing
    a container for the data based on the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). MESSAGE
    does not establish a session, which differentiates this type of emergency request
    from a SIP INVITE, which would. Any device that needs to initiate a request for
    emergency services where no interactive media channel will be established would
    use the mechanisms in this document.</p>"
