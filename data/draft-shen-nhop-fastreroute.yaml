abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism called NFRR (Nexthop Fast ReRoute)
    to perform fast re-route for any type of traffic in the event of a link/node failure
    or a nexthop unreachable. The protected traffic can be IP, MPLS, unicast or multicast.
    The re-routed traffic can either be destined to the nexthop router or to the next-nexthop
    router. RSVP explicitly routed LSPs are used as a tool to perform the local patch
    for minimizing the packet loss.</p>"
