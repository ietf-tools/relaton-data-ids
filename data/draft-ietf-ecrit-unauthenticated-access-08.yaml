abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling device
    has acquired rights to use the access network or that no authentication is required
    for the access network, such as for public wireless access points. Subsequent
    protocol interactions, such as obtaining location information, learning the address
    of the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are
    largely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures. In some cases,
    however, the device does not have these credentials for network access, does not
    have a VoIP service provider, or the credentials have become invalid, e.g., because
    the user has exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has expired. With
    features provided by the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) there is precedence
    for some of these use cases and the transition to IP-based emergency calling creates
    the desire to replicate functionality the PSTN already offers today. For example,
    in many countries persons seeking help are empowered to initiate emergency calls
    without having a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) in their mobile phone. This
    document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology and describes an
    extension for the base IETF emergency services architecture to address these scenarios.</p>"
