abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM Flooding Mechanism is a generic PIM message exchange mechanism
    that allows multicast information to be exchanged between PIM routers hop-by-hop.
    One example is PIM Flooding Mechanism and Source Discovery which allows last hop
    routers to learn about new sources using PFM messages, without the need for initial
    data registers, Rendezvous Points or shared trees. This document defines a new
    TLV for announcing sources that allows for Sub-TLVs that can be used for providing
    various types of information. This document also defines methodologies that enhance
    forwarding efficiency in PFM-SD deployments.</p>"
