abstract:
- content: "<p>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due consideration
    of operations and management issues related to the protocol. Retrofitting operations
    and management recommendations to protocols is sub-optimal. The purpose of this
    document is to provide guidance to authors of protocol documents about aspects
    to consider related to the operations and management that should be considered
    for inclusion in documents defining requirements or functionality of new protocols
    or protocol extensions.</p>"
