abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an architectural framework for the MPLS Network
    Actions (MNA) technologies. MNA technologies are used to indicate actions for
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and/or MPLS packets and to transfer data needed for
    these actions. The document describes a common set of network actions and information
    elements supporting additional operational models and capabilities of MPLS networks.
    Some of these actions are defined in existing MPLS specifications, while others
    require extensions to existing specifications to meet the requirements found in
    "Requirements for MPLS Network Action Indicators and Ancillary Data".</p>
