abstract:
- content: "<p>When using a publicly available DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) server, some clients
    may suffer poor performance when the authoritative DNS server is located far from
    the DoH server. For example, a publicly available DoH server provided by a Content
    Delivery Network (CDN) should be able to resolve names hosted by that CDN with
    good performance but might take longer to resolve names provided by other CDNs,
    or might provide suboptimal results if that CDN is using DNS- based load balancing
    and returns different address records depending or where the DNS query originated
    from. This document attempts to lessen these issues by allowing the web server
    to indicate to the client which DoH server can best resolve its addresses. This
    document defines an HTTP header field that enables web host operators to inform
    user agents of the preferred DoH servers to use for subsequent DNS lookups for
    the host's domain.</p>"
