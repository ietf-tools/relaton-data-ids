abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is network based mobility protocol which
    provides IP session continuity for a mobile node without its involvement in mobility
    management. PMIPv6 also can be viewed as a service and authorization provided
    by networks. A mobile node can decide if it wants to use the service or not. This
    proposal describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) based mechanism
    for the service negotiation between a mobile node and an AAA server.</p>"
