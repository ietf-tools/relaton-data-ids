abstract:
- content: "<p>A fundamental concept in Label Distribution Protocol - Interior Gateway
    Protocol (LDP-IGP) Synchronization is that LDP is fully established before the
    IGP path is switched for IP forwarding. This document proposes a mechanism to
    affirm the switching time accurately by propagating a explicit notification from
    downstream. The interoperability with other Label Switched Routers (LSRs), which
    may not support the mechanism, is also considered.</p>"
