abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and
    return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation
    (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6. This latter category
    of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific
    fragmentation and reassembly to the point that it would be highly desirable to
    push the workload back to the IPv6 communication endpoints. A common case that
    exhibits these link characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels. Additionally,
    IPv6 nodes can avoid path MTU discovery issues even when no link adaptation is
    necessary by performing a small amount of fragmentation and/or by probing the
    path as necessary. This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6
    specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.</p>
