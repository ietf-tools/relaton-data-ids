- content: "<p>This document describes the problem space of remote service installation
    and configuration in the provider's network through a centralized management system.
    This is a typical scenario for virtual function installation and dynamic configuration
    in network function virtualization (NFV) context. It is also a typical scenario
    in cloud computing environment where end users do not have to install applications
    in their end hosts, but can install their own featured powerful software application
    in the cloud. This specification also identifies the scope that needs standardization
    based on the problems.</p>"
