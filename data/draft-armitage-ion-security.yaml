- content: "<p>This document aims to assist people attempting to understand the security
    limitations of existing ION working group protocols RFC 2022 (MARS), and RFC xxxx
    (NHRP). As RFC 2022 and RFC xxxx share their basic control message protocol(s),
    this document also identifies common areas amenable to improvement using additional
    security TLVs.</p>"
