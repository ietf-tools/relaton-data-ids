abstract:
- content: "<p>In RFC 8957 the concept of MPLS synonymos flow labels (SFL) was introduced.
    This document describes a simple control protocol that runs over an associated
    control header to request, withdraw, and extend the lifetime of such labels. It
    is not the only control protocol that might be used to support SFL, but it has
    the benefit of being able to be used without modifying of the existing MPLS control
    protocols. The existence of this design is not intended to restrict the ability
    to enhance an existing MPLS control protocol to add a similar capability. A Querier
    MUST wait a configured time (suggested wait of 60 seconds) before re-attempting
    a Withdraw request. No more than three Withdraw requests SHOULD be made. These
    restrictions are to prevent overloading the control plane of the actioning router.</p>"
