abstract:
- content: "<p>There is no standard, interoperable method for associating Internet
    service identifiers with payment information. This document specifies a means
    for retrieving information sufficient for a party to render payment using various
    payment networks given the recipient's email address by leveraging the DNS to
    securely publish payment information in a payment association record. A payment
    association record associates an Internet service identifier such as an email
    address with payment information such as an account number or Bitcoin address.</p>"
