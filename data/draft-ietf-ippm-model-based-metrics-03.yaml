abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
    if an end-to-end Internet path can meet predefined transport performance targets
    by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths. The subpath-at-a-time
    tests can be robustly applied to key infrastructure, such as interconnects, to
    accurately detect if it will prevent the full end-to-end paths that traverse it
    from meeting the specified target performance. Each IP diagnostic test consists
    of a precomputed traffic pattern and a statistical criteria for evaluating packet
    delivery. The traffic patterns are precomputed to mimic TCP or other transport
    protocol over a long path but are independent of the actual details of the subpath
    under test. Likewise the success criteria depends on the target performance for
    the long path and not the details of the subpath. This makes the measurements
    open loop, which introduces several important new properties and eliminates most
    of the difficulties encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics. This document
    does not define diagnostic tests, but provides a framework for designing suites
    of diagnostics tests that are tailored the confirming the target performance.
