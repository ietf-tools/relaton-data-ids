abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the necessity and feasibility to introduce
    a proxy network node between the congested network node and the traffic sender.
    The proxy network node is used to translate the congestion notification. The congested
    network node sends the congestion notification to the proxy network node in a
    format defined in this document, and the proxy network node translates the received
    congestion notification to a format known by the traffic sender and resends the
    translated congestion notification to the traffic sender.</p>"
