- content: "<p>This document outlines the usecase for implementing Service Function
    Chaining(SFC) based on SRv6 in cloud, motivated by the increasing demand for collabration
    between cloud and network. The capabilities of SRv6 in most cloud service are
    not ready, such as SFC based on SRv6. If we want to realize these capabilities
    of SRv6 end-to-end, virtual routers(VR) can be deployed as an agent which support
    SRv6 in the cloud.</p>"
