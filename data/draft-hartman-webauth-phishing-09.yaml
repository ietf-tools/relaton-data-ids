abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes requirements for protocols between web browsers
    and relying parties at websites; these requirements also impact third parties
    involved in the authentication process. These requirements minimize the likelihood
    that criminals will be able to gain the credentials necessary to impersonate a
    user or be able to fraudulently convince users to disclose personal information.
    To meet these requirements browsers must change. Websites must never receive information
    such as passwords that can be used to impersonate the user to third parties. Browsers
    should authenticate the website to the browser as part of authenticating the user
    to the website. Browsers MUST flag situations when this authentication fails and
    flag situations when the target website is not authorized to accept the identity
    being offered as this is a strong indication of fraud. These requirements may
    serve as a basis for requirements for preventing fraud in environments other than
    the web.</p>"
