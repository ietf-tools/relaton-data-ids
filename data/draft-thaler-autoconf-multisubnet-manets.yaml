abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach to addressing nodes in Mobile Ad-hoc
    Networks (MANETs) which involves assigning a separate subnet to each MANET router.
    This approach avoids many of the problems that arise in other approaches, and
    is intended to allow existing protocols and applications to work unmodified.</p>"
