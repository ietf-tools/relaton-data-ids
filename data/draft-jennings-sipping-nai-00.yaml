abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to SIP that enable a network of
    trusted SIP servers to assert the identity of end users or end systems, and to
    convey indications of end-user requested privacy. The use of these extensions
    are only applicable inside an administrative domain, or among federations of administrative
    domains with previously agreed-upon policies for usage of such information. This
    document does NOT offer a general privacy or identity model suitable for inter-domain
    use or use in the Internet at large.</p>"
