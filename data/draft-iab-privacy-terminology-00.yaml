abstract:
- content: '<p>Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout the
    last few millennia by all manner of people. Its most striking feature is that
    nobody seems able to agree upon a precise definition of what it actually is. In
    order to discuss privacy in any meaningful way a tightly defined context needs
    to be elucidated. The specific context of privacy used within this document is
    that of "personal data", any information relating to a data subject; a data subject
    is an identified natural person or a natural person who can be identified, directly
    or indirectly. This context is highly relevant since a lot of work within the
    IETF involves defining protocols that can potentially transport (either explicitly
    or implicitly) personal data. This document aims to establish a basic lexicon
    around privacy so that IETF contributors who wish to discuss privacy considerations
    within their work can do so using terminology consistent across the area. Note:
    This document is discussed at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy</p>'
