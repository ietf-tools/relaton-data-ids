abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum features
    in calculations. For over 20 years, it has been known that if very large, specialized
    quantum computers could be built, they could have a devastating effect on asymmetric
    classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and elliptic curve signatures and
    key exchange, as well as (but in smaller scale) on symmetric cryptographic algorithms
    such as block ciphers, MACs, and hash functions. There has already been a great
    deal of study on how to create algorithms that will resist large, specialized
    quantum computers, but so far, the properties of those algorithms make them onerous
    to adopt before they are needed. Small quantum computers are being built today,
    but it is still far from clear when large, specialized quantum computers will
    be built that can recover private or secret keys in classical algorithms at the
    key sizes commonly used today. It is important to be able to predict when large,
    specialized quantum computers usable for cryptanalysis will be possible so that
    organization can change to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well before they
    are needed. This document describes quantum computing, how it might be used to
    attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly how to predict when large,
    specialized quantum computers will become feasible.</p>"
