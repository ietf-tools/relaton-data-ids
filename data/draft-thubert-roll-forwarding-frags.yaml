abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to be routed, a fragmented packet must be reassembled at every
    hop of a multihop link where lower layer fragmentation occurs. Considering that
    the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an 802.15.4 frame can have a payload
    limited to 74 bytes in the worst case, a packet might end up fragmented into as
    many as 18 fragments at the 6LoWPAN shim layer. If a single one of those fragments
    is lost in transmission, all fragments must be resent, further contributing to
    the congestion that might have caused the initial packet loss. This draft introduces
    a simple protocol to forward and recover individual fragments that might be lost
    over multiple hops between 6LoWPAN endpoints.</p>"
