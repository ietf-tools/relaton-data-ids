abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC5575 which defines a Border Gateway Protocol
    Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be
    used to distribute traffic flow specifications. This allows the routing system
    to propagate information regarding more specific components of the traffic aggregate
    defined by an IP destination prefix. This draft specifices IPv4 traffic flow specificaitnos.
    Other drafst specify, IPv6), MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses, and NV03 encapsulation
    of IP addresses. The information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol
    algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes such as inter-
    provider peering agreements. There are applications of that encoding format: 1)
    automation of inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is
    required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service attacks; 2) enable
    traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service, and 3) aid centralized
    control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context. Some of deployments of these three
    applications can be handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic flow
    filters, and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community Flow Specification
    actions. This defines the first two applications. This document provides the definition
    of a BGP NLRI which carries traffic flow specification filters, and Extended Community
    values which encode the actions a routing system can take if a packet matches
    the traffic flow filters. The specification requires that the BGP Flow Specification
    traffic filters follows a string ordering, and that the BGP Flow Specification
    Extended Communities actions are processed in a defined order.</p>"
