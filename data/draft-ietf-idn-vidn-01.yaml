abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method that enables domain names to be used
    in both local and English scripts, as a directory-search solution at an upper
    layer above the DNS. The method first converts virtual domain names typed in local
    scripts into the corresponding domain names in English scripts that comply with
    the DNS, using the knowledge of transliteration between local and English scripts.
    Then, the method searches for and displays domain names in English scripts that
    are active on the Internet so that the user can choose any of them. The conversion
    takes place automatically and transparently in the user's applications before
    DNS queries are sent, and so, the method does not make any change to the DNS nor
    require separate name servers.</p>"
