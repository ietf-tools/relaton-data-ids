abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a methodology for automatically allocating IPv6
    [RFC2460] address blocks for networks that run BGP [RFC4271] and are either single-homed
    or multi-homed [BARBER2011]. The automatic allocation is taken from a specific
    /16 block assigned by IANA for this purpose. Networks that require more than this
    single /48 can still request additional allocations via the existing RIR process.
    Networks are not forced to use this allocation and can ignore this completely.
    Availability of the /48 assignment via this mechanism does not change existing
    mechanisms for obtaining IPv6 assignments through the existing RIR (Regional Internet
    Registry) or LIR (Local Internet Registry) mechanisms. There is an implicit assumption
    that it's a good thing to promote networks to enable IPv6 with a near-zero effort.</p>"
