abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of IPv6 in 3GPP cellular broadband for accessing the Internet
    and other data services like VoLTE via smartphones has increased as a result of
    EPS network deployments worldwide and new IPv6 capable smartphones tablets, and
    netbook computers. The upcoming rise of IoT/M2M is anticipated to bring billions
    of new devices into these networks and the majority of these devices will be using
    only IPv6. This document discusses the EPS network impact of IoT/M2M IPv6 connectivity
    specifically targeting the IPv6 Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC),
    as specified in [RFC4861] and [RFC4862], which currently is the only supported
    IPv6 address configuration mechanism in 3GPP standards.</p>"
