abstract:
- content: "<p>This document adds recommendations for adoption of ssh-curves from
    the [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves] and new-modp from the [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-modp-dh-sha2],
    and deprecates some previously specified Key Exchange Method algorithm names for
    the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It also updates [RFC4253], [RFC4419], [RFC4462],
    and [RFC5656] by specifying the set key exchange algorithms that currently exist
    and which ones MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be implemented. New key exchange
    methods use the SHA-2 family of hashes.</p>"
