abstract:
- content: "<p>In many roaming scenarios, it is necessary to be able to carry cost
    information between the different parties in order to facilitate credit checking,
    real-time accounting, cost presentation to the user. It is also necessary that
    this information be interpretable by automated systems, that these systems be
    able to modify it to take commissions into account, and that non-repudiation mechanisms
    be available. This document proposes such a system to be used with AAA architectures.</p>"
