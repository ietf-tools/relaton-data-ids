abstract:
- content: "<p>The Route header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is
    used to cause a request to visit a set of hops on its way towards the final destination.
    Several specifications have defined rules for how a user agent obtains and then
    uses a set of Route header fields in the transmission of a request. These include
    the SIP specification itself, the Service-Route header field specification, the
    SIP server option in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and others.
    Unfortunately, these specifications are not consistent and the resulting behavior
    at clients and servers is not clear or complete. This document resolves this problem
    by defining a consistent set of logic, and in the process, serves as an update
    to the Service-Route specification.</p>"
