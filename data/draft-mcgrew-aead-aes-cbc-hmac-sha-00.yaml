abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with
    additional authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on the composition of the
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of
    operation for encryption, and the HMAC- SHA1 message authentication code (MAC).
    It also separately defines a generic composition method that can be used with
    other MACs and randomized ciphers. These algorithms are randomized, and thus are
    suitable for use with applications that cannot provide distinct nonces to each
    invocation of the AEAD encrypt operation.</p>"
