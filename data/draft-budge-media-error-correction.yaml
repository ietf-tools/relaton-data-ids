abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a media-independent error-correction scheme
    using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), along with the payload format for
    encapsulating both error-correction signaling and media bitstreams in RTP. It
    enables the reconstruction of lost packets across a connectionless transport such
    as RTP over UDP. The goal of this scheme is to maximize isochrony, the regular
    and timely delivery of data, with minimal bandwidth, latency, and computational
    costs.</p>"
