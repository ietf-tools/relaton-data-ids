abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP type-length-value (TLV) message types provide a mechanism for encapsulating
    additional information in an EAP conversation. In some cases it is useful to cryptographically
    protect this information to maintain the integrity and/or privacy of the communication.
    This document defines a TLV type that uses message authentication to maintain
    the integrity of the data, encryption to protect the privacy of the data and sequence
    numbers to protect replays or re-sequencing of the data. Although protected TLVs
    must be chained after an authentication mechanism that generates key material
    the protection mechanism is independent of any particular authentication mechanism.</p>"
