abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Routing header type 3 (termed as RH3) is defined and used in Low-Power
    and Lossy Networks (LLNs) that are typically constrained in resources (limited
    communication data rate, processing power, energy capacity, memory). Based on
    the mechanisms introduced by RH3, this document specifies an new IPv6 Routing
    Header type that provides encapsulation capability of segments with various lengths
    and can be applied to more scenarios.</p>"
