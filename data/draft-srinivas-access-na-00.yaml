abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of the SIP protocol for controlling Networked Appliances (NA)
    has been proposed in several recent IETF drafts including [1] and [2]. The issue
    of controlling access to NAs from a remote device is paramount, especially in
    the context of NAs in the home. This draft investigates the issue of where the
    access rules must be stored and executed to control access to an NA. The use of
    proxy gateways within the home domain and their resultant impact on communication
    pathways between the remote device and the NAs have been studied.</p>"
