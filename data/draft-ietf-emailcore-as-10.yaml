abstract:
- content: '<p>Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is
    still in very active use. While the basic protocols and formats for mail transport
    and message formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and thinking in
    more recent years have supplemented those core protocols with additional features
    and suggestions for their use. This Applicability Statement describes the relationship
    among many of those protocols and provides guidance and makes recommendations
    for the use of features of the core protocols. Open Issues * #40 - Recommended
    SMTP Extensions (https://github.com/ietf-wg- emailcore/emailcore/issues/40): Requires
    discussion of current/new text. * #78 - Advice against using URL %-encoding on
    non-ASCII email addresses (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/ issues/78):
    Is the "final" proposed text in Section 4.2 sufficient? * #79 - Add Internationalization
    Considerations Section (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/79):
    Requires discussion of any new text. * #84 - Handling of Trace Header Fields by
    MUAs (https://github.com/ ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/84): Is the proposed
    text in Section 3.3 sufficient? * #85 - What mail agents should do/not do with
    Received header fields (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/85):
    Is the proposed text intended to replace just some or all of the text in Section
    3.2.2? * #86 - Expand on operational meaning of being a Trace Header Field (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/86):
    Requires discussion of any new text. * #92 - CNAME handling in "5.1. Locating
    the Target Host" (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/92): Requires
    discussion of any new text. * #93 - "7.3. VRFY, EXPN, and Security" should point
    to SMTP AUTH RFC (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/93): Requires
    discussion of any new text.</p>'
