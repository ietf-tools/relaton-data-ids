abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet users continue to find new ways to apply existing Internet
    standards and technology. In particular, it has become common usage to use the
    DNS to locate services on a particular network, by use of names like gopher.tc.umn.edu
    or www.hypermall.com. This was a natural use of DNS. However, the continued commercialization
    of the Internet and the current trend towards service providers who maintain services
    and 'pseudo-domains' for numerous customers, and the difficulties of using multiple
    IP's requires that not only an IP address, but a port number as well, be available
    to client software looking for a particular service. This draft describes a simple
    way to support 'multi-home' servers through the DNS, with no changes to existing
    protocols, and only minimal additions to client software.</p>"
