- content: "<p>In the scenarios of both client to service and service to service interconnections,
    the host-oriented addressing mechanism turns out to be ineffective, and employment
    of a standalone service ID in routing network could facilitate the fine-grained
    interfaces of underlay networking capabilities, as well as cross connections among
    services residing at multiple sites.</p>"
