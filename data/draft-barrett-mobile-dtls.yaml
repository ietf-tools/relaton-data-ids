abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile DTLS (Mobi-D) is an extension to DTLS that provides host mobility
    support. After obtaining a new IP address or port, a DTLS client mobile host can
    continue sending to its DTLS server correspondent host. The mobile host continues
    to use the existing set of security parameters, from the new address, without
    re- negotiation. The correspondent host accepts packets from the new IP address
    or port, also without re-negotiation. After receiving any valid DTLS packet from
    the mobile host's new address or port, the correspondent host uses the new address
    or port to send to the mobile host.</p>"
