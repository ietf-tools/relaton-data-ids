abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use case of providing IPsec-based flow
    protection by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller (aka. Security
    Controller) and establishes the requirements to support this service. It considers
    two main well-known scenarios in IPsec: (i) gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-host.
    This document describes a mechanism based on the SDN paradigm to support the distribution
    and monitoring of IPsec information from a Security Controller to one or several
    flow-based Network Security Function (NSF). The NSFs implement IPsec to protect
    data traffic between network resources with IPsec. The document focuses in the
    NSF Facing Interface by providing models for Configuration and State data model
    required to allow the Security Controller to configure the IPsec databases (SPD,
    SAD, PAD) and IKE to establish security associations with a reduced intervention
    of the network administrator. NOTE: State data model will be developed as part
    of this work but it is still TBD.</p>"
