abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast security algorithm based on agent node can select the group
    node corresponding to the smallest path cost to be the agent node, and multicast
    in accordance with the optimal multicast routing. In addition, the multicast source
    node uses the key different from the group key to encrypt multicast data to meet
    the requirements of multicast security. The agent nodes can be different for different
    multicast sources, which can spread the burden of the agent node and avoid the
    excessive burden problem when the same node as the agent node of different sources.</p>"
