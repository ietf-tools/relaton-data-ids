abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing Bridges (RBridges) implement the TRansparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol which provide a transparent least- cost frame
    routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, while also inherently
    providing loop mitigation. As RBridges are deployed in real-world situations,
    operators will need tools for debugging problems that arise. This document specifies
    a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM)
    purposes in RBridge campuses. The features specified in this document include
    tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.</p>"
