abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism to advertise different IPv6 prefixes
    which are associated with different color attributes to establish end-to-end intent-aware
    paths for SRv6 services. Such IPv6 prefixes are called "Colorful Prefixes", and
    this mechanism is called Colorful Prefix Routing (CPR). In SRv6 networks, the
    colorful prefixes are the SRv6 locators associated with different intent. SRv6
    services (e.g. SRv6 VPN services) with specific intent could be assigned with
    SRv6 SIDs under the corresponding SRv6 locators, which are advertised as colorful
    prefixes. This allows the SRv6 service traffic to be steered into end-to-end intent-aware
    paths simply based on the SRv6 Service SIDs. The existing IPv6 Address Family
    could be used for the advertisement of IPv6 colorful prefixes, thus this mechanism
    is easy to interoperate and allows incremental deployment in multi-domain networks.</p>
