abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP4 protocol is a well established single standard of an inter- domain
    routing and non-routing information distribution today. For many applications
    it is also the protocol of choice to disseminate various application based information
    intra-domain. It's popularity and it's wide use has been effectively provided
    by it's reliable transport, session protection as well as loop free build in mechanism.
    It has been observed in both intra-domain as well as inter-domain applications
    that reliable information distribution is an extremely desired tool for many services.
    Introduction of Multiprotocol Extensions to BGP even further attracted various
    sorts of new information to be carried over BGP4. The observation proves that
    amount and nature of information carried by BGP increases and diverges from the
    original goal of interconnection for IP Internet Autonomous Systems at a rather
    fast pace. This draft proposes BGP to divide information into two broad categories:
    Internet routing critical and non Internet routing critical that would also include
    information carried by BGP which is not related directly to routing. For the purpose
    of this document we will refer to the latter case as second BGP instance. This
    draft proposes that the current BGP infrastructure will continue to be used to
    disseminate Internet routing related information while non routing information
    or private routing data is recommended to be carried by independent transport
    instance BGP.</p>"
