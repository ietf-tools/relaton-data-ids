abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a possible solution enabling multicast routing
    in a home network. It relies on the Source-Specific Bidirectional variant of the
    Protocol Independent Multicast routing protocol (PIM-SSBIDIR). HNCP is used to
    elect the Rendezvous Point address and a Proxy Controller connected to the Rendezvous
    Point Link. Additionally, PIM-SSBIDIR routers behavior is slightly modified on
    the Rendezvous Point Link so that the Proxy Controller may know the home-wide
    subscription state. Note that this document defines one single working solution
    to the stated problem: Inputs regarding other possibilities are welcome.</p>"
