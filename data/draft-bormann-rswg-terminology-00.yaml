abstract:
- content: "<p>The canonical format for RFCs is called RFCXML, with the currently
    effective details originally documented in the RFC 799x series. This format has
    experienced some uncontrolled evolution since, partially caused by an unwillingness
    to recognize the need for overt, deliberate evolution. Controlled RFCXML evolution
    is going to be complex. Its discussion will need agreed terminology, without which
    it will devolve into a Tower of Babel.</p>"
