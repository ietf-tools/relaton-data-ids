abstract:
- content: "<p>The Unicode Standard and ISO/IEC 10646 jointly define a coded character
    set, referred to as Unicode, which encompasses most of the world's writing systems.
    Characters of the same language are arranged close to each other in the Unicode
    code table. This memo proposes a dynamic Unicode transformation format(DUTF).
    DUTF has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII range, and uses XOR
    to calculate the offset value between the Unicode code point of adjacent non-ASCII
    characters in the source string, then encodes the result as a variable-length
    sequence of octets.</p>"
