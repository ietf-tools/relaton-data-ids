abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft offers seven MODP ?Diffie-Hellman? groups which
    can be used in conjunction with other IETF standards to provide security for Internet
    communications. The groups are designed to allow implementers to use the same
    groups with different security protocols such as SMIME, SSH, TLS and IKE. The
    prime numbers which form part of the definition of these groups are designed to
    allow for fast, small signatures and be of the correct form for compliance with
    standards bodies such as ANSI, NIST and the IEEE. This draft includes groups with
    bit sizes of 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, and 8192. These may be used in addition
    to the groups already specified or in place of them. Since these groups are acceptable
    for all cryptographic applications involving the difficulty of discrete logarithms
    over GF(p) they are referred to as</p>"
