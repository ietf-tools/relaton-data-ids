abstract:
- content: "<p>The MIKEY specification [2] describes several modes of key distribution
    to setup SRTP [4] sessions, viz., pre-shared key, public-key, and an optional
    Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In the public-key mode the initiator encrypts a random
    key with the responder's public key and sends it to the responder. In many VoIP
    calling scenarios, the initiator may not know the responder's public key or in
    some cases the responder's ID (e.g., call forwarding) in advance. We propose a
    new MIKEY mode that works well in such scenarios.</p>"
