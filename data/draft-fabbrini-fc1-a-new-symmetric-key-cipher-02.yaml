abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we describe a symmetric key algorithm that offers an
    unprecedented grade of confidentiality. Based on the uniqueness of the modular
    multiplicative inverse of a positive integer a modulo n and on its computability
    in a polynomial time, this non-deterministic cipher can easily and quickly handle
    keys of millions or billions of bits that an attacker does not even know the length
    of. The algorithm's primary key is the modulo, while the ciphertext is given by
    the concatenation of the modular inverse of blocks of plaintext whose length is
    randomly chosen within a predetermined range. In addition to the full specification
    here defined, in a related work we present an implementation of it in Julia Programming
    Language, accompanied by real examples of encryption and decryption.</p>"
