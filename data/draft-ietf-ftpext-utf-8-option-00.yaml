abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol
    (FTP) which provides for inter-operation between existing implementations and
    those supporting the exchange of UTF-8 encoded pathnames, and clarifies certain
    issues involved with UTF-8 encoding. It introduces a new option, UTF-8, negotiated
    by use of the OPTS command. Through use of this option, the user informs the server
    of its willingness to accept UTF-8 encoded pathnames. The proposed extension requires
    that neither party transmit UTF-8 encoded pathnames without having first successfully
    negotiated this option.</p>"
