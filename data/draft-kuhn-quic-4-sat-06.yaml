abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC has been designed for use across Internet paths. Initial designs
    of QUIC focused on common deployment scenarios for web traffic. This document
    focuses on the performance when using a path with a large Bandwidth-Delay Product
    (BDP). A large BDP path can result from using a satellite communication (SATCOM)
    system. The BDP is also high for paths where a satellite network segment is combined
    with other network technologies (Ethernet, cable modems, WiFi, cellular, radio
    links, etc), resulting in more complex characteristics. These path characteristics
    have implications on the efficiency of the network traffic and unless considered
    in a design can impact the end-to-end quality of experience by the transport service.
    This memo identifies the characteristics of a SATCOM link that impact the operation
    of the QUIC transport protocol. It proposes regression tests to evaluate QUIC
    over SATCOM links. It discusses how to ensure acceptable protocol performance.</p>"
