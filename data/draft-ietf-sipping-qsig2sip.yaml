abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known
    as enterprise networks). SIP is an Internet application-layer control (signalling)
    protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.
    These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol
    for creating, modifying, and terminating circuit-switched calls (in particular,
    telephone calls) within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is
    specified in a number of Ecma Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
