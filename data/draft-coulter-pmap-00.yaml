abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a service that manages a type of disposable
    Internet mail address known as a proxy address. Proxy addresses conform to the
    standard addressing scheme [RFC 822] and exist in the same address space, but
    act as aliases for regular, fixed addresses. Users may own many at a time and
    allocate and deallocate them at will. The service also defines a distinct command-response
    interface for use between client and server implementations to conduct management
    chores.</p>"
