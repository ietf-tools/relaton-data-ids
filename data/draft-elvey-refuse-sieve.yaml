abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines the SIEVE mail filtering language [SIEVE] "refuse"
    extension. A Joe-job is a spam run forged to appear as though it came from an
    innocent party, who is then generally flooded by the bounces, MDNs and messages
    with complaints. With the Sieve "reject" action, MDNs contribute to the flood
    of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs; SMTP level refusals usually don't. With
    "refuse", Sieve gains the ability to simply not accept an email during the SMTP
    transaction (instead of accepting it and then sending an MDN [MDN] back to the
    alleged sender using "reject").</p>
