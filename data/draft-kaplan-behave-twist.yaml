abstract:
- content: "<p>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can
    be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) located
    behind other NATs. In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the
    services of an intermediate node on the Internet that acts as a communication
    relay. Likewise, if a host of one IP address family wants to communicate with
    the host of another address family, through one or more NATs, an intermediate
    node may be necessary. This specification defines a protocol, called TWIST (Traversal
    With Internet Server Transports), that allows the host to control the operation
    of a TWIST relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay, or directly
    between each other. This is similar to TURN, but defines an alternative mechanism
    which is more scalable, cheaper to deploy, and is thus more likely to succeed
    in achieving wide- spread use. TWIST is not meant to replace TURN, but rather
    to provide an alternative. This document is a straw-man proposal, to stimulate
    discussion, not a fully defined draft.</p>"
