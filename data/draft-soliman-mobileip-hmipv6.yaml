abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces some extensions for MIPv6 and neighbour discovery
    to allow for the introduction of a hierarchical MIPv6 mobility management model.
    The proposed hierarchical mobility management for MIPv6 will reduce the amount
    of signalling to CNs and the HA and may also improve the performance of MIPv6
    in terms of handoff speed. Moreover, HMIPv6 is well-suited to implement access
    control and handoffs between different access technologies.</p>"
