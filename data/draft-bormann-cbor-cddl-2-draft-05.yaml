abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) today is defined by RFC
    8610 and RFC 9165. The latter (as well as some more application specific specifications
    such as RFC 9090) have used the extension point provided in RFC 8610, the control
    operator. As CDDL is used in larger projects, feature requirements become known
    that cannot be easily mapped into this single extension point. Hence, there is
    a need for evolution of the base CDDL specification itself. The present document
    provides a roadmap towards a "CDDL 2.0". It is based on draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-freezer,
    but is more selective in what potential features it takes up and more detailed
    in their discussion. It is intended to serve as a basis for prototypical implementations
    of CDDL 2.0. This document is intended to evolve over time; it might spawn specific
    documents and then retire or eventually be published as a roadmap document.</p>
