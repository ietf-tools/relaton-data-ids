abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how Large Access Providers (LAP) could use
    IPv6 to solve current technical challenges. In particular, IPv6â€™s large address
    space and optional header mechanism can be used to provide scalable and manageable
    broadband Internet access and Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. A new optional
    header to support forwarding-plane based VPNs is proposed.</p>"
