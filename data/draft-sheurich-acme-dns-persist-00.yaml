abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies "dns-persist-01", a new validation method for
    the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. This method
    allows a Certification Authority (CA) to verify control over a domain by confirming
    the presence of a persistent DNS TXT record containing CA and account identification
    information. This method is particularly suited for environments where traditional
    challenge methods are impractical, such as IoT deployments, multi- tenant platforms,
    and scenarios requiring batch certificate operations. The validation method is
    designed with a strong focus on security and robustness, incorporating widely
    adopted industry best practices for persistent domain control validation. This
    design aims to make it suitable for Certification Authorities operating under
    various policy environments, including those that align with the CA/ Browser Forum
    Baseline Requirements.</p>
