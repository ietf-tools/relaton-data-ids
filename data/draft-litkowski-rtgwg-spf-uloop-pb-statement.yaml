abstract:
- content: "<p>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently
    among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm. In this
    document, we are trying to analyze the impact of using different Link State IGP
    implementations in a single network in regards of microloops. The analysis is
    focused on the SPF triggers and SPF delay algorithm.</p>"
