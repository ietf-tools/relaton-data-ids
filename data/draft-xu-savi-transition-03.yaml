abstract:
- content: "<p>IP spoofing always is bothering us along with the Internet invention.
    With the rapid development of IPv6 next generation Internet, this issue is more
    prominent. Though many studies have made their contributions to the prevention
    of IP-spoofing, the most excellent one is the SAVI (Source Address Validation
    Improvement) proposal advocated by IETF, since it can prevent IP-spoofing from
    happening by automatically binding the key properties of hosts in layer2 access
    subnet. Nevertheless, till now, SAVI only focuses on the IPv6 stack and simple
    network access scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, there is no solution even
    has paid attention to IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. Given the fact that IPv4/IPv6
    transition will continue to be adopted for a long period of time, this issue is
    becoming increasingly urgent. However, since transition schemes are plenty and
    diverse, hardly can an ordinary solution satisfy all the requirements of various
    transition scenarios. In this document, we present an improved general SAVI-based
    framework of IP source address validation and traceback for IPv4/IPv6 transition
    scenarios. To achieve this goal, we extract essential and mutual properties from
    these transition schemes, and create sub-solutions for each property. Naturally,
    if one transition scheme is proposed by combining some properties, the corresponding
    sub-solutions would be included into its IP source address validation and traceback
    solution. Therefore, the advantage of this framework is its capability to adapt
    to all the transition schemes.</p>"
