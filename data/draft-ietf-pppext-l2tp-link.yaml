abstract:
- content: "<p>The physical separation of the LAC and LNS with L2TP[2] and logical
    separation of the responsibilities of each with respect to negotiated link parameters
    introduces a lack of awareness between the tunnel endpoints that does not exist
    in a typical PPP dialup device. When possible, Proxy LCP provides a manner in
    which to negotiate link parameters at the LAC and communication of these in full
    to the LNS. If these options can be made acceptable to the LNS, then there should
    not be any insurmountable difficulty with regard to mismatch of link expectations.
    However, given that there are instances where negotiation of LCP[1] must take
    place at the LNS, some direction by the LAC as to what parameters are acceptable,
    as well as some communication from the LNS as to what parameters have been negotiated,
    is desirable.</p>"
