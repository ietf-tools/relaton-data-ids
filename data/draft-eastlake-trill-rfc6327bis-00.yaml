abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches including point-to-point
    links and multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can have multiple TRILL
    switches and end stations attached. TRILL uses IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System) routing. This document specifies the establishment, reporting, and termination
    of IS-IS adjacency between TRILL switches, also known as RBridges. It also concerns
    four other link-local aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU
    (Maximum Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bi- Directional
    Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection with adjacency. State
    diagrams are included where appropriate. This document obsoletes RFC 6327 and
    updates RFC 6325.</p>"
