abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes an AAA architecture that would incorporate a generic
    AAA server along with an application interface to a set of Application Specific
    Modules that could perform application specific AAA functions. A separation of
    AAA functions required in a multi- domain environment is then proposed using a
    layered protocol abstraction. The long term goal is to create a generic framework
    which allows complex authorizations to be realized through a network of interconnected
    AAA servers.</p>"
