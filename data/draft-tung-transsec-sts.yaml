abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Simple Transaction Security (STS), a protocol
    for specifying services and protocols used to secure an enclosed message. The
    framework is flexible enough to allow a wide variety of protocols to be used,
    at the cost of some negotiation and the optimizations present in protocols such
    as S-HTTP.</p>"
