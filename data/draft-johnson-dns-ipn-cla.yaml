abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are typically characterized by high
    latency and lack of constant end to end connectivity, consistent with their use
    in deep space communications. This, however, is not the limit of application of
    Bundle Protocol (BP) and related DTN enabling technologies. Through a collection
    of Convergance Layer Adapters (CLAs), deployment overlaying the terrestrial Internet
    is a core component of DTN implementations. IPN is a integer based naming scheme
    for DTN networks. Nothwithstanding cryptographic considerations, three basic components
    are necessary to make a BP overlay network connection, the IP address of the node,
    the CBHE Node Number (IPN component), and the CLA which providing IP connectivity.
    This document describes additions to DNS to enable terrestrial BP resource look
    up.</p>"
