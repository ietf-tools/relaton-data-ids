abstract:
- content: "<p>Many systems (e.g., cryptographic protocols relying on symmetric cryptography)
    require that plaintext passwords be stored. Given how often people reuse passwords
    on different systems, this poses a very serious risk if a single machine is compromised.
    We propose a scheme to derive passwords limited to a single machine from a typed
    password, and explain how a protocol definition can specify this scheme.</p>"
