abstract:
- content: "<p>It is evident that to ensure seamless and robust user experience across
    all type of access networks multimedia communication suits should adapt to the
    changing network conditions. There is an ongoing effort in IETF RMCAT working
    group to standardize rate adaptive algorithm(s) to be used in the real-time interactive
    communication. In this document test cases are described to evaluate the performances
    of the proposed endpoint adaptation solutions in LTE networks and Wi-Fi networks.
    It is aimed that the proposed solutions should be evaluated using the test cases
    defined in this document to select most optimal solutions.</p>"
