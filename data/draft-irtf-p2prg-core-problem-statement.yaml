abstract:
- content: "<p>New research in the design of peer-to-peer overlay networks offers
    the possibility of addressing limitations of existing service, resource and content
    discovery methods. We identify the research goals to be pursued in investigating
    new designs for global scale service discovery. The purpose of this document is
    to attract participation from other researchers interested in these problems and
    to lead to a coordinated research approach within the P2PRG CORE subgroup.</p>"
