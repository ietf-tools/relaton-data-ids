abstract:
- content: "<p>The home agent can be a single point of failure when Mobile IPv6 and
    its associated supporting protocols are operated in a system. It is critical to
    provide home agent reliability in the event of a home agent crashing or becoming
    unavailable. This would allow another home agent to take over and continue providing
    service to the mobile nodes. This document describes the problem scope briefly,
    and provides mechanisms of home agent failure detection, home agent state transfer,
    and home agent switching for home agent redundancy and reliability.</p>"
