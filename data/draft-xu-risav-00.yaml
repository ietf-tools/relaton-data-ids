abstract:
- content: "<p>Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination
    address, packet forwarding typically takes no place with inspection of the source
    address. Therefore, malicious attacks or behaviors have been launched with spoofed
    source addresses. This document defines using RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure)
    and IPsec (IP Security) to reinforce the security of source addresses in the inter-
    domain layer.</p>"
