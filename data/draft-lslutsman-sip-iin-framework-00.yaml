abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for an Internet Intelligent Network
    (IIN) architecture which accommodates a service logic execution environment on
    a session initiation protocol (SIP) proxy, but at the same time is able to support
    the traditional PSTN IN-based architecture which uses a service control point
    (SCP) as a service execution environment. A large number of services, including
    traditional advanced 800 and other legacy services, as well as IN specific services
    (Internet Call Waiting (ICW) for ex ample) must be made available for the Internet.
    Implementation of such services requires a software support architecture that
    which addresses the following issues: 1)where and how to create the service logic;
    2)what kind of software instrumentation should be used to write the service logic
    (e.g., CPL scripts, Parlay Group API's, or JAIN SIP API); and 3)where to run and
    how to trigger the service logic. Traditional PSTN architectures address these
    issues under the umbrella of IN. The traditional IN approach is subject to the
    parameters of the PSTN architectural and traditional legacy services constraints.
    Though it would be preferable to avoid being locked into these constraints, it
    is not possible to bypass them completely (this is especially true in instances
    when PSTN and IN networks are inter-working). Hence the draft proposes to support
    both a) 'IP-network-based IN' (e.g., use of script-based-methods such as CPL or
    CGI), and b) integration of traditional IN-based service logic (e.g., SCP-based)
    and SIP call control protocols.</p>"
