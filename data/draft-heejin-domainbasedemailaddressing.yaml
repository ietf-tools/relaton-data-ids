- content: "<p>This document proposes a new email addressing specification that allows
    email messages to be sent to all email addresses associated with a domain. The
    new format can simplify the email addressing process and reduce the risk of errors,
    while maintaining compatibility with existing email protocols and standards. This
    specification includes requirements, design, and security considerations for the
    new email addressing format.</p>"
