abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview and specification of Version 5 of
    the Kerberos protocol, and updates RFC1510 to clarify aspects of the protocol
    and its intended use that require more detailed or clearer explanation than was
    provided in RFC1510. This document is intended to provide a detailed description
    of the protocol, suitable for implementation, together with descriptions of the
    appropriate use of protocol messages and fields within those messages. This document
    is not intended to describe Kerberos to the end user, system administrator, or
    application developer. Higher level papers describing Version 5 of the Kerberos
    system [NT94] and documenting version 4 [SNS88], are available elsewhere.</p>"
