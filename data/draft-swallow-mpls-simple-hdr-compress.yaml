abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS allows packets to be forwarded based on a label lookup without
    inspection of the IP header at intermediate routers. This enables headers to be
    compressed in some applications. Label Switched Paths may be established through
    the use of RSVP. This draft describes a simple technique for header compression.
    It then proposes RSVP procedures for signaling header compression.</p>"
