abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS)
    Database using the Domain Name System (DNS) as a distributed database of Rules.
    The Keys are domain-names and the Rules are encoded using the Naming Authority
    Pointer (NAPTR) Resource Record (RR). Since this document obsoletes RFC 2915,
    it is the official specification for the NAPTR DNS Resource Record. It is also
    part of a series that is completely specified in "Dynamic Delegation Discovery
    System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS" (RFC 3401). It is very important
    to note that it is impossible to read and understand any document in this series
    without reading the others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
