abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication for CoAP can be secured using Group Object Security
    for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE). A Group Manager is responsible
    to handle the joining of new group members, as well as to manage and distribute
    the group keying material. The Group Manager can provide a RESTful admin interface
    that allows an Administrator entity to create and delete OSCORE groups, as well
    as to retrieve and update their configuration. This document specifies how an
    Administrator interacts with the admin interface at the Group Manager by using
    the Constrained RESTful Application Language (CoRAL). The ACE framework for Authentication
    and Authorization is used to enforce authentication and authorization of the Administrator
    at the Group Manager. Protocol-specific transport profiles of ACE are used to
    achieve communication security, proof-of-possession, and server authentication.</p>"
