abstract:
- content: "<p>There are quite a few potential problems regarding firewalling or packet
    filtering in IPv6 environment. These include slight ambiguity in the IPv6 specification,
    problems parsing packets beyond unknown Extension Headers and Destination Options,
    and introduction of end- to-end encrypted traffic and peer-to-peer applications.
    There may also be need to extend packet matching to include some Extension Header
    or Destination Option fields. This draft discusses these issues to raise awareness
    and proposes some tentative solutions or workarounds.</p>"
