abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a problem statement on collaborative mitigation
    of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The evolving trends of DDoS attacks,
    including their types, intensities, and attack methods, pose formidable challenges
    to existing defense systems. This problem statement examines the current defense
    landscape, highlighting the distributed deployment of defense systems across various
    network positions and the imbalances in defense capabilities. Collaboration is
    crucial for effective DDoS attack mitigation, considering that a considerable
    number of attacks are spread across operators. The existing collaborative framework,
    DOTS, shows promise but requires addressing these challenges to enhance its efficacy.
    The existing collaborative framework DOTS demonstrates potential, but there are
    still numerous challenges in its practical application. This document aims to
    address these key issues that impact the implementation of collaborative technologies.</p>"
