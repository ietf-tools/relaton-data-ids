abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents for a new IPv6 site multihoming scheme and its
    operational requirements. It aims at solving potential deployment problems in
    'IPv6 Multihoming Support at Site Exit Routers [2]' using an application of BGP
    extended community attribute, called multihomed community. In case of link failure
    in [2], basic operations to support multihoming are entirely dependent on functionality
    of border router in other ISPs. Hence, it causes following problems; centralized
    encapsulation overhead for re-routing, packet delivery along un-optimized tunneling
    session, and losing connectivity in case of ISP failure. Also, [2] do not provide
    any alternative mechanism for long-term failure. For above reasons, if the link
    remains failed for a long time, it has a little applicability due to previously
    mentioned problems. In this memo, we propose a new IPv6 site multihoming scheme,
    which establishes multiple direct tunneling sessions between sender's site exit
    router and reachable receiver's site exit router instead of one tunneling session
    between border router and site exit router in [2]. Furthermore, with some additional
    BGP operations, it can preserve connectivity of on-going sessions regardless of
    ISP, intermediate link, as well as directly connected site link failure.</p>"
