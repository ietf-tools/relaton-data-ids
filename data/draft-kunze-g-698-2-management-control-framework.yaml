abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework that describes a solution space
    for the control and management of optical interfaces parameters according to the
    Black Link approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU G.698.2]. In particular, it examines
    topological elements and related network management processes to operate this
    construct. This framework is scoped to address the Optical Channel (OCh)-layer
    covered by G.698.2. The focus is on enabling the wavelength provisioning process
    in a black link approach irrespective on how it is triggered i.e. by EMS, NMS
    or GMPLS. This document covers management as well as control plane considerations
    in different management cases of a single channel DWDM interface as defined by
    ITU-G.698.2. The purpose is to identify the necessary information elements and
    processes to be used by control or management devices for further processing.
    Hence wavelength routing and selection processes as defined e.g. in WSON are beyond
    the scope of this document.</p>"
