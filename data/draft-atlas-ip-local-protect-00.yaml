abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architecture and selection process for providing
    local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in the event of a single link
    or node failure until the router has converged. When computing the primary next-hop
    for a prefix, a router S also determines an alternate next-hop which can be used
    if the primary next-hop fails. The alternate can be either a loop-free alternate,
    which goes to a neighbor whose shortest path to the prefix does not go back through
    the router S, or a U-turn alternate, which goes to a neighbor whose primary next-hop
    to the prefix is the router S, and which has itself a loop-free node-protecting
    alternate, which thus does not go through router S to reach the destination prefix.</p>"
