abstract:
- content: "<p>The document defines how Geographically-Focused IETF Activities are
    organized and how IETF policies apply. It is intended for eventual publication
    as a BCP but this is currently an initial strawman proposal based upon the existing
    variety of experience with the experimental activities in this space over the
    past several years.</p>"
