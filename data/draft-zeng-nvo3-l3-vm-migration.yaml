abstract:
- content: "<p>This document utilizes software-defined network (SDN) to propose a
    cross-site live VM migration scheme in layer 3 environment. The architecture and
    main components are described in detail. The components include central controller,
    local controller, gateway and virtual switch, which are in charge of cross-site
    communication management, in-site network configuration, inter-site connection
    and VM address resolution respectively. This scheme can implement layer 3 cross-site
    VM migration without using complex mechanism.</p>"
