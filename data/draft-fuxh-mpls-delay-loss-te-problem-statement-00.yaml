abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment and usage of cloud based applications and services that
    use an underlying MPLS network are expanding and an increasing number of applications
    are extremely sensitive to delay and packet loss. Furthermore, in cloud computing
    an additional decision problem arises of simultaneously choosing the data center
    to host applications along with MPLS network connectivity such that the overall
    performance of the application is met. Existing mechanisms exist to measure and
    monitor MPLS path performance parameters for packet loss and delay, but only after
    the path has been setup. These cloud-based and performance sensitive applications
    would benefit from measurement of MPLS network and potential path information
    that would be provided for use in the computation and selection of LSPs. This
    document provides a statement of problems faced by these cloud based and performance
    sensitive applications and describes requirements to enable the efficient and
    accurate measurement of the MPLS network and allow new performance parameters
    to be reported and used in the computation of MPLS services in support of these
    cloud based and performance sensitive applications.</p>"
