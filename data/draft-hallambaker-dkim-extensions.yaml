abstract:
- content: "<p>Optional extensions for DKIM are described. A DKIM Policy statement
    is defined for the policy 'this zone never sends mail'. The NULL Key Algorithm
    is defined to simplify management of large zones where most mail is signed but
    with important exceptions. The X509 key record extension allows the location from
    which an X.509v3 certificate for the key specified in the record may be obtained.</p>"
