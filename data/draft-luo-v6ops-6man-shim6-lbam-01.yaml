abstract:
- content: "<p>Load balancing is a key factor for both IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechnisms,
    e.g.NAT-PT or Tunnel broker, and Multihoming to improve their scalability and
    Robustness. In fact, that is a method, by which IP packet can be distributed across
    a pool of servers, instead of directing to a single server.Load balancing has
    been widely used by NAT, Web service and FTP service. However, current load balancing
    software and implementations have problems such as poor scalability, inability
    to balance session flow, long latency time and topological constraint on server
    pool. This document describes a method using pseudo-anycast and pseudo- mobility
    based on Mobile IPv6 to implement load balancing in session level in IPv6 network,
    by which those problems above can be solved. Futhermore, this method only need
    little modification to Mobile IPv6 in the servers' and agent's side; as for the
    general users, it need not any modification.</p>"
