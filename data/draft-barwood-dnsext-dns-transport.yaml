abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new transport protocol for DNS. IP fragmentation
    is avoided, blind spoofing, amplification attacks and other denial of service
    attacks are prevented. Latency for a typical DNS query is a single round trip,
    after a setup handshake. No per-client server state is required between transactions.
    Packets may optionally be encrypted and authenticated. The protocol may have other
    applications.</p>"
