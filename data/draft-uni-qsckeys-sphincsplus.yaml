abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe
    Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm SPHINCS+ (or SPHINCS-PLUS) which has been selected
    for standardization by the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process. This
    includes key identification and key serialization. The purpose is to provide guidance
    such that the adoption of quantum safe algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented
    evolution of necessary key management standards. Early definition of key material
    standards will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms at the
    same time as improving interoperability between implementations and minimizing
    divergence across standards.</p>"
