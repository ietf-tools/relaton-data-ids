abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN supports intra and inter-subnet IP multicast forwarding. However,
    EVPN (or conventional IP multicast techniques for that matter) do not have a solution
    for the case where: a) a given multicast group carries more than one flow (i.e.,
    more than one source), and b) it is desired that each receiver gets only one of
    the several flows. Existing multicast techniques assume there are no redundant
    sources sending the same flow to the same IP multicast group, and, in case there
    were redundant sources, the receiver's application would deal with the received
    duplicated packets. This document extends the existing EVPN specifications and
    assumes that IP Multicast source redundancy may exist. It also assumes that, in
    case two or more sources send the same IP Multicast flows into the tenant domain,
    the EVPN PEs need to avoid that the receivers get packet duplication by following
    the described procedures.</p>"
