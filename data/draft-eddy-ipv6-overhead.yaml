abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an analysis and comparison of IPv4 and IPv6
    header sizes under various circumstances. The goal of this document is to provide
    hard evidence for use in frequent discussions regarding transition, where header
    overhead comes up as an issue used to portray IPv6 depolyment as untenable. The
    results show that for links that are not fully utilized, the IPv6 overhead would
    only add a few percent to their load over what IPv4 implies, while for congested
    links, we note that header compression techniques for IPv6 are at least as effective
    as those for IPv4. This demonstrates that the header overhead argument against
    IPv6 is misinformed.</p>"
