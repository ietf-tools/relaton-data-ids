abstract:
- content: "<p>Twamp can be used to measure the performance of end-to-end paths in
    networks. Stamp [rfc8762] and twamp light are more lightweight measurement methods.
    In the SRv6 network, it is also necessary to measure the performance of SRv6 policy.
    This document describes a method to measure srv6 policy through stamp and twamp
    light.</p>"
