abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an experimental protocol for opportunistic TLS
    security based on the DANE TLSA PKI. The design goal is an incremental transition
    of the Internet email backbone (MTA to MTA SMTP traffic) from today's unauthenticated
    and typically unencrypted connections to TLS encrypted and authenticated delivery
    when the client is DANE TLSA aware and the server domain publishes DANE TLSA records
    for its MX hosts. This protocol has been implemented by author in the Postfix
    MTA. It is hoped that other MTA implementations will find this protocol well suited
    to their needs and will adopt interoperable implementations. This protocol may
    be suited to other use-cases for opportunistic TLS beyond SMTP, but such use-cases
    are not covered here, and will need to be defined in separate specifications.</p>"
