abstract:
- content: "<p>As a mobile node moves in a network, existing mobility mechanisms may
    not be sufficient to achieve performance as expected by the user. Seamless mobility
    can be said to be achieved when a mobile node suffers little to no disruption
    of service. This document presents an overview of requirements and functions needed
    for Seamless Mobility and their impact.</p>"
