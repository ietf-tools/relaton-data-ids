abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new architecture on the client-side for authentication
    by EAP. This architecture complements the usual setup considered in EAP by making
    it become symmetric: the client-side is divided in two parts, the Authentication
    Token and the client, which are analogous respectively to the Authentication Server
    and the Authenticator on the server-side. Moreover, this document describes a
    framework for the use of Authentication Tokens with the EAP protocol.</p>"
