abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, low-latency transport protocols like RDMA over Converged Ethernet
    (RoCE) can provide good delay and throughput performance in small and lightly
    loaded high-speed datacenter networks due to lossless transport based on priority-based
    flow control (PFC). However, PFC suffers from various issues from performance
    degradation and unreliability (e.g., deadlock), limiting the deployment of RoCE
    to only small scale clusters (~1000). This document presents LDCP, a new transport
    that scales loss- sensitive transports, e.g., RDMA, to entire data-centers containing
    tens of thousands machines, without dependency on PFC for losslessness, i.e.,
    PFC-free. LDCP develops a novel end-to-end congestion control scheme and achieves
    very low queue occupancy even under high network utilization or large traffic
    churns, resulting in almost no packet loss. Meanwhile, LDCP allows a new flow
    to jump start at full speed at the very beginning and therefore minimizes the
    latency for short RPC-style transactions. LDCP relies on only WRED and ECN, two
    widely supported features on switches, so it can be easily deployed in existing
    network infrastructures. Finally, LDCP is simple by design and thus can be easily
    implemented by programmable or ASIC NICs.</p>"
