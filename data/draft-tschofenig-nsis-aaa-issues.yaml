abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the implications of authentication, authorization
    and accounting for an NSIS QoS signaling protocol. We try to show that authorization
    and charging are very important for the internal machinery of a signaling protocol
    and for the security and trust model behind it. This document only addresses charging
    aspects for unicast data traffic.</p>"
