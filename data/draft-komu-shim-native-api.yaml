abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes extensions to the current networking APIs for
    protocols based on identifier/locator split. Currently, the document focuses on
    HIP, but the extensions can be used also by other protocols similar "shim" layer
    protocols. Using the API extensions, new SHIM aware applications can gain a better
    control of the SHIM layer and endpoint identifiers. For example, the applications
    can query and set SHIM related attributes, or specify their own endpoint identifiers
    for a host. In addition, a new indirection element called endpoint descriptor
    is defined for SHIM aware applications.</p>
