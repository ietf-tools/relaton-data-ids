abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents the various methods known to be in use by peer-to-peer
    (P2P) applications for communication in the presence of Network Address Translators
    (NATs) at the current time. This memo covers NAT traversal approaches used by
    both TCP and UDP based applications. This memo is not an endorsement of the methods
    described, but merely an attempt to capture them in a document.</p>"
