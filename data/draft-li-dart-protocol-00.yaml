abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes a new addressing and routing protocol named
    Domain-Aware Routing Technology (DART). Built upon the existing IP network architecture,
    DART introduces a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)-centric addressing model
    to address the global exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and significantly enhance the
    scalability and evolvability of the Internet. DART supports a name-based communication
    model and can be encapsulated over either IPv4 or IPv6 networks. This enables
    high compatibility with existing infrastructures and supports deployment and interoperability
    across heterogeneous protocol environments. Its addressing logic and architectural
    design exhibit the following characteristics: * In terms of scalability DART localizes
    the IPv4 address space to individual Domain Names (DNS) domains, granting each
    domain an independent full address pool. This enables unlimited address reuse,
    greatly reduces global routing table growth, and promotes a more structured and
    aggregatable forwarding hierarchy. * In terms of evolvability DART shifts the
    addressing paradigm from "IP-based location" to "name-based location", laying
    the foundation for a unified, name- driven networking model. It holds potential
    to redefine the semantics of network addressing and routing architecture. DART
    is designed for incremental deployment. Network operators can derive a subdomain
    within the DNS system to serve as a DART domain, immediately gaining access to
    a dedicated 2^32-sized address space. Each DART domain may further delegate subdomains,
    forming a theoretically infinite, hierarchical, and scalable global addressing
    system. Deployment requires only the installation of DART-capable gateways at
    the boundaries between DART domains and traditional networks, or between different
    DART domains, to enable protocol interoperability and cross-domain forwarding.
    Internal network devices and endpoints within DART domains may continue operating
    under the existing IP stack without immediate modification. In particular, legacy
    IPv4-only devices located behind an edge DART gateway can seamlessly connect to
    the DART network via the *NAT-DART-4* mechanism. New devices may progressively
    evolve toward native DART support, enabling direct, end-to-end, name-based communication.
    A working prototype of the DART protocol has been independently developed and
    deployed by the author. It is publicly accessible at http://dart-proto.cn</p>'
