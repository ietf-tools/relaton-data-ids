abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this Internet Draft is to define standard compliant procedures
    for configuring layer-2 security services in IEEE 802.15.4e-based Low-power and
    Lossy Networks. In particular, it provides a review of security aspects presented
    in both IEEE 802.15.4-2011 and IEEE 802.15.4e-2012 specifications, the classification
    of secure network configurations and layer-2 keys, the description of a set of
    consecutive steps required to establish a layer-2 secure link, and a lightweight
    Key Management Protocol designed for negotiating a layer-2 one-hop link key. As
    the final goal, the document would describe how security MAC attributes can by
    initialized and updated in order to offer layer-2 security services in real networks.</p>"
