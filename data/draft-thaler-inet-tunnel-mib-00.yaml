abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
    network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes
    managed objects used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
    Extension MIBs may be designed for managing protocol-specific objects. Likewise,
    extension MIBs may be designed for managing security-specific objects. This MIB
    does not support tunnels over non-IP networks. Management of such tunnels may
    be supported by other MIBs.</p>"
