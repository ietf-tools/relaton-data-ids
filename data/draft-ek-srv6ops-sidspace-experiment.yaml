abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification proposes an experimental structure for use of the
    SRv6 SIDs prefix in support of Inter-Domain SRv6 networks. The core of the proposal
    is to structure the address space by Autonomous System Number (ASN). Use of this
    proposed structure is entirely voluntary. The goal of this experiment is to aid
    SRv6 operations while preserving the ability to use this prefix across cooperating
    SRv6 domains, but not across the general Internet.</p>"
