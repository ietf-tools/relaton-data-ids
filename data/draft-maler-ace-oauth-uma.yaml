abstract:
- content: <p>Authentication and authorization are fundamental security features used
    in Internet and Web applications. Providing the same level of security functionality
    to the Internet of Things (IoT) environment as well is a logical enhancement and
    reduces the risk of unauthorized access to personal data. IoT devices, however,
    have limitations in terms of processing power, memory, user interface, Internet
    connectivity, etc. Since many use cases span Web and IoT environments and the
    question of "Web" vs. "IoT" can in some cases be considered a continuum, it is
    required to find security solutions that can accommodate the capabilities and
    constraints of both environments without significant compromises. Thus, an approach
    of adapting already standardized and deployed authentication and authorization
    technologies is worth examining. This document describes how the Web Authorization
    Protocol (OAuth) in combination with User-Managed Access (UMA) can be used for
    an IoT environment to bring Web-scale authorization services to the IoT world.</p>
