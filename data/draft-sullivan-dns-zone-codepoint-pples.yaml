abstract:
- content: <p>Traditionally, the management of the DNS root zone permitted only "alphabetic"
    labels. As long as the root zone included only ASCII characters, and as long as
    there was only one form of a label, the restriction plainly meant that only the
    letters A-Z and a-z were permitted. The advent of internationalized labels using
    IDNA2008 presents some complications for the restriction. One of the complications
    is the meaning of the term "alphabetic" when applied to the Unicode code points
    in U-labels. This memo presents a set of principles that can be used to determine
    whether a Unicode code point may be wisely included in the repertoire of permissible
    code points in a U-label in a zone.</p>
