abstract:
- content: "<p>Operational procedures and protocols of today's communication networks
    typically use explicitly defined mechanisms and representations to reach the goals
    associated to their design. This practice results into numerous protocols having
    a restricted space for (self-)adaptability, flexibility, and sensitivity respective
    to their network context (e.g. network traffic conditions, failure conditions,
    etc). On the other hand, a wide spectrum of learning and optimization techniques
    is available such that networks could learn and optimize their behavior in the
    running context. This document describes the opportunities and challenges for
    a Learning Capable Communication Network (LCCN).</p>"
