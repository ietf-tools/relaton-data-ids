abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of the Domain Name System(DNS) for
    storage of Chinese Common Name to URI mapping. More specifically, how DNS can
    be used for identifying URIs or services associated with the Chinese Common Names.
    The method used to discover the mapping is the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System,
    which can be found in a series of documents specified in RFC 3401. Understanding
    of RFC 3401 is necessary for understanding this document.</p>"
