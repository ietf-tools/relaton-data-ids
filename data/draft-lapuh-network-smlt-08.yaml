abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes Split Multi-link Trunking (SMLT) for bridged
    and routed networks. SMLT enables topologies with upstream node redundancy for
    increased reliability of Layer 2 link aggregationsubnetworks based on [IEEE 802.3ad]
    and router redundancy based on VRRP [RFC3768]. SMLT is an improvement over Multi-Link
    Trunking (MLT), a method of link aggregation that allows multiple Ethernet links
    to be aggregated together, and handled as a single logical trunk. MLT can be realized
    via many different link aggregation mechanisms. Several methods of MLT are in
    use today; one example is [IEEE 802.3ad]. SMLT is MLT with links of a link-aggregation
    group connected to ports on two different devices (e.g. SMLT client and aggregation
    device). Unlike MLT, at least one end of a link-aggregated group is dual-homed
    to two different SMLT aggregation devices. In many cases those devices act as
    bridges (switches) as well as L3 routers (Routing Switches). These two redundant
    SMLT aggregation devices can share one or more VRRP routing instances; for that
    SMLT-VRRP extends the VRRP functionality to an active-active router concept, where
    both SMLT aggregation device route traffic for a common VRRP-ID, thus load balancing
    traffic not only for L2 but also for L3. Conventions used in this document The
    key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119.</p>
