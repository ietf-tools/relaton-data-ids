abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS protocol specifications provide a large number of options,
    and it can be difficult to know exactly which protocol messages, objects, and
    procedures must be supported in order to provide some particular application of
    MPLS, or in order to interoperate with some other implementation. This document
    specifies a number of MPLS 'Profiles'. Each Profile is a subset of the full MPLS
    functionality, specified in enough detail to ensure that two implementations of
    a given Profile will interoperate. This document also specifies which Profiles
    may be used for which purposes. In the future, it is hoped that specifications
    for the applications of MPLS will specify the Profiles that must be implemented
    in order to support the application.</p>"
