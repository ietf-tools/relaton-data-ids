abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource-constrained nodes come in various sizes and shapes and often
    have constraints on code size, state memory, processing capabilities, user interface,
    power and communication bandwidth (RFC 7228). This document specifies a profile
    that describes how two autonomous resource-constrained devices, a client and a
    server, obtain the required keying material and authorization information to securely
    communicate with each other. Each of the devices is coupled with a less-constrained
    device, the authorization manager, that helps with difficult authentication and
    authorization tasks. The constrained devices do not need to register with authorization
    managers from other security domains. The profile specifically targets constrained
    clients and servers. It is designed to consider the security objectives of the
    owners on the server and the client side.</p>"
