abstract:
- content: "<p>The Content Network Advertisement Protocol (CNAP) is a protocol Intended
    to facilitate the interconnection of Content Networks (CN). CNAP is a simple CN-to-CN
    information exchange protocol that advertises both content and area advertisements.
    These two types of advertisements are described in [3,6] and are intended to be
    used by content network request routing systems [9]. The exchange of these advertisements
    between CNs is intended to facilitate inter-CN request-routing decisions.</p>"
