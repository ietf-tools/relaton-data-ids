- content: "<p>This document describes additions to Address Resolution Protocol that
    will allow a host to authentically resolve the hardware address from the protocol
    address of given host. Using authentication data based on X.509 digital signatures
    to evaluate the authenticity of ARP packets, hosts can prevent ARP spoofing efficiently.</p>"
