abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a mechanism for fault management during a MPTCP
    session. It is used to convey subflow failure information from client to server
    by other subflow running normally. It includes: 1) a new Fault Announce Option
    for describing subflow failure, 2) implementation and interoperability of this
    option during a MPTCP session when one subflow suffers a failure. In fact, the
    server is able to determine network problems accurately based on these fault information
    reported from multiple clients for their connections.</p>"
