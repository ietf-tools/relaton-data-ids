abstract:
- content: "<p>In the IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) architecture, a Verifier
    accepts Evidence and generates Attestation Results needed by Relying Parties.
    This document provides a solution to inconsistent behaviors of the Verifier in
    the RATS architecture by introducing a mechanism to aggregate Attestation Results
    collected from multiple Verifiers at the Relying Party while simplifying its policy
    and operation.</p>"
