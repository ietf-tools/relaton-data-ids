abstract:
- content: "<p>The speed extension to the Mobile Internet Protocol provides a way
    for the Foreign Agents and Home Agents to perceive the moving speed of the Mobile
    Nodes. With the speed information popularized in the mobile IP network, the behavior
    of the Mobile IP implementation with speed adaptive algorithm implemented will
    automatically adapt to the speed of the Mobile Node so that the performance of
    the Mobile IP wonâ€™t decline dramatically in a rapid moving environment. At the
    same time, the Mobile IP speed adaptive algorithm only requires reasonable resources
    that are enough for seamless handoff.</p>"
