abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several different single sign-on (SSO) solutions offered
    by various software vendors today. All such solutions require applications to
    be written to a vendor specific API. In view of a lack of industry wide standard
    for SSO APIs, application developers find it almost impossible to SSO enable their
    applications to work with any vendor solution. This document presents alternative
    SSO implementation architecture that allows applications to be transparently enabled
    for SSO. Further, it allows different SSO solutions to interoperate with relatively
    little effort.</p>"
