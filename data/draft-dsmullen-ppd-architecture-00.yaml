abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a framework that empowers users to define and
    enforce privacy policies within their home networks through a Privacy Preference
    Declaration (PPD) protocol. As connected devices proliferate, this approach enhances
    user control by enabling user- defined privacy settings for different data types,
    automatic policy discovery by new devices, and accountability measures such as
    notifications, network restrictions, or perhaps reporting non- compliance with
    users' defined preferences to designated authorities. The framework aims to cultivate
    a privacy-conscious home network environment through clear, enforceable privacy
    governance.</p>"
