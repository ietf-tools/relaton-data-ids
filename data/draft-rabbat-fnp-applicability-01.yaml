abstract:
- content: "<p>The Fault Notification Protocol (FNP) is a set of procedures designed
    to enable time-bounded failure notification in networks using an IP- based control
    plane. This document discusses the applicability of FNP in the context of optical
    transport networks. It highlights the protocol?s principles of operation, and
    then describes the network, node, fault, and operational models in optical networks
    for which the protocol is designed. It also discusses the relationship to higher
    layers, and issues of scalability. Some guidelines for deployment are also provided.</p>"
