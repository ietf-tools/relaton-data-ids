abstract:
- content: "<p>In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-ps, the problems with using global IP
    mobility management protocols for local mobility and some problems with existing
    localized mobility management protocols are described. In this document, we explore
    requirements for localized mobility management in more detail. An extensive gap
    analysis against the protocols illustrates where existing protocols are able to
    fulfill the requirements and where they are lacking.</p>"
