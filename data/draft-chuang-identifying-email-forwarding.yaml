abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarded email often becomes unauthenticated because it breaks SPF
    (RFC7208) authentication and DKIM (RFC6376) authentication. For example mailing-lists
    distribute email to multiple recipients through a separate server than the original
    sending server that breaks IP based SPF authentication and potentially may modify
    the message that breaks the DKIM signature. This document calls for using ARC
    (RFC8617) to identify and authenticate forwarded emails by further specifying
    the naming of the two digital signatures present in ARC headers- the message signature
    and the seal. Because this uses ARC digital signature, the receiver has confidence
    that a valid signature corresponding to some forwarder only could have been generated
    by the named domain. This document also specifies that all forwarded mail flows
    have associated ARC headers and the means to characterize the mail flows.</p>"
