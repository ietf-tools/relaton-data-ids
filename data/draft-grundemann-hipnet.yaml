abstract:
- content: "<p>Home networks are becoming more complex. With the launch of new services
    such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many Service Providers are
    placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the subscriber network. This document
    describes a self-configuring home router that is capable of operating in such
    an environment, and that requires no user interaction to configure it. Compliant
    with draft- ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols in new ways without
    the need for a routing protocol.</p>"
