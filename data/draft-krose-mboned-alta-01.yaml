abstract:
- content: "<p>Establishing authenticity of a stream of datagrams in the presence
    of multiple receivers is naively achieved through the use of per-packet asymmetric
    digital signatures, but at high computational cost for both senders and receivers.
    Timed Efficient Stream Loss-Tolerant Authentication (TESLA) instead employs relatively
    cheap symmetric authentication, achieving asymmetry via time-delayed key disclosure,
    while adding latency to verification and imposing requirements on time synchronization
    between receivers and the sender to prevent forgery. This document introduces
    Asymmetric Loss-Tolerant Authentication (ALTA), which employs an acyclic graph
    of message authentication codes (MACs) transmitted alongside data payloads, with
    redundancy to enable authentication of all received payloads in the presence of
    certain patterns of loss, along with regularly paced digital signatures. ALTA
    requires no time synchronization and enables authentication of payloads as soon
    as sufficient authentication material has been received.</p>"
