abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a solution to classify Application-Layer traffic
    on switches using Application Tags. The Application Tags can be passed on to other
    switches in the Enterprise Network and also to switches in the Service Provider
    Network. Thus it provides a mechanism to classify and apply Quality of Service
    based on the Application-Layer Traffic. The advantage of this solution is that
    it requires no hardware upgrade on switch nor any Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
    function on the switch. 1. Conventions The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 2.
