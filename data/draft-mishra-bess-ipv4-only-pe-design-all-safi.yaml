abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers try to decide whether or not to
    upgrade their brown field or green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol
    BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of their Provider (P)
    core network as well as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators
    must be able to continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge
    networks are IPv4-Only. This specification details an important External BGP (eBGP)
    PE-CE Edge IPv4-Only peering design that leverages the MP-BGP capability exchange
    by using IPv4 peering as pure transport, allowing both IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be
    carried over the same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session. The design change
    provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate
    IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today. With this design change from a control
    plane perspective a single IPv4 is required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates
    and from a data plane forwarindg perspective an IPv4 address need only be configured
    on the PE and CE interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding. This document
    defines the IPv4-Only PE Design as a new PE-CE Edge and ASBR-ASBR PE-PE Inter-AS
    BGP peering Standard defined in this specification which is now extended to support
    to all AFI/SAFI ubiquitously. As service providers migrate to Segment Routing
    architecture SR-MPLS and SRv6, VPN overlay exsits as well, and thus Inter-AS options
    Option-A, Option-B, Option-AB and Option-C are still applicable and thus this
    extension of IPv4-Only peering architecure extension to Inter-AS peering is very
    relevant to Segment Routing as well.</p>"
