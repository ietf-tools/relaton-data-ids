abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the BDP_FRAME extension for QUIC. The frame
    enables the exchange of CC parameters related to the path characteristics between
    the receiver and the sender during a connection. These CC parameters can be utilised
    by the Careful Resume method when a new connection is established or for application-limited
    traffic. The CC parameters allows a receiver to prepare to use the additional
    capacity that could be amde available when the method is used. This CC parameters
    can also be used by the receiver to request that previously computed CC parameters
    related to the path characteristics, are not used, when the receiver has additional
    information about the path or traffic to be sent.</p>"
