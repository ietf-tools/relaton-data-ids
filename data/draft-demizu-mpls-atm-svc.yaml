abstract:
- content: "<p>Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and integrate
    Layer 2 and Layer 3. ATM Label Switching Router (ATM-LSR) is one of the major
    applications of label switching. Some ATM-LSRs will need to support ATM SVC services,
    which requires signaling to establish VCs before employing them and to release
    VCs after utilizing them. This document proposes procedures to deal with ATM SVCs
    between ATM-LSRs.</p>"
