abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we provide a gap analysis to apply DMM deployment
    models to a 3GPP mobile core network. The DMM deployment models are described
    into five models for separation control and data plane, and the 3GPP mobile core
    network is a 4G-based extended architecture and 5G core network study architecture.
    We conduct the gap analysis to describe the technology that requires current standards-based
    applicability and extension for technical interoperability between two standardization
    organizations.</p>"
