abstract:
- content: "<p>A frame relay pseudowire is a mechanism that exists between a provider's
    edge network nodes and that supports as faithfully as possible frame relay services
    over an MPLS packet switched network (PSN). This document describes the detailed
    encapsulation necessary to transport frame relay packets over an MPLS network.
