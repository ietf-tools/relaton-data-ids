abstract:
- content: "<p>In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation is done
    based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR available-bandwidth
    to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and nodes such as Broadcast-Multi-Access
    networks that form part of the topology in an area. When MPLS is deployed in the
    area (be it the backbone or non-backbone area) LDP can be used to distribute a
    disjoint set of labels for the power based topology. Flows some or all of those
    that traverse the area can then be mapped either to the regular shortest-path
    tree or the power based shortest-path tree. This document specifies the proposal
    to construct and maintain such a tree called the power based SPT.</p>"
