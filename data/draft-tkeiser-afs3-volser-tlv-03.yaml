abstract:
- content: "<p>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed
    at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s. AFS-3 heavily leverages Remote
    Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed architecture. In
    2003, new RPCs were introduced into AFS-3 that provide for capability introspection
    between file servers and cache managers. This memo introduces equivalent functionality
    to the volume server RPC interface, thus making the volume management interface
    more extensible. Furthermore, this memo extends the volume management interface
    to support getting and setting of AFS volume attributes via an extensible Tag-Length-Value
    (TLV) encoding, which is based upon XDR discriminated unions. TLV-based get and
    set RPCs are specified, along with a tag enumeration RPC. The TLV encoding side-steps
    the typical XDR union decode problem, whereby failure to decode a union leg causes
    the entire RPC payload decode to fail, by mandating an XDR opaque default leg
    for the union, along with a standard mechanism for encoding new leg types inside
    the XDR opaque blob. Finally, tags are allocated for existing volume and transaction
    metadata, and implementation-private tags are allocated for metadata related to
    the OpenAFS Demand Attach File Server and RxOSD protocol. Internet Draft Comments
    Comments regarding this draft are solicited. Please include the AFS-3 protocol
    standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient
    of any comments.</p>"
