abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6
    Network Prefix Translation (NPTv6) function that provides the address-independence
    benefit associated with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT (NAPT44) and provides a 1:1 relationship
    between addresses in the "inside" and "outside" prefixes, preserving end-to-end
    reachability at the network layer. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be
