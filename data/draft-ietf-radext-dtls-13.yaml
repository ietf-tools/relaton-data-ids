abstract:
- content: "<p>The RADIUS protocol defined in RFC 2865 has limited support for authentication
    and encryption of RADIUS packets. The protocol transports data in the clear, although
    some parts of the packets can have obfuscated content. Packets may be replayed
    verbatim by an attacker, and client-server authentication is based on fixed shared
    secrets. This document specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    protocol may be used as a fix for these problems. It also describes how implementations
    of this proposal can coexist with current RADIUS systems.</p>"
