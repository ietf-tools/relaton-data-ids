abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC5559. This memo is one of a series describing
    possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain. This document proposes an
    admission control method. It assumes that PCN nodes perform threshold-marking
    configured with the PCN- admissible-rate on any link. The decision point uses
    the PCN marking state of an initial signaling message of a flow to determine whether
    the flow should be admitted or blocked.</p>"
