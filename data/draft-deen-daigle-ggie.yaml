- content: "<p>This document introduces the Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem (GGIE).
    GGIE's purpose is to improve how the Internet is used create and consume video,
    both amateur and professional, reflecting that the line between amateur and professional
    video technology is increasingly blurred. Glass to Glass refers to the entire
    video ecosystem, from the camera lens to the viewing screen. As the name implies,
    GGIE's scope is the entire video ecosystem from capture, through the steps of
    editing, packaging, distributed and searching, and finally viewing. GGIE is not
    a complete end to end architecture or solution, it provides foundational elements
    that can serve as building blocks for new Internet video innovation. This is a
    companion effort to the GGIE W3C Taskforce in the W3C Web and TV Interest Group.
    This document is being discussed on the ggie@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
