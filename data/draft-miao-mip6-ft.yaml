abstract:
- content: "<p>As important security devices, firewalls are widely deployed in ISP
    and enterprise networks. However, currently firewalls, which are essentially designed
    for fixed networks, are difficult to support Mobile IPv6. Unless firewalls are
    aware of the detail of mobile IPv6 protocol, they impacts smooth operation of
    the protocol and can be harmful to mobile IPv6 deployment. This internet draft
    intends to show some ideas to solve the problems on mobile IPv6 firewall traversal.
    The solutions proposed are not an overall solution to fix all the traversal problems.</p>"
