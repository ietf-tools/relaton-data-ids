abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP, the Constrained Application Protocol, needs to be implemented
    in such a way that it does not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.
    The CoRE CoAP specification defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of congestion
    with minimal implementation requirements. It also leaves room for combining the
    base specification with advanced congestion control mechanisms with higher performance.
    This specification defines more advanced, but still simple CoRE Congestion Control
    mechanisms, called CoCoA. The core of these mechanisms is a Retransmission TimeOut
    (RTO) algorithm that makes use of Round-Trip Time (RTT) estimates, in contrast
    with how the RTO is determined as per the base CoAP specification (RFC 7252).
    The mechanisms defined in this document have relatively low complexity, yet they
    improve the default CoAP RTO algorithm. The design of the mechanisms in this specification
    has made use of input from simulations and experiments in real networks.</p>"
