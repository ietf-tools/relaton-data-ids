abstract:
- content: <p>An RFC can include a tag called "Updates" which can be used to link
    a new RFC to an existing RFC. On publication of such an RFC, the existing RFC
    will include an additional metadata tag called "Updated by" which provides a link
    to the new RFC. However, this tag pair is not well-defined and therefore it is
    currently used for multiple different purposes, which leads to confusion about
    the actual meaning of this tag and inconsistency in its use. This document recommends
    the discontinuation of the use of the updates/updated by tag pair, and instead
    proposes three new tag pairs that have well-defined meanings and use cases.</p>
