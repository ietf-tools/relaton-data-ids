abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF regularly develops new technologies. Sometimes there are several
    standards that can be combined to become vastly more than the sum of their parts.
    Right now, there are six technologies either recently adopted or poised for adoption
    that create such a cluster. Combining secure onboarding, remote attestation, secure
    update, software bill-of-materials/expected attestation, automated network policy
    enforcement, and trusted execution environment provisioning, devices can be defended
    from many threats. This is an opportunity for an inflection point for more secure
    and trustworthy devices. Simultaneous adoption of two or more of these six standards
    could create the foundation of computing devices that are worth trusting.</p>"
