abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems
    within the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway Protocol [BGP],
    which is used to provide routing information between autonomous systems. This
    draft addresses various deployment scenarios and options using the extensions
    to BGP outlined in [SOBGP-BGP] in conjunction with [SOBGP-KEY] (which is not yet
    completed or published) and [SOBGP-RADIUS]. Each section of this draft discusses
    a different deployment situation or deployment option. The final section discusses
    how private key rollovers can be accomplished with no loss of routing information
    within soBGP deployments.</p>"
