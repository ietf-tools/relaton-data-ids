abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol described in this document is a member of the IP Device
    Control (IPDC) family of protocols. The IPDC protocols are proposed as a protocol
    suite, components of which can be used individually or together to perform connection
    control, media control, and signaling transport for environments where the service
    control logic is separated from the network access server. Please see the references
    section for other IPDC documents. The protocol specification presented here is
    intended for use between a media gateway controller and a media gateway. The media
    gateway may be capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice over ATM gateway,
    dialup modem media gateway, circuit switch, or cross- connect. Using the IP Device
    Signaling Transport protocol presented here, the media gateway can receive a signaling
    from a circuit switched network and deliver the signaling to a media gateway controller
    on an intervening IP network. The media gateway controller can also send signaling
    to a media gateway for delivery on a circuit switched network.</p>"
