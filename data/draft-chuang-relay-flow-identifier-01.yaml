abstract:
- content: "<p>To prevent spammers from using relay forwarding, we propose to identify
    relay flows. We do this by having relays categorize their authenticated traffic
    flows and publish to receivers identifiers associated with those flows. This is
    a unique, persistent over time, relay flow identifier name that is secured by
    some digital signature. Receivers can use this identifier to help categorize traffic
    through the relay and use that identifier to apply fine-grain anti-abuse policies
    instead of on the entire traffic through the relay. This document provides a specification
    for DKIM ([RFC6376]) for originating traffic and ARC [RFC8617] for forwarded traffic.</p>"
