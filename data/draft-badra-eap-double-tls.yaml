abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-Double-TLS is an EAP protocol that extends EAP-TLS. In EAP-TLS,
    a full TLS handshake is used to mutually authenticate a peer and server and to
    share a secret key. EAP-Double-TLS extends this authentication negotiation by
    establishing a secure connection based on the use of Pre Shared Keys (PSK). The
    secure connection may then be used to allow the server and the peer to securely
    exchange their identity and to update security attributes for next sessions. EAP-Double-TLS
    allows the peer and the server to establish keying material for use in the data
    connection between the peer and the authenticator. The keying material is established
    implicitly between peer and server based on the TLS Pre-Shared-Key handshake.</p>"
