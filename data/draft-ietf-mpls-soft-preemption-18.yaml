abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic
    Engineering Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications extending the concept
    of preemption with the goal of reducing or eliminating traffic disruption of preempted
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs). Initially, MPLS RSVP-TE was
    defined with support for only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption. The
    utilization of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully mitigate the
    reroute process of preempted TE LSP. For the brief period soft preemption is activated,
    reservations (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned
    until the TE LSP(s) can be rerouted. For this reason, the feature is primarily,
    but not exclusively, interesting in MPLS-enabled IP networks with Differentiated
    Services and Traffic Engineering capabilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
