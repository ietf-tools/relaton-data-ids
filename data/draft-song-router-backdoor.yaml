abstract:
- content: "<p>This document elaborates a threat model for inherent backdoor in a
    telecom router. We assume a malicious router can have inherent backdoor with an
    interest in eavesdropping or disabling the functioning of the router or the whole
    network. It is intended to demonstrate to the system designers and network administrators
    how the backdoor works, so as to assist in the security evaluation of the routers,
    and especially the standard design that is immune to inherent backdoors.</p>"
