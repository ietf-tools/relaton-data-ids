- content: "<p>This note is intended to describe the end to end problem as it applies
    to a network of networks, wherein some component networks independently run only
    IPv4 with or without a transition mechanism, some run only IPv6 with or without
    a transition mechanism and without coordination of transition mechanisms, and
    some run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel supporting native routing.</p>"
