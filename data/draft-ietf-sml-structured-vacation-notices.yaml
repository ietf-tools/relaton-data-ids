abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a machine-readable format for conveying unavailibility
    information in email messages. This includes "vacation notices" of persons but
    also different forms of unavailibility for emails sent by programs. Structured
    vacation notices are supposed to be used in conjunction with conventional, human-readable
    vacation notices in most cases. They are based on the forthcoming "structured
    email" specification defined in [I-D.ietf-sml-structured-email-03] and related
    drafts.</p>
