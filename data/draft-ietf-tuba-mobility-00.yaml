abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent
    routing of CLNP datagrams to Mobile Nodes in the Internet. The Mobile Node is
    always identified by its Home-Address, regardless of its current point of attachment
    to the Internet. While situated away from its home, a Mobile Node is also associated
    with a Care-Of-Address, which provides information about its current point of
    attachment to the Internet. The protocol provides for registering the Care-Of-Address
    with the Home Agent. The Home Agent tunnels traffic destined for the Mobile Node
    to the Care-Of-Address.</p>"
