abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for impersonation of one principal
    by another. Relying parties are expected to apply policy to decide which impersonation
    attempts they accept. Trusted third parties may provide assistance in evaluating
    policy. The proposed system fails safe: applications that do not support it see
    their peers as the impersonators, not the impersonated principals.</p>"
