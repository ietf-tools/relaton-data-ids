abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to perform third party call control in
    SIP for both a basic single-media and multi-media call when SDP preconditions
    are used. This draft considers the Quality of Service and the resource management.
    There are no new SIP extensions needed to accomplish this. The mechanism outlined
    is illustrated with examples in order to help understand it.</p>"
