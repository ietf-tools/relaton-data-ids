abstract:
- content: "<p>By default, a CMS signed-and-encrypted document or message authenticates
    only the document's originator, and not the person who encrypted the document.
    This subtle limitation exposes CMS and S/MIME signed-and-encrypted data to 'surreptitious
    forwarding.' Secure-messaging standards have treated surreptitious forwarding
    as an insoluble problem of user carelessness, and have long accepted the risk
    of this attack. This document discusses easy cryptographic remedies for this attack,
    suitable for incorporation into the CMS and S/MIME specifications. This document
    is an abridgement of [U2001].</p>"
