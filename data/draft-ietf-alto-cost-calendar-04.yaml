abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning network related information
    in order to allow applications to make network informed decisions. The present
    draft extends the ALTO cost information so as to broaden the decision possibilities
    of applications to not only decide 'where' to connect to, but also 'when'. This
    is useful to applications that need to schedule their data transfers and connections
    and have a degree of freedom to do so. ALTO guidance to schedule application traffic
    can also efficiently help for load balancing and resources efficiency. Besides,
    the ALTO Cost Calendar allows to schedule the ALTO requests themselves and thus
    to save a number of ALTO transactions. This draft proposes new capabilities and
    attributes on filtered cost maps and endpoint cost maps enabling an ALTO Server
    to provide "Cost Calendars". These capabilities are applicable to ALTO metrics
    with time-varying values. With ALTO Cost Calendars, an ALTO Server exposes ALTO
    cost values in JSON arrays where each value corresponds to a given time interval.
    The time intervals as well as other Calendar attributes are specified in the IRD
    and ALTO Server responses.</p>
