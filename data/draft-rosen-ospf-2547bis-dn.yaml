abstract:
- content: "<p>[VPN] describes a method by which a Service Provider (SP) may provide
    a VPN service to its customers. In that method, BGP is used to carry customer
    routes across the SP's backbone. That method allows a variety of different protocols
    to be used as the routing protocol between the Customer Edge (CE) router and the
    Provider Edge (PE) router. [VPN-OSPF] specifies additional procedures to be used
    when the CE/PE router protocol is OSPF. In these additional procedures, customer
    OSPF routes from a CE router are translated into BGP routes by a PE router. Then
    they are sent via BGP to another PE router, which translates them back into OSPF
    routes and distributes them to another CE router. This translation may lose some
    of the information needed to prevent loops. This document proposes that one of
    the OSPF options bits be used to ensure that when a VPN route is sent from a PE
    to a CE, the route will be ignored by any PE which receives it back from a CE.</p>"
