abstract:
- content: "<p>As operators struggle to optimize their network for different applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's growing business pressure to
    minimize operational tasks and the deployment time of new services. New automation
    paradigms are meant to help reach these goals, including the optimization of network
    functions through application control. This control could be signaled directly
    by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a centralized manner. The
    current version of the Application-based Policy for Network Functions (APONF)
    proposed working group mentions the NSIS framework as a possible signaling protocol,
    through the definition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP). The present
    memo analyses if this proposition is suitable for the designed purpose and if
    other protocols would be more suitable.</p>"
