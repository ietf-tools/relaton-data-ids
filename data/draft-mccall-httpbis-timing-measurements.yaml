abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to gather relevant
    performace data from compliant user-agents. Though the HTML 5 standard supplies
    Nav-Timings there is no standard way for that data to be communicated back to
    an origin. The intention of this document is to describe a method in which that
    can be done cleanly and scalably.</p>"
