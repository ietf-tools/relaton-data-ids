abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a scheme to improve the credibility of log reporting
    time by adding time synchronization information. This document updates the "timeQuality"
    structured Data in RFC 5424 [RFC5424], The Syslog Protocol. By appending "SYNCINFO"
    information after the "isSynced" parameter, the log collector can judge the credibility
    of logs when correlating logs of different devices.</p>
