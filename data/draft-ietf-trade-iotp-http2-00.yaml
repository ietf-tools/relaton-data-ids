abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) messages will be carried as Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) documents. As such, the goal of mapping to the transport
    layer is to ensure that the underlying XML documents are carried successfully
    between the various parties. This document describes that mapping for the Hyper
    Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), Versions 1.0 and 1.1, and the location of HTTP
    based IOTP services using the SRV domain name system resource record.</p>"
