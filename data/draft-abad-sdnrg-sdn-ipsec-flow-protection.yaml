abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use case for providing IPsec flow protection
    by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller and raises the requirements
    to support this service. It considers two main scenarios: (i) gateway-to-gateway
    and (ii) host-to-gateway (Road Warrior). For the gateway-to-gateway scenario,
    this document describes a mechanism to support the bootstrapping of key material
    between network resources to protect data traffic with IPsec and IKE, both in
    intra and inter-SDN cases. The host-to-gateway case defines a mechanism to bootstrap
    key material to protect data with IPsec between an end user's device and a gateway.</p>"
