abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a simple mechanism to prevent an attacker from
    presenting a forged "From" header field. It offers an end-to-end identity assumption
    which does not require any previous association or trust relationship between
    administrative domains or the UAs. The UAS verifies the "From" header by subscribing
    to the Dialog Event package [RFC 4235] at the AOR in the "From" header field.
    If the entity calling is registered under this AOR, it will confirm that it is
    calling by sending some valid dialog state. In this case, the identity of the
    caller is considered to be verified.</p>
