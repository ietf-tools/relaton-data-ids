abstract:
- content: <p>DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either
    UDP or TCP. UDP transport involves keeping less state on a busy server, but can
    cause truncation and retries over TCP. Additionally, UDP can be exploited for
    reflection attacks. Using TCP would reduce retransmits and amplification. However,
    clients are currently limited in their use of the TCP transport as most implementations
    limit the TCP session to a single DNS query and answer, making use of TCP only
    suitable as a fallback protocol for UDP. This document defines an EDNS0 option
    ("edns-tcp-keepalive") that allows DNS clients and servers to signal their respective
    readiness to conduct multiple DNS transactions over individual TCP sessions. This
    signalling facilitates a better balance of UDP and TCP transport between individual
    clients and servers, reducing the impact of problems associated with UDP transport
    and allowing the state associated with TCP transport to be managed effectively
    with minimal impact on the DNS transaction time.</p>
