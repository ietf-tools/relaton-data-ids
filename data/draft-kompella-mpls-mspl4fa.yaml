abstract:
- content: '<p>The MPLS architecture introduced Special Purpose Labels (SPLs) to indicate
    special forwarding actions and offered a few simple examples, such as Router Alert.
    In the two decades since the original architecture was crafted, the range, complexity
    and sheer number of such actions has grown; in addition, there now is need for
    "associated data" for some of the forwarding actions. Likewise, the capabilities
    and scale of forwarding engines has also improved vastly over the same time period.
    There is a pressing need to match the needs with the capabilities to deliver the
    next generation of MPLS architecture. In this memo, we propose an alternate mechanism
    whereby a single SPL can encode multiple forwarding actions and carry data (if
    any) associated with the actions, some in the label stack and some after the label
    stack. This proposal also solves the problem of scarcity of base SPLs. As proof
    of its utility and flexibility, this approach can immediately address several
    use cases: * to carry an Entropy Label for better load balancing; * to carry a
    Flow-Aggregate Selector for IETF network slicing; * to signal that further fast
    reroute may have harmful consequences; * to indicate that there is relevant data
    after the label stack; * among others.</p>'
