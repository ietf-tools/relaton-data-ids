abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces two schemes that provide a per-packet authentication
    and integrity service in the context of the ALC and NORM protocols. The first
    scheme is based on digital signatures. Because it relies on asymmetric cryptography,
    this scheme generates a high processing load at the sender and to a lesser extent
    at a receiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead. It is therefore
    well suited to low data rate sessions. The second scheme relies on a group Message
    Authentication Code (MAC). Because this scheme relies symmetric cryptography,
    MAC calculation and verification are fast operations, which makes it suited to
    high data rate sessions. However it only provides a group authentication and integrity
    service, which means that it only protects against attackers that are not group
    members.</p>"
