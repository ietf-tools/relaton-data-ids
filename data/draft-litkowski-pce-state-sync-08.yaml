abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) using PCEP. A Path Computation Client (PCC) can
    synchronize an LSP state information to a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).
    The stateful PCE extension allows a redundancy scenario where a PCC can have redundant
    PCEP sessions towards multiple PCEs. In such a case, a PCC gives control on a
    LSP to only a single PCE, and only one PCE is responsible for path computation
    for this delegated LSP. There are some use cases, where an inter-PCE stateful
    communication can bring additional resiliency in the design, for instance when
    some PCC-PCE sessions fails. The inter-PCE stateful communication may also provide
    a faster update of the LSP states when such an event occurs. Finally, when, in
    a redundant PCE scenario, there is a need to compute a set of paths that are part
    of a group (so there is a dependency between the paths), there may be some cases
    where the computation of all paths in the group is not handled by the same PCE:
    this situation is called a split-brain. This split-brain scenario may lead to
    computation loops between PCEs or suboptimal path computation. This document describes
    the procedures to allow a stateful communication between PCEs for various use-cases
    and also the procedures to prevent computations loops.</p>"
