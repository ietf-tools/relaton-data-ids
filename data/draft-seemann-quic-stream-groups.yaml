abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a few different mechanism flow control mechanisms:
    Stream flow control, connection-level flow control and flow control for the number
    of (unidirectional / bidirectional) streams This allows a single application running
    on of a QUIC connection to apply backpressure. However, when multiple independent
    applications share a single underlying QUIC connection, these mechanisms are not
    sufficient to prevent one resource-hungry application from consuming all the resources
    (streams and / or connection-level flow control credit) available on the connection,
    effectively starving the other application.</p>"
