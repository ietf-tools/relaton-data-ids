abstract:
- content: "<p>During the summer of 1999, a grand debate raged over the correct interpretation
    of several DHCP client options as described in [RFC 2132], as well as the need
    for one option whose proposing Internet-Draft expired. As a result of that debate,
    the authors gained some insights into the intended (or unintended!) interpretation
    of certain options defined in [RFC 2132,] particularly the Vendor Class Identifier
    (option 60) and Vendor Encapsulated Options (option 43.) These insights are presented
    in this informational Internet-Draft, whose reason for being is to act as an aid
    to implementers of the DHC protocol, and to future editors of the underlying RFCs
    and selected, current Internet-Drafts. This memo is not being proposed as a standards-track
    document, but rather as an aid to clarify existing and future RFCs.</p>"
