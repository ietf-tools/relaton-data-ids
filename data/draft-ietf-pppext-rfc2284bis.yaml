abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),
    an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication mechanisms.
    EAP typically runs directly over the link layer without requiring IP, but is reliant
    on lower layer ordering guarantees as in PPP and IEEE 802. EAP does provide its
    own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission. Fragmentation is not
    supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this.
    While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is also now in use with
    IEEE 802. This document obsoletes RFC 2284.</p>"
