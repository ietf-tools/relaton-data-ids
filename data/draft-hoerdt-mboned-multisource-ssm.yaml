abstract:
- content: "<p>Classical multicast multi-sources applications use the Deering's [1]
    ASM group communication model where anyone, including non-members, can send packets
    with one local operation to a group identifier G with best effort guarantees that
    its packet will be transmitted to all group members: the network duplicates packets
    and manages the dynamics of source and receivers. With the new Holbrook's [3]
    SSM model it is the responsibility of applications to tell the network who are
    their sources of interest. As a consequence, the SSM model is well suited for
    TV-like (one to many) applications because there is only one source to discover
    and it's supposed to be well known. But there is still missing an SSM session
    layer or middleware for applications helping multi-sources applications to discover
    the presence/leaving source in case of SSM model. We give here a possible implementation
    for this Source discovery session layer according to the protocol defined in [5].</p>"
