abstract:
- content: "<p>The MIPSHOP working group is currently developing functionality to
    support media independent handover services, which are intended to aid IP handover
    mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless access systems. These handover
    services provide a mechanism by which information such as the presence of neighbouring
    links and networks, and their associated characteristics, can be delivered to
    mobile and other network nodes for the purposes of supporting better handover
    decisions. A key component of the solution is the set of protocols that is used
    to deliver the various types of information to the appropriate destination node.
    A separate problem statement draft outlines a structure for this set of protocols
    as a unified set of common functions, supporting a more diverse set of application
    specific protocols. This draft outlines the key considerations that have to be
    considered when selecting or designing protocols for such common functionality.
    This draft is offered for use as a mechanism to capture working group discussions
    on the design of the common protocol functions during their initial development,
    without imposing a particular solution on the discussion process. It is not intended
    as a long term output.</p>"
