abstract:
- content: "<p>The GSSAPI Kerberos 5 mechanism definition [GSSAPI-KRB5] specifically
    enumerates encryption and checksum types, independently of how such schemes may
    be used in Kerberos. In the long run, a new Kerberos- based mechanism, which does
    not require separately enumerating for the GSSAPI mechanism each of the various
    encryption types defined by Kerberos, is probably a better approach. Various people
    have expressed interest in designing one, but the work has not yet been completed.</p>"
