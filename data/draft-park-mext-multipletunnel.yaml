abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
    for multiple tunnel support by adopting an IP mobility management scheme in which
    multiple wireless network interfaces are assigned active IPv6 care-of addresses
    and are used simultaneously to enable fast handover. The mechanism of this document
    not only enhances the handover latency, but also drastically reduces the packet
    loss and improves throughput.</p>"
