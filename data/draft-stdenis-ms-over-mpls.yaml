abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generalized approach to carrying Multi- service
    protocol data units (PDUs) over an MPLS Network. This proposal defines standard
    MPLS encapsulations that support permanent virtual circuit (PVC) and switch virtual
    circuit (SVC) networking. The goal of this draft is to provide a framework that
    allows an MPLS network to support a range of services from simple circuit emulation
    services, to complete network inter-working. There are two distinct aspects to
    these services: the data plane and the control plane. The data plane must be defined
    to support nailed-up and switched services. This architecture covers the data
    plane but not the complete procedures for the control plane. The control plane
    is only defined from a nailed up perspective. The control plane for dynamic services
    maybe supported by other signaling protocols such as PNNI. Non MPLS signaling
    is not covered by this draft.</p>"
