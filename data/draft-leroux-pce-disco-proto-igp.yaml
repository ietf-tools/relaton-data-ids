abstract:
- content: "<p>In various situations it would be highly useful for a Path Computation
    Client (PCC) to be able to dynamically and automatically discover a set of Path
    Computation Element(s) (PCE), along with some of information relevant for PCE
    selection. When the PCE is an LSR participating to the IGP, or even a server participating
    passively to the IGP, a simple and efficient way for PCE discovery, consists of
    relying on IGP flooding. For that purpose this document defines simple OSPF and
    ISIS extensions for the advertisement of PCE Discovery information within and
    across IGP areas.</p>"
