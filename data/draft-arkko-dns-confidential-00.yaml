abstract:
- content: "<p>Data leaks are a serious privacy problem for Internet users. Data in
    flight and at rest can be protected with traditional communications security and
    data encryption. Protecting data in use is more difficult. In addition, failure
    to protect data in use can lead to disclosing session or encryption keys needed
    for protecting data in flight or at rest. This document discusses the use of onfidential
    Computing, to reduce the risk of leaks from data in use. Our example use case
    is in the context of DNS resolution services.</p>"
