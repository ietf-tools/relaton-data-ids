abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a mechanism that allows a single router to share
    one or more links among multiple IS-IS routing protocol instances. Multiple instances
    allow the isolation of resources associated with each instance. Routers will form
    instance specific adjacencies, exchange instance specific routing updates and
    compute paths utilizing instance specific LSDB information. Each PDU will contain
    a new TLV identifying the instance to which the PDU belongs. This allows a network
    operator to deploy multiple IS-IS instances in parallel, using the same set of
    links when required and still have the capability of computing instance specific
    paths. This draft does not address the forwarding paradigm that needs to be used
    in order to ensure data PDUs are forwarded according to the paths computed by
    a specific instance.</p>"
