abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the inter-FE consistent control problem for
    ForCES in software-defined network (SDN), and proposes an inter-FE consistent
    control scheme through dynamic match-field selection. In detail, the control element
    (CE) analyzes the similarities and differences between both the old and rules.
    Then, CE dynamically determines appropriate match fields and, correspondingly,
    generates a set of transitional flow entries. After that, it deletes the old flow
    entries and writes the new ones. Finally, the consistent control is achieved after
    deleting the transitional flow entries. This scheme guarantees the inter-FE consistent
    control.</p>"
