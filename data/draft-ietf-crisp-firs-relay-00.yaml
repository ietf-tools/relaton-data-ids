- content: "<p>This document describes an LDAP search request and response control
    to allow additional unspecified data to be returned with a referral to the client,
    which can submit these data to the referred to server in support of the Federated
    Internet Registry Service (FIRS) described in [FIRS-ARCH] and [FIRS-CORE]. A flexible
    container called relay bag as required in [CRISP-REQ] is included into this extension
    to the LDAP search operation.</p>"
