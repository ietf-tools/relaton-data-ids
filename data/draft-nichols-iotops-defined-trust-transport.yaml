abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a broadcast-friendly, many-to-many Defined-
    trust Transport (DeftT) that makes it simple to express and enforce application
    and deployment specific integrity, authentication, access control and behavior
    constraints directly in the protocol stack. DeftT is part of a Defined-trust Communications
    framework with an example codebase, not a protocol specification. Combined with
    IPv6 multicast and modern hardware-based methods for securing keys and code, it
    provides an easy to use foundation for secure and efficient communications in
    Limited Domains (RFC8799), in particular for Operational Technology (OT) networks.</p>"
