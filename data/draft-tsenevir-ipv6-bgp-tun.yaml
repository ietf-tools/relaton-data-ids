abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we provide methods to discover and connect native
    IPV6 clouds that are separated by IPV4 Internet. BGP-MP [2] is used as protocol
    to discover IPV6 relay routers. BGP-MP(BGP4+) [3] is used to distribute IPV6 routes.
    Encapsulation of IPV6 presented in [4] is used to tunnel IPv6 traffic across IPV4
    Internet. The method presented here is known as 6in4 as opposed to 6to4 [4] or
    6over4[5].</p>"
