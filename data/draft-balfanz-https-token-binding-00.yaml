abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP
    servers to cryptographically bind authentication tokens (such as cookies and OAuth
    tokens) to a TLS [RFC5246] connection. We describe both _first-party_ as well
    as _federated_ scenarios. In a first-party scenario, an HTTP server issues a security
    token (such as a cookie) to a client, and expects the client to send the security
    token back to the server at a later time in order to authenticate. Binding the
    token to the TLS connection between client and server protects the security token
    from theft, and ensures that the security token can only be used by the client
    that it was issued to. Federated token bindings, on the other hand, allow servers
    to cryptographically bind security tokens to a TLS [RFC5246] connection that the
    client has with a _different_ server than the one issuing the token. This Internet-Draft
    is a companion document to The Token Binding Protocol [DraftPopov]</p>"
