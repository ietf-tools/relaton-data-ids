abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL uses distribution trees for multi-destination traffic. In fat
    tree structure, it is very possible that the distance from an ingress RBridge
    to multiple tree roots are the same. Therefore the minimum distance comparison
    may not help much in the tree selection decision. Multiple trees can be used by
    an ingress RBridge. For any RBridge RBn, if RBn has downstream receivers of VLAN
    x in a distribution tree t, there will be an entry of (t, x, port list) in the
    multicast forwarding table on RBn. If there are n trees and m VLANs, the multicast
    forwarding table size on RBn is typically n*m entries. The value of m is up to
    4096 and n is up to the total number of distribution trees in the campus. If finer
    granularity filtering such as L2/L3 multicast address is used, then the multicast
    forwarding table size further increases dramatically. TRILL multicast forwarding
    table size is limited in hardware/silicon implements and sometimes L3 multicasting
    shares the same table with it. This document specifies a VLAN based tree selection
    mechanism to reduce the multicast forwarding table size. No data plane change
    is required.</p>"
