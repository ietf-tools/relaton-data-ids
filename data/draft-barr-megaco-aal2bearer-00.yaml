abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes specific procedures that Media Gateways (MGs)
    shall follow for AAL2 bearer-path establishment under the control of H.248 (Megaco)
    capable Media Gateway Controllers (MGCs). The procedures cover MGs which use provisioned
    VCCs and backward call setup mode dynamic SVCs, and which do not use AAL2 signalling
    (i.e. no Q.2630.x). Although this document refers to the use of the H.248 (Megaco)
    gateway control protocol, many of the concepts and procedures are not specific
    to this protocol.</p>"
