abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to connect billions
    of objects to Internet. Today, the IoT landscape is very fragmented from both
    the technology and service perspectives. As a consequence, it is difficult to
    integrate and cross-correlate data coming from the heterogeneous contexts and
    build value-added services on top. This reason has motivated the current trend
    to develop a unified de- fragmented IoT architecture so that objects can be made
    accessible to applications across organizations and domains. Several proposals
    have been made to build a unified IoT architecture as an overlay on top of today's
    Internet. Such overlay solutions, however, inherit the existing limitations of
    the IP protocol: mobility, security, scalability, and communication reliability.
    To address this problem, A unified IoT architecture based on the Information Centric
    Networking (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT [1] has been proposed. ICN-IoT
    leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless device-to-device
    (D2D) communication, mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and
    service delivery. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the real diffusion of ICN-IoT
    architecture it is fundamental to deal with self-configuring features such as
    device onboarinding and discovery, service discovery, scalability, security and
    privacy requirements, content dissemmination since the IoT system will comprise
    of diverse applications with heterogenous requirements including connectivity,
    resource constraints and mobility. Towards this, the draft elaborates on a set
    of middleware functions to enable large operation of an ICN-IoT deployment. This
    draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT architecture to connect
    heterogeneous IoT systems. We then propose an ICN-IoT system architecture and
    middleware components which includes device/network-service discovery, naming
    service, IoT service discovery, data discovery, user registration, and content
    delivery. For all of these components, discussions for secure solutions are offered.
    We also provide discussions on inter- connecting heterogeneous ICN-IoT domains.</p>"
