abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a mechanism for use in conjunction with link state
    routing protocols which prevents the transient loops which would otherwise occur
    during topology changes. It does this by correctly sequencing the FIB updates
    on the routers. This mechanism can be used in the case of non-urgent link or node
    shutdowns and restarts or link metric changes. It can also be used in conjunction
    with a FRR mechanism which converts a sudden link or node failure into a non-urgent
    topology change. This is possible where a complete repair path is provided for
    all affected destinations. After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes
    a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB. A method for
    accelerating this loop-free convergence process by the use of completion messages
    is also described.</p>"
