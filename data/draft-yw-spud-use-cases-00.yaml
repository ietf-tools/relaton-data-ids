abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of SPUD is to provide a standardized layer below the transport
    layer, to behavior as a communication channel between the host and network devices.
    So when a new transport protocol is deployed, it's easy for network devices to
    cooperate with it. New transports could have a common encapsulation to middleboxes.
    On the other hand, the transport layer could also make use of the state of network
    devices collected by the SPUD, to improve transport performance. This document
    provides some exemplary use cases for SPUD, especially in stateful firewall and
    TCP optimization. The objective of this draft is not to cover all conceivable
    p2a or a2p signaling in detail. Rather, the intention is to explain the requirements
    in these use cases as far as it is required to complement the problem statement
    of the SPUD.</p>"
