abstract:
- content: "<p>The submission profile of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) provides
    a standard way for an email client to submit a complete message for delivery.
    The chunking extension provides a way for a client to compose a message for submission
    from a series of client provided pieces. This specification further extends the
    chunking facility so that a client can compose a message from additional sources.
    For example, a client could use this facility to forward a message from an IMAP
    server or forward a web page as an attachment to a new message.</p>"
