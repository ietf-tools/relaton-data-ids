abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the issue which makes the data tranfer in SMTP
    protocol highly vulnerable to a 'resend' in case of a network disruption. We then
    discuss a means by which such a 'resend' can be avoided, by tranferring mail data
    only from the point of disruption.</p>"
