abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes VP9, a video codec being developed specifically
    to meet the demand for the consumption of video over the Internet, including professionally
    and amateur produced video-on- demand and conversational video content. VP9 is
    an evolution of the VP8 video codec that is described in [bankoski-rfc6386] and
    includes a number of enhancements and new coding tools that have been added to
    improve the coding efficiency. The new tools that have been added so far include:
    larger prediction block sizes up to 64x64, various forms of compound INTER prediction,
    more modes for INTRA prediction, &amp;#8539;-pel motion vectors, 8-tap switchable
    sub-pixel interpolation filters, improved motion reference generation, improved
    motion vector coding, improved entropy coding including frame-level entropy adaptation
    for various symbols, improved loop filtering, the incorporation of the Asymmetric
    Discrete Sine Transform (ADST), larger 16x16 and 32x32 DCTs, and improved frame
    level segmentation. VP9 is under active development and this document provides
    only a snapshot of the current state of the coding tools as they exist today.
    The finalized version of the VP9 bitstream may differ considerably from the description
    contained herein and may encompass the exclusion or modification of existing coding
    tools or the addition of new coding tools.</p>"
