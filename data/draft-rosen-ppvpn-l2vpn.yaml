abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Providers may offer a 'Layer 2 VPN Service' over an IP backbone
    by provisioning point-to-point 'virtual circuits' that run through IP tunnels.
    This document discusses the signaling, encapsulation, and configuration issues
    that arise. Its purpose is to provide an architecture which allows different kinds
    of point-to- point virtual circuits to be provided through different kinds of
    IP tunnels.</p>"
