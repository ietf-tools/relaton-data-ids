abstract:
- content: "<p>The support of QoS Differentiation in MPLS is based on the definition
    of two types of LSP, respectively E-LSP and L-LSP (see [11]). Both E-LSP and L-LSP
    can be established with bandwidth reservation. In this case bandwidth requirements
    for the LSP must be signaled at LSP establishment time, in order to perform admission
    control in the LSRs in the path. If RSVP-TE is used as setup protocol, it has
    to support the signaling of bandwidth requirements for the LSPs. In this document
    we extend the RSVP-TE capability by defining a new type of Sender_Tspec (and FlowSpec),
    explicitly designed to allow signaling of bandwidth requirements for E-LSP and
    L-LSP set up. This new type, called MPLS Sender_Tspec (MPLS FlowSpec), can include
    bandwidth requirements for different classes inside the LSP.</p>"
