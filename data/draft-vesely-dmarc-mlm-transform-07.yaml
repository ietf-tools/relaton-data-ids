abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
    and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header
    field as a workaround. This document proposes three methods to get rid of munged
    From: lines. The methods vary requirements, complexity and success rates. Method
    one considers how MLMs can avoid From: munging for specific users. Methods two
    uses the Author: header field while method three tries to revert MLM transformations,
    in order to restore the original From: line after reception.</p>"
