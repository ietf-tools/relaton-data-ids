abstract:
- content: "<p>Data source authentication is an important requirement to provide multicast
    security. Data source authentication assures that the member claiming to send
    the data is the actual sender. An imposter member should not be able to claim
    to be the sender of the data. This document proposes a scheme by which data source
    authentication can be acheived. This approach does not use digital signatures
    or assume any time synchronization between the sender and the receivers. Instead
    of directly authenticating a multicast communication, it is split into a 1-to-1
    authenticated unicast to GCKS followed by an authenticated multicast by GCKS.
    Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are used instead of digital signatures in
    both the authenticated unicast and the authenticated multicast.</p>"
