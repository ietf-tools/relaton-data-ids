abstract:
- content: "<p>The drafts [I-D.zzhang-dmm-5g-distributed-upf] and [I-D.zzhang-dmm-mup-evolution]
    have described the 5G mobile user plane (MUP) via the refinement of distributed
    UPFs and a more radical proposal by integrating gNB &amp; UPF as a single network
    function (NF). Some user plane implementation requirements that vendors and operators
    are exploring are not introducing changes to 3GPP architecture &amp; signaling,
    if possible. The document 3GPP TS 23.247 [_3GPP-23.247] for 5G multicast and broadcast
    services, or 5MBS, specifies the 5GS architecture to support MBS communication.
    Thanks to the addition of new 5GS network functions (NFs) and MB-interfaces on
    5G CP &amp; UP, specifically if coupled with the increasingly popular satellite-related
    requirements, these would certainly post additional provisioning &amp; implementation
    challenges to the underlay transport infrastructure. This document is not an attempt
    to do 3GPP SDO work in IETF. Instead, it discusses how to potentially integrate
    distributed UPFs with the delivery of 5MBS communication, as well as the benefits
    of using distributed UPFs to handle 5MBS traffic delivery.</p>"
