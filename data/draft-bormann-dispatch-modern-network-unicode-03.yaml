abstract:
- content: <p>BCP18 (RFC 2277) has been the basis for the handling of character- shaped
    data in IETF specifications for more than a quarter of a century now. It singles
    out UTF-8 (STD63, RFC 3629) as the "charset" that MUST be supported, and pulls
    in the Unicode standard with that. Based on this, RFC 5198 both defines common
    conventions for the use of Unicode in network protocols and caters for the specific
    requirements of the legacy protocol Telnet. In applications that do not need Telnet
    compatibility, some of the decisions of RFC 5198 can be cumbersome. The present
    specification defines "Modern Network Unicode" (MNU), which is a form of RFC 5198
    Network Unicode that can be used in specifications that require the exchange of
    plain text over networks and where just mandating UTF-8 may not be sufficient,
    but there is also no desire to import all of the baggage of RFC 5198. As characters
    are used in different environments, MNU is defined in a one-dimensional (1D) variant
    that is useful for identifiers and labels, but does not use a structure of lines.
    A 2D variant is defined for text that is a sequence of text lines, such as plain
    text documents or markdown format. Additional variances of these two base formats
    can be used to tailor MNU to specific areas of application.</p>
