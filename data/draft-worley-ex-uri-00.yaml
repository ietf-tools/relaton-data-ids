abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a number of response
    codes which a SIP agent can use to indicate that it cannot find a suitable destination
    to which to send a request. Unfortunately, this set of response codes was not
    carefully designed, making it difficult in many cases for a proxy to select a
    response code that accurately reflects the proxy's knowledge about the request
    URI. This document describes these response codes and their current usage.</p>"
