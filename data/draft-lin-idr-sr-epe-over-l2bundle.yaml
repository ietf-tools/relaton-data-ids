abstract:
- content: "<p>There are deployments where the Layer 3 interface on which a BGP peer
    session is established is a Layer 2 interface bundle. In order to allow BGP-EPE
    to control traffic flows on individual member links of the underlying Layer 2
    bundle, BGP Peering SIDs need to be allocated to individual bundle member links,
    and advertisement of such BGP Peering SIDs in BGP-LS is also required. This document
    describes how to support Segment Routing BGP Egress Peer Engineering over Layer
    2 bundle.</p>"
