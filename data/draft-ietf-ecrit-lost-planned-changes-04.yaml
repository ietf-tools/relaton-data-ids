abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a
    planned change to the data in the LoST server to occur. Records that previously
    were valid will become invalid at a date in the future, and new locations will
    become valid after the date. The extension adds two elements to the &lt;findservice&gt;
    request: A URI to be used to inform the LIS that previously valid locations will
    be invalid after the planned change date, and add a date which requests the server
    to perform validation as of the date specified. It also adds an optional Time-To-Live
    element to the response, which informs clients about the current expected lifetime
    of the validation. This document also provides a conventional XML schema for LoST,
    as backwards compatible alternative to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222</p>"
