- content: "<p>IP Mobility provides basic IP mobility for IP nodes. However, it does
    not provide any support for a Mobile Node which wishes to be the endpoint of its
    own tunnel. Without such support, it is extremely difficult to provide location
    privacy to a Mobile Node or Integrated Mobility support.</p>"
