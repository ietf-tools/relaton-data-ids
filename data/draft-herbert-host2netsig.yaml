    for Host to Network Signaling. In Host to Network Signaling, hosts annotate packets
    with information that is intended for consumption by on-path elements. Signals
    may be used to request services on a per packet basis from on-path elements, to
    request admission into the network, or to provide diagnostics and tracing information.</p>"
