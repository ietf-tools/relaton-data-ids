abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an attribute for attestation to the possession
    of a private key. As part of X.509 certificate enrollment, a Certification Authority
    (CA) typically demands proof that the subject has possession of the private key
    that corresponds to the to-be-certified public key. In some cases, CAs might accept
    an attestation from the subject. For example, when a subject needs separate certificates
    for a signature and key establishment, an attestation that can be validated with
    the previously issued signature certificate might be adequate for subsequent issuance
    of the key establishment certificate.</p>"
