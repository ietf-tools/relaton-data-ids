abstract:
- content: "<p>The year-2000 problem (Y2K problem) is of increasing interest. Little
    has been said about the relationship of Y2K to synchronous groupware. We describe
    a matrix model of selective dissemination of information to viewers of that information.
    The model is suitable for some forms of synchronous groupware.</p>"
