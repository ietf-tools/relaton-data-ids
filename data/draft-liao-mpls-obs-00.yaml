abstract:
- content: "<p>Protection and restoration at optical layer is critical to network
    integrity since data is transmitted and switched at a considerably high speed
    in optical domain. A few second halt may cause tens to thousands gigabit loss.
    Optical burst switching is a promising technology, bridging optical circuit switching
    and optical package switching. Unlike optical circuit switching and time division
    multiplexing, OBS is featured with unidirectional reservation and statistical
    multiplexing of wavelength resources. The general idea behind protection and restoration
    techniques is to utilize redundant bandwidth resources as backup. The flexibility
    brought by OBS provides alternatives for existed protection and restoration schemes
    at optical layer.</p>"
