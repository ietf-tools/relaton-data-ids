- content: "<p>For access network operators, accounting information are crucial: they
    provide information for billing and give an overview of the traffic usage. This
    document defines the requirements for accounting information needed on Softwires.1.
    Motivation The Softwires WG is working on a solution to bring IPvX connectivity
    over an IPvY network [RFC4925]. This solution may be deployed and managed by access
    network operators to provide for example IPvX continuity of service. Operators
    should then consider the Softwires solution as an extension of their access network
    service. For operators, AAA [RFC2865] is the key feature for access network deployment:
    Authentication verifies user credentials, Authorization ensures access network
    integrity and Accounting provides information for billing and network management.
    Information from accounting usually includes measurements of in and out octets
    and packets [RFC2867]. As an alternative access network, the Softwires solution
    should provide similar AAA features. For instance accounting on the softwire should
    gives to the operator measurements of the traffic generated by the user using
    this access network. In a dual stack (IPvX and IPvY) network, the operator may
    want to manage information about the comparative usage of both protocols, for
    example for billing purpose. When the softwire is used to access IPvX over IPvY,
    accounting information will be specific to IPvX. Operators should be able to differentiate
    for which version of IP such information are relevant. This differentiation may
    become important if such operators offer a softwire solution for both IPvX over
    IPvY and IPvY over IPvX access networks.2. Study case In this section is given
    an example of IPv6 access over IPv4 network which is similar to the Hub-and-Spokes
    problem stated in the Softwires WG ([RFC4925]). The Point6box architecture uses
    L2TP [RFC2661] and PPP for IPv6 tunneling over IPv4 (see Figure 1). Radius manages
    AAA parameters for the access network created by the tunnel. On the server side,
    PPP sends to RADIUS accounting information measuring the traffic generated by
    the customer. /---------------------------\\ CPEv6 | +--------------+ | DHCPv6

    Problem statement The accounting information defined for tunnels [RFC2867] includes
    attributes Acct-{Input,Output}-Octets and Acct-{Input,Output}-Packets for traffic
    measurements. These attributes do not depend of the version of IP used by the
    monitored traffic. Operators may not be able to differenciate IPv4 from IPv6 traffic
    in their accounting statistics. This non-differentiation even leads to mis-usages:
    In the current PPP implementation from BSD, the values of these attributes are
    only based on IPv4 statistics collected from IPCP protocol. No statistics are
    collected for IPv6 from IPV6CP. This proposal should decide which attributes may
    be candidate for IP- version differentiation. In operating system MIBs, values
    for in/out octets on a network interface are independent of the IP version. Having
    such values for each version may be usefull for monitoring and billing purpose.
    However the differentiation is done for in/out IPv4 and IPv6 packets on a network
    interface. Operators can extract from these values some hints about the usage
    of each version of the IP protocol but can not give quantitative report of bandwidth
    usage.</p>"
