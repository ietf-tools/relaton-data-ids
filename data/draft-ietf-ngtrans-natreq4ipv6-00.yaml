abstract:
- content: "<p>During the next few years, as the Ipv4 address space moves toward exhaustion,
    it is likely that the deployment of NAT will accelerate. By 2005, millions of
    NAT devices will likely be deployed on the Internet, both within enterprises and
    consumer households. Should those NAT devices not support either native Ipv6,
    or IPv6 transition mechanisms such as 6 to 4, the result would be significant
    delays in the deployment of IPv6.</p>"
