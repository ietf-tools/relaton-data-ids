abstract:
- content: "<p>In AI networks, flow characteristics often exhibit a low number of
    flows but with high bandwidth per flow, making it easy to cause network congestion
    when using traditional flow-level load balancing methods. Currently, the direction
    of traffic scheduling focuses on load sharing individual packets of the same flow,
    which requires sorting based on the Tunnel Egress Point information from the remote
    end. This document describes the method of publishing Tunnel Egress Point through
    the BGP protocol.</p>"
