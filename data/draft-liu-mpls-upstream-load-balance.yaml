abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for Load-Balancing among a set
    of candidate upstream LSRs on a LAN interface. When there are several candidates
    to be selected as an upstream LSR, according the current upstream label allocation
    methods, the load on the candidate upstream LSR which is selected by the routing
    protocol may be very heavy, while the load on other candidate upstream LSRs is
    little. The Load- Balancing also provides some procedures to minimize the packet
    loss in following cases: 1) adding/removing a candidate upstream LSR; 2) a better
    path emerging.</p>"
