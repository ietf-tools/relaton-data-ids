abstract:
- content: "<p>The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based
    access networks. However, in roaming environments, IP clients might change of
    gateways and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur. The present document
    describes a solution based on the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) to enhance
    IP handover in mobile environments. Note that only the intra-domain case is considered.
    This protocol can recover the previously established PANA security context from
    previous PANA Authentication Agent.</p>"
