abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use
    an MPLS enabled IPv4 backbone to provide Virtual Private Networks for its IPv6
    customers. This proposal makes use of the method to build network based VPNs described
    in the Internet draft 'BGP/MPLS VPN' [2547bis]. In BGP/MPLS VPN, MPLS is used
    to forward packets over the backbone, and 'Multiprotocol BGP' is used for distributing
    VPN routes over the service provider backbone. This document defines an IPv6 VPN
    address family and describes the route distribution and the MPLS tunnel selection.</p>"
