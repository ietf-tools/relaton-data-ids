abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a YANG data model for traffic steering policies
    in Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios. The policy model is a specific data
    model for traffic steering using VPN technology. It helps the service management
    in Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to model the policy (a set of
    constraints and rules) that defines how a VPN service is monitored and managed
    during its lifecycle. Two traffic steering applications have been provided such
    as traffic optimization with pass or bypass specific nodes or sites.</p>"
