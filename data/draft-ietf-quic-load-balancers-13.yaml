abstract:
- content: <p>QUIC address migration allows clients to change their IP address while
    maintaining connection state. To reduce the ability of an observer to link two
    IP addresses, clients and servers use new connection IDs when they communicate
    via different client addresses. This poses a problem for traditional "layer-4"
    load balancers that route packets via the IP address and port 4-tuple. This specification
    provides a standardized means of securely encoding routing information in the
    server's connection IDs so that a properly configured load balancer can route
    packets with migrated addresses correctly. As it proposes a structured connection
    ID format, it also provides a means of connection IDs self-encoding their length
    to aid some hardware offloads.</p>
