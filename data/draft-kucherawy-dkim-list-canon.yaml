abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) introduced a mechanism whereby a
    mail operator can affix a signature to a message that validates at the level of
    the signer's domain name. It specified two possible ways of converting the message
    body to a canonical form, one intolerant of changes and the other tolerant of
    simple changes to whitespace within the message body. The provided canonicalization
    schemes do not tolerate changes in a structured message such as conversion between
    transfer encodings or addition of new message parts. It is useful to have these
    capabilities to allow for transport through gateways, and also for transport through
    handlers (such as mailing list services) that might add content that would invalidate
    a signature generated using the existing canonicalization schemes. This document
    presents a mechanism for generating a canonicalization that can allows easy detection
    of modified content while still being valid for the content it originally signed.
    It also presents a use profile of DKIM that takes advantage of this capability.</p>"
