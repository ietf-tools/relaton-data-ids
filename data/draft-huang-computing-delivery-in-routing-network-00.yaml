abstract:
- content: "<p>This document drafts a proposal of Computing Delivery in Routing Network
    which incorporates both computing and networking metrics into the routing polices
    and enables the network sensing and scheduling computing services based upon traditional
    networking services. A mechanism of two-class computing power granularity and
    two segment forwarding is illustrated for end-to-end networking and computing
    service in the cloud sites, while major networking and computing actors is defined
    in terms of functionality. An example work flow is demonstrated, and both control
    plane and data plane solution consideration is proposed.</p>"
