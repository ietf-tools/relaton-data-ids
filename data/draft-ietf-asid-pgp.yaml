abstract:
- content: "<p>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) as definied by [1] is a high security cryptographic
    software application for MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS, MacOS and other operating systems.
    There is a need to store public PGPkeys in the X.500 [2,3] Directory as a means
    to ease the publication of public keys, and thereby the use of PGP as a cryptographic
    system. This document builds on the experimentation to date and defines four new
    attribute types and an auxiliary object class to allow PGP keys to be included
    in X.500 Directory entries in a standard way. It is intended that the schema elements
    defined in this document will be progressed according to the process defined by
    the Internet X.500 Schema Working Group [4].</p>"
