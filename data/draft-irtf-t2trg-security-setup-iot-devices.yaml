- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of terms that are commonly used
    when discussing the initial security setup of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
    This document also presents a brief but illustrative survey of protocols and standards
    available for initial security setup of IoT devices. For each protocol, we identify
    the terminology used, the entities involved, the initial assumptions, the processes
    necessary for completion, and the knowledge imparted to the IoT devices after
    the setup is complete.</p>"
