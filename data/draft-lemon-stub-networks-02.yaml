abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub networks
    to adjacent infrastructure networks, as well as to larger network fabrics. This
    is applicable in cases such as constrained (Internet of Things) networks where
    there is a need to provide functional parity of service discovery and reachability
    between devices on the stub network and devices on an adjacent infrastructure
    link (for example, a home network). The stub networks use case is intended to
    fully address the need to attach a single network link to an infrastructure network,
    where the attached link provides no through routing and in cases where integration
    to the infrastructure routing fabric (if any) is not available.</p>"
