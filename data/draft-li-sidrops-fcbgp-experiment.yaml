abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-BGP) enables the establishment of a secure
    inter-domain routing system by providing security for the path of Autonomous Systems
    (ASs) through which a BGP UPDATE message passes. In an effort to enhance the validation
    of FC-BGP, a prototype implementation of the FC-BGP was developed and an evaluation
    was conducted on the FITI high-performance IPv6 backbone network. This document
    reports on the prototype implementation and the results of the evaluation.</p>"
