abstract:
  content: "<p>Transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated in IPv6 is a common solution
    to the problem of IPv4 service continuity over IPv6-only provider networks. A
    number of differing functional approaches have been developed for this, each having
    their own specific characteristics. As these approaches share a similar functional
    architecture and use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo describes a specification
    whereby a single CPE can interwork with all of the standardized and proposed approaches
    to providing encapsulated IPv4 in IPv6 services.</p>"
