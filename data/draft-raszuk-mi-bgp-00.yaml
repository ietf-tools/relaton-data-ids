abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number of operational use cases of BGP grows there is demand
    to increase the level of separation and processing independence between various
    address families carried by BGP today. This document augments base BGP specification
    in allowing local configuration of BGP port number by the operator to run parallel
    fully disjoined BGP instances allowing full processing separation between them.
    While local BGP implementation may already assure BGP process or thread robustnes
    the general aim here is to allow similar level of groups of BGP address families
    independence when running BGP code on general purpose hardware as well as x86
    based route reflectors.</p>"
