abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Hierarchical Paging
    (HMIPv6HP), an IP host alerting protocol which is a link-layer independent extension
    to Hierarchical Mobile IPv6. The extension allows a mobile node to enter a power
    saving dormant mode during which its location is known with coarse accuracy defined
    by a paging area. In the visited domain only the paging mobility anchor point
    (PMAP) is responsible for keeping the binding cache entries for dormant mobile
    nodes and, it re-establishes the downlink routes on demand by means of paging.
    Paging is initiated by the paging agent (PA) and the access routers in paging
    areas and does not involve periodic layer 3 messages to be sent except for time-slot
    based paging which is optional and is to be used on links with no support for
    layer 2 paging.</p>"
