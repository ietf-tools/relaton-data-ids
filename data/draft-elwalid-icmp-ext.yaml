abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we define two new ICMP message types. These new types
    of ICMP messages can be used as probe packets to support a variety of measurement
    applications. This draft gives detailed definition and format of these two new
    ICMP message types. It is in full conformance with the original RFC on ICMP [1],
    and complements the work of the IPPM working group [6][7][8]. The extension of
    ICMP for one-way traffic measurement is also useful for traffic engineering.</p>"
