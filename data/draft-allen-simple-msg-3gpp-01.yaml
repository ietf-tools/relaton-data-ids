abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is using SIP RFC 3261
    [1] as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia Core Network
    Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem, IMS). 3GPP has recently started working on messaging
    over the IM CN Subsystem. It is intended that this will utilize the IM CN Subsystem
    for delivery and may be based on IETF protocols including the work being performed
    in the SIMPLE working group. In this document is provided an outline and areas
    of interest of the 3GPP work on IMS messaging for the information of the SIMPLE
    working group.</p>"
