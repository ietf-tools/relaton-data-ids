abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft discusses a adaptation modules for backhauling
    signaling protocols (SS7, ISDN and DPNSS) over packet networks. The adaptation
    modules are part of the framework referred to as signaling 'backhaul'. These adaptation
    modules would be used for signaling backhaul between a Signaling Gateway (SG),
    which interfaces between the circuit world (PSTN) and the packet world (IP/ATM),
    and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC), which provides call processing.</p>"
