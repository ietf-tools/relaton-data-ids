abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. These
    headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user agents, letting
    the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.
    The cookie protocol has many historical infelicities and should be avoided for
    new applications of HTTP. NOTE: If you have suggestions for improving the draft,
    please send email to http-state@ietf.org. Suggestions with test cases are especially
    appreciated.</p>"
