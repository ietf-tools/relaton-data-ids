abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is no longer a creature of the United States, much less
    of DARPA (the US Defence Advance Research Projects Agency). It is now an international
    network, and the ability to communicate in any of the world languages on an equal
    footing is an imperative. This draft attempts to track the development of ISO
    10646, a moving target at this writing. The reference citation below is to the
    2nd 10646 draft, for which balloting has just concluded. (June 1992). It is therefore
    expected that this memo will potentially change until the publication of IS 10646.
    Some of the following text refers to 10646 in the present tense, as if it is IS
    now; it should be understood in this context.</p>"
