abstract:
- content: <p>Despite growing adoption of TLS [RFC5246], a significant fraction of
    TCP traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted. The persistence of unencrypted
    traffic can be attributed to at least two factors. First, some legacy protocols
    lack a signaling mechanism (such as a "STARTTLS" command) by which to convey support
    for encryption, making incremental deployment impossible. Second, legacy applications
    themselves cannot always be upgraded, requiring a way to implement encryption
    transparently entirely within the transport layer. The TCP Encryption Negotiation
    Option (TCP-ENO) addresses both of these problems through a new TCP option kind
    providing out-of-band, fully backward-compatible negotiation of encryption.</p>
