abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet Draft that
    was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is being published now
    for the historical record and to provide a reference for later RFCs. The original
    Abstract follows. There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier
    for the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained across Proxies,
    B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of Troubleshooting. This draft
    proposes a new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.</p>"
