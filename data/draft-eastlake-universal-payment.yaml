abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is becoming an increasingly commercial arena in which
    payments are rendered for goods, information, and services. To support such commerce,
    various incompatible Internet payment protocols have been proposed or adopted
    by a variety of organizations. There appears to be little prospect of merger of
    all or abandonment of most of these protocols. A header syntax, the Universal
    Payment Preamble (UPP), is presented for parties to negotiate payment alternatives
    at any point in shopping, until a final hand-off to a particular chosen payment
    system. The chosen payment system, not UPP, is responsible for the security of
    any actual transmission of funds.</p>"
