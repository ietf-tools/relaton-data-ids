abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates the treatment of the special-use domain name "localhost"
    as specified in RFC6761, Section 6.3, with the goal of ensuring that it can be
    safely relied upon as a name for the local host's loopback interface. To that
    end, stub resolvers are required to resolve localhost names to loopback addresses.
    Recursive DNS servers are required to return "NXDOMAIN" when queried for localhost
    names, making non-conformant stub resolvers more likely to fail and produce problem
    reports that result in updates. Together, these requirements would allow applications
    and specifications to join regular users in drawing the common-sense conclusions
    that "localhost" means "localhost", and doesn't resolve to somewhere else on the
    network.</p>
