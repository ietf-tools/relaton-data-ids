    how Networks are evolving from Wireless Networks and Programming. This draft describes
    how Big Data bottlenecks are present in current Networks. This draft describes
    Network and Cloud Orchestrated Reflectors for resolving the Big Data bottleneck
    at Inter-AS and CSC (Carrier Supporting Carrier) level. This draft proposes a
    Context Mapping Language for E2E context-awareness and M2M communication. This
    draft proposes Path diversity in Wired Networks as it evolves from Wireless Networks.
    Path diversity through Cloud Orchestrated Reflectors can be implemented through
    the Wireless concepts of Rx Diversity, Tx Diversity and MIMO (Multi-Input, Multi-Output)
    This draft is more of a fundamental concept that identifies how the Network is
    evolving. This draft explains about the implicit life cycle, which is also somewhat
    mathematical as it involves one-to-many and many-to-one function mapping between
    Cloud and Network reflectors. Then it relates the many cloud reflectors together
    throug Wireless network technologies like Tx, Rx diversity and MIMO. This draft
    explains how this can be implemented in Wired networks through Cloud software,
    path diversity, spatial multiplexing and Diversity precoding. Introduction This
    draft: 1.Identifies the Big data, Digital Data bottleneck in present Network.
    2.Identifies that Networks are evolving from Wireless Networks as well as Programming.
    3. Provides a resolution to the Data bottleneck problem by evolving the present
    Wired Networks and Cloud architectures to incorporate features from Wireless networks
    and Programming. This draft begins at a very basic level where it identifies the
    problem in the M2M communication. John Backus (Inventor of FORTRAN or Formula
    Translation) describes the Von Neumann bottleneck as an Intellectual bottleneck.
    This Intellectual bottleneck also affects the TCP-IP model or the Networking layers.
    There is a static nature to the TCP-IP model. If an AI approach is chosen to understand
    the TCP-IP layers the problem in M2M communication can be further classified.
    The problem is that there is a duality between the state machine and the program
    control. However, the state machine is like a point value or a basic computational
    element. This point value links the state machine to Wireless Networks through
    Mass-Energy equivalence. Thus the state machine comes first and then the Program
    control. From the AI based TCP-IP model and analysis of digital data it can be
    seen that this duality is centred between the Internet and the Transport layers.
    The Digital Data or Big Data is the central point around which we are building
    a network architecture, therefore a design model somewhat different from SDN or
    TCP-IP can be arrived at. This is described through the diagrams in this draft:
    1. Implicit Lifecycle with Big Data in Centralised Control plane and Distributed
    forwarding 2. Implicit Lifecycle between Network, Cloud and the Internet (aka
    Network of Networks). Impact on EPN (Evolved Programmable Networks): Having arrived
    at these models we can understand how the Network is not just evolving from Programming
    but is evolving from the M2M bottleneck or M2M duality. This duality has Digital
    data or Big data as the central point. This digital data can be considered as
    an infinitesimal mass value or a finite state element. Considering the implicit
    lifecycle and the mass-energy equivalence we can arrive at the conclusion that
    Networks are also evolving firstly from Wireless Networks and then from Programming.
    As the Network is evolving from both Wireless Networking as well as Software Programming
    we can thus find out more about the inter-working of the Cloud (more of a software
    based and Wireless concept) and the Network (Hardware based and both a Wired,
    Wireless concept). The digital or Big data is the central connecting point so
    it cannot be declassified from both the Cloud and the Network. Based on this analysis
    it can be seen that the Big Data bottleneck occurs at the Inter-AS and CSC(Carrier
    supporting Carrier) level. A Network grows as we add more physical hosts. A Network
    will keep growing and scaling. Thus we can predict from Wireless Network architecture
    and Programming how the present Network needs to evolve (grow and scale) to merge
    with the Cloud Architecture. Through new features described in my draft such as
    Cloud Orchestrated Reflectors, Network Orchestrated Reflectors, Context Mapping,
    Path diversity (as evolved from Wireless concepts such as Tx Diversity, Rx diversity
    and MIMO) the Big data or Digital data bottleneck problem in present Networks
    can be resolved. Description: The goal is to build a Seamless cloud infrastructure
    which allows any CE to be seamlessly connected to the Internet (or SP). The Infrastructure
    would combine high speed core (data center) architecture with the Service provider
    and also to the end user. The Seamless cloud does not have the drawbacks of the
    hybrid cloud division that breaks down the Cloud into a public and a private cloud
    infrastructure. The Seamless Cloud infrastructure can provide an alternate way
    of building the CSC (Carrier Supporting Carrier) framework which is the present
    SP backbone design. A Distributed Intelligence system is more suited for the hierarchical
    layered system that defines the Network. A centralized control plane for the entire
    network may have vulnerabilities and also greatly increases the complexity. A
    distributed system is more practical considering the Routing/Switching infrastructure
    and Network layers that we have. From an AI perspective this would be a bottoms-up
    approach rather than a top-down approach. Please see below diagram of the TCP/IP
    model from this AI perspective.It is important to understand that the AI in a
    Network or a Cloud is centered around the Internet and Transport Layer while still
    needing a Top-down approach from the Application layer and a bottoms-up approach
    from the Link layer. The Cisco proprietary parameter appropriately named as "weight"
    in the BGP protocol is suggestive of the fact that the Intelligence in a Network
    needs to be centered around the Network and Transport Layers. Also the term "Weighted"
    appears in QoS as "Weighted Fair Queueing". TCP/IP Layers from an AI/IoT perspective

    AI based FSM with IntelligentFlow in contrast to OpenFlow needs to be developed
    to build an AI based Network Infrastructure. This FSM can form a sort of Shadow
    Router that tracks and defines the Network from a bottoms-up approach. The underlying
    hardware approach can assist in fast switching the data as in Shortest path bridging.
    Basically TCP is stateful, IP is stateless and BGP is stateful. IntelligentFlow:
    Scaling the Data Flow If an AI based FSM can somehow be sandboxed and moved between
    devices (or hosts) then IntelligentFlow may be possible with the bottoms up and
    top down AI approach. From a programming point of view, a combination of high
    level and low level programming is needed by which we can Sandbox the AI based
    FSM between hosts. This calls for introducing an IntelligentStack as opposed to
    an Openstack within the data flow of the AI Based TCP/IP model. This IntelligentStack
    could work in tangent with the Elastic Compute Cloud of Openstack by providing
    more traction over the Internet. The AI based FSM Sandbox can optimize the traffic
    flows by acting as Intermediary in the Data flow model. The Sandbox can scale
    up or reverse-scale the flows. This could solve the BGP slow convergence and divergence
    problems. AI is like the logic behind a thought process. A Combinatorial logic
    is needed to combine the low level and high level languages. This combination
    can develop into a very basic type of M2M Intelligence which is essential for
    IoT. From a high level programming perspective, the data type is a program construct
    and the control flow is a type of program execution (in a Machine). From a low
    level perspective, the AI based FSM can do the reverse which is to program the
    data flow by sending the control plane information(to a Machine). In other words,
    there is a duality in the M2M architecture through the State Machine and the Program
    Control. This maybe the only way to tackle the Von Neumann Bottleneck: The Von
    Neumann bottleneck was described by John Backus in his 1977 ACM Turing Award lecture.
    According to Backus: Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes
    in the store than by pushing vast numbers of words back and forth through the
    von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data
    traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck
    that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to
    think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming
    is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the
    Von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data
    itself, but where to find it.[22][23] This is contrast to the duality in the Cloud
    that is implied in the Intercloud Architecture. Hence according to me the Seamless
    Cloud can incorporate the M2M architecture via the Network that cannot be declassified
    from the Cloud. The Combinatorial logic behind the above categorization of a Machine
    (M2M) is that the binary or digital data is not completely defined and can be
    divided into low level machine learning based data (letters or numbers presented
    to Machine for reading) and high level Top down AI based data (checks inputs of
    letters or numbers against a description). The binary data gets more well defined
    (turing complete?) when put into a finite state machine. When binary data is put
    into a state machine it adds value and thus weight into the machine. This is where
    BGP, TCP, IP protocols come into the picture through the weight parameter and
    the CBWFQ in QoS. This is where we need to find the data based on the Von Neumann
    bottleneck. If this M2M Intelligence can be developed Robots can identify Objects
    and take actions through Proximity Sensors. Robots can focus on near Objects,
    identify them and take actions. A great boost for IoT. From a bio-technology perspective
    the network is akin to a nervous system controlled by a centralized Neural network.
    However, both distributed and centralized intelligence may be required considering
    the hierarchical distributed layers in the legacy network data flow model where
    both a bottoms-up and top-down AI model is required. Neural networks have a concept
    called Convergence and Divergence. In Networking the focus is mostly on convergence
    through routing protocols. However, a divergent approach is also needed in order
    to meet the AI/IoT based TCP/IP model requirement. As described above I have defined
    an AI Based TCP-IP model. Through that model I explained the significance of the
    "weight" parameter. This allows us to define an Intelligent Automation for Autonomous
    system through Cloud and Network orchestration. There can be alternate ways of
    approaching Inter-AS and CSC. The weight parameter is localized in an AS. With
    this being introduced in Segment routing it allows dynamic scaling of such parameters.
    Thus an AS can grow or shrink. Or a Private AS can be dynamically generated. A
    public AS can scale, grow or shrink. In essence this means adding more value and
    functions into AS numbers through algorithms which can dynamically alter the Autonomous
    systems without impacting the network in any way. Autonomous systems could be
    further classified into Temporary and Permanent Autonomous Systems. This could
    serve as the mapping between Cloud and network resources because the network cannot
    be declassified from the cloud. This mapping can form an interface between Network
    computing and Cloud computing. This is rather like finding a number within a number.
    This algorithm could involve randomly changing numbers. Making numbers big or
    small. However, one-to-many is not the same as many-to-one. Quantum computing
    with Qubits and Shor Algorithm could implement such an algorithm. The efficiency
    of Shor''s algorithm is due to the efficiency of the quantum Fourier transform,
    and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings. These concepts of an Automated
    AS can be of significance in the IoT scenario where IoT devices can pe present
    anywhere and everywhere. IoT technologies like Smart Grid, Smart Transportation,Smart
    Cities require a more robust and intelligent M2M communication. This is rather
    oddly somewhat like APIPA in Windows but now at the Autonomous System level. The
    M2M interface between Cloud and Network can be further defined based on the concept
    of finding a number within a number. There is an element of time in-variance in
    the network while there is an element of time variance in the Cloud. This means
    that the network convergence system needs to act as a Network Orchestrated Reflector
    based on the ASN (Autonomous System number) while the Cloud needs to act as Cloud
    Orchestrated Reflector based on the Cloud platform ASN (Autonomous System number).
    This defines the interface between the two which in turn defines the mapping between
    Cloud and Network. Thus Fast Computing in the Cloud compensates for the slow computation
    in the Network. The Network orchestrated reflector and Cloud orchestrated reflector
    defined above are similar to the Route reflector but include ASN and other relevant
    features. The loop or life cycle between the Network and Cloud reflectors can
    be closed through the Segment routing and "weight" parameter There may not really
    be a need for Quantum computing as of now to implement these concepts. There is
    an Implicit Life cycle and need for Seamless Cloud Infrastructure as indicated
    by the diagrams below: Diagram 1: Implicit Life cycle (time bound) as the Network
    cannot be declassified from the Cloud (one way) |-----&gt; Internet -----&gt;

    for TCP-IP: 1. Big Data analysis in terms of Artificial Intelligence, Digital
    footprint, Programming and Quality. Not only in terms of Volume 2. Big Data is
    the central intelligence that sits between the control plane and the forwarding
    plane. 3. Big Data can be considered as a centralized intelligence around which
    we are trying to put our concepts together. Big data is centered around IP, BGP
    and TCP. 4. Big Data in terms of volume (content) drags us down to the link layer.
    Concepts such as MPLS, switching take us away from Big Data. 5. Big Data is both
    a centralized intelligence and a bottleneck. A Distributed intelligence approach
    is also thus mandated. 6. Intelligent automation in the Cloud through Big Data
    (Hadoop, MapReduce) needs to interface with the Network at the Internet and Transport
    layers. What is the proof for Scale and manageability of these concepts ? Big
    Data is centered around TCP, IP and BGP layers. This is the forwarding path information
    in IGP via IBGP as well as EBGP. The interconnect between EBGP and IBGP is through
    Autonomous s ystems (ASN). The slow convergence problem is in BGP and in IBGP.
    This convergence issue is uncorrelated and exponential. However, this affects
    EBGP scenarios and overall Internet stability and scalability. This scale problem
    can only be solved by options which take into consideration path diversity and
    matching for LPM (Longest Prefix Match) between Autonomous systems. The number
    of unique Autonomous networks has grown to 47000 in mid-2014. Inter-AS options
    and CSC are big data bottlenecks. The present Inter-AS options consider solutions
    such as inter-VRF, ASBR with MP-BGP,etc. As these consider the routes and prefixes,
    they do not really solve the scale problem. Thus we need to look for alternate
    ways to approach this problem. Manipulating AS numbers, Cloud and network orchestrated
    Reflectors, HRR is required. Segment routing with parameters (eg: weight introduced
    into Segment routing) which can manipulate BGP AS path, communities are thus required.
    I use the word Cloud orchestrated Reflectors and Network orchestrated Reflectors
    as the problem needs to be abstracted from the Internet Architecture in order
    to avoid manageability issues in the present and in the future. Based on the diagram
    involving the Cloud, Internet and Network which is an implicit life cycle I believe
    that this is the only option to scale the Internet in the future. This is taking
    into consideration the limitations right now in BGP convergence, Inter-AS and
    Cloud computing. As this is a limitation issue even if the manageability is not
    feasible as of now it would still have to be considered in the future. The implicit
    life cycle proves that the Internet needs to be changed at the core as well and
    not just at the edges. Cloud orchestrated reflectors are also important as the
    Internet continues to scale with the Cloud and SDN. Big data as defined in Hadoop
    through MapReduce suggests that the interface between Cloud and Network is also
    important. New BGP AF/SAF options do not really solve this scalability problem:
    IP6 IP-VPN BGP Flow Specification Pseudo Wires L2VPN 2547 Multicast VPNs The scalability
    problem needs to be solved taking into consideration the fact that the network
    cannot be declassified from the Cloud. Hence The IP Packet need to be classified
    through a new AF/SAF which could likely involve BGP, ASN, segment routing and
    path diversity, etc. Alternate ways to approach inter-AS is needed as the traditional
    methods are traffic (big data) bottlenecks. This draft proposes the following:
    Cloud and Network Orchestrated Reflectors to route the Multi-service, multi-tenant
    data between Cloud and Network. Limitations of the Cloud and Network can only
    be resolved through: 1. IP Packet 2. Segment routing (weight parameter, load balancing,
    distributed computing, QoS, etc) 3. New AS numbers (having Cloud and Network orchestrated
    reflectors in a reserved, private or a public AS) 4. Cloud and Network orchestrated
    Reflectors 5. New BGP AF/SAF having Segment routing 6. New Inter-AS options considering
    Segment Routing, distributed intelligence, Path diversity, LPM (longest prefix
    match) Benefits: 1. Inter-AS options are based on inter-VRF, MPLS VPN and ASBRs
    which re-distribute routes. Re-distributing repeats the routes. Segment routing
    with RR is a better option. MPLS takes the Big data away from Internet layer and
    towards Link layer. 2. Segment routing needs to focus on Big Data, routing for
    Path diversity, LPM (Longest prefix match), QoS and Multi-service Mutli-tenant
    offerings. 3. The benefits with Segment routing are that it can avoid redistribution
    and rely on path diversity, distributed intelligence, distributed computing, etc
    through the interworking of Cloud and Network. 4. Benefits for Multi-service Multi-tenancy
    is greater scale, redundancy, distributed computing, distributed intelligence,
    Improved exchange and transit points for Services. These benefits outweigh the
    present Inter-AS options which are a big data bottleneck. Context Maps in BGP,
    Segment Routing and SDN Controllers. The traditional route maps in BGP can match
    for routes, BGP PA, communities. However for distributed intelligence and SDN
    Controllers the Service providers need to be more context-aware. Segment routing
    can act as a Centralized Controller in the SDN framework. However BGP, Segment
    routing does not support or cannot differentiate between different contexts (virtual,
    cloud, network) or services such as Network services , Web services (WSDL), Cloud
    services(REST API). A context map can map and act as an interface between the
    Cloud services, Network services and Web services. The concept of Path diversity
    is analogous to the concept of Transmit diversity and Receiver diversity in Wireless
    networks. The concept of Cloud reflectors is thus analogous to the concept of
    reflection in Wireless networks. Therefore it should be theoretically possible
    to implement features like MIMO (Multi-input Multi-output) and Tx, Rx diversity
    in Wired networks through COR and context mapping. MIMO concepts such as Spatial
    Multiplexing and Diversity Precoding can be implemented through Cloud Orchestrated
    Reflectors. This would also indirectly resolve the problem of sub-optimal routing
    that occurs through Route reflectors. Context maps or Context Mapping Language
    (CML) are the next evolutionary step in Cloud-fog-Computing: Route map-&gt; Policy
    map -&gt; Context map RPL --&gt; CML This mapping between Cloud and Network is
    rather like an M2M interface therefore the Context Maps or CML needs to be in
    both BGP as well as in the SDN Controller or Cloud. ODL learns the Customer network
    through the NOR and transfers the topology to the COR transparently. COR is just
    a contextual representation of the NOR. There is a one-to-many mapping between
    NOR and COR. For one NOR or ODL we can have multiple COR. This is the most efficient
    way of Cloud and Network inter-working. Context maps can give us E2E context awareness
    for Smart cities, Smart grid, etc. Diagram 4: Cloud and Network Orchestrated Reflectors

    | |--- COR Security From a Security perspective the AI based bottoms-up/Top-down
    approach can help develop an Internet Map or a Cloud Map from this Seamless Cloud
    which can be further developed to form an Intelligent Secure network which is
    a Security-aware, Zone-aware Seamless Cloud. The Seamless cloud can dynamically
    identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities. Personalized Secure clouds can
    become a reality. Security boundaries and perimeters for the Cloud can be more
    clearly identified. A Distributed Intelligence system is more suited for the hierarchical
    layered system that defines a Network. A centralized control plane for the entire
    network may have vulnerabilities and also greatly increases the complexity. A
    distributed system is more practical considering the Routing/Switching infrastructure
    and Network layers that we have. From an AI perspective my draft would be a bottoms-up
    approach rather than a top-down approach. The Network needs to grow (and scale)
    towards the Cloud and not just the other way round.</p>'
