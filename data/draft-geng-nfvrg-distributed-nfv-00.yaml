abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the distributed NFV (D-NFV) concept based
    on potential implementation in scattered locations including customer edge devices
    and transport network equipments. The motivation of pushing NFV entities from
    conventional centralized infrastructures to distributed promises is discussed,
    which are driven by the requirements of high flexibility, low end-to-end latency
    and faster time-to-market in future network. To better understand the D-NFV concept,
    examples of D-NFV implementation is introduced. Potential use cases are also described
    as references for readers. Gaps have also been recognized in the documents in
    terms of the investigation of appropriate virtualization technologies used in
    the D-NFV and corresponding management and orchestration challenges.</p>"
