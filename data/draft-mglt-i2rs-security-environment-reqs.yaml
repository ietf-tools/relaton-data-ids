abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS
    architecture. Environment security requirements are independent of the protocol
    used for I2RS. As a result, the requirements provided in this document are intended
    to provide good security practise so I2RS can be securely deployed and operated.
    These security requirements are designated as environment security requirements
    as opposed to the protocol security requirements described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].
    The reason to have separate document is that protocol security requirements are
    intended to help the design of the I2RS protocol whether the environment requirements
    are rather intended for deployment or implementations.</p>"
