abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Access Identifier can be added to a Mobile IP Registration
    Request to identify a user and allow for the assignment of a dynamic home address.
    However, users may want to open several simultaneous sessions using the same NAI
    from the same or different devices and obtain a unique IP address for each session.
    The Mobile IP Binding Identifier Extension defined in this draft can be used to
    distinguish registration requests belonging to these various sessions.</p>"
