abstract:
- content: "<p>As well as the Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv4 (ICMPv4),
    the Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) is significant for network
    diagnostics and error reporting. However, like ICMPv4, ICMPv6 is also vulnerable
    to off-path forgery, making it difficult for the receiver to verify the legitimacy
    of a received ICMPv6 error message, particularly when the message contains stateless
    protocol data (e.g., the message includes a UDP/ICMPv6 packet). Consequently,
    adversaries on the Internet can forge ICMPv6 error messages carrying stateless
    protocol data, leading the receiver to erroneously accept the forged message and
    respond to it. This document proposes enhancement to ICMPv6 by introducing a challenge-
    confirm mechanism that leverages random numbers embedded in the IPv6 Extension
    Headers. The enhancement aims to strengthen the authentication of ICMPv6 error
    messages, thereby mitigating the risks associated with forged messages and improving
    the overall robustness of the protocol.</p>"
