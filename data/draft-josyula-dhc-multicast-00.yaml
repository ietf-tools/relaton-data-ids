abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating transmission
    of television channels as multicast streams use dedicated multicast group addresses
    in IP networks.Internet Group Multicast Protocol(IGMP) is widely used for the
    communication between the hosts and routers to deliver these multicast streams.It
    is also possible for the networks to distinguish these multicast streams not only
    by their destination multicast group but also by the source IP address of the
    streams.In IGMP version-3 implementation,the networks can deliver the multicast
    traffic to the hosts from the specific multicast sources requested by the users.This
    needs a mechanism to supply the available multicast source address information
    to the hosts and the hosts also should be strictly implemented with IGMPv3 client.
    This document describes a new DHCP option which can addresses these issues.In
    addition to this,the document also describes about the advantages in the networks
    by implementing this option.</p>"
