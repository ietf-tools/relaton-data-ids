abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP Level multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in BIER
    Use cases document. HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's video streaming and
    delivery services such as HLS, AR/VR etc., generally realized over IP Multicast.
    A realization of "HTTP Multicast" over "IP Multicast" is described. IP multicast
    is commonly used for IPTV services. DVB and BBF is also developing a reference
    architecture for IP Multicast service. Few problems with IPMC, such as waste of
    transmission bandwidth, increase in signaling when there are few users are described.
    Realization over BIER, through a BIER Multicast Overlay Layer, is described. How
    BIER Multicast Overlay operation improves over IP Multicast, such as reduction
    in signaling, dynamic creation of multicast groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth
    wastage is described. We conclude with few next steps.</p>
