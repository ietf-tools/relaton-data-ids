abstract:
- content: "<p>The EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) protocol defined a Well-
    Known URI (Uniform Resource Identifier): /.well-known/est. EST also defined several
    path components that clients use for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) services,
    namely certificate enrollment (e.g., /simpleenroll). In some sense, the services
    provided by the path components can be thought of as PKI management-related packages.
    There are additional PKI-related packages a client might need as well as other
    security-related packages, such as firmware, trust anchors, and symmetric, asymmetric,
    and encrypted keys. This document also specifies the PAL (Package Availability
    List), which is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) file that clients use to retrieve
    packages available and authorized for them. This document extends the EST server
    path components to provide these additional services.</p>"
