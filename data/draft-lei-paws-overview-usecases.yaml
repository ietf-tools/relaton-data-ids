abstract:
- content: <p>Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments. The
    spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment (eg. radio and
    television), communication (telephony and Internet access), military (radars etc.)
    and, navigation (satellite communication, GPS). Portions of the radio spectrum
    that are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white
    space". TV White space refers to those unused channels, within the range allocated
    for TV transmission, that can be used without interfering with the primary purpose
    for which it is allocated. This document describes examples of how a radio system
    might operate using TV white space spectrum and associated requirements. Not only
    does it describe the operation of a radio system, but also how the radio system
    including a white space database enables additional services.</p>
