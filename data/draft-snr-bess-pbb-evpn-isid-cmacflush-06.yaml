abstract:
- content: "<p>Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet VPN
    (EVPN) to deploy ELAN services in very large MPLS networks (PBB- EVPN). Single-Active
    Multi-homing and per-ISID Load-Balancing can be provided to access devices and
    aggregation networks. In order to speed up the network convergence in case of
    failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed Ethernet Segments, PBB-EVPN defines a CMAC-Flush
    mechanism that works for different Ethernet Segment BMAC address allocation models.
    This document complements those CMAC-Flush procedures for cases in which no PBB-EVPN
    Ethernet Segments are defined (ESI 0) and an ISID-based CMAC-Flush granularity
    is desired.</p>"
