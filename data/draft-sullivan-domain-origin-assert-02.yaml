abstract:
- content: "<p>Some clients on the Internet make inferences about the administrative
    relationships among servers on the Internet based on the domain names of those
    servers. Perhaps unfortunately, it is not currently possible to detect the real
    administrative boundaries in the DNS, and therefore such inferences can go wrong
    in several ways. Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale. The solution
    to this is to provide a way to make an explicit assertion about the relationships
    between different domain names and perhaps the services provided at them.</p>"
