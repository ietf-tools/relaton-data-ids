abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for Safely Turning Authentication
    Credentials Into Entropy (STACIE) using an efficient Zero Knowledge Password Proof
    (ZKPP), and is provided as a standalone component suitable for use as a building
    block in other protocol development efforts. The scheme was created to fill the
    emerging need for a standard which allows a single low entropy password to be
    used for user authentication and the derivation of strong encryption keys. The
    design is modular, and is conservative in its use of an arbitrary one-way cryptographic
    hash function. The security of the scheme depends on the difficulty associated
    with reversing the hash function output back into the plain text input. STACIE
    attempts to make discovering the plain text input through the use of brute force
    more difficult by correlating the amount of processing to the length of a user's
    plain text password. The shorter the plain text password, the more processing
    is required, with the amount of additional, artificially required, work scaling
    exponentially for each character.</p>"
