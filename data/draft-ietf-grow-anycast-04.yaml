abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet has grown, and as systems and networked services within
    enterprises have become more pervasive, many services with high availability requirements
    have emerged. These requirements have increased the demands on the reliability
    of the infrastructure on which those services rely. Various techniques have been
    employed to increase the availability of services deployed on the Internet. This
    document presents commentary and recommendations for distribution of services
    using anycast. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for
    the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
