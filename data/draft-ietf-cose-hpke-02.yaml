abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines hybrid public-key encryption (HPKE) for
    use with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). HPKE offers a variant of public-key
    encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key. HPKE works
    for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation
    function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption
    function. Authentication for HPKE in COSE is provided by COSE-native security
    mechanisms.</p>"
