abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to reduce redundant packet transmissions
    for the IS-IS Routing protocol, as described in RFC 1142 [1], when it is used
    to construct routing tables for IP networks, as described in RFC 1195 [2]. The
    described mechanism can be used to reduce the flooding of Link State PDUs (LSPs)
    in IS-IS topologies with fully meshed routers.</p>"
