abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with
    additional authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on the composition of the
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of
    operation for encryption, and the HMAC- SHA1 message authentication code (MAC).
    It also separately defines a generic composition method that can be used with
    other MACs and randomized ciphers (that is, ciphers that use random initialization
    vectors). These algorithms are randomized, and thus are suitable for use with
    applications that cannot provide distinct nonces to each invocation of the AEAD
    encrypt operation.</p>"
