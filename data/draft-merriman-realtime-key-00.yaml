abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase in privacy-enabling cryptographic software, there
    exists the growing problem of verification of the 'validity' of a cryptographic
    'key'. That is, the recipient of (for example) a PGP-signed email message from
    an unknown person generally has no ready, convenient means to verify that the
    'signature' on the message actually belongs to the sender. To verify the relationship
    between a cryptographic 'key' and an identity (real or anonymous), it is necessary
    for an individual to contact one of several existing 'manual' keyservers as a
    separate process, request the key (if it exists on that keyserver), and retrieve
    it before being able to use it for any reference or validation purposes. This
    draft is meant to propose a protocol/system that would both enable the automatic
    retrieval of cryptographic keys, and the exchange of keys between servers (both
    new keys, and those deleted through revocation certificates). This proposal could
    be extended to allow retrieval of cryptographic certificates and/or 'credentials'
    with relatively minor difficulty.</p>"
