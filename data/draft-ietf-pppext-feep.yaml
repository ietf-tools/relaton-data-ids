abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an Authentication
    Protocol for authentication of its peer before allowing Network Layer protocols
    to transmit over the link. One of the Authentication protocols that can be negotiated
    is the EAP. The EAP can be used in any of a number of variants. When the EAP is
    used in it's KEA variant, this results in mutual authentication and key generation.
    This key is available for use during the PPP data transfer phase by an encryption
    encapsulation. The encryption encapsulation that is described in this memo is
    one possible encapsulation that can use the keying material generated by the EAP
    KEA protocol.</p>"
