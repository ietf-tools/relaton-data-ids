abstract:
- content: "<p>The original IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header has been deprecated due to
    the security risk of a packet forwarding loop being formed, by specifying a large
    sequence of alternating IPv6 node addresses to visit. This memo proposes a method
    to prevent these forwarding loops forming, allowing the IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header
    to be more securely and safely used. The method is also more generally applicable
    to any unicast source routing.</p>"
