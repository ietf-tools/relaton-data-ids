abstract:
- content: "<p>Access Point Names are used in wireless networks which are based on
    3GPP standards to identify a specific gateway element. A mobile node which attaches
    via a 3GPP access network indicates the gateway to which connectivity is desired
    by providing the gateways access point name, in the network attach signaling messages.
    This document specifies a new DHCP option which enables the mobile node to request
    connectivity to a gateway, identified by the access point name, in DHCP messages.
    A mobile node whose mobility is managed by the network using Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol may perform a handover from one access technology to another. This document
    defines a DHCP option which enables the host to indicate to Proxy Mobile IPv6
    elements in the access network if the attachment via the new interface is a handover
    or a new connection.</p>"
