- content: "<p>Efforts are currently being undertaken to define and formalize registry/registrar
    communications protocols in light of the current and evolving scope and utility
    of DNS, domain name registries and related entities. In order for this work to
    be truly effective and broadly applicable, it is important that accepted definitions
    act as the foundation. This document is an attempt to create a starting point
    for the requisite dialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and acceptance
    of these new protocols. This document obsoletes &lt;draft-rader-dnwhois-defn-00.txt&gt;.</p>"
