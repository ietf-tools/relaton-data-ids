abstract:
- content: "<p>The Large-scale Deterministic Network(LDN) technology based on cyclic
    queuing and scheduling is expected to solve the scalability problem of DetNet,
    and is hoped to extend the adaptive domain of DetNet to wide area network or even
    backbone network. One of the keys of this technology is to accurately obtain the
    cyclic mapping relationship between adjacent nodes, based on which DetNet packets
    can be end-to- end deterministically forwarded. This draft proposes a method for
    LDN nodes to learn the cycle mapping relationship through sending learning messages.</p>"
