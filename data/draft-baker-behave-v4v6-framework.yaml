abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation. This is
    in the context of replacing NAT-PT, which was deprecated by RFC 4966, and to enable
    networks to have IPv4 and IPv6 coexist in a somewhat rational manner while transitioning
    to an IPv6 network.</p>"
