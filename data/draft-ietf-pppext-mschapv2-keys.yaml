abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. The PPP Compression
    Control Protocol [2] provides a method to negotiate and utilize compression protocols
    over PPP encapsulated links. Version 2 of the Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication
    Protocol (MS-CHAP-2) [3] is a Microsoft-proprietary PPP authentication protocol,
    providing the functionality to which LAN-based users are accustomed while integrating
    the encryption and hashing algorithms used on Windows networks. Microsoft Point
    to Point Encryption (MPPE) [4] is a means of representing PPP packets in an encrypted
    form. MPPE uses the RSA RC4 [5] algorithm to provide data confidentiality. The
    length of the ses- sion key to be used for initializing encryption tables can
    be negoti- ated. MPPE currently supports 40-bit and 128-bit session keys. MPPE
    session keys are changed frequently; the exact frequency depends upon the options
    negotiated, but may be every packet. MPPE is negotiated within option 18 [6] in
    the Compression Control Protocol. This document describes the method used to derive
    the initial MPPE ses- sion keys from MS-CHAP-2 credentials. The algorithm used
    to change ses- sion keys during a session is described in [4].</p>"
