abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight web transfer
    protocol designed to be used in constrained nodes and constrained networks. Communication
    security support for CoAP, including authentication, encryption, integrity protection,
    is well understood and a DTLS binding for CoAP is specified, but authorization
    and access control are not described in detail. This document describes a generic
    and dynamic access control framework suitable for constrained environments using
    CoAP. The framework builds on standards and well known paradigms for access control,
    externalizing authorization decision making to unconstrained nodes while performing
    authorization decision enforcement and verification of local conditions in constrained
    devices. In addition, this document provides alternative or complementary key
    management to the CoAP security modes.</p>"
