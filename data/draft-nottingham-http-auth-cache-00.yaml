abstract:
- content: "<p>This note proposes an HTTP cache-control extension mechanism that allows
    caching of authentication credentials, thereby allowing authenticated resources
    to be served from cache without incurring the cost of a round-trip to the origin
    server more than once during the freshness lifetime of the credentials.</p>"
