abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a framing protocol for TCP which is designed
    to be fully compliant with applicable TCP RFC's and fully interoperable with existing
    TCP implementations. The framing mechanism is designed to work as a 'shim' between
    TCP and higher- level protocols, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of
    TCP while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries if
    the record is less than or equal to the path MTU. The shim is designed to enable
    hardware acceleration of data movement operations (e.g. direct placement of receive
    TCP segments into higher-level protocol buffers) for the protocols that use it,
    even if TCP segments are delivered out-of-order.</p>"
