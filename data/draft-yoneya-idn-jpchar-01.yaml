abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) makes expression of domain name
    rich. The demand for such enrichment is to use native language characters in a
    domain name. IDN itself has no locale dependency as a protocol, but to utilize
    IDN in the real world, language and/or regional aspects should be taken into account.
    This document explains a guideline to any IDN zone administrator who accepts Japanese
    as an IDN label.</p>"
