abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines three types to be used in future AFS-3 Rx Remote
    Procedure Calls (RPCs) to represent time. Current AFS-3 RPCs represent time as
    32-bit integers representing seconds. This is insufficient in both granularity
    and range, so new types to represent time are defined in this document to overcome
    these limitations. Internet Draft Comments Comments regarding this draft are solicited.
    Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org)
    as a recipient of any comments.</p>"
