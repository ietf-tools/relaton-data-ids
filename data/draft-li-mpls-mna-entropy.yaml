abstract:
- content: <p>Load balancing is a powerful tool for engineering traffic across a network
    and has been successfully used in MPLS as described in "The Use of Entropy Labels
    in MPLS Forwarding". With the emergence of MPLS Network Actions (MNA), there is
    signficant benefit in being able to invoke the same load balancing capabilities
    within the more general MNA infrastructure. This document describes a network
    action for entropy to be used in conjunction with [I-D.jags-mpls-mna-hdr].</p>
