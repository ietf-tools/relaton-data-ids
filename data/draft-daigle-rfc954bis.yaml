abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the specification of the WHOIS protocol, thereby
    obsoleting RFC 954. The update is intended to remove the material from RFC 954
    that does not have to do with the on-the-wire protocol, and is no longer applicable
    in today's Internet. This document does not attempt to change or update the protocol
    per se, or document other uses of the protocol that have come into existence since
    the publication of RFC 954. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
