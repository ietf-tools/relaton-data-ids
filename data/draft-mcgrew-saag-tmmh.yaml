abstract:
- content: "<p>TMMH is a `universal' hash function suitable for message authentication
    in the Wegman-Carter paradigm, as in the Stream Cipher Security Transform. It
    is simple, quick, and especially appropriate for Digital Signal Processors and
    other processors with a fast multiply operation, though a straightforward implementation
    requires storage equal in length to the largest message to be hashed.</p>"
