abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a number of use cases that have a common need
    for encoding network action indicators and associated ancillary data inside MPLS
    packets. There has been significant recent interest in extending the MPLS data
    plane to carry such indicators and ancillary data to address a number of use cases
    that are described in this document. The use cases described in this document
    are not an exhaustive set, but rather the ones that are actively discussed by
    members of the IETF MPLS, PALS and DETNET working groups participating in the
    MPLS Open Design Team.</p>"
