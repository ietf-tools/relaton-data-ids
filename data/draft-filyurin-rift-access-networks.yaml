abstract:
- content: "<p>RIFT is a new specialized dynamic routing protocol originally designed
    for Clos and Fat Tree Data Center networks. It is designed to work on multilevel
    network topologies in which nodes in certain level will only connect to nodes
    in one upper or lower level with optional and non-contiguous intra-level connectivity.
    While the protocol was originally designed to meet the needs of Massively Scalable
    Data Centers, its ability to automatically prune the information distribution
    from higher levels to lower levels, as well as provide optimal routing for intra
    and inter-level traffic makes it a good match for user access networks, or any
    network that combines end user access and various compute enabling various network
    service for these end users. Current directions in distributed computing seek
    to blur even that distinction. Large distributed networks can be created, where
    virtual compute units can be in all tiers, combining and crossing many requirements
    for DC or User Access design. This draft seeks to analyze these requirements.</p>"
