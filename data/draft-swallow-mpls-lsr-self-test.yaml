abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a means of self test for a Label-Switched Router
    (LSR) to verify that its dataplane is functioning for certain key Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) applications including unicast forwarding based on LDP
    [LDP] and traffic engineering tunnels based on [RSVP-TE]. A new Loopback FEC type
    is defined to allow an upstream neighbor to assist in the testing at very low
    cost. MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages [LSP-Ping] messages are extended
    to do the actually probing.</p>"
