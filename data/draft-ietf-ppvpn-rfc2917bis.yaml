abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents an approach for building core Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) services in a service provider's MPLS backbone. This approach uses Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) running in the backbone to provide premium services in
    addition to best effort services. The central vision is for the service provider
    to provide a virtual router service to their customers. The keystones of this
    architecture are ease of configuration, user security, network security, dynamic
    neighbor discovery, scaling and the use of existing routing protocols as they
    exist today without any modifications.</p>"
