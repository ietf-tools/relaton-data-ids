abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives examples of SIP IP Telephony call flows. Elements
    in these call flows include SIP User Agents and Clients, SIP Proxy and Redirect
    Servers, and Gateways to the PSTN (Public Switch Telephone Network). Scenarios
    include SIP Registration, SIP to SIP calling, SIP to Gateway, Gateway to SIP,
    and Gateway to Gateway via SIP. Call flow diagrams and message details are shown.
    PSTN telephony protocols are illustrated using SS7 (Signaling System 7), ISDN
    (Integrated Services Digital Network) and FGB (Feature Group B) circuit associated
    signaling. PSTN calls are illustrated using global telephone numbers from the
    PSTN and from private extensions served on a PBX (Private Branch Exchange).</p>"
