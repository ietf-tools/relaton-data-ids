abstract:
- content: "<p>IP addresses work as a basic element for providing broadband network
    services. However, the increase in number, diversity and complexity of modern
    network devices and services creates unprecedented challenges for the currently
    prevailing approach of manual IP address management. Manually maintaining IP addresses
    could always be sub- optimal for IP resource utilization. Besides, it requires
    heavy human effort from network operators. To achieve high utilization and flexible
    scheduling of IP network addresses, it is necessary to automate the address scheduling
    process. This document describes an architecture for the IP address space management.
    It includes architectural concepts and components used in the CASM (Coordinated
    Address Space Management), with a focus on those interfaces to be standardized
    in the IETF.</p>"
