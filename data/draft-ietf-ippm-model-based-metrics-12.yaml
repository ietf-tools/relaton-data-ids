abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target Transport
    Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths.
    The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to critical infrastructure,
    such as network interconnections or even individual devices, to accurately detect
    if any part of the infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting
    the Target Transport Performance. Model Based Metrics rely on mathematical models
    to specify a Targeted Suite of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to assess whether
    common transport protocols can be expected to meet a predetermined Target Transport
    Performance over an Internet path. For Bulk Transport Capacity the IP diagnostics
    are built using test streams and statistical criteria for evaluating the packet
    transfer that mimic TCP over the complete path. The temporal structure of the
    test stream (bursts, etc) mimic TCP or other transport protocol carrying bulk
    data over a long path. However they are constructed to be independent of the details
    of the subpath under test, end systems or applications. Likewise the success criteria
    evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the subpath against criteria determined
    by protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport Performance of
    the complete path. The success criteria also does not depend on the details of
    the subpath, end systems or application.</p>"
