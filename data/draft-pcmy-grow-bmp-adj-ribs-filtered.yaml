abstract:
- content: "<p>Filtering RIBs in BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) can be desirable for
    several use-cases like, for example, limiting the amount of data a collector station
    has to process or allow a sender to export only a certain afi/safi of interest.
    This document defines a light way to inform a collector station that a Adj-Rib-In
    / Adj-Rib-Out data feed is being filtered.</p>"
