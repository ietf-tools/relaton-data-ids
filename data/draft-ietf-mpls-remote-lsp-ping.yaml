abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a means of remotely initiating Multiprocal Label
    Switched Protocol Pings on Label Switched Paths. A proxy ping request is sent
    to any Label Switching Routers along a Label Switched Path. The primary motivations
    for this facility are first to limit the number of messages and related processing
    when using LSP Ping in large Point-to-Multipoint LSPs, and second to enable leaf
    to root tracing.Contents</p>"
