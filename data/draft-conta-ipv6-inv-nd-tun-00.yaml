abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension mechanism to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    and IPv6 Inverse Neighbor Discovery [IND] that applies to IPv6 and IPv4 tunnels.
    The mechanism can be used to advertise the parameters of a tunnel to its exit
    point node, and to create a reverse tunnel path between the exit point and entry
    point nodes of a unidirectional tunnel. If such a bidirectional tunnel already
    exists, the mechanism can be used to learn the IPv6 address of the tunnel pseudointerface
    of the exit-point node, as well as the reverse tunnel path parameters.</p>"
