abstract:
- content: "<p>In a network running PIM-SM, multicast traffic can fail to be properly
    routed and forwarded during some period of time after a topology change, when
    unicast routing converges to a new path using a new next-hop before multicast
    routing adjacencies are fully setup with this new next-hop. At this point, a blackhole
    appears in the multicast topology and persists until the PIM adjacency become
    fully setup. This document describes different procedures aiming at avoiding such
    blackholes, focusing on the use of non-congruent unicast routing that takes into
    account the status of PIM adjacencies.</p>"
