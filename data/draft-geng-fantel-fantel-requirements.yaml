abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for Fast Notification for Traffic
    Engineering and Load Balancing (FaNTEL), a mechanism designed to deliver timely
    network status updates directly from the network device with a change to the device
    expected to react to it. FaNTEL supports fast failure and congestion notifications,
    enabling rapid protection switching and dynamic load balancing. By providing low-
    latency alerts, it helps networks respond quickly to link failures and congestion
    events, enhancing service reliability and performance.</p>"
