abstract:
- content: '<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale
    content delivery. As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure
    and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. There
    is a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so that their collective
    CDN footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content
    Service Providers (CSPs) to end users. The Content Distribution Network Interconnection
    (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable
    solution for such CDN interconnection. The goal of the present document is to
    outline the requirements for the solution and interfaces to be specified by the
    CDNI working group. This draft is a work in progress and requirements may be added,
    modified, or removed by the working group. Requirements Language The key words
    "High Priority", "Medium Priority" and "Low Priority" in this document are to
    be interpreted in the following way: o "High Priority" indicates requirements
    that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces. A requirement is stated as "High
    Priority" when it is established by the working group that it can be met without
    compromising the targeted schedule for WG deliverables, or when it is established
    that specifying a solution without meeting this requirement would not make sense
    and would justify re- adjusting the WG schedule, or both. This is tagged as "[HIGH]".
    o "Medium Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI
    interfaces unless the WG realizes at a later stage that attempting to meet this
    requirement would compromise the overall WG schedule (for example it would involve
    complexities that would result in significantly delaying the deliverables). This
    is tagged as "[MED]". o "Low Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported
    by the CDNI interfaces provided that dedicating WG resources to this work does
    not prevent addressing "High Priority" and "Medium Priority" requirements and
    that attempting to meet this requirement would not compromise the overall WG schedule.
    This is tagged as "[LOW]".</p>'
