abstract:
- content: "<p>End-by-Hop Transmission Protocol (EHTP) is the connection-oriented
    transport service for the reliable or unreliable delivery of data packets with
    possible violation of a sequence. It has the own address space compatible with
    Unified Memory Space Protocol (UMSP, RFC3018 [5]). EHTP includes the gateway protocol,
    which supports labels and dynamic resources deallocating. Networks with non- overlapping
    or incompatible addresses space may be united at EHTP layer with end-to-end interaction
    and with preservation of a transparency.</p>"
