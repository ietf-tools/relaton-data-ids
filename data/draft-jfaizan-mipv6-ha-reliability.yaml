abstract:
- content: "<p>In Mobile-IPv6, Mobile Node is dependent on a single Home Agent for
    the seamless roaming over the Internet. Mobile-IPv6 also allows deployment of
    multiple Home Agents on the subnet for providing continuous service to Mobile
    Node in case of serving Home Agent failure. But switching of service from the
    failed Home Agent to another functional Home Agent on the Home Subnet is problematic
    and the base Mobile-IPv6 specifications does not currently have well-described
    solutions. This document aims to describe and illustrate these problems, and propose
    some guidelines for possible solutions.</p>"
