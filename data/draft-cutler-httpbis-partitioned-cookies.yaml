abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6265bis, defining a new attribute, Partitioned,
    which restricts the contexts in which a cookie is available to only those whose
    top-level document is same-site with the top-level document that initiated the
    request that created the cookie. These cookies are referred to as "partitioned
    cookies" and allow embedded sites which are cross-site with the top-level frame
    to have access to HTTP state which cannot be used for tracking across multiple
    top-level sites.</p>
