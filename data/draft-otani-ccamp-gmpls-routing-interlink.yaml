abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft states the problem of the current generalized multi- protocol
    label switching (GMPLS) routing in order to deal with inter- domain TE links for
    GMPLS inter-domain signaling. Since the GMPLS signaling protocol introduces bi-directional
    label switched path (LSP) creation mechanism, an ingress node (or a path computation
    element) searches for the bidirectional route in the traffic engineering database
    (TED). Considering the GMPLS inter-domain path creation, the TED contains only
    outgoing TE information of inter- domain links and will not be able to confirm
    the validity of the incoming inter-domain links. In order to solve this issue,
    we describe the GMPLS inter-domain routing requirement in support of exchanging
    of inter-domain TE link information.</p>"
