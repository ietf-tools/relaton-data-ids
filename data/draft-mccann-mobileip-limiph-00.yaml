abstract:
- content: "<p>There are currently a number of proposals for different mechanisms
    intended to reduce the overhead of IP mobility management. Generally speaking,
    the goal of these proposals is twofold: first, to reduce the latency or interruption
    due to handoffs; and second, to reduce the signaling load on the Mobile IP Home
    Agent (and Correspondent Nodes, for the case of Mobile IPv6). These techniques
    are meant to improve the performance of real-time applications like voice or video
    over IP over wireless networks. By minimizing the period of interruption during
    a handoff from one point of attachment to another, the proposals attempt to minimize
    packet loss when these events occur. This draft argues that the best solution
    to this problem is a 'transparent' one that requires no changes to the Mobile
    IP clients in mobile nodes and that gives control over routing functionality to
    the operator of a wireless network. We review some of the existing proposals and
    describe in detail a new proposal that can provide for low interruption handoffs
    in a more transparent manner.</p>"
