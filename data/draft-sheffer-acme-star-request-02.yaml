abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a protocol that allows a domain name owner to delegate
    to a third party (such as a CDN) control over a certificate that bears one or
    more names in that domain. Specifically the third party creates a Certificate
    Signing Request for the domain, which can then be used by the domain owner to
    request a short term and automatically renewed (STAR) certificate. This is a component
    in a solution where a third-party such as a CDN can terminate TLS sessions on
    behalf of a domain name owner (e.g., a content provider), and the domain owner
    can cancel this delegation at any time without having to rely on certificate revocation
    mechanisms.</p>"
