abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a PC model, where the recovery LSP route in
    a domain is computed using an external PCE. Recovery LSP computation that promotes
    bandwidth sharing between other recovery LSPs requires unreserved bandwidth information
    that corresponds to each failure position or SRLG. However, the present IGP-TE
    can only advertise unreserved bandwidth information corresponding to eight priority
    classes to each LSR involved in an IGP area. An external PCE in a domain can compute
    efficient recovery LSP routes by exclusively preserving such unreserved bandwidth
    information without any extension of the present IGP-TE.</p>"
