abstract:
- content: "<p>In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM), defined
    in RFC 9197, is an on-path telemetry method to collect and transport the operational
    state and telemetry information that can be used to calculate various performance
    metrics. IOAM Direct Export (IOAM-DEX) is one of the IOAM Option types, in which
    the operational state and telemetry information are collected according to the
    specified profile and exported in a manner and format defined by a local policy.
    MPLS Network Actions (MNA) techniques are meant to indicate actions to be performed
    on any combination of Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS packets, and the node
    itself, and also to transfer data needed for these actions. This document explores
    the on-path operational state, and telemetry information can be collected using
    IOAM-DEX Option in combination with MNA.</p>"
