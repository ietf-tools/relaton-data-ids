abstract:
- content: <p>The present specification describes a light extension of the TCP protocol
    [RFC793] that allows a TCP transport connection to be maintained operational whenever
    the underlying IP network address of its end-points changes. This includes situations
    where a single- interface host changes its IP address or where a multiple-interface
    host diverts a connection from one interface to another. The mechanism used to
    maintain a transport connection in such situations is based on the capability
    of both end-points to "Rehash" a TCP connection (rebuild its lookup key) with
    a new IP address in a fast and reliable manner.</p>
