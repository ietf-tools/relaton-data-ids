- content: "<p>This document attempts to list mechanisms that if added to the Internet
    protocols could take us some way in providing well desirable alternatives and
    improvements to NAT. Some of the techniques and components described here are
    controversial and their appearance in this document does not mean that the author
    supports them. We merely attempt to list the options and issues (most of them
    already known) as a starting point for an elimination and selection process.</p>"
