abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simple protocol, BMP, which can be used to
    monitor BGP sessions. BMP is intended to provide a more convenient interface for
    obtaining route views for research purpose than the screen-scraping approach in
    common use today. The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented,
    and minimally service-affecting. BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</p>"
