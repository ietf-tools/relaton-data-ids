abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Bootstrap Router (BSR) mechanism for the
    class of multicast routing protocols in the PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)
    family that use the concept of a Rendezvous Point as a means for receivers to
    discover the sources that send to a particular multicast group. BSR is one way
    that a multicast router can learn the set of group-to-RP mappings required in
    order to function. The mechanism is dynamic, largely self-configuring, and robust
    to router failure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
