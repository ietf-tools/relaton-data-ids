abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines optional ECN and filter related attributes that
    can be used for improved traffic identification, support of ECN and minimized
    filter administration within Diameter. RFC 5777 defines a Filter-Rule AVP that
    accommodates extensions for classification, conditions and actions. It does not
    support traffic identification for packets using Explicit Congestion Notification
    as defined in RFC 3168 and does not provide specific actions when the flow(s)
    described by the Filter-Rule are congested. A Filter-Rule can describe multiple
    flows but not the exact number of flows. Flow count and other associated data
    (e.g. packets) is not captured in Accounting applications, leaving administrators
    without useful information regarding the effectiveness or understanding of the
    filter definition. These optional attributes are forward and backwards compatible
    with RFC 5777.</p>"
