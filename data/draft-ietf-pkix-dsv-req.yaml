abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements to fully delegate the validation
    of a digital signature to a DSV (Delegated Signature Validation) server. The validation
    is performed using a set of rules, called a signature policy. It also defines
    the requirements for two optional request/response pairs, either for allowing
    to indicate to a signature validation server a signature policy, or giving the
    reference of a signature policy to obtain the details of an already defined signature
    policy.</p>"
