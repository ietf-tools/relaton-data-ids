abstract:
- content: <p>This is a copy of the paper sent to the "Smart Object Security" workshop
    March 23, 2012 in Paris. It is submitted as an IETF draft to have a record of
    it in the draft archive. The original publication date of this work was Feb 14,
    2012. Readers are encouraged to read later versions of this draft. This document
    provides a very early sketch of a enrollment protocol that allows constrained
    internet devices to securely enroll into a system. As the work is in its early
    phase, many details remain to be resolved. The solution is based on the idea that
    each device will be manufactured with a one time password that can be used by
    the customer to tell the device which controller to enroll with.</p>
