abstract:
- content: "<p>Service usage might require some form of compensation and this is also
    true for many communication systems where an entity receiving a call should be
    able to charge the caller. This is necessary for allowing fair communication between
    two communicating parties and is a major strategy for reducing the viability of
    SPAM. This draft proposes an approach for doing this in SIP using the Security
    Assertion Markup Language (SAML). It relies on a third party to act as a payment
    provider and is designed for low value transactions. It does not aim to provide
    the same capability as other authentication, authorization and accounting backend
    infrastructures.</p>"
