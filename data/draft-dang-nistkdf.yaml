abstract:
- content: <p>This draft specifies two Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that may be
    used to derive symmetric keying material for participating parties from a secret
    value and application specific information. Each KDF is based on a concatenation
    technique and a secure hash function. The length in bits of secret keying material
    that can be generated by either of the KDFs is limited to (2**32 - 1) times the
    length in bits of the output block of the hash function. The derived keying material
    is a concatenation of the outputs of the hashing operations. Outputs from the
    KDFs are either "Invalid" or desired secret keying material. The HKDFs specified
    in this document are intended for use in scenarios where the communicating parties
    derive keying material for their own use. This specification is not intended for
    implementation of key hierarchies.</p>
