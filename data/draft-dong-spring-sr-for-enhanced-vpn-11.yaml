abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment
    can represent topological or service based instructions. A segment can further
    be associated with network resources allocated for executing the instruction.
    Such a segment is called resource-aware SID. The resource-aware SIDs can be used
    to build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources. In addition, the resource-aware
    SIDs can be used to build SR based virtual networks, which can provide the customized
    network topology and resource attributes required by different customers or services.
    Such virtual networks are called SR based Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs). The
    SR based VTNs can be used to enable the enhanced VPN (VPN+) services. This document
    describes the mechanisms of using resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.</p>
