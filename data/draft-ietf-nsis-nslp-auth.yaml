abstract:
- content: "<p>Signaling layer protocols specified within the Next Steps in Signaling
    (NSIS) framework may rely on the General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol
    to handle authorization. Still, the signaling layer protocol above GIST itself
    may require separate authorization to be performed when a node receives a request
    for a certain kind of service or resources. This document presents a generic model
    and object formats for session authorization within the NSIS signaling layer protocols.
    The goal of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between
    network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and
    to coordinate actions between the signaling and transport planes. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
