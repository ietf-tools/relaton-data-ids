abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies "tcpcrypt", a TCP encryption protocol designed
    for use in conjunction with the TCP Encryption Negotiation Option (TCP-ENO). Tcpcrypt
    coexists with middleboxes by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations
    of the TCP header. The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to
    TCP implementations, which often reside in kernels or other environments in which
    large external software dependencies can be undesirable. Because the size of TCP
    options is limited, the protocol requires one additional one-way message latency
    to perform key exchange before application data can be transmitted. However, the
    extra latency can be avoided between two hosts that have recently established
    a previous tcpcrypt connection.</p>
