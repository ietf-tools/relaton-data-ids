abstract:
- content: "<p>Long-lived flows such as file transfers, video streams are common in
    today's networks. In the context of service function chaining, this draft suggests
    use cases for dynamic bypass of certain service functions for such flows. The
    benefit of this approach would be to avoid expensive Layer 7 service function
    processing for such flows based on dynamic decisions and thus improve overall
    performance.</p>"
