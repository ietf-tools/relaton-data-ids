abstract:
- content: "<p>In delayed authentication in DHCPv6[RFC3315], the hardware identifier
    is used to select the key, and the key is exchanged between the server and the
    client in advance. Therefore, when a user tries to use a new device, it is necessary
    to add key information to the new device and DHCPv6 servers. In this document,
    we propose a procedure for introducing CHAP[RFC1994] into the DHCPv6 authentication
    procedure. This procedure allows the client get the host configuration information
    related to the user and exchanges a secret key to use in later sequence.</p>"
