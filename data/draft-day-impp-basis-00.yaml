abstract:
- content: "<p>As of this writing, the IMPP working group has largely reached consensus
    on the requirements for IMPP [Reqts]. In addition, Hudson [Issues] has catalogued
    a set of design issues discussed on the mailing list. This document proposes a
    starting point for further discussions about the design of the Instant Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (IMPP). It is not a fully-specified protocol, but a summary
    of design decisions on which the authors were able to reach agreement during two
    full days of discussion. Our discussions drew on knowledge of operational and
    architectural aspects of Activerse Ding!, Lotus Sametime, Microsoft Exchange instant
    messaging, MSN Messenger, and Zephyr, among other diverse, widely-deployed systems
    supporting presence and/or instant messaging. We believe that the issues on which
    we reached agreement are issues on which the working group as a whole should be
    able to quickly reach rough consensus. We hope that the working group will be
    able to adopt these decisions as the basis for further work on designing IMPP;
    of course, we recognize the possibility that strong technical arguments not hitherto
    considered may cause the group to arrive at different decisions in some instances.
    We also identified some areas, primarily related to security, in which we were
    lacking enough information or experience to make a solid recommendation. We draw
    the working group's attention to these issues in the hope that others can contribute.
    Although we have treated presence and instant messaging in the same document,
    we believe that these design decisions allow implementors to offer either service
    independently of the other.</p>"
