abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent progress in ITU-T Recommendation G.709 standardization has introduced
    new ODU containers (ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex) and enhanced Optical Transport
    Networking (OTN) flexibility. Several recent documents have proposed ways to modify
    GMPLS signaling protocols to support these new OTN features. It is important that
    a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS signaling and routing protocols.
    This solution must support ODUk multiplexing capabilities, address all of the
    new features, be acceptable to all equipment vendors, and be extensible considering
    continued OTN evolution. This document describes the extensions to the Generalized
    Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving Optical
    Transport Networks (OTN) addressing ODUk multiplexing and new features including
    ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex.</p>"
