abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the addition of a latency spin bit to the QUIC
    transport protocol and describes how to use it to measure end- to-end latency.
    Note to Readers This document specifies an experimental delta to the QUIC transport
    protocol. Specifically, this experimentation is intended to determine: o the impact
    of the addition of the latency spin bit on implementation and specification complexity;
    and o the accuracy and value of the information derived from spin bit measurement
    on live network traffic. The information generated by this experiment will be
    used by the QUIC working group as input to a decision about the standardization
    of the latency spin bit. Although this is a Working Group document, it is currently
    NOT a Working Group deliverable. Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC
    working group mailing list (quic@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic
    [1]. Working Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg [2];
    source code and issues list for this draft can be found at https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-spin
    [3].</p>"
