abstract:
- content: "<p>Home network design faces many challenges currently. Two of them are
    multi-homing and policy enforcement. Different with other types of networks, home
    network operators are usually not professional technicians or geeks. The problems
    we face are fundamentally related with the poor semantics provided by current
    destination-based routing protocol. TwoD-IP routing protocol is a link state routing
    protocol that makes routing decisions based on both destination and source addresses.
    This document describes the mechanism for supporting flexible multi- homing and
    policy routing across home networks.</p>"
