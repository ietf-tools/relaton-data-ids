abstract:
- content: "<p>Since digital multichannel TV broadcasting services have been started
    in many areas, low cost digital data receivers are available. They can be used
    for not only TV broadcasting service but also any kind of data communication services.
    A low cost receiver can receive high bandwidth traffic from a feed, while no bandwidth
    from the receiver to the feed is provided. Therefore the connection between the
    feed and the receiver is unidirectional. Current routing protocols stand on a
    fact that any links are bidirectional even if the bandwidth in each direction
    may be different. They can not handle unidirectional links. This document defines
    an idea to use unidirectional links (UDLs) routing without any modifications of
    current routing protocols.</p>"
