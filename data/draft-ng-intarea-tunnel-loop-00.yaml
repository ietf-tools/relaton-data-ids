abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protocols in the Internet Protocol suite use packet encapsulations.
    This runs into the danger of forming a tunnel loop. Since each tunnel entry point
    encapsulates the inner packet with a tunnel packet header that contains a new
    hop count, a packet entering a tunnel loop may be routed infinitely, consuming
    network resources. Although there exist methods to cause a packet in a tunnel
    loop to be discarded eventually, it would be more desirable to detect the presence
    of a tunnel loop and act accordingly. This draft explores the possibility for
    tunnel entry points to detect the presence of a tunnel loop by using an extra
    identifier tagged to the outer packet header.</p>"
