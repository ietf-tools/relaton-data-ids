abstract:
- content: "<p>The optimization offered by reactive routing relies on the observation
    that under normal activity a host makes a low rate of outgoing sessions to new
    or different hosts, and connections are locally correlated. This contrasts the
    fundamental behavior of address scanning worms that search for new hosts to infect
    at high speeds. Consequently, each infected node will frequently flood the network
    with route request messages targeted at possibly non-existing addresses.</p>"
