abstract:
- content: "<p>With the definition of standardized media types in MIME it has become
    necessary to keep mapping tables which translate between the standard media type
    names, commonly used file name extensions, any platform specific typing mechanism,
    and helper applications to view, compose, edit or print media types. Supplying
    a set of site defaults is useful so that users won't have to configure well-known
    types. The mailcap mechanism provides some of this functionality in a homogeneous
    environment with a shared file system, and both the Macintosh program 'Internet
    Config' and the Windows Registry have had some success in consolidating these
    tables for multiple applications on a single machine. But neither of these addresses
    the problems of multi-platform users or a heterogeneous environment. Application
    Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) provides appropriate facilities for this
    need. ACAP's dataset structure is extensible and ACAP's inheritance feature provides
    for enterprise default settings with per-user customization. This memo defines
    an ACAP dataset class for media type mapping tables.</p>"
