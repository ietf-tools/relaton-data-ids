abstract:
- content: "<p>The OCSP digest extension creates a strong cryptographic binding between
    an OCSP token and the certificate it asserts a status value for. Support for the
    digest identifier extension permits a certificate issuer to employ a high assurance
    cryptographic digest function such as SHA2 to attest to the authenticity of their
    certificates in a fashion that is fully downwards compatible with legacy clients
    that only support SHA1.</p>"
