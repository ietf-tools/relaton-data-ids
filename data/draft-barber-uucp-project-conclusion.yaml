abstract:
- content: "<p>The UUCP Mapping Project started in the early 1980s as a means to facilitate
    the exchange of electronic mail among sites using the UUCP store-and-forward transport
    mechanism. This UUCP software, originally part of the UNIX operating system became
    available on a variety of operating systems and platforms, from large mainframe
    to small home PC's. This was done by creating a single database of systems connected
    to each other via UUCP and then using path building software (such as pathalias)
    to determine the optimal path from one system to another. Email addresses using
    this system incorporated the use of the path as part of the address.</p>"
