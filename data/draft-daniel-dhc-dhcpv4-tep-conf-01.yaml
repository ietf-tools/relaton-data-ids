abstract:
- content: "<p>The intent of this draft is to provide a solution to automate tunnel
    end-point configuration for a configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel. This uses a DHCPv4
    option to percolate the tunnel end-point configuration information. This is very
    useful to connect a newly deployed native IPv6 cloud to other existing IPv6 networks
    using IPv4 backbone as well as to connect isolated dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 nodes
    to IPv6 networks through IPv4.</p>"
