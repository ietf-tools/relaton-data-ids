abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes MRCC, a scalable multirate congestion control
    building block for multicast. MRCC is an approach that allows multiple receivers
    to concurrently receive packets from a single sender at vary- ing rates depending
    on individual bandwidth connections and network con- ditions. Two basic goals
    of the approach are to allow each receiver to obtain the full benefit of the available
    bandwidth to the sender and to be fair to other flows in the network.</p>"
