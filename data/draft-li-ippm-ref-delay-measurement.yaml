abstract:
- content: "<p>The end-to-end network one-way delay is an important performance metric
    in the 5G network. For realizing the accurate one-way delay measurement, existing
    methods requires the end-to-end deployment of accurate clock synchronization mechanism,
    such as PTP or GPS, which results in relatively high deployment cost. Another
    method can derive the one-way delay from the round-trip delay. In this case, since
    the delay of the downlink and uplink may be asymmetric, the measurement accuracy
    is relatively low. Hence, this document introduces a method to measure the end-to-end
    network one-way delay based on a reference delay guaranteed by deterministic networking
    without clock synchronization.The advantage of this solution is that it has high
    measurement accuracy and can test any flow type.</p>"
