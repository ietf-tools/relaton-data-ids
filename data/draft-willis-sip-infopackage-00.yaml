abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP INFO method (RFC 2976) establishes a method by which applications
    may transfer application-specific information within a SIP dialog. However, RFC
    2976 does not provide a mechanism for describing and documenting an application
    of INFO, nor does it provide a mechanism by which applications may negotiate such
    uses. This document provides a framework for documenting and naming specific uses
    of INFO (called INFO packages), for registering those package names with IANA,
    and for negotiating the support for various INFO packages between applications
    using SIP.</p>"
