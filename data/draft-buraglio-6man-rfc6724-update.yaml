abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 6724 based on operational experience gained
    since its publication over ten years ago. In particular it updates the preference
    of Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) in the default address selection policy table,
    which as originally defined by RFC 6724 has lower precedence than legacy IPv4
    addressing. The update places both IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs) and ULAs
    ahead of all IPv4 addresses on the policy table to better suit operational deployment
    and management of ULAs in production. This document also updates requirements
    on configurability of the policy table and preference for using ddresses from
    a prefix advertised by a next-hop router, and demotes the preference for 6to4
    addresses in the default policy table. These changes to default behavior improve
    supportability of common use cases such as, but not limited to, automatic / unmanaged
    scenarios. It is recognized that some less common deployment situations may require
    explicit confioguration or custom changes to acheive desired operational parameters.</p>"
