abstract:
- content: "<p>Service synchronisation for Television And Related devices (STAR) is
    a suite of application level protocols to enable network connected devices to
    correlate events on a broadcast system with events outside that broadcast system.
    It is a generic suite of protocols, that enables playback of content retrieved
    from over a network such that it is synchronised to a broadcast source. It also
    enables correlation of non-broadcast events (such as conversations) to broadcast
    events. Key features of STAR include: 1) The broadcast system does not require
    modification 2) It is designed to work with restricted clients limited to stream
    connections - such as web browsers 3) It is content agnostic. This specification
    describes the research implementation as it stands today, and is published as
    a starting point for further discussion.</p>"
