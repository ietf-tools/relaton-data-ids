abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to make DNS-SD browsing domains available
    for browsing and discovery without requiring special cooperation from the network
    infrastructure. Zones made available in this way are browsed using DNS or DNS
    Push. The mechanism for advertising them is Multicast DNS (mDNS). This allows
    DNS-SD browsers to benefit from the permissionless aspects of mDNS without relying
    on mDNS for all queries, which improves scalability and reliability in applications
    where many services may be advertised.</p>"
