abstract:
- content: "<p>Active traffic measurements are starting to become more widely used
    to ascertain network performance characteristics. All active measurement systems
    have the capability to measure one-way delay and one-way loss metrics, as defined
    in RFC2679 [1] A One- way Delay Metric for IPPM and RFC 2680 [2] A One-way Packet
    Loss Metric for IPPM, respectively. To ensure that the resulting numbers have
    some meaning, we attempt to characterize how the measurements are taken and what
    would ensure that the end numbers are indeed meaningful. This document describes
    an applicability statement (formerly known as best current practices) for measuring
    the one-way delay and one-way loss metrics in operational networks.</p>"
