abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 network mobility (NEMO) configuration relies on a prefix delegation
    service to fulfill its task. Such service has already been described in two different
    proposals, one is based on DHCPv6 and the other extends NEMO signaling. However,
    both failed to gather consensus. This memo describes how DHCPv6 Relay Agents can
    be used in order to provide the missing flexibility and pave the way for a solution.</p>"
