abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an approach to support multicast listeners and
    senders located within a moving IPv6 network (NEMO). A NEMO is built up by at
    least one Mobile Router (MR) and a set of Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs). The MR
    handles all routing related tasks to provide connectivity between the MNNs and
    an access network including mobility management. Correspondingly the MR also subscribes
    to multicast groups and forwards emerging multicast traffic on behalf of a MNN.
    For optimised routing of multicast data a hierarchical multicast agent is introduced
    as a logical entity providing an anchor to the multicast tree. In the MR a corresponding
    functionality is defined which decides on the location of the specific agent to
    be used for a distinct multicast traffic. Conventions used in this document The
    key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119 [1].</p>
