abstract:
- content: '<p>The rules for SIP proxies are organized so that when a UAC sends an
    out-of-dialog request, even if the request is forked to a number of UASs, (usually)
    only one UAS will accept the request, and only the final response from that UAS
    will be returned to the UAC. This forking mechanism is optimal for an INVITE intended
    to connect one human user with another human uses, but is poor for requests that
    have a "one to many" nature, especially PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE requests, but also
    including some INVITEs. This document proposes an alternative forking mechanism
    that better supports "one to many" requests, and that mechanism be the standardized
    meaning of the (existing but weakly specified) "Request-Disposition: no-cancel,
    parallel" header.</p>'
