abstract:
- content: '<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This
    document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user and third parties to
    determine the trusted key state for the root key of the resolvers that handle
    that user''s DNS queries. Note that this method is only applicable for determing
    which keys are in the trust store for the root key. There is an example / toy
    implementation of this at http://www.ksk- test.net . [ This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/APNIC-Labs/draft-kskroll-sentinel.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. Text in square brackets will
    be removed before publication. ] [ NOTE: This version uses the labels "kskroll-sentinel-is-ta-&lt;key-
    tag&gt;", "kskroll-sentinel-not-ta-&lt;key-tag&gt;"; older versions of this document
    used "_is-ta-&lt;key-tag&gt;", "_not-ta-&lt;key-tag&gt;". Also note that the format
    of the tag-index is now zero-filled decimal. Apolgies to those who have began
    implmenting.]</p>'
