abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to define the goals and benefits of multihoming
    for fixed and mobile nodes (hosts and routers), i.e. from a node point of view,
    as investigated in the Monami6 WG, and not from a site point of view as investigated
    in the Shim6 WG. Those goals and benefits are illustrated with a set of scenarios.
    This document is generic in the sense that the benefits of node multihoming can
    be shared by both fixed end nodes and mobile end nodes. It is intended to satisfy
    the first item as specified on the Monami6 charter and as such, working group
    approval as a working group document will be sought.</p>"
