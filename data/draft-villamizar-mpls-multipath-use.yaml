abstract:
- content: "<p>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many
    MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth
    applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged
    the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot
    be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations. Using
    MPLS Entropy label, MPLS LSPs can be carried over multipath links while also providing
    a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSPs. This document describes
    the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP
    LSPs as a server layer for MPLS LSPs is also discussed.</p>"
