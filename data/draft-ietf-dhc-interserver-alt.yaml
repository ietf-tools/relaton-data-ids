abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHCP protocol is designed to allow for multiple DHCP servers, so
    that reliability of DHCP service can be improved through the use of redundant
    servers. To provide redundant service, all of the DHCP servers must be configured
    with the same information about assigned IP addresses and parameters; i.e., all
    of the servers must be configured with the same bindings. Because DHCP servers
    may dynamically assign new addresses or configuration parameters, or extend the
    lease on an existing address assignment, the bindings on some servers may become
    out of date. The DHCP inter-server protocol provides an automatic mechanism for
    synchronization of the bindings stored on a set of cooperating DHCP servers. This
    draft is a direct extension of draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-00.txt, but has been
    renamed draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-alt-00.txt since an alternative proposal (also
    a direct extension of draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-00.txt but in a different direction)
    exists named draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-01.txt.</p>"
