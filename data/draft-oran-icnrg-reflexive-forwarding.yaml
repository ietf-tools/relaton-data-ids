abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Information-Centric Networking protocols such as CCNx and NDN
    have a wide range of useful applications in content retrieval and other scenarios
    that depend only on a robust two-way exchange in the form of a request and response
    (represented by an _Interest-Data exchange_ in the case of the two protocols noted
    above). A number of important applications however, require placing large amounts
    of data in the Interest message, and/or more than one two-way handshake. While
    these can be accomplished using independent Interest-Data exchanges by reversing
    the roles of consumer and producer, such approaches can be both clumsy for applications
    and problematic from a state management, congestion control, or security standpoint.
    This specification proposes a _Reflexive Forwarding_ extension to the CCNx and
    NDN protocol architectures that eliminates the problems inherent in using independent
    Interest-Data exchanges for such applications. It updates RFC8569 and RFC8609.</p>"
