abstract:
- content: "<p>On July 24-26, 1990, an invited panel met at the Corporation for National
    Research Initiatives in Reston Virginia to consider the issues involved with interworking
    between protocol stacks based on Connection-mode Network Service (CONS, or CO)
    and Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS, or CL). The main example of a CO
    stack is OSI TP0 over X.25. Examples of CL protocolstacks include OSI TP4 over
    CLNP and TCP over IP. The workshop was convened at the direction of RARE and the
    U.S. Federal Networking Council (FNC). The meeting was organized and co-chaired
    by Les Clyne (UK Joint Network Team) and Phillip Gross(Corporation for National
    Research Initiatives). An electronic mailing list was established for use by both
    attendees and a wider audience of experts. This report gives an overview and synopsis
    of the deliberations at the meeting, and it describes the outcome.</p>"
