abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes the "regex" extension to the Sieve email filtering
    language. In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism which
    is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match or a glob-style
    wildcard match. The regular expression matching mechanism defined in this draft
    provides users with much more powerful string matching capabilities. Change History
    (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC) Changes from draft-murchison-sieve-regex-08:
    o Updated to XML source. o Documented interaction with variables. Changes from
    draft-ietf-sieve-regex-00: o Various cleanup and updates. o Added trial text specifying
    comparator interactions. Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an
    RFC) o The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything, about
    localization/internationalization. Are [IEEE.1003-2.1992] collating sequences
    and character equivalents sufficient? Should we reference the Unicode technical
    specification? Should we punt and publish the document as experimental? o Is the
    current approach to comparator integration the right one to use? o Should we allow
    shorthands such as \\b (word boundary) and \\w (word character)? o Should we allow
    backreferences (useful for matching double words, etc.)?</p>'
