abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses an enhancement of automated bootstrapping of
    a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to operate in domains featuring no
    or only timely limited connectivity to backend services offering enrollment functionality,
    specifically a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In the context of deploying new
    devices the design of BRSKI allows for online (synchronous object exchange) and
    offline interactions (asynchronous object exchange) with a manufacturer's authorization
    service. For this it utilizes a self- contained voucher to transport the domain
    credentials as a signed object to establish an initial trust between a pledge
    and the target deployment domain. The currently supported enrollment protocol
    for request and distribution of deployment domain specific device certificates
    provides only limited support for asynchronous PKI interactions. This memo motivates
    the enhancement of supporting self-contained objects for certificate management
    by using an abstract notation. This allows off-site operation of PKI services
    outside the deployment domain of the pledge. This addresses specifically scenarios,
    in which the final authorization of certification request of a pledge cannot be
    made in the deployment domain and is therefore delegated to a operator backend.
    The goal is to enable the usage of existing and potentially new PKI protocols
    supporting self-containment for certificate management.</p>"
