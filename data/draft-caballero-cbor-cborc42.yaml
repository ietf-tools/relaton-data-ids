abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a strict profile of CBOR Core (CBOR/c) intended
    for use with the special tag 42. Like the CBOR Core it profiles, "CBOR/c-42" can
    also be used as an internet-scale serialization for JSON, and is optimized for
    objects that compose into a directed acyclical graph. Since CBOR/c-42 objects
    link to one another by hash-based identifiers, deterministic encoding is mandated
    to verify dereferenced links and encode new ones. This document mainly targets
    CBOR tool developers and those downstream users who would like to precisely configure
    their tools. While full support in CBOR tools would be ideal and is already possible
    in some highly configurable parsing libraries, ALDRs can help close the delta
    by sidestepping the biggest interoperability stumbling blocks; see Appendix C
    for details.</p>
