abstract:
- content: "<p>STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track specifications in
    order to provide a stable reference even when RFCs are revised and the underlying
    documents change. However, the numbers are only assigned when the specifications
    reach Full Standard maturity level, significantly reducing their utility in the
    contemporary world in which few specifications advance beyond the first standardization
    maturity level. For that reason, one recent proposal suggested eliminating the
    numbers entirely. This document argues that stable references for Standards Track
    specifications are actually useful and that the solution is not to abolish the
    numbers but to change the point at which they are assigned.</p>"
