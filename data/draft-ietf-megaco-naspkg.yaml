    - the NAS Incoming package contains properties and events supported by NAS terminations
    involved in calls initiated by the circuit network; - the NAS Outgoing package
    contains properties supported by NAS terminations involved in calls outgoing to
    the circuit network; - the NAS Control package contains an event supported by
    a NAS Control termination, which allows the MG to indicate a request to initiate
