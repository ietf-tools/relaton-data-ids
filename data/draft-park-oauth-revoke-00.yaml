abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the revocation of an access token in the case
    that a client uses the access token illegally or maliciously. Contrast to the
    existing revocation defined in RFC7009, the proposed revocation is initiated by
    a resource server when the abnormal behaviors of a client such as too many DB
    queries are detected. The revocation process after revocation initiation is based
    on RFC7009.</p>"
