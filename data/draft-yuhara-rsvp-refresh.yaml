abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion on the refresh
    overhead reduction of RSVP. Specifically, this document proposes some extensions
    to deal with route change while maintaining the advantage of ID-based refreshes.
    For environments where PATH refreshes must be used to detect route change, ID-only
    refreshes are used to decrease the message size. For environments where route
    change is informed to RSVP process by some other means, a new message is introduced
    to invalidate ID.</p>"
