abstract:
- content: "<p>The Open Grid Protocol documents define the protocols by which a vast,
    Internet wide virtual world can operate. This protocol enables different regions
    of the virtual world to be operated independently, yet interoperate to form a
    cohesive experience. This document specifies the foundation upon which various
    suites of virtual world functionality are built. It describes the basic structure
    of OGP interaction and common methodology and terminology for protocols.</p>"
