abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an IMAP extension that allows a client to convert
    and retrieve message MIME parts on demand. The conversion would be from one Content-Type
    to another. The client can discover the conversion set the server supports. It
    is assumed that there are two distinct phases: one, server conversion capability
    discovery, and two, client retrieval of a converted MIME part. In addition to
    MIME type conversion this document allows for compressed body part retrieval as
    a special case of conversion.</p>"
