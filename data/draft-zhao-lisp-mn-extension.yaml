abstract:
- content: '<p>LISP describes a network-based protocol that enables separation of
    IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing
    Locators (RLOCs). No changes are required to either host protocol stacks or to
    the "core" of the Internet infrastructure. The LISP Mobile Node extension design
    described in this document uses standard LISP functionality to provide scalable
    mobility for LISP mobile nodes. This document extends the lisp, it introduces
    some contents that lisp does not include but the author think it is important
    and recommendation them to be considered in the lisp.</p>'
