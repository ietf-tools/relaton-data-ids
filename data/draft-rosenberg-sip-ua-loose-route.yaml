abstract:
- content: "<p>A key part of the behavior of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    is that SIP proxies rewrite the Request-URI as a request moves throughout the
    network. Over the years, experience has shown this to be problematic. It makes
    it difficult to use Request URI for service invocation, complicates emergency
    services, makes it more complex to support aliases, and so on. Architecturally,
    it confounds the concepts of address and route. This document proposes to change
    this through a new mechanism called UA loose routing.</p>"
