abstract:
- content: <p>The PCE is a core component of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) systems.
    A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed
    control plane by blending it with elements of SDN without necessarily completely
    replacing it. Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and
    tunneling paradigms. Each path is specified as a set of "segments" encoded in
    the header of each packet as a list of Segment Identifiers (SIDs). This document
    specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    extensions when a PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the
    forwarding actions on the routers, in addition to computing the paths for packet
    flows in the SRv6 (SR in IPv6) network and telling the edge routers what instructions
    to attach to packets as they enter the network. PCECC is further enhanced for
    SRv6 SID allocation and distribution.</p>
