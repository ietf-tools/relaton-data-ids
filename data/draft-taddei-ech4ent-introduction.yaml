abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reviews some of the Enterprises and Organizations requirements
    and constraints and tests the current Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) proposal in
    these environments. In particular it highlights the need for several clarifications
    as well as highlights known attack vectors which will become easier with the current
    ECH proposal. The current ECH drafts should consider how they want to include
    enterprises operational security capabilities to mitigate these attacks.</p>"
