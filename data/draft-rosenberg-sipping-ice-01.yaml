abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a methodology for Network Address Translator
    (NAT) traversal for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This methodology is
    called Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). ICE is not a new protocol,
    but rather makes use of existing protocols, such as Simple Traversal of UDP Through
    NAT (STUN), Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) and even Real Specific IP (RSIP).
    ICE works through the mutual cooperation of both endpoints in a SIP dialog. By
    having the endpoints work together in NAT traversal, a number of important properties
    are obtained. ICE always works, independent of the types or number of NATs. It
    always represents the cheapest solution for a carrier. It always results in the
    minimum voice latency. It can be done with no increase in call setup delays. It
    is far less brittle than STUN. ICE also facilitates the transition of the Internet
    from IPv4 to IPv6, supporting calls between dual-stack and v6 clients behind a
    4to6 NAT. Preconditions can be used in conjunction with ICE, to guarantee that
    the phone never rings unless the users will both hear and see each other when
    they pick up.</p>"
