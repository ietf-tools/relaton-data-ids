abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the extremely large scale of P2P overlay networks, complexity
    has become a major issue. With the number of connected nodes reaching into the
    millions, a platform which can accurately simulate an overlay network is important.
    Many freely available network simulators exist, ranging from modelling networks
    at the packet level to concentrating purely on the overlay network. The following
    document provides an overview of these simulators, documenting the maximum number
    of simulated nodes achieved in experiments, the P2P overlay architectures modelled
    and the chosen implementation language.</p>"
