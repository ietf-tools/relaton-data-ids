abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends VRRP mechanism to support fast transition of
    non-master router to master when the original master router (is not functioning
    or) becomes unavailable. Through introducing another state of router, named alternate
    state, when the failure of master router is detected by alternate router with
    fast detection technology, such as BFD, it will transmit to master immediately.
    Then the new master will inform other routers in its VRRP group to elect a new
    alternate router, and a fast detection session will be established between alternate
    and master routers, through which the availability of the master can be detected
    by alternate router.</p>"
