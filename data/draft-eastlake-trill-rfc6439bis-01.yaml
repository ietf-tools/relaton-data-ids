abstract:
- content: <p>TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links where a single
    link can have multiple end stations and TRILL switches attached. Where multiple
    TRILL switches are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end stations
    on that link is handled by a subset of those TRILL switches called "Appointed
    Forwarders", with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled by at
    most one TRILL switch. This document clarifies and updates the Appointed Forwarder
    mechanism. It updates RFC 6325, updates RFC 7177, and obsoletes RFC 6439.</p>
