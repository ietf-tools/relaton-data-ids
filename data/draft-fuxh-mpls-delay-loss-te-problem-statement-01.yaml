abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment and usage of cloud based applications and services that
    use an underlying MPLS network are expanding and an increasing number of applications
    are extremely sensitive to delay and packet loss. Furthermore, in cloud computing
    an additional decision problem arises of simultaneously choosing the data center
    to host applications along with MPLS network connectivity such that the overall
    performance of the application is met. Mechanisms exist to measure and monitor
    MPLS path performance parameters for packet loss and delay, but the mechanisms
    work only after the path has been setup. The cloud-based and performance sensitive
    applications would benefit from measurement of MPLS network and potential path
    information that would be provided for use in the computation before LSP setup
    and then the selection of LSPs. This document provides a statement of problems
    faced by these cloud based and performance sensitive applications and describes
    requirements to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of the MPLS network.
    This also allows new performance parameters to be reported and used in the computation
    of MPLS services in support of these cloud based and performance sensitive applications.</p>"
