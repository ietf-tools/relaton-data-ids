- content: "<p>Although NNTP [NNTP] has traditionally provided public access to newsgroups,
    it is often useful to use authentication to control resource consumption as well
    as to create restricted-access newsgroups. The NNTP AUTHINFO command described
    here provides a way to do this.</p>"
