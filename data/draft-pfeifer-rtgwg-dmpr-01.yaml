abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector routing
    protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing. It has been
    designed from scratch to work at both low and high bandwidth networks - even with
    high packet loss. The objective was to keep routing overhead low and ensure a
    deterministic protocol exchange behavior. DMPR can be used to manage larger networks
    with characteristics based on BGPv4 with transport and self-configuration properties
    taken from OSPF/OLSR. Unlike BGPv4 or OSPF, DMPR does not support higher network
    separation concepts. A DMPR network is a flat network in which DMPR nodes have
    equal tasks. This also applies to DMPR communication. Unlike OLSR/OSPF there is
    no flooding messages (topology broadcast), information are stored, accumulated/compressed
    and forwarded at each DMPR node. This feature contributes to the message load
    being deterministic.</p>"
