abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual links
    using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO). Nodes attached to AERO links
    can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding
    services to reach off-link destinations and route optimization services for improved
    performance. AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation
    of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6 ND to IP forwarding.
    Admission control and address/prefix provisioning are supported by the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), while mobility management, quality
    of service signaling and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic
    neighbor cache updates. AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling solution especially
    well suited to mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and other applications as
    described in this document.</p>"
