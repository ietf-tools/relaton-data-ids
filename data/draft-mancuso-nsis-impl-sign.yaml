abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a mechanism for NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).
    The driving motivation is that some network domains, e.g. based on Differentiated
    Services data plane, might not explicit support a per-router and/or per-domain
    admission control rule. Hence, for such domains, explicit signaling is not a viable
    approach. To partially solve this issue, we suggest an admission control paradigm
    devised to provide ?Implicit Signaling? via data plane packet delivery operation.
    Implicit Signaling relies the decision to admit a new flow upon the successful
    and timely delivery, through the domain, of Probe packets independently generated
    by the NSIS initiator (NI). The key idea is to use failed receptions of Probes
    to discover, at the NI, that a congestion condition occurs in the network segment
    between NSIS initiator and NSIS Responder (NR), and to abort a reservation procedure.
    Since Implicit Signaling is not able to communicate per-flow traffic and QoS parameters,
    in principle it cannot exert a QoS control as tight as in the case of explicit
    mechanisms. However, it is important to notice that Implicit Signaling can indeed
    operate in a differentiated manner on the basis of traffic and QOS parameters,
    if i) Probes are marked according to the flow traffic and QoS requirements, ii)
    marked Probes experience a dropping behaviour according to their mark, and iii)
    Probe dropping is controlled according to measurements taken into the core routers.</p>"
