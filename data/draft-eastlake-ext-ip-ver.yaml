abstract:
- content: "<p>The current four bit Internet Protocol (IP) Version field provides
    for such a limited number of versions that very tight control must be exercised
    on their allocation as documented in [RFC 2780]. Provisions are specified whereby
    one value of that field is extended to provide ample easily allocated values.</p>"
