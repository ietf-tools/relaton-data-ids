abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet
    electronic mail transport. It (including text carried forward from RFC 5321) consolidates,
    updates, and clarifies several previous documents, making all or parts of most
    of them obsolete. It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices for
    the contemporary Internet, but does not provide details about particular extensions.
    The document also provides information about use of SMTP for other than strict
    mail transport and delivery. This document replaces RFC 5321, the earlier version
    with the same title.</p>"
