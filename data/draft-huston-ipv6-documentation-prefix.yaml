abstract:
- content: "<p>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating documented
    examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 unicast address prefix is reserved for use
    in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like. Since site-local and
    link-local unicast addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these addresses cannot
    be used in many example situations. The document describes the use of the IPv6
    address prefix 2001:DB8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
