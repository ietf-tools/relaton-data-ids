abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of end-to-end (inner) and hop-by-hop
    (outer) cryptographic transforms within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
    (SRTP). The motivation is to support use cases when two or more end-points communicate
    via one (or more) cloud service (e.g. virtualized cloud-based conferencing) that
    are not trusted to access the media content. One of the main aspects of the transform
    is to make the confidentiality and message authentication independent of the RTP
    header. Another central aspect is to enable identification of the cryptographic
    context (keys etc.). Besides the security of the end-points, also trust assumptions
    regarding the cloud services are addressed.</p>"
