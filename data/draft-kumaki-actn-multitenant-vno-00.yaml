abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a use case that addresses the need for facilitating
    virtual network operation: creation and operation of multi-tenant virtual networks
    that use the common core network resources. This will accelerate a rapid service
    deployment of new services, including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve
    overall network operations and scaling of existing services. This use case addresses
    the aforementioned needs within a single operator network.</p>"
