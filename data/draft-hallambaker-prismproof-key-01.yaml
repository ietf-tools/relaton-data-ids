abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes previous efforts and their deployment legacy
    and the requirements for a successful email security infrastructure. A gap analysis
    is performed and the tasks divided into problems that are generally considered
    solved albeit possibly requiring improved execution and problems that may be regarded
    as research. This division of the problem space into 'execution' and 'research'
    portions allows different groups of developers to address each independently and
    avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. A testbed for development and early adopter
    deployment that achieves this separation is described.</p>"
