abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification defines how layered
    encodings can be sent over a layered transmission system. A source can stripe
    the progressive layers of a hierarchically represented signal across multiple
    RTP sessions, each carried on, for example, its own multicast group. These layered
    encodings are given special treatment in RTP, notably in that the same synchronization
    source (SSRC) identifier space is used across the sessions of all layers. The
    RTP protocol specification does not, however, explicitly state how RTP timestamps
    are to be used with layered encodings. This document updates the RTP specification
    to require that RTP timestamps for layered encodings be synchronized, i.e. that
    every layer chooses the same random initial value for the timestamp.</p>"
