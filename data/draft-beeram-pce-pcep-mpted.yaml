abstract:
- content: "<p>A Multipath Traffic Engineered Directed Acyclic Graph (MPTED) tunnel
    is a Traffic Engineering (TE) construct that facilitates weighted load balancing
    of unicast traffic across a constrained set of paths optimized for a specific
    objective. This document describes the provisioning of an MPTED Tunnel in a TE
    network using Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) in a stateful
    PCE model.</p>"
