abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant
    variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless channel conditions,
    interference, or the end-user's movement. These variations in capacity take place
    in the order of hundreds of milliseconds and is much too fast for end-to-end congestion
    signaling by itself to convey the changes for an application to adapt. Media applications
    on the other hand demand both high throughput and low latency, and are able to
    dynamically adjust the size and quality of a stream to match available network
    bandwidth. However, catering to such media flows over a radio link where the capacity
    changes rapidly requires the buffers and QoS in general to be managed carefully.
    This draft proposes to provide metadata about the media transported in each packet
    to allow the wireless network to manage radio resources optimally and to maximize
    network utilization while also improving application performance. This draft discusses
    at a high level potential solution options to this problem and the trade-offs
    involved. The draft then defines a solution that uses a new UDP option to carry
    media metadata between a UDP source and destination. This option is compact and
    has low processing overhead at the wireless router.</p>"
