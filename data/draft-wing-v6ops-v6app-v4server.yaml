abstract:
- content: <p>When an application runs on a host or network that only supports IPv6
    ("IPv6-only"), it is sometimes necessary that the application communicate with
    IPv4 peers. When that communication involves DNS, DNS64 and a 6/4 translator works
    well without any changes to most applications. However, when that communication
    does not involve DNS, it can require additional features be configured on or programmed
    into the IPv6 application. This document explains why this functionality is important
    and describes mechanisms for applications to provide such functionality.</p>
