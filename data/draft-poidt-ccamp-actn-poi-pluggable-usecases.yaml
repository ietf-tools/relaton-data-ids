abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides general overarching guidelines for control and
    management of packet over optical converged networks and focuses on operators'
    use cases with requirements and network topologies. It provides a set of use cases
    and requirements which are needed to achieve full automation for control and management
    of the packet over optical networks which comprise devices with mixes of packet
    and optical functions where the optical functions may be provided on coherent
    pluggables. It is intended that other IETF drafts in this area reference this
    draft and abide by the use cases and requirements in this draft. The realization
    of these use cases is out of scope of this draft and shall be covered in other
    IETF drafts.</p>"
