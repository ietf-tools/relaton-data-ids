abstract:
- content: "<p>This extensions defines an additional protective layer for changes
    to domain [RFC5731], host [RFC5732] and contact [RFC5733] objects managed through
    EPP. EPP allows changes to objects only by the sponsoring client. EPP objects
    are usually managed by the sponsoring client on behalf of the sponsoring clients
    customers. All of these interactions are ususally fully automated. In case of
    a system breach, there is no protection in EPP to changes to any object by the
    intruder. This extension defines a protective layer that aims to break automated
    changes and work flows by requiring manual intervention. The actual form of manual
    intervention is out-of-scope for this document. By whom and how changes can be
    made is up to the registry and registrars to decide.</p>"
