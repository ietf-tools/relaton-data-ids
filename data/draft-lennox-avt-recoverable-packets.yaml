abstract:
- content: "<p>In some circumstances, it is useful and desirable for the sender of
    an RTP stream to be able to deliver a subset of its RTP packets reliably. One
    example of this is a video codec which can encode a video stream such that decoder
    state can be maintained using just a subset of the packets encoded. However, existing
    RTP reliability mechanisms only define mechanisms which retransmit all the packets
    of an RTP stream. This document describes a mechanism by which the sender of an
    RTP stream can mark a subset of the packets of an RTP stream as high- priority
    recoverable packets, and by which the receiver of the stream can request retransmission
    of the high-priority packets.</p>"
