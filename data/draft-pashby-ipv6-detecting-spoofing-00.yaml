abstract:
- content: '<p>The purpose of this draft is to provide a method to detect exploitation
    of inherent vulnerabilities in the Neighbor Discovery processes. There are two
    well documented vulnerabilities in the basic IPv6 architecture: Neighbor Discover
    spoofing and Host Redirection. There already exists the SeND RFC [send] that addresses
    authenticating these interactions. Certain networks may choose not to uses (or
    cannot use) SeND, for instance, networks that use DHCP or statically assigned
    addresses. There is an underlying security principle that says, "If you can block
    a attack do it. If you cannot block it, detect it. Even if you can block it, detect
    it." This proposal outlines simple modifications to the basic protocols to allow
    for easily detecting these attacks. Through proactive systems, once an attack
    is detected it could easily provide blocking by isolating the attacking host via
    Access Control Lists (ACLs) or disabling ports. The basic method proposed is to
    force packets used in these attacks to be multicast to the attacked nodes Solicited
    Node Multicast group, thus allowing a security device to detect when it is occurring.</p>'
