abstract:
- content: "<p>STUN provides an easy way to traverse some types of NATs and it will
    work satisfactorily in many NAT deployments. To overcome STUN's limitations, one
    solution is to accept the idea that NATs can change too (and they've been proven
    to change, an example being the proliferation of IPsec pass-thru NAT devices)
    and to colocate STUN server functionality on the NAT box itself. Upon receipt
    of a STUN request, the server colocated within the NAT device allocates addresses
    and ports, and installs bindings. This allows hosts running the STUN client software
    to transparently achieve symmetric NAT traversal and to make themselves addressable
    from the Global Internet.</p>"
