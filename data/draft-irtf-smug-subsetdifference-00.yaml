abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a key management mechanism for multicast communication
    sessions that is based on the 'Subset-Difference' algorithm. The Subset-Difference
    algorithm is a new revocation scheme which allows a Center (such as a Group Controller/
    Key Manager) to send a message so that *every* authorized receiver, but none of
    the revoked receivers, can decrypt.</p>"
