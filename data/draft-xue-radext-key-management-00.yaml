abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to guarantee the security and integration of the subscriber
    in WLAN network, Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated as an access authorization
    token during the mutual authentication procedure between station (STA) and authenticator
    server (AS). Then, the PMK and 4-way handshake are used between STA and Authenticator
    to derive, bind and verify the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is a collection
    of operational keys for security. Also,Group Transient Key (GTK) can be derived,
    and is used to secure multicast/broadcast traffic. In the authentication architecture,
    only STA and AS can manufacture PMK, moreover, AS can only distribute PMK to Authenticator.However,
    if the authenticator function is not collocated with the encryption/decryption
    function, it is difficult to achieve traffic encryption/decryption in WLAN network.The
    purpose of this document is to analyze the requirement and issue for key management
    that have arisen so far during STA authentication process in WLAN network. Meanwhile,
    the control messages for key management are defined.</p>"
