abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a detailed analysis of the problems and requirements
    of network addressing in "Internet in space" for terrestrial users. It introduces
    the basics of satellite mega- constellations, terrestrial terminals/ground stations,
    and their inter-networking. Then it explicitly analyzes how space-terrestrial
    mobility yeilds challenges for the logical topology, addressing, and their impact
    on routing. The requirements of addressing in the space-terrestrial network are
    discussed in detail, including uniqueness, stability, locality, scalability, efficiency
    and backward compatibility with terrestrial Internet. The problems and requirements
    of network addressing in space-terrestrial networks are finally outlined.</p>
