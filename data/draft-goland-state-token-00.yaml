abstract:
- content: "<p>There are times when a principal will want to predicate successful
    execution of a method on the current state of a resource. While HTTP/1.1 provides
    a mechanism for conditional execution of methods using entity tags via the 'If-Match'
    and 'If-None-Match' headers, the mechanism is not sufficiently extensible to express
    conditional statements involving more generic state indicators, such as lock tokens.
    This draft defines the term 'state token' as an identifier for a state of a resource.
    This draft defines requirements for state tokens and provides a state token syntax,
    along with two new headers which are used to express method preconditions using
    state tokens.</p>"
