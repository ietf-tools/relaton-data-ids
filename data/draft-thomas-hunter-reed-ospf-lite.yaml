abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents OSPF-lite. OSPF-lite is a link state routing protocol,
    and a branch version of Internet Standard 54 OSPF [ref1]. It is designed to be
    run internal to a single Autonomous System. Each OSPF-lite router maintains an
    identical database describing the Autonomous System's topology. From this database,
    a routing table is calculated by constructing a shortest-path tree. OSPF-lite
    has been designed to provide a simpler version of the OSPF protocol. A router
    running ospf-lite requires little configuration. Areas are not implemented and
    all designated Router functionality has been removed from the protocol. OSPF-lite
    will run over non fully meshed clouds with no special OSPF configuration commands
    required. Many of the Protocol complexities have been removed, and processor overhead
    utilised in a different way. This work is intended to keep pace with the vast
    increases in processor performance, memory size and link capacity since OSPF was
    originally designed in 1989, with the resulting benefits of simpler network design,
    configuration and maintenance. The differences between this memo and RFC 2328
    are highlighted throughout the document, but special attention should be placed
    on Sections 2, 7, 16, and Appendix A; the latter describes detailed packet structures.
    Many of the differences are backward compatible in nature, but it is not envisioned
    that OSPF Version 2 will interoperate with OSPF-lite, unless multiple instances
    are running and route redistribution is employed. The protocol has been designed
    with backward consistency in mind, as far has been possible, to allow code modules
    developed for OSPF Version 2 to be re-utilised. This Internet Draft has been written
    within the same structure as RFC 2328, to enable a section-by-section comparison
    with previous versions of the main OSPF protocol. It is recommended that the sections
    are directly compared. The authorsâ€™ thanks in turn go the developers of all of
    the features in RFC 2328, and associated RFCs, and Standards.</p>"
