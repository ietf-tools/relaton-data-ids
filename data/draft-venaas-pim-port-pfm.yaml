abstract:
- content: "<p>The PIM Flooding Protocol (PFM) defined in RFC8364 relies on sending
    periodic updates as it does not provide for any reliability. If a message is lost,
    the information will be provided in the next periodic update. This document extends
    the Reliable Transport Mechanism for PIM in RFC6559 to allow for sending PFM messages.
    This significantly reduces the PFM signaling by not requiring frequent periodic
    updates, and it provides for retransmission, allowing for quick recovery when
    an IP packet is dropped.</p>"
