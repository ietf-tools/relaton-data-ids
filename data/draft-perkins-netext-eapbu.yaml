abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is commonly used for access
    authentication in many wireless networks. EAP methods often involve AAA servers
    to effect the required authentications; notifications about success or failure
    are then relayed back to a functional module in the access network known as the
    Network Access Server. The Binding Authentication Data option has been defined
    for enabling alternative methods for authentication in the context of Mobile IPv6,
    and there is a subtype allocated for AAA-based authentication methods such as
    EAP. However, some EAP methods require additional handling that requires specification
    not yet available in the existing documentation for the Binding Authentication
    Data option. This document provides the required specification for at least some
    very widely deployed EAP methods. In many situations requiring the use of EAP,
    this enables much faster operation for Mobile IPv6 tunnel redirection to a wireless
    device's new care-of address by avoiding having to do multiple authentications.</p>"
