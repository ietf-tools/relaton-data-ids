abstract:
- content: "<p>In MIPv6 [1], whenever a mobile node changes its attached point, handover
    process should be followed to inform its home agent and correspondent of a MN's
    current location. The handover process is decomposed into layer 2 and layer 3
    handovers again, and these two handovers are accomplished sequentially, which
    causes long latency problem. This problem is a critical issue in MIPv6. To make
    up for this, we propose an enhanced Fast Handover scheme to reduce the overall
    latency on handover, revising the Fast Handover [2]. Especially, several messages
    in layer 3 are sent in one frame during layer 2 handover.</p>"
