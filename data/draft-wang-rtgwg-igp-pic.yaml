abstract:
- content: "<p>In many cases, a large number of routes can be reached by multiple
    next hops. When a link fails, route calculation needs to be performed and a new
    reachable path needs to be calculated. If all routes are re-calculated and refreshed,
    the calculation time increases linearly as the number of routes increases, resulting
    in a long time for route convergence. This document describes an architecture
    where the number of prefixes is independent. This architecture allows routes to
    be recalculated when paths change, regardless of the number of IGP routes.</p>"
