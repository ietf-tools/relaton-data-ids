abstract:
- content: "<p>Many media types may be used in situations where it may beneficial
    to indicate that the object represented in this media type is not yet (or no longer)
    present. The Observe option introduced in Observing Resources in the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) (RFC7641) requires sequences of responses (notifications)
    to carry the same Content-Format. The application/maybe media type provides a
    way to use a single media type (and thus Content-Format) to express presence or
    absence of information in a specific media type.</p>"
