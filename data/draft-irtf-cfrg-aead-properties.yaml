abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms provide
    confidentiality and integrity of data. The extensive use of AEAD algorithms in
    various high-level applications has caused the need for AEAD algorithms with additional
    properties and motivated research in the area. This document gives definitions
    for the most common of those properties intending to improve consistency in the
    field.</p>"
