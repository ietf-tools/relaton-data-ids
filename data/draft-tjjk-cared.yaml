abstract:
- content: "<p>For privacy reasons, encrypted DNS clients need to be anonymous to
    their encrypted DNS servers to prevent third parties from correlating client DNS
    queries with other data for surveillance or data mining purposes. However, there
    are cases where the client and server have a pre-existing relationship and each
    peer wants to prove its identity to the other. For example, an encrypted DNS server
    may only wish to accept resolutions from encrypted DNS clients that are managed
    by the same enterprise. This requires mutual authentication. This document defines
    when using client authentication with encrypted DNS is appropriate, the benefits
    and limitations of doing so, and the recommended authentication mechanism(s) when
    communicating with TLS- based encrypted DNS protocols.</p>"
