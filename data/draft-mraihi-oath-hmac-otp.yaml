abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an algorithm to generate one-time password
    values, based on Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC). A security analysis
    of the algorithm is presented, and important parameters related to the secure
    deployment of the algorithm are discussed. The proposed algorithm can be used
    across a wide range of network applications ranging from remote Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) access, Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented Web applications.
    This work is a joint effort by the OATH (Open AuTHentication) membership to specify
    an algorithm that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors
    believe that a common and shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor
    authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability across commercial
    and open-source implementations. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
