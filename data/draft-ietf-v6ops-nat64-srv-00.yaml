abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the way of discovering the NAT64 pools in use
    as well as DNS servers providing DNS64 service to the local clients. The discovery
    is done via SRV records, which also allows asignment of priorities to the NAT64
    pools as well as DNS64 servers. It also allows clients to have diferent DNS providers
    than NAT64 provider, while providing a secure way via DNSSEC validation of provided
    SRV records. This way, it provides DNS64 service even in case where DNS over HTTPS
    is used.</p>"
