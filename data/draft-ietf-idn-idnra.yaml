abstract:
- content: "<p>The current DNS infrastructure does not provide a way to use internationalized
    host names (IDN). This document describes a mechanism that requires no changes
    to any DNS server that will allow internationalized host names to be used by end
    users with changes only to resolvers and applications. It allows flexibility for
    user input and display, and assures that host names that have non-ASCII characters
    are not sent to servers.</p>"
