abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) describes how one origin's resource
    can be accessed via a different protocol/host/port combination. Alternatives are
    advertised by servers using the Alt- Svc header field or the ALTSVC frame. This
    includes a protocol name, which reuses Application Layer Protocol Negotiation
    (ALPN) codepoints. The "h3" codepoint indicates the availability of HTTP/3. A
    client that uses such an alternative first makes a QUIC connection. However, without
    a priori knowledge of which QUIC version to use, clients might incur a round-trip
    latency penalty to complete QUIC version negotiation, or forfeit desirable properties
    of a QUIC version. This document specifies a new Alt-Svc parameter that specifies
    alternative supported QUIC versions, which substantially reduces the chance of
    this penalty. Similarly, clients can retrieve additional instructions about access
    to services or resources via DNS SVCB and HTTP Resource Records. This document
    also defines a new SvcParamKey for these Resource Records, which specifies the
    specific QUIC versions in use.</p>
