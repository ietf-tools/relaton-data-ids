abstract:
- content: "<p>Carrier grade NAT (CGN) devices are required to log events like creation
    and deletion of translations and information about the resources it is managing.
    The logs are required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host that was
    used to launch malicious attacks and/or for various other purposes of accounting.
    Since there is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices
    behave differently and hence it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior.
    The lack of a consistent way makes it difficult to write the collector applications
    that would receive this data and process it to present useful information. This
    document describes the information that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.</p>"
