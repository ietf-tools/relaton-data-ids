abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Megaco working group is currently working on defining a proto-
    col for controlling Media Gateways (MG) from external control elements such as
    a Media Gateway Controller (MGC). Different models have been proposed to address
    this problem, and in order to judge the different models, a series of test cases
    will be considered. This document explains how the Media Gateway Control Protocol
    (MGCP) can be used to handle the first test case, which considers a Voice over
    IP gateway with directly subtending DTMF lines placing a call to an H.323 client.
    The document contains an introduction with further details on the test case, two
    different call flows to solve it, followed by the conclusion of the test case.
    MGCP is defined in a companion document [0].</p>"
