abstract:
- content: "<p>Through the establishment of bi-directional tunnels between a mobile
    router and home agent, global connectivity can be extended to nodes within a network
    in motion. However, the multiple levels of bi- directional tunnels in nested mobile
    networks lead to undesirable effects. This memo proposes using a new mobility
    header option called the Access Router Option to allow a mobile router to inform
    its home agent the home-address of the access router it is currently attached
    to. From there, this memo lays out a mechanism that allows mobile routers to securely
    achieve nested tunnels optimization.</p>"
