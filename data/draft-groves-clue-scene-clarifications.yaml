abstract:
- content: "<p>The CLUE framework document defines the concept of media captures which
    identify and describe the characteristics of media sent by a provider. A capture
    scene is a grouping concept that provides ties a number of captures together.
    Within the capture scene the media captures may further be grouped into capture
    scene entries. The current text in the CLUE framework document describing these
    concepts could be improved and clarified so that both providers and consumers
    use the same logic to encode/decode CLUE messages with capture scenes/ capture
    scene entries and media captures. This draft discusses these concepts and provides
    suggested updates.</p>"
