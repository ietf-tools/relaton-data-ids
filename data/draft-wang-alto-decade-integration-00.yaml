abstract:
- content: "<p>While DECADE architecture is going to provide a framework to use in-
    network storage with standard interface for content distribution, there are still
    cases when many in-network storage servers provide the same content. Then traffic
    optimization mechanism is needed to select one best replica for the user request.
    This document is going to discuss the integration of Application Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol into DECADE so as to optimize network traffic.</p>"
