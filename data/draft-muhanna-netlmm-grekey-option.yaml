abstract:
- content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 base specification and Proxy Mobile IPv6 support
    for IPv4 allow the mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 traffic between the local mobility
    anchor and the mobile access gateway to be tunneled using IPv6 or IPv4 encapsulation
    headers. These encapsulation modes do not offer the tunnel end-points the required
    semantics to expose a service identifier that can be used to identify traffic
    for a certain classification, such as for supporting mobile nodes that are using
    overlapping private IPv4 addressing. The extension defined in this document allow
    the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor to negotiate GRE encapsulation
    mode and exchange the GRE keys for marking the flows, so that differential processing
    can be applied by the tunnel peers over those flows.</p>"
