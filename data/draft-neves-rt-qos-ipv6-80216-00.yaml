abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the support of IPv6 QoS aware real-time services
    over IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] networks. In particular, it provides a novel solution
    to overcome the limitations of the IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] system to support real-time
    and dynamic environments. Specifically, this solution supports dynamic and fast
    access from the Mobile Nodes to the network services and dynamic reservations
    and modifications of services. These fast and dynamic reservations are crucial
    to the support of fast mobility approaches. Moreover, the proposed solution is
    also able to provide IPv6 support and efficient traffic differentiation for services
    running on the same MN.</p>"
