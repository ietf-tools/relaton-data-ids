abstract:
- content: "<p>A slice aggregate is a collection of packets that match a slice policy
    selection criteria and are given the same forwarding treatment. Slice Aggregate
    aware Traffic Engineering (SA-TE) is a mechanism that facilitates Traffic Engineering
    (TE) path selection to take into account the available network resources associated
    with a specific slice aggregate. This document specifies the Interior Gateway
    Protocol (IGP) extensions for support of SA-TE. This includes the generalization
    of the semantics of a number of IGP extensions already defined for existing MPLS
    Traffic Engineering in [RFC3630], [RFC4124], [RFC5305] and additional IGP extensions
    beyond those.</p>"
