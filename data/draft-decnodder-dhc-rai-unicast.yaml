abstract:
- content: <p>In some network topologies, it is preferred to have a trusted network
    element between the DHCP client and the L3 relay agent that adds the DHCP relay-agent-information
    option but does not set the giaddr field. They operate in Layer 2 mode and hence
    act as trusted Layer 2 relay agents. The replies from the server are broadcasted
    by the L3 relay agents to these L2 relay agents which must be avoided. This document
    defines a new sub-option for the relay-agent-information option. With this sub-option,
    the L3 relay agent will always unicast the messages towards the trusted layer
    2 DHCP relay agent with a hardware address that is known in the network. The new
    sub-option is called the "unicast-address" sub-option.</p>
