abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint security.
    In the fifteen years since RFC 3552 security issues and cyber attacks have increased,
    especially on the endpoint. This document proposes a new approach to Internet
    cyber security protocol development that focuses on the user of the Internet,
    namely those who use the endpoint and are the most vulnerable to attacks.</p>"
