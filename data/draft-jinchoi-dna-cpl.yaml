abstract:
- content: "<p>Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host determines whether
    a link change has occurred to examine the validity of its IP configuration. This
    draft presents a way to robustly check for link change without assuming changes
    to the routers. Each link can be uniquely identified by the set of prefixes assigned
    to it. We propose that, at each attached link, the host generates the complete
    prefix list, that is, the prefix list contains all the prefixes on the link, and
    when it receives a hint that indicates a possible link change, it detects the
    identity of the currently attached link by consulting the existing prefix list.
    This memo describes how to generate the complete prefix list and to robustly detect
    the link identity even in the presence of packet losses.</p>"
