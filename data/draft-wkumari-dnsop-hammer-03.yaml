abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple DNS cache optimization which keeps
    the most popular Resource Records set (RRset) in the DNS cache: Highly Automated
    Method for Maintaining Expiring Records (HAMMER). The principle is that popular
    RRset in the cache are fetched, that is to say resolved before their TTL expires
    and flushed. By fetching RRset before they are being queried by an end user, that
    is to say prefetched, HAMMER is expected to improve the quality of experience
    of the end users as well as to optimize the resources involved in large DNSSEC
    resolving platforms.</p>"
