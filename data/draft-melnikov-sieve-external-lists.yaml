abstract:
- content: "<p>Sieve scripting language can be used for implementing of whitelisting,
    blacklisting and personal distribution lists. Currently this requires that all
    members of such lists be hardcoded in the script itself. Whenever a member of
    such list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded
    to a mail server. This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally
    stored mailing lists, i.e. list whose members are stored externally to the script,
    for example in LDAP (RFC 4510), ACAP (RFC 2244) or a relational database. ToDo
    o Need a way to advertise supported URI schemas in ManageSieve and ihave.</p>"
