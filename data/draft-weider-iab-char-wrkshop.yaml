abstract:
- content: "<p>This report details the conclusions of an IAB-sponsored invitational
    workshop held 29 February - 1 March, 1996, to discuss the use of character sets
    on the Internet. It motivates the need to have character set handling in Internet
    protocols which transmit text, provides a conceptual framework for specifying
    character sets, recommends the use of MIME tagging for transmitted text, recommends
    a default character set *without* stating that there is no need for other character
    sets, and makes a series of recommendations to the IAB, IANA, and the IESG for
    furthering the integration of the character set framework into text transmission
    protocols. This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo
    does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
