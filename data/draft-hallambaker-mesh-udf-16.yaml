abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the underlying naming and addressing schemes
    used in the Mathematical Mesh. The means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint
    (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs are described.
    A UDF consists of a binary sequence, the initial eight bits of which specify a
    type identifier code. For convenience, UDFs are typically presented to the user
    in the form of a Base32 encoded string. Type identifier codes have been selected
    so as to provide a useful mnemonic indicating their purpose when presented in
    Base32 encoding. Two categories of UDF are described. Data UDFs provide a compact
    presentation of a fixed length binary data value in a format that is convenient
    for data entry. A Data UDF may represent a cryptographic key, a nonce value or
    a share of a secret. Fingerprint UDFs provide a compact presentation of a Message
    Digest or Message Authentication Code value. A Strong Internet Name (SIN) consists
    of a DNS name which contains at least one label that is a UDF fingerprint of a
    policy document controlling interpretation of the name. SINs allow a direct trust
    model to be applied to achieve end-to-end security in existing Internet applications
    without the need for trusted third parties. UDFs may be presented as URIs to form
    either names or locators for use with the UDF location service. An Encrypted Authenticated
    Resource Locator (EARL) is a UDF locator URI presenting a service from which an
    encrypted resource may be obtained and a symmetric key that may be used to decrypt
    the content. EARLs may be presented on paper correspondence as a QR code to securely
    provide a machine- readable version of the same content. This may be applied to
    automate processes such as invoicing or to provide accessibility services for
    the partially sighted. [Note to Readers] Discussion of this draft takes place
    on the MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.
