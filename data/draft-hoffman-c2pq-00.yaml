abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum features
    in calculations. For over 20 years, it has been known that if large- scale quantum
    computers could be built, they could have a devastating effect on classical cryptographic
    algorithms such as RSA and elliptic curve signatures and key exchange, as well
    as on encryption algorithms. There has already been a great deal of study on how
    to create algorithms that will resist large-scale quantum computers, but so far,
    the properties of those algorithms make them onerous to adopt before they are
    needed. Small-scale quantum computers are being built today, but it is still far
    from clear when large-scale quantum computers that can be used to break classical
    algorithms with key sizes commonly used today will be available. It is important
    to be able to predict when large-scale quantum computers usable for cryptanalysis
    will be possible so that organization can change to post-quantum cryptographic
    algorithms well before they are needed. This document describes quantum computing,
    how it can be used to attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly
    how to predict when large-scale quantum computers will become feasible.</p>"
