abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to clarify terms and concepts presented in RFC 3095.
    RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles for RObust Header
    Compression (ROHC). The standard introduces various concepts which might be difficult
    to understand and especially to relate correctly to the surrounding environments
    where header compression may be used. This document aims at clarifying these aspects
    of ROHC, discussing terms such as ROHC instances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback,
    and ROHC contexts, and how these terms relate to other terms, like network elements
    and IP interfaces, commonly used, for example, when addressing MIB issues. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
