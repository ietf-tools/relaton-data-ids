abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration
    (SADI), a set of best practices for implementing stateless web services that consume
    RDF data as input and generate RDF data as output. The goal of SADI is to establish
    conventions that will enable a much higher level of interoperability between web
    services from independent providers than is currently possible under the widespread
    use of WSDL/XML and RESTful services. Under SADI, interoperability depends on
    the shared use of predicate vocabularies, rather than the shared use of particular
    XML schemas, JSON structures, or ad hoc data formats. Through the use of OWL to
    describe service input and output datatypes, SADI enables: i) automated discovery
    of services that provide data or computations of interest, and ii) automated matchmaking
    between local data and available services. By iterative application of the former
    two capabilities, SADI enables semi-automated construction of arbitrarily complex
    workflows across independent service providers.</p>"
