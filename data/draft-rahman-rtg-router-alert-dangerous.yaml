abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides guidelines to address security concerns which
    arise with the use of IP Router Alert option [RFC2113] and [RFC2711]. RSVP,[RFC2205]
    and [RFC3209], and IGMP [RFC3376] are some of the protocols which make use of
    the IP Router Alert option. IP datagrams carrying the Router Alert option are
    usually examined in a router's "slow path" and an excess of such datagrams can
    cause performance degradation or packet drops in a router's "slow path".</p>
