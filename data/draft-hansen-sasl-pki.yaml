abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a user/password Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer(SASL) mechanism called the PKI mechanism. The PKI mechanism is intended
    to be used in situations where (1) passwords must be encrypted, (2) the password
    must be recoverable, and (3) using TLS in combination with a SASL mechanism such
    as PLAIN is inappropriate. NOTE: This document is a straw proposal to see what
    interest there is in having a SASL mechanism such as this. See the first section
    below for more information on why this mechanism is needed.</p>"
