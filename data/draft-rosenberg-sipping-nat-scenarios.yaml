abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a set of examples about how to establish sessions
    through Network Address Translators (NATs) using the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). NAT traversal for SIP is accomplished using Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE), which allows the media streams to work, in addition to the SIP extension
    for symmetric response routing, which allows SIP itself to flow through NAT. The
    examples cover a range of network topologies and use cases. This variability helps
    to demonstrate that the ICE methodology always works, and that a common client
    algorithm, independent of the network topology and deployment configuration, results
    in the best connectivity.</p>"
