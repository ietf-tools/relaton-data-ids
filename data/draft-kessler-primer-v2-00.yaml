abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is an introductory guide to some of the TCP/IP and Internet
    tools and utilities that allow users to access the wide variety of information
    on the network, from determining if a particular host is up to viewing a multimedia
    thesis on foreign policy. It also describes discussion lists accessible from the
    Internet, ways to obtain Internet and TCP/IP documents, and some resources that
    help users weave their way through the Internet. This memo may be used as a tutorial
    for individual self-learning, a step-by-step laboratory manual for a course, or
    as the basis for a site's users manual. It is intended as a basic guide only and
    will refer to other sources for more detailed information.</p>"
