abstract:
- content: "<p>The Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security Service Application
    Program Interface (IDUP-GSS-API) extends the GSS-API [RFC-1508] for applications
    requiring protection of a generic data unit (such as a file or message) in a way
    which is independent of the protection of any other data unit and independent
    of any concurrent contact with designated 'receivers' of the data unit. Thus,
    it is suitable for applications such as secure electronic mail where data needs
    to be protected without any on-line connection with the intended recipient(s)
    of that data. Subsequent to being protected, the independent data unit can be
    transferred to the recipient(s) - or to an archive - perhaps to be processed only
    days or years later.</p>"
