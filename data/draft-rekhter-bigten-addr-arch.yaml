abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper provides an architecture for allocating IPng addresses in
    the Internet. This paper does not go into the details of an addressing plan. This
    paper focuses on addressing for a particular proposal known as BigTen, but the
    general principles apply to any hierarchically allocated address space. The IPng
    address space is a finite shared resource that must be managed for the good of
    the community. The managers of this resource are acting as its custodians. They
    have a responsibility to the community to manage it for the common good.</p>"
