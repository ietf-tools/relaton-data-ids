abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an address management module for mobile Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP). The module is used for a mobile node to
    manage the IP addresses associated with an mSCTP association. The address management
    module utilizes the link layer signal strength information in order to determine
    when to add or delete end-point IP addresses of a mobile node and how to change
    the primary path from the mSCTP association when a handover happens.</p>"
