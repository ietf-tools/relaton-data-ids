abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a revised model for the management, evolution
    and improvement of the RFC Series led by an RFC Series Editor (RSE) assisted by
    an RFC Series Editorial Board (RSEB). The model removes the IAB and its appointed
    RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) from direct control of the RFC Series and
    the RFC Series Editor, replacing them on the publication evolution side with the
    RSEB, and on the financial and personnel management side with the IETF Administration
    Limited Liability Company or its board as appropriate (LLC).</p>"
