abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft is intended to provide a means for 'IP Clustering'
    across multiple servers. It is meant as an improved alternative to the various
    solutions for distributing WWW traffic already attempted by the IETF DNS Working
    Group. In addition, the clustering method can be applied not only to a heavily
    visited web server, but also to any overloaded TCP/IP servers such as a domain
    name server. The IP Cluster provides two primary functions: IP traffic distribution
    to multiple servers and fault-tolerance.</p>"
