abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extensible mechanism that allows a RIPv2
    [RIP2] speaker to advertise summarized routes to its peers without changing the
    format of the RESPONSE message. Summarized routes are carried in RESPONSE message
    like normal RIPv2 routes. Summarized routes are treated as normal routes on the
    receiving side. No extra provisions are required to discriminate between summarized
    and normal routes. The mechanisms described in this document is OPTIONAL and is
    applicable to all RIPv2 speaking routers, with some modifications in the routing
    information base and output processing for storing and advertising summary routes.
    This mechanism cannot be applied to RIPv1 [RIP1].</p>"
