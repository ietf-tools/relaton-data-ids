abstract:
- content: "<p>Content delivery is frequently provided by specifically architected
    and provisioned Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). As a result of significant growth
    in content delivered over IP networks, existing CDN providers are scaling up their
    infrastructure. Many Network Service Providers (NSPs) and Enterprise Service Providers
    (ESPs) are also deploying their own CDNs. To deliver contents from the Content
    Service Provider (CSP) to end users, the contents may traverse across multiple
    CDNs. This creates a need for interconnecting (previously) standalone CDNs so
    that they can collectively act as a single delivery platform from the CSP to the
    end users. The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for
    the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working group.</p>"
