- content: "<p>This document describes the use cases and requirements for simulcast
    and layered video coding support in WebRTC. These techniques simplify the implementation
    of video stream adaptation to different participants in centralized conferencing
    solutions. This document also includes a proposal to expose these capabilities
    in the existing PeerConnection API by defining new media constraint properties.</p>"
