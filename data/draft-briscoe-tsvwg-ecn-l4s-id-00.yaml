abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets
    for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput
    (L4S). It is similar to the original (or 'Classic') Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN). 'Classic' ECN marking was required to be equivalent to a drop, both when
    applied in the network and when responded to by a transport. Unlike 'Classic'
    ECN marking, the network applies the L4S identifier more immediately and more
    aggressively than drop, and the transport response to each mark is reduced and
    smoothed relative to that for drop. The two changes counterbalance each other
    so that the bit-rate of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a 'Classic' flow
    under the same conditions. However, the much more frequent control signals and
    the finer responses to them result in ultra-low queuing delay without compromising
    link utilization, even during high load. Examples of new active queue management
    (AQM) marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time)
    are specified separately. The new L4S identifier is the key piece that enables
    them to interwork and distinguishes them from 'Classic' traffic. It gives an incremental
    migration path so that existing 'Classic' TCP traffic will be no worse off, but
    it can be prevented from degrading the ultra-low delay and loss of the new scalable
    transports.</p>"
