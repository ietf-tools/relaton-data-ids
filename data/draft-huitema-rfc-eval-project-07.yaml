abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the author's effort to understand the delays
    involved in publishing an idea in the IETF or through the Independent Stream,
    from the first individual draft to the publication of the RFC. We analyze a set
    of randomly chosen RFCs approved in 2018, looking for history and delays. We also
    use two randomly chosen sets of RFCs published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing
    delays seen in 2018 to those observed 10 or 20 years ago. The average RFC in the
    2018 sample was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months
    were spent in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review,
    and 3 to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation in RFC production delays
    comes from the AUTH48 phase. We also measure the number of citations of the chosen
    RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about
    deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but correlate
    only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications. Counting web references
    could complement that.</p>"
