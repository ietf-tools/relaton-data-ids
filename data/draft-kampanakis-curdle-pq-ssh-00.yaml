abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines hybrid key exchange methods based on classical
    ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes. These methods are
    defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol. It also defines post-quantum
    public key authentication methods based on post-quantum signature schemes. These
    methods are defined for use in the SSH Authentication Protocol. Note EDNOTE: The
    goal of this draft is to start the standardization of PQ algorithms in SSH early
    to mitigate the potential record-and-harvest later with a quantum computer attacks.
    This draft is not expected to be finalized before the NIST PQ Project has standardized
    PQ algorithms. After NIST has standardized then this document will replace TBD1,
    TBD3 with the appropriate algorithms and parameters before proceeding to ratification.
    EDNOTE: Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the IETF WG Mailing
    List or in the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/csosto-pk/pq-ssh/issues
