abstract:
- content: "<p>ISAKMP and PKIX both provide frameworks that must be profiled for use
    in a given application. This document provides a profile of ISAKMP and PKIX that
    defines the requirements for using PKI technology in the context of IPsec. The
    document compliments protocol specifications such as IKE, which assume the existence
    of public key certificates and related keying materials, but which do not address
    PKI issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues.</p>"
