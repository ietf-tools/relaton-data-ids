abstract:
- content: '<p>Massive pervasive monitoring attacks using key exfiltration and made
    possible by key exchange without forward secrecy have been reported. If key exchange
    without Diffie-Hellman is used, static exfiltration of the long-term authentication
    keys enables passive attackers to compromise all past and future connections.
    Malicious actors can get access to long-term keys in different ways: physical
    attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding
    access to keying material with or without a court order. Exfiltration attacks
    are a major cybersecurity threat. If NULL encryption is used an on-path attacker
    can read all application data. The use of psk_ke and NULL encryption are not following
    zero trust principles of minimizing the impact of breach and governments have
    already made deadlines for their deprecation. This document evaluates TLS pre-shared
    key exchange modes, (EC)DHE groups, signature algorithms, and cipher suites and
    downgrades many entries to "N" and "D" where "D" indicates that the entries are
    "Discouraged".</p>'
