abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for virtual
    network operation for mobile operators, which is facilitated by the application
    of network abstraction. These abstractions shall create a virtual network operation
    environment supporting mobile operators in viewing, managing and operating multi-domains
    of many dimensions (e.g., radio access, backhaul transport, mobile DC edge, mobile
    DC core, packet/optical transport for DC interconnect, etc.) as a single virtualized
    network. This use-case considers the application of these abstractions and the
    need for the associated operational mechanisms within the network of a single
    operator.</p>"
