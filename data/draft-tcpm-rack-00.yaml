abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a new TCP loss detection algorithm called RACK
    ("Recent ACKnowledgment"). RACK uses the notion of time, instead of packet or
    sequence counts, to detect losses, for modern TCP implementations that can support
    per-packet timestamps and the selective acknowledgment (SACK) option. It is intended
    to replace the conventional DUPACK threshold approach and its variants, as well
    as other nonstandard approaches.</p>
