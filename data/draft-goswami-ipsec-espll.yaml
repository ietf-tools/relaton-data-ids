abstract:
- content: "<p>The trend has been to use different encryption mechanism for different
    layers. Although it can be argued that multiple layers is good protection, such
    an approach is higly inefficient from the view performance and necessity. In some
    situations this kind separate encryption mechanism may afford the bytes 7 levels
    of encryption, for example : AES (from 802.11)+ 3DES (from IPSec) + 3DES (from
    TLS/SSL). Recently link layer encryption has become an important issue, specially
    in the context of wireless networks. Although this document does not attempt to
    solve this multiple layer encryption issue, it is an effort to that goal. Specifically,
    this document describes a way to use ESP in several link layer technologies.</p>"
