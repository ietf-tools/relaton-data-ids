abstract:
- content: '<p>The fast increase in traffic volumn within and outside Datacenters
    is placing an unprecendented challenge on the underline network, in both the capacity
    it can provide, and the way it delivers traffic. When a large portion of network
    traffic is contributed by large flows, providing high capacity and slow to change
    optical circuit switching along side fine-granular packet services may potentially
    improve network utility and reduce both CAPEX and OpEX. This gives rise to the
    concept of hybrid switching - a paradigm that seeks to make the best of packet
    and circuit switching. However, the full potential of hybrid switching networks
    (HSNs) can only be realized when such a network is optimally designed and operated,
    in the sense that "an appropriate amount of resource is used to handle an appropriate
    amount of traffic in both switching planes." The resource allocation problem in
    HSNs is in fact complex ineractions between three components: resource allocation
    between the two switching planes, traffic partitioning between the two switching
    planes, and the overall cost or performance constraints. In this memo, we explore
    the challenges of planning and operating hybrid switching networks, with a particular
    focus on the resource allocation problem, and provide a high-level model that
    may guide resource allocation in future hybrid switching networks.</p>'
