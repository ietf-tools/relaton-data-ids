abstract:
- content: <p>Different routing protocols employ different mechanisms for securing
    protocol packets on the wire. While most already have some method for accomplishing
    cryptographic message authentication, in many cases the existing methods are dated,
    vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated.
    The "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul
    and improve these mechanisms. This document does not contain protocol specifications.
    Instead, it defines the areas where protocol specification work is needed and
    a set of requirements for KARP design teams to follow. RFC 6518, "Keying and Authentication
    for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines" is a companion to this document;
    KARP design teams will use them together to review and overhaul routing protocols.
    These two documents reflect the input of both the IETF Security Area and IETF
    Routing Area in order to form a mutually agreeable work plan. This document has
    three main parts. The first part provides an overview of the KARP effort. The
    second part lists the threats from RFC 4593 (Generic Threats To Routing Protocols)
    that are in scope for attacks against routing protocol transport systems. This
    includes any mechanisms built into the routing protocols themselves, to authenticate
    packets. The third part enumerates the requirements that routing protocol specifications
    must meet when addressing those threats for RFC 6518's "Work Phase 1", the update
    to a routing protocol's existing transport security.</p>
