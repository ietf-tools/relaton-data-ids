abstract:
- content: "<p>Pro-active fault monitoring for TRILL monitors all the paths between
    any two given RBridges in the network. Number of paths to be monitored can be
    of exponential order based on the distance between two RBridges. In this document
    novel fault monitoring mechanism based on a distributed approach is presented.</p>"
