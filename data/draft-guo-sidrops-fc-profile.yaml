abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
    content type for Forwarding Commitments (FCs) objects used in Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI). An FC is a digitally signed object that provides a
    means of verifying whether an IP address block is received from AS a to AS b and
    announced from AS b to AS c. When validated, an FC's eContent can be used for
    the detection and mitigation of route hijacking, especially providing protection
    for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE.</p>"
