abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized
    Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement of the Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO
    10646). A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used
    instead of URIs, where appropriate, to identify resources. The approach of defining
    a new protocol element was chosen instead of extending or changing the definition
    of URIs. This was done in order to allow a clear distinction and to avoid incompatibilities
    with existing software. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment of
    IRIs in various protocols, formats, and software components that currently deal
    with URIs.</p>"
