abstract:
- content: "<p>A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that may utilize
    different DNS namespaces. The node often receives DNS server configuration information
    from all connected networks. Some of the DNS servers may have information about
    namespaces other servers do not have. When the multi-homed node needs to utilize
    DNS, it has to choose which of the servers to contact to. This document describes
    a policy based method for helping on selection of DNS server for both forward
    and reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix and IPv6 prefix information
    received via DHCPv6.</p>"
