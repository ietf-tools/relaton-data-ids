abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a technique to improve DNS privacy, a technique
    called "QNAME minimisation", where the DNS resolver no longer sends the full original
    QNAME to the upstream name server. RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION.
    The original [RFC7816] had the experimental status. This document is intended
    for the standards track. It should be discussed in the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations)
    Working Group, through its mailing list. The source of the document, as well as
    a list of open issues, is currently kept at Framagit [1].</p>'
