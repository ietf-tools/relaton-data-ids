abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of mappings which will enable inter working
    between systems operating the ISO/IEC 10021 - CCITT (now ITU) X.400 Recommendations
    on Message Handling Systems, and systems running the Mail-11 (also known as DECnet
    mail or VMSmail) protocol. The specifications are valid both within DECnet Phase
    IV and DECnet/OSI addressing and routing scheme. The complete scenario of X.400
    / MIME / Mail-11 is also considered, in order to cover the possible complex cases
    arising in multiple gateway translations. This document covers mainly the X.400
    O/R address to/from Mail-11 address mapping and the RFC822 to/from Mail-11 ones;
    other mappings are based on MIXER specifications. Bodypart mappings are not specified
    in this document: MIXER and MIME-MHS specifications can be applied to map bodyparts
    between X.400, MIME and Mail-11, too. In fact MIME encoding can be used without
    modifications within Mail-11 text bodyparts. This document obsoletes RFC 1405,
    which was a combined effort of RARE Working Group on Messaging, and the IETF X.400
    Ops Working Group.</p>"
