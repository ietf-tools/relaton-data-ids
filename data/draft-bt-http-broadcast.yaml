abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 in RFC 2616 uses the 100-Continue
    status message with Expect: Continue header to send request body at a later time
    to the origin server. This memo explains how to extend this status message to
    send multiple responses from the origin server to the client for an extended period
    of time. This achieves the essential function of broadcast from the origin server
    to the client, without the client waiting for a response to a request.</p>"
