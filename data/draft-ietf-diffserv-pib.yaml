- content: "<p>This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device
    implementing the Differentiated Services Architecture. The provisioning classes
    defined here provide policy control of resources implementing the Differentiated
    Services Architecture. These provisioning classes can be used with other none
    Differentiated Services provisioning classes (defined in other PIBs) to provide
    for a comprehensive policy controlled mapping of service requirement to device
    resource capability and usage.</p>"
