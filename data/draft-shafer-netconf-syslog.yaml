abstract:
- content: "<p>SYSLOG is the most prevalent mechanism for delivering event notification
    data off networking devices. NETCONF is intended to provide a standard mechanism
    for performing configuration operations on networking devices. The two areas will
    overlap, giving rise to a need for receiving notification data over NETCONF. This
    document presents a simple mechanism for accessing SYSLOG data over NETCONF, implemented
    using the existing NETCONF RPC infrastructure.</p>"
