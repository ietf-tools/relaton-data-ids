abstract:
- content: <p>YANG (RFC 7950) is a data modeling language used to model configuration
    data, state data, parameters and results of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations
    or actions, and notifications. YANG-CBOR (RFC 9254) defines encoding rules for
    YANG in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (RFC 8949). While the
    overall structure of YANG-CBOR is encoded in an efficient, binary format, YANG
    itself has its roots in XML and therefore traditionally encodes some information
    such as date/times and IP addresses/prefixes in a verbose text form. This document
    defines how to use existing CBOR tags for this kind of information in YANG-CBOR
    as a "stand-in" for the text-based information that would be found in the original
    form of YANG-CBOR.</p>
