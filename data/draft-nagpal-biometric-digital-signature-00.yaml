abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Signatures are fast emerging as a viable information security
    solution, satiating the objectives of data integrity, entity authentication, privacy,
    non-repudiation and certification. The technique, as it stands today, faces the
    problem of the maintenance of the secrecy of the private key. This document provides
    a conceptual framework for the establishment of a biometric-based key generation
    scheme. In this scheme, the private key is generated each time a document or record
    requires to be signed. Such generation is based upon a combination of biometric
    traits.</p>"
