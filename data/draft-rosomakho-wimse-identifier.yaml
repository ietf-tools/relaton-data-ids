abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a canonical identifier for workloads, referred
    to as the Workload Identifier. A Workload Identifier is a URI that uniquely identifies
    a workload within the context of a specific trust domain. This identifier can
    be embedded in digital credentials, including X.509 certificates and security
    tokens, to support authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement across
    diverse systems. The Workload Identifier format ensures interoperability, facilitates
    secure identity federation, and enables consistent identity semantics.</p>"
