abstract:
- content: "<p>An SDF specification can describe the definition of a Things, i.e.,
    physical objects and their associated interactions and express the various information
    that be exchanged for the interactions. Therefore, the SDF format can be used
    to define the behaviour of an object and its associated data model and interaction
    model in a digital twin system that has an object as a component. In a digital
    twin system, interactions between physical and virtual objects, as well as interactions
    of objects existing in the different digital twin systems, are performed over
    a network, which is important to provide location information of objects during
    interactions. This document specifies the extension information of SDF to represent
    the location information of an objects.</p>"
