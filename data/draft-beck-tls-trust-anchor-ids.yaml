abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the TLS Trust Anchors extension, a mechanism
    for relying parties to convey trusted certification authorities. It describes
    individual certification authorities more succinctly than the TLS Certificate
    Authorities extension. Additionally, to support TLS clients with many trusted
    certification authorities, it supports a mode where servers describe their available
    certification paths and the client selects from them. Servers may describe this
    during connection setup, or in DNS for lower latency.</p>"
