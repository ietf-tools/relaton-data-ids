abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which PCP
    could not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage port mapping
    status for communicating remote peers. The bi-directional port control mode will
    eliminate risks of connections interruption caused by remote peer pinhole timeout.</p>"
