abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed calendaring is gradually becoming more demanding than standalone
    calendaring and scheduling. The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown exponentially
    and enterprise and inter- enterprise business has become so dependent on group
    scheudling applications. But there is no Internet standard to provide interoperability
    among various calendaring applications. Consequently, user need to install different
    conduit programs to access these calendaring stores. This memo proposes a HTTP
    based simple calendaring access protocol which allows web, email and any HTTP
    compliant clients to access and manipulate calendar store. The motivation for
    this proposal is the expanded scope and diversity of the World Wide Web. The World
    Wide Web provides a simple and effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve,
    and publish information of their own available for others. Now that Web browsers
    and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it is worthwhile to use HTTP as transport
    protocol and XML to encode calendar objects. The power and extensibility of XML
    allows us to represent calendar data objects as well-formed XML documents. Simple
    Calendar Access Protocol(SCAP) allows exchanging calendaring information between
    scheduling systems using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows users
    to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter what scheduling software they
    use. This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary
    to HTTP/1.1 for the management of calender properties, creation and management
    of calendar objects, and namespace manipulation.</p>"
