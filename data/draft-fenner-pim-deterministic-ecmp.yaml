abstract:
- content: "<p>In densely interconnected networks, a PIM node may have many choices
    as to what upstream neighbor to send a JOIN message to, for a given source and
    group. This document describes a mechanism for multiple nodes (e.g., leaf nodes
    in a data center) to pick the same upstream node (e.g., spine node) to avoid redundant
    traffic flows.</p>"
