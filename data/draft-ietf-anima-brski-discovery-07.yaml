abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to make BRSKI communications autoconfiguring,
    extensible and resilient in the face of simultaneous use of different variations
    of the BRSKI protocol (BRSKI, BRSKI-AE, BRSKI-PRM, constrained BRSKI, stateless
    constrained BRSKI proxies). This document specifies a data model, IANA registry
    and BRSKI component procedures to achieve this. This document does not define
    any new discovery methods. Instead, its data model allows to signal all current
    (and future) variations of the BRSKI family of protocols consistently via different
    existing network discovery mechanisms: DNS-SD, CoAP discovery (CORE-LF) and GRASP.
    Additional/future discovery mechanisms can also be supported through the IANA
    registry. Automatic resiliency and load-sharing are enabled through the use of
    discovery mechanisms and the provisioning of multiple instances of BRSKI components
    such as registrars and Join Proxies. This document specifies the procedures to
    support load-sharing and (fast) failover under failure and recovery of redundant
    components. Future proof deployments of BRSKI requires Join Proxies that automatically
    support any current and future BRSKI variation. This document specifies the procedures
    how Join Proxies can support this through specific Join Proxy protocol behavior
    and the use of discovery mechanisms. The specification for discovery of pledges
    by their IDevID as introduced by BRSKI-PRM is refined in this document.</p>"
