abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a secure authentication protocol between the MN
    and NAR(New Access Router) in FMIP6. The main idea is that the MN generates an
    authentication key for handoff, and delivers it to the NAR through an existing
    secure channel via the AAA server during a pre-authentication process. The NAR
    verifies the MN using the delivered key when the MN attaches to itself. The main
    advantage of this scheme over the full authentication procedure is to distribute
    the heavy overhead of the AAA server such as key generation and management to
    the MNs. The AAA server in this scheme just forwards the key information to the
    NAR using an existing secure channel.</p>"
