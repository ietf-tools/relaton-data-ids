abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a practical mechanism to implement IP fast
    reroute using multiple viable loop-free next hops, which are not necessarily shortest
    path to a destination. Upon a link failure, all the destinations reachable via
    the primary nexthop will be forwarded to pre-computed alternative loop free nexthops,
    if any, without much delay. The mechanism does not impose any new protocol message/capability
    exchange. The mechanism does not use any tunneling techniques. It is shown that
    simple changes to existing IGP shortest path computation and routing table structures
    are sufficient to achieve the desired functionality. More over, routers which
    implement the proposed mechanism can co-exist and can be fully backward compatible
    with existing unmodified routers.</p>"
