abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new mechanism in Mobile IPv6, which allows
    a mobile node to discover promptly a suitable slave home agent's address on its
    home link when the mobile node may not know a master home agent's address due
    to some reasons. To implement the proposed mechanism, new Binding Update/Acknowledgement
    messages are defined. The proposed mechanism might be more efficient and general,
    and faster than the existing Home Agent Address Discovery in [1].</p>"
