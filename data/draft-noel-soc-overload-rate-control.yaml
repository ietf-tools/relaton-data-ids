abstract:
- content: "<p>The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in
    Next Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide adequate control
    mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by preventing congestion collapse
    during traffic overloads. Already [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-05] proposes
    a loss-based solution to remedy known vulnerabilities of the [RFC3261] SIP 503
    (service unavailable) overload control mechanism. This document proposes a rate-based
    control solution to complement the loss-based control defined in [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-05].</p>"
