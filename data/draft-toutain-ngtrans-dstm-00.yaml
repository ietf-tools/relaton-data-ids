abstract:
- content: "<p>The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of
    IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4. Nodes will be able
    to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need to communicate with IPv4
    nodes that do not have a dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. This specification
    defines a mechanism called 'Assignment of IPv4 Global Addresses to IPv6 hosts'
    (AIIH), which will assign an IPv6 host a temporary IPv4 Global Address, which
    can be used to communicate with a host that supports IPv4 or IPv4/IPv6. This document
    includes also the definition of a Dynamic Tunneling Interface (DTI) to ease the
    automatic IPv4 address assignment and to remove the IPv4 routing table from routers.
    Another objective is to demonstrate that IPv6 Addresses can be deployed now instead
    of non-Global IPv4 Addresses within an Intranet.</p>"
