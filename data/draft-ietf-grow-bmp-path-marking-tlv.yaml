abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
    BGP Path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route Monitoring
    (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to convey the status
    of a path after being processed by the BGP process. This extension makes use of
    the TLV mechanims described in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv]
    and draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].</p>"
