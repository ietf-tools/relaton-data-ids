abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft introduces the concept of a Resource Helper in
    OAuth 2.0. A Resource Helper is a modular component that assists the Authorization
    Server in managing fine-grained authorization processes. The Resource Helper,
    associated with a specific Resource Server, handles scope selection and resource-specific
    details, providing the user-interface for the Resource Owner to approve or refine
    access requests. By offloading scope-related user interaction to the Resource
    Helper, the Authorization Server remains generic and stable while the Resource
    Helper evolves alongside the Resource Server's requirements. This specification
    defines the protocol, interfaces, and flow between the Authorization Server and
    the Resource Helper. Introducing a Resource Helper does not affect the OAuth client
    or the interaction between the OAuth client and the Resource Server.</p>"
