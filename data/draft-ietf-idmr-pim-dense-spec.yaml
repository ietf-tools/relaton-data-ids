abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a multicast routing algorithm for multicast
    groups that are densely distributed across an internet. The protocol is unicast
    routing protocol independent. It is based on the PIM sparse-mode and employs the
    same packet formats. This protocol is called dense-mode PIM. The design is based
    largely on foundational work by Deering.</p>"
