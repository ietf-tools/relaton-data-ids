abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) is a new player towards autonomous vehicles
    in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). An SDV is constructed by a software
    platform like a cloud-native system (e.g., Kubernetes) and has its internal network.
    To facilitate the easy and efficient configuration of networks in the SDV, an
    intent-based management is an appropriate direction. This document proposes a
    framework of intent-based management for networks, security, and applications
    in SDVs so that they can communicate with other SDVs and infrastructure nodes
    for safe driving and infotainment services in the road networks.</p>"
