abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, IPv6 Internet is, globally considered, inseparable from
    the 6bone network. The 6bone has been built as a tighly meshed tunneled topology.
    As the number of participants has grown, it has become an untangible mess, hindering
    the real deployment of IPv6 due to low quality of connections. This memo discusses
    the nature and the state of 6bone/IPv6 Internet, points out problems and outlines
    a few ways to start fixing them; also, some rough operational guidelines for different-sized
    organizations are presented. The most important issues are: not offering transit
    to everyone and real transit operators being needed to take a more active role.</p>"
