abstract:
- content: "<p>Near-term quantum networks will grow to form a Noisy, Intermediate-
    Scale Quantum Internet (NISQI). Connection setup will require adapting behavior
    along the path to the noise levels of individual elements. In this proposal, path
    creation is triggered by an application at the Initiator, information is accumulated
    node-by-node on an outbound pass in a series of QCap (quantum capability) blocks,
    then the RuleSets are created at the Responder. RuleSets are installed at the
    individual nodes on the return pass. This document describes the architecture
    of connection setup in a network. Details of the RuleSets and QCaps, addressing
    architecture, link protocols, routing, resource allocation (multiplexing), extension
    of this setup procedure to an internetwork, and extension to multiparty communications
    are beyond the scope of this document.</p>"
