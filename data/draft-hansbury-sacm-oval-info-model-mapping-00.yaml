abstract:
- content: "<p>The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing and employing
    the OVAL Language. During this time, the community has made a number of design
    decisions and learned a number of lessons that should be leveraged as next generation
    endpoint posture assessment is formulated. There are a number of places throughout
    the SACM Information Model document that could be fulfilled by portions of the
    OVAL Language, either in its current state or, in some cases, with modifications.
    Another output of the work executed under the OVAL project is a number of lessons
    that are applicable to the SACM work. These lessons include a clear separation
    of data collection and evaluation; a call to focus on ensuring both primary source
    vendors and third party security experts feel invited to the discussion and are
    empowered to leverage their unique domain knowledge; and to strive for simplicity
    and flexibility, where possible. Finally, the OVAL community has a set of clear
    recommendations with respect to which parts of OVAL should be used by SACM as
    a means to make best use of the efforts of those that have worked on and supported
    OVAL over the past ten years. Those recommendations are: o Use the OVAL System
    Characteristics Model as a base data model for at least one way to provide data
    collection. o Use the OVAL Definitions Model in parts as a base data model for
    both evaluation and collection guidance. o Do not use the OVAL Results Model for
    a data model to encode evaluation results.</p>"
