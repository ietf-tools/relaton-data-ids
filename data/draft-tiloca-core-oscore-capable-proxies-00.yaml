abstract:
- content: <p>Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) can be
    used to protect CoAP messages end-to-end between two endpoints at the application
    layer, also in the presence of intermediaries such as proxies. This document defines
    how OSCORE is used to protect CoAP messages also between an origin application
    endpoint and an intermediary, or between two intermediaries. Besides, it defines
    how a CoAP message can be double-protected through "OSCORE-in-OSCORE", i.e., both
    end-to-end between origin application endpoints, as well as between an application
    endpoint and an intermediary or between two intermediaries. Thus, this document
    updates RFC 8613. The same approach applies to Group OSCORE, for protecting CoAP
    messages when group communication with intermediaries is used.</p>
