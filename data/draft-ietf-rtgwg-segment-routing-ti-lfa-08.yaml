abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate Fast
    Re-route (TI-LFA), aimed at providing protection of node and adjacency segments
    within the Segment Routing (SR) framework. This Fast Re-route (FRR) behavior builds
    on proven IP-FRR concepts being LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with
    directed forwarding (DLFA). It extends these concepts to provide guaranteed coverage
    in any two connected network using a link-state IGP. A key aspect of TI-LFA is
    the FRR path selection approach establishing protection over the expected post-convergence
    paths from the point of local repair, reducing the operational need to control
    the tie-breaks among various FRR options.</p>"
