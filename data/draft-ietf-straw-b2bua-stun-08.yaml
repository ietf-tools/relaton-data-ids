abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs)
    are often designed to be on the media path rather than just intercepting signaling.
    This means that B2BUAs often act on the media path leading to separate media legs
    that the B2BUA correlates and bridges together. When acting on the media path,
    B2BUAs are likely to receive Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) packets
    as part of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) processing. This document
    defines behavior for a B2BUA performing ICE processing. The goal of this document
    is to ensure that B2BUAs properly handle SIP messages that carry ICE semantics
    in Session Description Protocol (SDP) and STUN messages received as part of the
    ICE procedures for NAT and Firewall traversal of multimedia sessions.</p>"
