abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS filtering is widely deployed for various reasons, including network
    security. However, filtered DNS responses lack information for end users to understand
    the reason for the filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide explanatory details
    to end users cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS
    server. This document updates RFC 8914 by signaling client support for structuring
    the EXTRA-TEXT field of the Extended DNS Error to provide details on the DNS filtering.
    Such details can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or used for other
    purposes.</p>"
