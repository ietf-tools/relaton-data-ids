abstract:
- content: <p>RFC4552 describes how to provide authentication/confidentiality to OSPFv3
    using IPsec. It specifies that same IPsec SA parameters be configured for both
    inbound and outbound SAs to provide the "one to many" security for multicast OSPFv3
    communications over broadcast links (e.g., Ethernet). Manual keying is specified
    as the mandatory and default group key management solution. However, issues of
    scalability and security exist with manual keying. It is better to replace manual
    keying with automated group key management. This document discusses the requirements
    on OSPFv3 automated group key management, assuming that the centralized group
    key management architecture introduced in [RFC4046] is used.</p>
