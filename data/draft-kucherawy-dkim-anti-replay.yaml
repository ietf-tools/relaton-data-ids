abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) provides a digital signature mechanism
    for Internet messages, allowing a domain name owner to affix its domain name in
    a way that can be cryptographically validated. DKIM signatures protect the integrity
    of the message header and body only. By design, it decoupled itself from the transport
    and storage mechanisms used to handle messages. This gives rise to a possible
    replay attack, but the original DKIM specification fell short of providing a mitigation
    strategy. This document presents an optional method for binding a message to a
    specific recipient or set of recipients so that broader replay attacks can be
    discouraged.</p>"
