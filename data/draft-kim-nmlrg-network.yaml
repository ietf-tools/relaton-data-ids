abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes agent reinforcement learning (RL) in a distributed
    environment to transfer or share information for autonomous shortest path-planning
    over a communication network. The centralized node, which is the main node to
    manage agent workflow in hybrid peer-to-peer environment, provides a cumulative
    reward for each action that a given agent takes with respect to an optimal path
    based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning process. A reward from the centralized
    node is reflected when an agent explores to reach its destination for autonomous
    shortest path-planning in distributed nodes.</p>"
