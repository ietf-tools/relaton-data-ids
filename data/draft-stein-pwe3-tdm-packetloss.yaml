abstract:
- content: "<p>The effect of packet loss on voice quality has been the subject of
    detailed study in the VoIP community, but these results are not directly applicable
    to TDM transport as being studied in the PWE WG. The present document presents
    an analysis of packet loss for the TDM over PW case, and demonstrates that packet
    loss of a few percent can be tolerated. We propose that robustness to packet loss
    of a few percent be a requirement for any proposed method for transport of TDM
    over pseudowires.</p>"
