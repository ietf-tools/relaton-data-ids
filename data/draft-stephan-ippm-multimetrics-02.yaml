abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized
    metrics for measuring end-to-end performance between 2 points. This memo defines
    2 sets of metrics to extend these end-to-end ones. It defines spatial metrics
    for measuring the performance of segments along a path and metrics for measuring
    the performance of a group of users in multiparty communications.</p>"
