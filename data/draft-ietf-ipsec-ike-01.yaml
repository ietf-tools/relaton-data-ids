abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a key exchange and security negotiation protocol
    which is intended to depricate [HC98]. As such it will not change the 'bits on
    the wire' for an implementation which is compiant with [HC98] but will clarify
    contentious issues with [HC98] and attempt to explain the protocol in a less haphazard
    manner. Due to advances in computer processing some mandatory-to-implement attributes
    have changed between this [HC98] and this document. In addition a new and optional
    exchange is introduced. Like [HC98] this memo uses [MSST98] for a framework and
    as a language to express exchanges which are derived from [Kra96] and [Orm98].
    In places where the requirements between this document and [MSST98] or [Kra96]
    or [Orm98] conflict, this document will be supreme.</p>"
