abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5239 defines centralized conferencing (XCON) as an association
    of participants with a central focus. The state of a conference is represented
    by a conference object. This document defines an XML- based conference information
    data model to be used for conference objects. A conference information data model
    is designed to convey information about the conference and about participation
    in the conference. The conference information data model defined in this document
    constitutes an extension of the data format specified in the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) event package for conference State. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
