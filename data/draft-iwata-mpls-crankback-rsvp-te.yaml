abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for RSVP-TE signaling
    and in a companion document for CRLDP signaling. Recently, several routing protocol
    extensions for advertising resource information in addition to topology information
    have been proposed for use in distributed constraint-based routing. In such a
    distributed routing environment, however, the information used to compute a constraint-based
    path may be out of date.</p>"
