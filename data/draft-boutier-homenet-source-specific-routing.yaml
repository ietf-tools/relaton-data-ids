abstract:
- content: "<p>Source-specific routing is a generalisation of next-hop routing in
    which the routing decision is made depending on a packet's source address in addition
    to the destination. We describe the motivation for source-specific routing and
    our experiences with an experimental extension of the Babel routing protocol that
    implements source- specific routing.</p>"
