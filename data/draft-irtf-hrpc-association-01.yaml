abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes the causal link between the Internet architecture
    and the ability of people to excercise their right to freedom of assembly and
    association online. The Internet increasingly mediates our lives, our relationships
    and our ability to exercise our human rights. As a forum, it provides a global
    public space despite being built on predominantly private infrastructure. Since
    Internet protocols play a central role in the management, development and use
    of the Internet, the relation between protocols and the aforementioned rights
    should be analyzed and any adverse impacts should be mitigated.</p>"
