abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of many new transport protocols for DNS in recent
    years (DoT, DoH, DoQ) significantly increases the complexity of DNS stub resolvers
    that want to support these protocols. A practical way forward is to have a DNS
    client proxy in the host operating system. This allows applications to communicate
    using Do53 and still get the privacy benefit from using more secure protocols
    over the internet. However, such a setup leaves the application with no control
    over which transport the proxy uses. This document introduces EDNS(0) options
    that allow a stub resolver to request certain transport and allow the proxy to
    report capabilities and actual transports that are available.</p>"
