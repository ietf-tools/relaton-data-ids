abstract:
- content: "<p>As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, so the number of Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements has increased.
    Various implementation recommendations have been proposed to manage the resulting
    increase in control plane state. However, those changes have had no effect on
    the number of labels that a transit Label Switching Router (LSR) has to support
    in the forwarding plane. That number is governed by the number of LSPs transiting
    or terminated at the LSR and is directly related to the total LSP state in the
    control plane. This document defines a mechanism to prevent the maximum size of
    the label space limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control plane scaling
    on that node. That is, it allows many more LSPs to be supported than there are
    forwarding plane labels available. This work introduces the notion of pre-installed
    'per Traffic Engineering (TE) link labels' that can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE
    LSPs that traverse these TE links. This approach significantly reduces the forwarding
    plane state required to support a large number of LSPs. This couples the feature
    benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane with the simplicity of the Segment Routing
    MPLS forwarding plane. This document also introduces the ability to mix different
    types of label operations along the path of an LSP, thereby allowing the ingress
    router or an external controller to influence how to optimally place a LSP in
    the network.</p>"
