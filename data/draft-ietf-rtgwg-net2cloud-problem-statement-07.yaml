abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problems that enterprises face today when
    interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third party data
    centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can be many problems associated with network
    connecting to or among Clouds, many of which probably are out of the IETF scope.
    The objective of this document is to identify some of the problems that need additional
    work in IETF Routing area. Other problems are out of the scope of this document.
    It examines some of the approaches interconnecting cloud DCs with enterprises'
    on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices. This document also describes some of the
    network problems that many enterprises face when they have workloads &amp; applications
    &amp; data split among different data centers, especially for those enterprises
    with multiple sites that are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g., MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN).
    Current operational problems are examined to determine whether there is a need
    to improve existing protocols or whether a new protocol is necessary to solve
    them.</p>"
