abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new method for the detection of increases
    in PMTU using the newly defined Hop-by-Hop option header. To detect increases
    in a path's PMTU, a node does not increase its assumed PMTU unconditionally without
    considering network status, but measures its real PMTU, and then replaces the
    previous PMTU with new one. To measure node's real PMTU, the node sends the IP
    packet with the newly defined Hop-by-Hop option header to the destination node
    right before a timer expires. This can eliminate the chance of occurrence of packets
    being discarded and Packet Too Big messages being generated.</p>"
