abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture
    of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows for sing interface-ID to allocate multicast
    addresses. When the link-local unicast address is configured at each interface
    of host, interface ID is uniquely determined. By delegating multicast addresses
    at the same time as interface ID, each host can identify their multicast addresses
    automatically at Layer 1 without needing to run an intra- or inter-domain allocation
    protocol in the serverless environments.</p>"
