abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.16e defines means for true mobility within an 802.16 wireless
    network. Determining an accurate location for 802.16e devices requires information
    on radio parameters. A format is defined for location-related measurement data
    that can be provided by an 802.16e device. This measurement data can be used by
    a Location Information Server (LIS) to more accurately determine the location
    of the device. A separate measurement used for identifying WiMAX session-related
    parameters is also provided.</p>"
