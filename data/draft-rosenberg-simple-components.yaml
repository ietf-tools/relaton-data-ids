abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIMPLE working group has developed a core set of specifications
    for messaging and presence functionality. However, those protocols alone are not
    sufficient to build a complete IM and presence application. In this document,
    we advocate a componentized model, whereby the other pieces of the system are
    very loosely coupled, and easily swapped out for others, in order to allow innovation
    and differentiation. We also propose some simple solutions for several of them
    to allow for interop.</p>"
