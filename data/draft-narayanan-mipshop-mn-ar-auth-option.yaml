abstract:
- content: "<p>FMIPv6 [4] requires signalling messages to be exchanged between a mobile
    node and its access router. For secure interaction, these messages must be authenticated
    using a security association between the access router and the mobile node. To
    enable the mobile node and the access router unambiguously identify the correct
    security association this document extends the mobility header authentication
    option by defining a subtype to indicate a mobile node - access router SPI. Also,
    this option can be used in signaling messages used to derive handover keys between
    the MN and AR, as described in HK_AAA [5]. The idea here is to re-use the existing
    mobility option for authentication and only define an additional sub-type for
    MN-AR authentication.</p>"
