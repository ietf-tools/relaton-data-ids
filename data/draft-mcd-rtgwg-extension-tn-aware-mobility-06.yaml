abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY]
    draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems' Slice and Service
    Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths between eNBs and UPFs (User
    Plane Functions).The focus of that work is limited to the 3GPP domain (i.e., eNB
    &lt;-&gt; UPFs) and doesn't cover the network between the UPFs and the services
    hosted in data centers. Extending the framework to the data centers where the
    services are hosted becomes necessary to maintain the end-to-end transport network
    characteristics between UEs and their application servers. This document describes
    a framework for extending the mobility-aware transport network characteristics
    from the UPF through the IP Data Networks.</p>"
