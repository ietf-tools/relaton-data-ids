abstract:
- content: "<p>Limiting and preventing SPAM for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is seen
    as an important task for future security work in the Voice over IP environment.
    This document addresses the problem by utilizing the concept introduced by the
    SIP Identity Framework in combination with the Security Assertion Markup Language
    (SAML) to warrant certain security relevant attributes from one administrative
    domain to another. This approach allows the destination domain to make intelligent
    filtering decisions when receiving voice calls.</p>"
