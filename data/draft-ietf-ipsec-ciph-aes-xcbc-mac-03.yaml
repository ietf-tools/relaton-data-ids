abstract:
- content: "<p>A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a key-dependent one way hash
    function. One popular way to construct a MAC algorithm is to use a block cipher
    in conjunction with the Cipher-Block-Chaining (CBC) mode of operation. The classic
    CBC-MAC algorithm, while secure for messages of a pre-selected fixed length, has
    been shown to be insecure across messages of varying lengths such as the type
    found in typical IP datagrams. This memo specifies the use of AES in CBC mode
    with a set of extensions to overcome this limitation. This new algorithm is named
    AES-XCBC-MAC-96. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
