- content: "<p>This document provides an analysis and evaluation of security with
    P2PSIP overlay network. The draft compares security difference between C/S and
    P2P, then partitions the P2PSIP architecture into layers, and analyze the security
    issues in each layer and the security relationship among the layers. Security
    issues with different kind of application scenarios are distinct. This draft classifies
    the application scenarios into two main types, and the security threats with these
    two types of scenarios are analyzed in detail.</p>"
