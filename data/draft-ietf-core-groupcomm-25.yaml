abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer
    protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks. It is anticipated that
    constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building
    automation scenario, all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off
    as a group). This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication
    context. An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based on
    existing CoAP functionality as well as new features introduced in this specification.
    Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate
    important concepts. Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network
    topologies.</p>"
