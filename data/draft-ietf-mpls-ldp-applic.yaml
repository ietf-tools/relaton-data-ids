abstract:
- content: "<p>A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs)
    must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between and through
    them. This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called
    a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label bindings
    it has made. This document describes the applicability of a set of such procedures
    called LDP (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to
    support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
