abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism by which web servers can provide
    metadata of a web resource which is indicated by a URL. The web client like web
    browser can use this metadata to filter out unwanted web resource or link to itself.
    In addition, the web client can take advantage of such metadata to provide high-level
    services like displaying additional information about the web resource without
    downloading it. We expect this mechanism to enable quick access to metadata of
    any web resource from any web client reduces overall web traffic remarkably.</p>"
