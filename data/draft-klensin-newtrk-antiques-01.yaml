abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2026 and some of its predecessors require that Proposed and Draft
    Standards either advance in grade within a reasonable period of time or that they
    expire and be moved to Historic. That procedure has never been followed on a systematic
    basis. A new procedure has been proposed that would make that action easier for
    protocols that have not gotten any real acceptance. In the interest of symmetry,
    fairness, and an orderly attic, it is worth noting that there are a number of
    protocol descriptions which have been at less than Full Standard level for a long
    time but which have proven their value by the traditional criteria of multiple
    interoperable implementations This document provides a procedure for upgrading
    such documents to Full Standards without creating an unreasonable burden on authors
    purely to meet the needs of procedural rituals or placing an unreasonable load
    on groups charged with performing other tasks in the IETF.</p>"
