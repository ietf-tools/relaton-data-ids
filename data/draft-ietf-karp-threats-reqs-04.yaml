abstract:
- content: <p>Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own mechanism
    for securing the protocol packets on the wire. While most already have some method
    for accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in many cases the existing
    methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic algorithms that
    have been deprecated. The "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP)
    effort aims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms. This document does not contain
    protocol specifications. Instead, it defines the areas where protocol specification
    work is needed and a set of requirements for KARP design teams to follow. RFC
    6518, "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols (KARP) Design Guidelines"
    is a companion to this document; KARP design teams will use them together to review
    and overhaul routing protocols. These two documents reflect the input of both
    the IETF's Security Area and Routing Area in order to form a mutually agreeable
    work plan. This document has three main parts. The first part provides an overview
    of the KARP effort. The second part lists the threats from RFC 4593, Generic Threats
    To Routing Protocols, that are in scope for attacks against routing protocols'
    transport systems, including any mechanisms built into the routing protocols themselves,
    which accomplish packet authentication. The third part enumerates the requirements
    that routing protocol specifications must meet when addressing those threats for
    RFC 6518's "Work Phase 1", the update to a routing protocol's existing transport
    security.</p>
