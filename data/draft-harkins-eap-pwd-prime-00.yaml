abstract:
- content: "<p>Passwords are a popular form of credential for user authentication.
    EAP-pwd (RFC 5931) is a popular method of performing secure password authenticaiton.
    EAP-pwd requires a secret element in a finite cyclic group, unfortunately the
    technique it uses to derive this secret is open to timing and cache attacks. This
    improved version, EAP-pwd', uses a different technique to derive the secret element
    which is resistant to timing and cache attacks.</p>"
