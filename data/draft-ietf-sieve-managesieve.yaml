abstract:
- content: <p>Sieve scripts allow users to filter incoming email. Message stores are
    commonly sealed servers so users cannot log into them, yet users must be able
    to update their scripts on them. This document describes a protocol "ManageSieve"
    for securely managing Sieve scripts on a remote server. This protocol allows a
    user to have multiple scripts, and also alerts a user to syntactically flawed
    scripts. [STANDARDS TRACK]</p>
