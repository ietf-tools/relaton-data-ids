abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a distributed architecture of mobility management
    in terms of abstracted logical functions. Mobility management functions are abstracted
    into different logical functions: (1) allocation of home network prefixes or home
    addresses to mobile nodes; (2) location management which includes managing the
    IP addresses and locations of the mobile nodes; and (3) mobility routing which
    includes intercepting and forwarding packets. A distributed architecture can be
    contructed by providing the mobility routing functions in multiple networks in
    the data plane and a distributed database is used to host the location management
    function. This generalized architecture enables different distributed mobility
    designs using primarily the existing mobility protocols (MIP and PMIP) and their
    extensions. Several existing distributed mobility management proposals are briefly
    reviewed using this framework. It is expected that the different proposals, when
    expressed in terms of the generalized framework of logical functions, can interwork
    with each other as well as with the existing hierarchical deployments.</p>"
