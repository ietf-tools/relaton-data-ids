abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more of today's devices are multi-homing capable, in particular
    3GPP user equipment like smartphones. In the current standardization of the next
    upcoming mobile network generation 5G Rel.16, this is especially targeted in the
    study group Access Traffic Steering Switching Splitting [TR23.793]. ATSSS describes
    the flexible selection or combination of 3GPP untrusted access like Wi-Fi and
    cellular access, overcoming the single-access limitation of today's devices and
    services. Another multi-connectivity scenario is the Hybrid Access [I-D.lhwxz-hybrid-access-network-architecture][I-D.
    muley-network-based-bonding-hybrid-access], providing multiple access for CPEs,
    which extends the traditional way of single access connectivity at home to dual-connectivity
    over 3GPP and fixed access. A missing piece in the ATSSS and Hybrid Access is
    the access and path measurement, which is required for efficient and beneficial
    traffic steering decisions. This becomes particularly important in heterogeneous
    access networks with a multitude of volatile access paths. While MP-TCP has been
    proposed to be used within ATSSS, there are drawbacks when being used to encapsulate
    unreliable traffic as it blindly retransmits each lost frame leading to excessive
    delay and potential head-of-line blocking. A decision for MP-TCP though leaves
    the increasing share of UDP in today's traffic mix (&lt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05168&gt;)
    unconsidered. In this document, a multi-access framework is proposed leveraging
    the MP-DCCP network protocol, which enables flexible traffic steering, switching
    and splitting also for unreliable traffic. A benefit is the support for pluggable
    congestion control which enables our framework to be used either independent or
    complementary to MP-TCP.</p>"
