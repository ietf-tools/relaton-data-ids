abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo talks about the problem that exist in the current L2TP network
    and the solution to that problem. In L2TP, internet link at LNS gets congested
    when two or more remote user starts communicating between them. This memo suggest
    multipoint capabality for L2TP, where LACs communicates between them and need
    not require LNS for every data packet. This draft also deals with the applications
    of multipoint L2TP in broadband networks.</p>"
