abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces MIN_STREAM_DATA and EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frames
    to enable partial reliability for QUIC streams. The EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame
    allows a sender to give up on retransmitting older parts of a stream and to notify
    the receiver about this decision. The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame allows a receiver
    to express its disinterest in older parts of a stream. The content of this draft
    is intended for merging into QUIC transport, recovery, and applicability drafts
    as a negotiable extension and/or QUIC Version 2 transport feature.</p>"
