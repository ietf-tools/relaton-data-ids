abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problems that enterprises face today when
    interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third party data
    centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can be many problems associated with network
    connecting to or among Clouds, many of which probably are out of the IETF scope.
    The objective of this document is to identify some of the problems that need additional
    work in IETF Routing area. Other problems are out of the scope of this document.
    This document focuses on the network problems that many enterprises face when
    they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split among different data centers,
    especially for those enterprises with multiple sites that are already interconnected
    by VPNs (e.g., MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN). Current operational problems are examined to
    determine whether there is a need to improve existing protocols or whether a new
    protocol is necessary to solve them.</p>"
