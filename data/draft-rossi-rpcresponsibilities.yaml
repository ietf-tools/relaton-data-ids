abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 9280 to specify that the RPC is responsible
    for operational decisions needed to implement RFC Series policies as they pertain
    to the document publication process code and tools, and provides a pathway for
    resolution of disagreements with those operational decisions. This document also
    updates RFC9280 to acknowledge that RFC Consumers, a distinct but partially overlapping
    group with IETF participants, must be specifically considered in the process of
    writing and implementing RFC Series policies, and makes the RPC responsible for
    representing their interests. Additionally, this document updates language in
    RFC7990, RFC7991, RFC7992, RFC7993, RFC7994, RFC7995, RFC7996, and RFC7997 to
    transfer responsibilities previously held by the RFC Editor or RFC Series Editor
    to the RPC.</p>"
