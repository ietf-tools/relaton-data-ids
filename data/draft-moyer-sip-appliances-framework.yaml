abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use of SIP for network-capable appliances.
    It leverages the standard SIP capabilities to directly communicate with appliances
    even when they are behind firewalls, NATs or other entities that prevent direct
    end-to-end communication. When combined with a new method type and the SIP event
    extensions these techniques become even more powerful.</p>"
