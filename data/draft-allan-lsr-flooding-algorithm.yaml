abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a distributed algorithm that can be applied
    to the problem of constraining IGP flooding in dense mesh topologies. The flooding
    topology utilizes two node-diverse spanning trees in order to provide complete
    coverage in the presence of any single failure while constraining the number of
    LSAs received by any IGP speaker connected to the flooding topology.</p>"
