abstract:
- content: "<p>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a consistent
    way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on the popular Internet MIME standard,
    S/MIME provides the following cryptographic security services for electronic messaging
    applications: authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin
    (using digital signatures) and privacy and data security (using encryption). S/MIME
    can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to add cryptographic security
    services to mail that is sent, and to interpret cryptographic security services
    in mail that is received. However, S/MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be
    used with any transport mechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP. As
    such, S/MIME takes advantage of the object-based features of MIME and allows secure
    messages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems. Further, S/MIME can be used
    in automated message transfer agents that use cryptographic security services
    that do not require any human intervention, such as the signing of software-generated
    documents and the encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.</p>"
