abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes proposed extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol to
    allow its use in a broadband environment, as a control plane between Access Nodes
    (e.g. DSLAM) and Broadband Network Gateways (e.g. BRAS). These proposed extensions
    are required to realize a protocol for "Access Node Control" mechanism as described
    in [9]. The resulting protocol with the proposed extensions to GSMPv3 [4] is referred
    to as "Access Node Control Protocol" (ANCP). This document focuses on specific
    use cases of access node control mechanism for topology discovery, line configuration,
    and OAM. It is intended to be augmented by additional protocol specification for
    future use cases considered in scope by the ANCP charter.</p>
