abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the Real-time Transport Control
    Protocol (RTCP) to use unicast feedback to a multicast sender. The proposed extension
    is useful for single-source multicast sessions such as Source-Specific Multicast
    (SSM) communication where the traditional model of many-to-many group communication
    is either not available or not desired. In addition, it can be applied to any
    group that might benefit from a sender-controlled summarized reporting mechanism.
