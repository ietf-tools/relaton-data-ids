- content: "<p>This document describes an information model representing a network
    architecture aimed at operating service provisioning. The network information
    model represents both the network topology, its resources and interconnections,
    and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) on top. VPNs are considered the basic tool
    for providing Network Services, as well as a network feature to build added-value
    Application Services.</p>"
