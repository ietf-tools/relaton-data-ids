abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a network that
    has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that implements
    BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from. It
    also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively
    act as address-based filters. This host behavior may interact with source address
    selection in a given implementation, but logically follows it. Given that the
    network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated
    addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix,
    and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their
    Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which
    router a host should present its transmission. It updates RFC 4861.</p>"
