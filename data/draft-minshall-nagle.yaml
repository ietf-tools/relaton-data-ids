abstract:
- content: "<p>The Nagle algorithm is one of the primary mechanisms which protects
    the internet from poorly designed and/or implemented applications. However, for
    a certain class of applications (notably, request-response protocols) the Nagle
    algorithm interacts poorly with delayed acknowledgements to give these applications
    poorer performance. This draft is NOT suggesting that these applications should
    disable the Nagle algorithm. This draft suggests a fairly small and simple modification
    to the Nagle algorithm to preserve Nagle as a means of protecting the internet
    while at the same time giving better performance to a wider class of applications.</p>"
