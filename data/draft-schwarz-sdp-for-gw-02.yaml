abstract:
- content: "<p>SDP is used in many signalling protocols at call control level (such
    as SAP, SIP, BICC), bearer control level (such as RTSP, IPBCP) and gateway control
    level (such as H.248/MEGACO, MGCP). Scope of this RFC is related to gateway control
    specific SDP usage. Gateway control protocols do NOT usually define and introduce
    any new SDP parameters, however, gateway control protocols need specific SDP parameter
    values in addition to those defined usaged at call or bearer control level. Such
    SDP codepoints are collected by this RFC with the purpose of registration with
    IANA.</p>"
