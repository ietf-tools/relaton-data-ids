abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a submission to the SNMPv2 Working Group of the IETF.
    Computer security systems can be usually be understood as being composed of two
    or more logically distinct components. There is often a privacy service that protects
    data from disclosure, an authentication service that validates the identity of
    the entity requesting service, and an access control service which, given an authorized
    entity, restricts the data and operations to which that entity has access. The
    SNMPv2 Administrative Model makes these distinctions. It specifies the data and
    protocols that a compliant SNMPv2 entity must implement in order to provide an
    access control service. However, it does not say anything about how authentication,
    privacy, timeliness, and the like ought to be implemented. Rather, it leaves the
    hooks in place for these services to be implemented in a variety of ways. Henceforth,
    this collection of unspecified services will be collectively referred to as 'the
    authentication and privacy services'. Consequently, the SNMPv2 Administrative
    Model provides an architecture that realizes an access control service, and provides
    the means for integrating authentication</p>"
