abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP's datagram tunnelling is incompatible with Network Address
    Translation (NAT). This document presents extensions to the Mobile IP protocol
    and a tunnelling method which permits mobile nodes using Mobile IP to operate
    in private address networks which are separated from the public internet by NAT
    devices. The NAT traversal is based on using the Mobile IP Home Agent UDP port
    for encapsulated data traffic. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
