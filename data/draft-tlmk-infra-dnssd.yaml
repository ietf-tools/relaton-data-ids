abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Service Discovery provides several mechanisms whereby hosts can
    discover and advertise services on an IP network. Such discovery can be done using
    Multicast DNS (mDNS) or DNS, and advertising can be done with DNSSD Service Registration
    Protocol (SRP) or mDNS. This document describes a way to provide a unified DNSSD
    proxy service that allows hosts to advertise services using SRP and discover services
    using unicast DNS via a Discovery Proxy rather than using of mDNS, in scenarios
    where mDNS is currently the only option.</p>"
