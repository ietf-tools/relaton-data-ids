- content: "<p>This document proposes a framework for context transfer between the
    access routers. The framework identifies the various functional elements that
    participate in the process of context transfer and the protocols required to exchange
    information between the functional entities. Included are a few samples of context
    transfer scenarios to assist in explaining the interactions of the entities in
    the framework.</p>"
