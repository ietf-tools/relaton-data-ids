abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how service function chains (SFC) can be applied
    to traffic flows using routing in a virtual (overlay) network to steer traffic
    between service nodes. Chains can include services running in routers, on physical
    appliances or in virtual machines. Service chains have applicability at the subscriber
    edge, business edge and in multi-tenant datacenters. The routing function into
    SFCs and between service functions within an SFC can be performed by physical
    devices (routers), be virtualized inside hypervisors, or run as part of a host
    OS. The architecture uses a controller to calculate and install routes to implement
    an SFC, based on a topological model of the chain and knowledge of the network
    addresses that should pass through the chain. An advantage of the approach is
    that SFCs can be implemented without alteration to today's BGP standard, and without
    change to the current operation of routers. Service chains need to support load
    balancing between network functions, and symmetric forward and reverse paths are
    required when stateful services are involved. This document shows how these requirements
    can be met by using VRFs at the ingress and egress of each service instance and
    by performing load balancing after the egress of each service as part of the routing
    function.</p>"
