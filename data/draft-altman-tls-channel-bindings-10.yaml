abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines three channel binding types for Transport Layer
    Security (TLS), tls-unique, tls-server-end-point, and tls-unique-for-telnet, in
    accordance with RFC 5056 (On Channel Binding). Note that based on implementation
    experience, this document changes the original definition of 'tls-unique' channel
    binding type in the channel binding type IANA registry. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
