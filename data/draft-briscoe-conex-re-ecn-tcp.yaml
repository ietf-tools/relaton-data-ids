abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces re-ECN (re-inserted explicit congestion notification),
    which is intended to make a simple but far-reaching change to the Internet architecture.
    The sender uses the IP header to reveal the congestion that it expects on the
    end-to-end path. The protocol works by arranging an extended ECN field in each
    packet so that, as it crosses any interface in an internetwork, it will carry
    a truthful prediction of congestion on the remainder of its path. It can be deployed
    incrementally around unmodified routers. The purpose of this document is to specify
    the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer and to give guidelines on any consequent changes
    required to transport protocols. It includes the changes required to TCP both
    as an example and as a specification. It briefly gives examples of mechanisms
    that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond sufficiently to congestion,
    but these are described more fully in a companion document. Note concerning Intended
    Status: If this draft were ever published as an RFC it would probably have historic
    status. There is limited space in the IP header, so re-ECN had to compromise by
    requiring the receiver to be ECN-enabled otherwise the sender could not use re-ECN.
    Re-ECN was a precursor to chartering of the IETF's Congestion Exposure (ConEx)
    working group, but during chartering there were still too few ECN receivers enabled,
    therefore it was decided to pursue other compromises in order to fit a similar
    capability into the IP header.</p>"
