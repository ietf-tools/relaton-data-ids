abstract:
- content: "<p>From a carrier perspective, the possibility of turning a permanent
    connection (PC) into a soft permanent connection (SPC) and vice versa, without
    actually affecting data plane traffic being carried over it, is a valuable option.
    In other terms, such operation can be seen as a way of transferring the ownership
    and control of an existing and in-use data plane connection between the management
    plane and the control plane, leaving its data plane state untouched. This memo
    sets out the requirements for such procedures within a Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) network. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
