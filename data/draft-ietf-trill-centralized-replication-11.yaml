abstract:
- content: "<p>In TRILL active-active access, an RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check
    failure issue may occur when using the pseudo-nickname mechanism specified in
    RFC 7781. This draft describes a solution to resolve this RPF check failure issue
    through centralized replication. All ingress RBridges send BUM (Broadcast, Unknown
    unicast and Multicast) traffic to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation.
    When the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets
    and forwards them to their destination RBridges using a distribution tree established
    as per TRILL base protocol RFC 6325. To avoid RPF check failure on a RBridge sitting
    between the ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, some change
    in the RPF calculation algorithm is required. RPF checks on each RBridge MUST
    be calculated as if the centralized node was the ingress RBridge, instead of being
    calculated using the actual ingress RBridge.</p>"
