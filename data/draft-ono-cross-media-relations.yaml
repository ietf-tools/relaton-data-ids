abstract:
- content: "<p>Some legitimate calls are from persons or organizations connecting
    the callee with weak social ties, such as a restaurant the callee booked a table
    on-line. These legitimate calls are often mistakenly labeled as unsolicited calls
    at a filtering system which uses the contact list of the callee. To reduce these
    false positives during SPIT filtering, we propose two approaches to label incoming
    calls using cross-media relations from earlier communications. One approach is
    that a potential caller offers the callee his contact address(es) which might
    be used in future calls. Another is that a callee provides a potential caller
    with weakly secret information. In order to be identified as someone the callee
    contacted through other means previously, the caller should convey the information
    in future calls.</p>"
