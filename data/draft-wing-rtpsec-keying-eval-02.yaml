- content: "<p>Over a dozen incompatible mechanisms have been defined to key an Secure
    RTP (SRTP) media stream. This document evaluates the keying mechanisms, concentrating
    on their interaction with SIP features and their security properties. This document
    is discussed on the rtpsec mailing list, &lt;http://www.imc.org/ietf-rtpsec&gt;.</p>"
