abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for negotiating scoped security associations
    between Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) agents within a delay-tolerant network
    (DTN). Security associations are used to amortize the costs of asymmetric-keyed
    security operations and allow for efficient and high-throughput BPv7 security
    within a public key infrastructure.</p>"
