abstract:
- content: "<p>UMSP gives the universal environment for integration of any Internet
    devices in one computing system. UMSP controls the distributed execution of applications
    at a level of network connections, gives the access to applications memory on
    remote nodes, and provides the network interaction on basis of the Remote Application
    Procedure Call. The submitted document is updating of the RFC3018 specification.
    The difference is the independence of the protocol from the format and the length
    of network address, the interaction between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, and the interaction
    between hosts with public and non-public network addresses.</p>"
