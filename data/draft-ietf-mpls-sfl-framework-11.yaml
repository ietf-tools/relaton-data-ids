abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 8372 ("MPLS Flow Identification Considerations") describes the requirement
    for introducing flow identities within the MPLS architecture. This document describes
    a method of accomplishing this by using a technique called "Synonymous Flow Labels"
    in which labels that mimic the behavior of other labels provide the identification
    service. These identifiers can be used to trigger per-flow operations on the packet
    at the receiving label switching router.</p>
