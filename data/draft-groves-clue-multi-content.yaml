abstract:
- content: <p>In a multipoint Telepresence conference, there are more than two sites
    participating. Additional complexity is required to enable media streams from
    each participant to show up on the displays of the other participants. Common
    policies to address the multipoint case include "site-switch" and "segment-switch".
    The document will discuss these policies as well as the "composed" policy and
    how they work in the multipoint case. The current CLUE framework document contains
    the "composed" and "switched" attributes to describe situations where a capture
    is mix or composition of streams or where the capture represents a dynamic subset
    of streams. "Composed" and "switched" are capture level attributes. In addition
    to these attributes the framework defines an attribute "Scene-switch-policy" on
    a capture scene entry (CSE) level which indicates how the captures are switched.
    This draft discusses composition/switching in CLUE and makes a number of proposals
    to better define and support these capabilities.</p>
