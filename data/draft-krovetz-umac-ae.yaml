abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies UMAC-AE, a shared-key algorithm that simultaneously
    encrypts data using a block cipher in counter mode while also authenticating the
    data with UMAC. At its peak rate, using AES as the block cipher, UMAC-AE encrypts
    and authenticates data at a cost of about 10% more than simple encryption. UMAC
    is unencumbered by intellectual property claims and can be used freely. Pairing
    UMAC with a license-free block cipher, such as AES, provides fast and license-free
    authenticated encryption.</p>"
