abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2326 [1] overloads the functionality of the PLAY and PAUSE methods
    to provide rudimentary support for 'muting' individual streams in an (Real Time
    Streaming Protocol) presentation. The current specification has several inconsistencies.
    In addition, we believe that this functionality should be optional. This document
    specifies an extension to RTSP consisting of new MUTE and UNMUTE methods, providing
    equivalent functionality in a consistent, optional manner.</p>"
