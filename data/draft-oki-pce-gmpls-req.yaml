abstract:
- content: "<p>Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of traffic engineering
    in Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and IP/MPLS net- works.
    In IP/MPLS networks, PCE provides MPLS LSP routes with con- straints. In GMPLS
    networks, PCE provides GMPLS LSP routes and optimal virtual network topology reconfiguration
    control, and jugdes on whether a new lower-region LSP should be established when
    a higher-region LSP is requested. PCE also handles interworking between GMPLS
    and IP/MPLS net- works, both of which will coexist at some point during the migration
    process.</p>"
