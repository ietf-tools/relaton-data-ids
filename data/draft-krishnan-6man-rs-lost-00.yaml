abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 stateless auto-configuration(SLAAC) mechanism allows a host
    to generate its own addresses using a combination of locally available information
    and information advertised by routers. This document describes a failure scenario
    for SLAAC and discusses how hosts can recover from this failure in a properly
    configured network.</p>"
