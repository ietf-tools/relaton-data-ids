abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) over Mobile IPv6. In this mechanism, a home agent (HA) on home subnet acts
    as a redirect server and a registrar for SIP as well as a home router for Mobile
    IPv6. Thus, a binding cache in the HA contains location information for SIP as
    well as home registration entries for Mobile IPv6. An access router on foreign
    subnet acts as only a router that offers a domain name. To implement the proposed
    mechanism, some messages used in network layer are newly defined, such as a router
    advertisement, a router solicitation and a binding update. In the proposed mechanism,
    a mobile node doesn't require dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and thus
    both home and foreign subnets don't need DHCP servers, unlike existing mechanisms
    on Mobile IPv4.</p>"
