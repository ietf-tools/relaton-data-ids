abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are
    looking for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to faults in the
    IP network carrying the packets for these services. This draft describes a mechanism
    for minimizing packet loss in a network when node or link failures occur. Multicast
    only Fast Re- Route (MoFRR) works by making simple enhancements to multicast routing
    protocols such as PIM and mLDP.</p>"
