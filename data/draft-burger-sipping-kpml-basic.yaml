abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a profile of the SIP Event Package "kpml" that
    enables simple monitoring of DTMF signals and uses XML documents referred to as
    Key Press Markup Language (KPML). This profile assumes devices of lesser capability
    that may have trouble parsing subscription requests or producing generic XML documents.
    This is a profile of RFC 4730, KPML.Conventions used in this document RFC2119
    [1] provides the interpretations for the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    found in this document. The Application Interaction Framework document [9] provides
    the interpretations for the terms "User Device", "SIP Application", and "User
    Input". This document uses the term "Application" and "Requesting Application"
    interchangeably with "SIP Application". Additionally, the Application Interaction
    Framework document discusses User Device Proxies. A common instantiation of a
    User Device Proxy is a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateway. Because
    the normative behavior of a presentation free User Interface is identical for
    a presentation free SIP User Agent and a presentation free User Device Proxy,
    this document uses "User Device" for both cases.</p>
