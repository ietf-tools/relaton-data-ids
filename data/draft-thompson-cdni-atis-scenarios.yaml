abstract:
- content: <p>The ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum (IIF) is a leading developer of
    requirements, standards, and specifications for Internet Protocol Television,
    or IPTV. IIF has specified an architecture for Content On Demand applications
    which was published as the [ATIS-0800042] IPTV Content on Demand (CoD) Service
    specification. ATIS IIF is now working on revision 2 of this document. Revision
    2 of ATIS CoD specification includes an additional work item called "Internet
    Sourced Content" which includes "off net delivery". Both Internet Sourced Content
    and off net delivery will address scenarios that include delivery of content from
    a Content Service Provider through multiple CDNs operated by different organizations
    to a user agent. This document provides information on [ATIS-0800042], and the
    Internet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases that are relevant to CDNI.
    The ATIS IIF architecture group focuses on developing architectures and prefers
    to reference existing protocols where ever possible. If, and as, the IETF CDNI
    effort progresses, the ATIS IIF architecture group will be evaluating the protocols
    defined by the CDNI working group for inclusion in the CDN interconnect scenarios
    defined as part of the Internet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases.
    A goal of the present document is to illustrate the Internet Sourced Content and
    off net Delivery use cases defined in revision 2 of the ATIS CoD architecture
    that are relevant to the IETF CDNI work. It is hoped that these use cases can
    also be used to guide requirements for the development of IETF CDNI protocols.</p>
