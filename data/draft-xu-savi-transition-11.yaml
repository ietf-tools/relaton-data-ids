abstract:
- content: "<p>SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvement) is an excellent mechanism
    for anti-IP-spoofing, which was advocated by IETF but only focused on single-stack
    or simple network scenarios right now. To the best of our knowledge, existing
    studies have not paid attention to the IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. However,
    since IPv4/IPv6 transition schemes are plenty and various, one solution cannot
    meet all requirements of them. In this draft, we present a SAVI-based general
    framework for IP source address validation and traceback in the IPv4/IPv6 transition
    scenarios, which achieve this by extracting out essential and mutual properties
    from these schemes, and forming sub-solutions for each property. When one transition
    scheme is composed from various properties, its IP source address validation and
    traceback solution is directly comprised by the corresponding sub-solutions. Thus,
    the most exciting advantage of this framework is that it is a once-and-for-all
    solution no matter how transition schemes change. Till now, this proposal was
    approved by China Communications Standards Association (CCSA), and we will actively
    promote it to apply real network scenarios.</p>"
