abstract:
- content: "<p>Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an area of
    concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease power consumption
    overall assumes importance. Multicast replication capacity is an attribute of
    every line card of major routers and multi-layer switches that support multicast
    in the core of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an enterprise network. Currently
    multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint Multicast Distribution trees
    consume power while delivering multiple output streams of data from a given input
    stream. The multicast distribution trees are constructed without any regard for
    a proper placement of the replication points and consequent optimal power consumption
    at these points. This results in overloading certain routers while under-utilizing
    others. An optimal usage of these replication resources could reduce power consumption
    on these routers bringing power consumption to optimality. In this paper, we propose
    a mechanism by which Multicast Distribution Trees are constructed for carrying
    multicast traffic across multiple routers within a given network. We propose that
    these Multicast Distribution Trees be built by using the information pertaining
    to power-replication capacity ratio available with fine grained components such
    as multicast capable line-cards of routers and multi-layer switches deployed within
    a network.</p>"
