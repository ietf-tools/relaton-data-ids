abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates, Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document describes the conventions
    for using Dilithium quantum-resistant signatures in Internet X.509 certificates
    and certifiate revocation lists. The conventions for the associated post-quantum
    signatures, subject public keys, and private key are also described.</p>"
