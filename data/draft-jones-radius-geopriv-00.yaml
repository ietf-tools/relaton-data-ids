abstract:
- content: "<p>Network access servers are increasingly capable of providing user and
    device location information to AAA servers. This enables the AAA server to make
    additional authorization decisions based on the location of the user or access
    device. The home or visited network may also use the location information for
    other purposes (e.g., acting as a location server). This document provides guidelines
    for the encoding and transport of location information using the RADIUS protocol
    which are compliant with the Geopriv requirements for security and privacy.</p>"
