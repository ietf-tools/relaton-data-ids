abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a few security concerns remaining within the
    working group draft of the DKIM base document. As the base document is a work-in-progress,
    some issues may have been already resolved. As with many protocols, accommodations
    for convenience are balanced against possible negative security repercussions.
    This draft attempts to expand upon some of these repercussions. In addition, some
    threat scenarios may have been considered too improbable to warrant the inclusion
    of mechanisms exceeding prior strategies. This draft attempts to justify added
    precaution. And lastly, some considerations may have neglected a transformation
    occurring with the display of the email-address localpart and domain impacting
    a recipient's recognition. This draft offers minor remedies for these security
    related issues.</p>"
