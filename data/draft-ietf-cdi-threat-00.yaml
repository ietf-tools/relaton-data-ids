abstract:
- content: "<p>Content internetworking (also referred to as content distribution internetworking,
    or CDI) is the technology for interconnecting content networks. The CDI model
    allows for interconnecting various Content Networks. The internetworking task
    requires request routing and content distribution protocols. This document investigates
    the security risks and threats associated with the content internetworking. Proposed
    remedies are viewed not as design recommendations but more as illustrations of
    the nature of threats.</p>"
