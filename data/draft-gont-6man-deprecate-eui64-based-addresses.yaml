abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for IPv6 typically results
    in hosts configuring one or more stable addresses composed of a network prefix
    advertised by a local router, and an Interface Identifier that typically embeds
    a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address). The security and privacy implications
    of embedding hardware addresses in the Interface Identifier have been known and
    understood for some time now, and some popular IPv6 implementations have already
    deviated from such scheme to mitigate these issues. This document deprecates the
    use of hardware addresses in IPv6 Interface Identifiers, and recommends the use
    of an alternative scheme ([I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]) for the generation
    of IPv6 stable addresses.</p>"
