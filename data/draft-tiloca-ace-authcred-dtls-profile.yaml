abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
    Profile for Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE).
    In particular, it specifies the use of additional formats of authentication credentials
    for establishing a DTLS session, when peer authentication is based on asymmetric
    cryptography. Therefore, this document updates RFC 9202. What is defined in this
    document is seamlessly applicable also if the profile uses Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) instead.</p>"
