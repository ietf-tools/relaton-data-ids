abstract:
- content: "<p>The energy aware dynamic source routing (EADSR) protocol is an extension
    to the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. It retains
    the features and benefits of DSR while it incorporates new features for energy
    limited nodes. The EADSR features include (1) a DSR header option so that link
    power costs can be passed with source routes; (2) an extended route discovery
    protocol to find lower energy routes than minimum hop routes; and (3) an additional
    route maintenance mechanism that allows the source node to respond to link changes
    without route disruption. The protocol is able to find routes with minimum total
    transmit power cost. It is able to track changes in link power on a route, choose
    between routes based on cost, and notify the source of new lower cost routes as
    they become available. This document specifies the EADSR header option and operation
    changes to DSR.</p>"
