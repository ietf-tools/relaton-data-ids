- content: "<p>The CoAP protocol was designed with direct connections and proxies
    in mind. This document defines mechanisms by which chains of proxies can be set
    up. In combination, they enable the operation of hidden services and client similar
    to how Tor (The Onion Router) enables it for TCP based protocols.</p>"
