abstract:
- content: "<p>This note attempts to describe how to apply the MIPv6 protocol to provide
    fault tolerance to transport layer connections established between a multi-homed
    host and other hosts in the Internet. Specifically, this note addresses the usage
    of MIPv6 signaling messages to convey information about alternative address to
    be used when an outage occurs. Additionally, possible mechanisms to detect failures
    affecting the currently used path are explored.</p>"
