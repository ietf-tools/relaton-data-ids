abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
    proxy mechanism to allow intermediate networking equipment (ex: Satellite HUB/Modem)
    to intercept BFD packets and to generate BFD packets to relay the health of connection
    monitored links. Note that this is an informational document that does not propose
    any changes to the BFD protocol.</p>"
