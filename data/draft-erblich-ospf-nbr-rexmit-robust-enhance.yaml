abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to process LSAs within a Update packet requires that the
    length field be correct to generate the next offset within the packet. During
    the rare times that a checksum error and length LSA fields are incorrect, the
    beginning of later LSAs header's can't be determined. This draft specifies a transparent
    method to allow all valid LSAs to be processed even when these corrupted LSAs
    exist on the neighbor's retransmission list.</p>"
