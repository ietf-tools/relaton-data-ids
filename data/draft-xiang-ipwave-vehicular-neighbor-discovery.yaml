abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an
    extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular networks. An
    optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)
    mechanism are established for both operation efficiency and the saving of wireless
    bandwidth and vehicle energy. Also, the two new ND options for a rapid prefix
    and service discovery are used to announce the network prefixes and services inside
    a vehicle (i.e., a vehicle's internal network). Finally, a mobility management
    scheme is proposed for moving vehicles in vehicular environments to support seamless
    communication for the continuity of transport-layer sessions (e.g., TCP connections).</p>"
