abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies additional information that can inserted in
    IS-IS LSPs to convey link capabilities that may be useful in certain applications.
    In particular, an IS may convey that zero or more of its links are explicit marked
    and/or implicit U-turn recipient capable, which may be described as capable of
    identifying traffic as U-turn traffic and redirecting the traffic to a suitable
    alternate. The immediate applicability for these two link capabilities is in support
    of local protection, provided by a U-turn alternate, in the event of a link and/or
    node failure while the IS-IS area is reconverging onto a new topology.</p>"
