abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to extend the existing Active Measurement
    Protocol, in order to implement alternate marking methodology detailed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark].
    The extension for Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) RFC 5357 [RFC5357]
    and One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) RFC 4656 [RFC4656] will be considered.
    RFC6374 [RFC6374] Use Case is also reported. This proposal defines a simplified
    mechanism with benefits to the metric precision and computational load. Hybrid
    measurements are also enabled.</p>"
