abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol RFC2960 [5] provides transparent
    multi-homing to its upper layer users. This multi-homing is accomplished through
    the passing of address parameters in the initial setup message used by SCTP. In
    an IPv4 network addresses SHOULD NOT be passed without consideration of their
    routeablility. This document defines considerations and enumerates general rules
    that an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT and INIT-ACK chunks
    when including IPv4 addresses.</p>"
