abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a simple, low- overhead,
    UDP-based protocol for use with resource-constrained IP networks and nodes. CoAP
    defines a simple technique to individually retransmit lost messages, but has no
    other congestion control mechanisms. This document motivates the need for additional
    congestion control mechanisms, and defines some simple strawman proposals. The
    goal is to encourage experimentation with these and other proposals, in order
    to determine which mechanisms are feasible to implement on resource- constrained
    nodes and are effective in real deployments.</p>"
