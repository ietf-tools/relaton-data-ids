- content: "<p>This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers
    that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of designating a
    resolver to be used for a subset of client queries based on domain. This method
    is intended to work both for locally- hosted resolvers and resolvers accessible
    over the broader Internet.</p>"
