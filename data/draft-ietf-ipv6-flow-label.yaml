abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the IPv6 Flow Label field and the minimum requirements
    for IPv6 source nodes labeling flows, IPv6 nodes forwarding labeled packets, and
    flow state establishment methods. Even when mentioned as examples of possible
    uses of the flow labeling, more detailed requirements for specific use cases are
    out of scope for this document. The usage of the Flow Label field enables efficient
    IPv6 flow classification based only on IPv6 main header fields in fixed positions.
