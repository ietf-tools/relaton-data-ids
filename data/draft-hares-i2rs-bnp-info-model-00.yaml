abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains three information Models: Basic Network Policy
    (BNP IM). ACLs do not provide all the policy support required by BGP, Policy Based
    Routing (PBR), SFC Topology Information Model (SF- Topo IM), Service Forwarding
    Chaing IM (SFC IM), and and flow specification filtering. The BNP IM has the following
    top-down levels of Policy Hierarchy: Policy Set, Policy Group, Policy Rule, and
    conditional actions within the policy rule (conditional match and Actions). These
    can be used in PBR-RIB or BGP to provide an ordered set of policy rules grouped
    with a Policy Group via operators (AND, OR, etc.) and ordered by a combination
    of priority and precedence. The Policy is an ordered set of Policy Groups. The
    BNP IM is based on the concept of an extensible information model for representing
    policies. This concept is also found in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM)
    (RFC3060) and the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644)
    and policy based routing.</p>"
