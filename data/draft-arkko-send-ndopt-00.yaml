abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover other
    nodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to find routers
    and to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors.
    If not secured, ND protocol is vulnerable to various attacks. This document specifies
    security mechanisms for ND. Contrary to the original ND specifications, these
    mechanisms do not make use of IPsec. The purpose of this draft is to present an
    alternative to the current approach in the Working Group.</p>"
