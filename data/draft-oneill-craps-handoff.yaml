abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a generalized IP handoff model that supports edge
    mobility such as that encountered in cellular systems and Internet roaming. The
    model is mobile-controlled and network- constrained. The model is generic in that
    it permits both planned and unplanned handoff (i.e. proactive and reactive) and
    supports both make-before-break and break-before-make link layers. It also supports
    movement within and between technologies, as well as within and between domains.
    Finally, it is -equally applicable to routed mobility and to tunneled mobile IP-based
    mobility.</p>"
