abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this report is to document how the requirements for publication
    of a routing protocol as an Internet Draft Standard have been satisfied by Border
    Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4). This report satisfies the requirement for
    "the second report", as described in Section 6.0 of RFC 1264. In order to fulfill
    the requirement, this report augments RFC 1774 and summarizes the key features
    of BGP-4, as well as analyzes the protocol with respect to scaling and performance.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
