abstract:
- content: "<p>In CDNI deployment, URL signing mechanism should continue to function
    for content access restriction. Previous CDNI documents have described the basic
    of URL signing. However, in some cases that the key cannot be distributed from
    the Authoritative CDN to the Delivering CDN, the URL validation requirement cannot
    be fulfilled. This document gives some supplementary description concerning URL
    signing and validation mechanism in case of DNS based Request Routing, and as
    a result, a compliment for authorization object in metadata interface is presented.</p>"
