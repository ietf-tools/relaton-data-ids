abstract:
- content: "<p>The MGCP protocol describes a protocol for controlling a VOIP (Voice
    Over IP) gateway from an external call agent. The protocol defines a number of
    event packages, each of which defines a group of events supporting a particular
    type of gateway functionality. For example, there is a package for MF trunks,
    one for DTMF, and one for RTP. A gateway may support one or more packages depending
    on the functional- ity it provides. A Residential Gateway might support the Generic
    Media, DTMF, Line, and RTP packages while an MF Trunk Gateway could support the
    Generic Media, MF, DTMF, MF Trunk, and RTP packages. This document proposes a
    set of IVR-related events that constitute an MGCP Announcement Package for use
    by an Announcement Server Gateway. This event package provides support for the
    standard IVR operations of Play Announcement, Play Collect, and Play Record. It
    supports direct references to simple audio as well as indirect references to simple
    and complex audio. It also provides multi-language audio vari- ables, control
    of audio interruptibility, digit buffer control, spe- cial key sequences, and
    support for reprompting during data collec- tion.</p>"
