abstract:
- content: "<p>In this contribution, a design of escape message mechanism is proposed,
    where the service provider sends an escape message to the service consumer using
    existing non-PQC connection and then starts to re-establish the quantum-safe protocol.
    The proposed escape message can potentially be used in a variety of protocols,
    including IPsec, TLS, or between the air interface of a cellpohone and a network
    device. We believe that for largely deployed networks and entities, escape messages
    can be provided as a plan B for legacy devices of the service provider and consumer
    that may not able to complete post- quantum migration in advance. It can mitigate
    negative migration impacts when potential Q-day occurs.</p>"
