abstract:
- content: "<p>Various Traffic Engineering extensions for OSPF have been proposed
    in [KATZ, OSPFEXT] and others. However, these are basically applicable only to
    intra-area Traffic Engineering since they do not support inter-area advertisements
    of the resource information. This draft proposes a new scheme for advertising
    the summarized resource information for Traffic Engineering outside the area.
    It also specifies a new LSA to achieve this advertisement.</p>"
