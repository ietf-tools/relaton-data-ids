abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP TTL Security Hack (BTSH) is designed to protect the BGP [RFC1771]
    infrastructure from CPU-utilization based attacks. While BTSH is most effective
    in protecting directly connected BGP peers, it can also provide a lower level
    of protection to multi-hop sessions.</p>"
