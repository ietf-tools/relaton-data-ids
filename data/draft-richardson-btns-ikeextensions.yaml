abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies how to use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocols,
    such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, to setup "unauthenticated" security associations (SAs)
    for use with the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the IPsec Authentication
    Header (AH). This is part of the Better-Than-Nothing-Security (BTNS) work. Two
    optional IKE extensions are documented here, and the format for one certificate
    payload type is fully specified.</p>
