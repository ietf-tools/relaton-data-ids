abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework to assist the writers of policy
    or practice statements and the designers of a Public Key Infrastructure to prepare
    disaster recovery plans in case of a private key-compromise or a private key-loss.
    This may happen to end-entity keys, Certification Authorities, Revocation Authorities,
    Attribute Authorities, or Time-Stamping Authorities. Since certificates have finite
    validity, CA key-rollover should be planned in advance. In addition, denial of
    service attacks on Repositories holding CRLs has also to be considered. This framework
    provides a comprehensive list of potential key- compromise or key-loss conditions
    that, in the opinion of the authors, should be addressed so that it is possible
    to quickly recover from exceptional situations.</p>"
