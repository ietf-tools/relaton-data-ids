abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC3315] was not written with the expectation that other stateful
    DHCPv6 options would be developed. [RFC3633] shoe-horned the new options for Prefix
    Delegation options for DHCPv6 into DHCPv6. Implementation experience of the CPE
    model described in [RFC6204] has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6 protocol
    in supporting multiple stateful options.</p>"
