abstract:
- content: "<p>In this note a number of PCE architectural and computational options
    are evaluated against a medium sized wavelength switched optical network. The
    key performance measures of overall and backward blocking are reported under different
    dynamic traffic scenarios. The corresponding reduction in connection blocking
    probabilities and computational advantages enabled by these architectural alternatives
    strongly warrant their inclusion in continuing PCE WSON work.</p>"
