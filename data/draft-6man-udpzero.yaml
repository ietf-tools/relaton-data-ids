abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the role of the transport checksum when used
    with IPv6, as defined in RFC2460. It presents a summary of the trade-offs for
    evaluating the safety of updating RFC 2460 to permit an IPv6 UDP endpoint to use
    a zero value in the checksum field to indicate that no checksum is present. The
    document describes issues and design principles that need to be considered and
    provides recommendations.</p>"
