abstract:
- content: "<p>It is widely recognized that it has become very difficult to introduce
    new transport protocols on the Internet. On reason to this is that there are no
    agreed-upon way for a source end host to find out whether there is support for
    a particular transport protocol along the network path from itself to a destination
    end host or not. This document describes a Happy Eyeballs framework that generalizes
    previously proposed Happy Eyeballs mechanisms to include a transport protocol,
    the configuration of this transport protocol, as well as a transport address,
    i.e., to include complete transport solutions. The described Happy Eyeballs framework
    is not only useful in the design and implementation of mechanisms that are to
    determine the support of particular transport solutions, but also for the design
    of mechanisms that are to select the transport solution, which, according to some
    criteria, is the most appropriate one to use.</p>"
