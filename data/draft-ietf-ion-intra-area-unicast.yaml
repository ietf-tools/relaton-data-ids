abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how IP unicast can be efficiently implemented
    among routers belonging to the same area of a routing domain, where the connectivity
    is provided by a legacy ATM network as defined by the ATM Forum or ITU. This proposal
    is designed to be complementary to IP multicast solutions such as the one described
    in [1].</p>"
