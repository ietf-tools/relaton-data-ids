abstract:
- content: "<p>In some cases, it is desirable not to route transit traffic via a specific
    OSPF router. However, OSPF [RFC2328] does not specify a standard way to accomplish
    this. This memo describes a backward- compatible technique that may be used by
    OSPF implementations to advertise unavailability to forward transit traffic or
    to lower the preference level for the paths through such a router.</p>"
