- content: "<p>This document provides a summary of the IAB/IRTF Workshop on 'Congestion
    Control for Interactive Real-Time Communication', which took place in Vancouver,
    Canada, on July 28, 2012. The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion
    on congestion control mechanisms for interactive real-time communication. This
    report summarizes the discussions and lists the conclusions and recommendations
    to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community. The views and positions
    in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect
    the views and positions of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
    or the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).</p>"
