- content: "<p>Since small devices such as sensors are often required to be physically
    small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internet protocols will have to
    deal with having limited computing resources and memory. This report describes
    the design and implementation of a small TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small
    enough to be used in minimal systems.</p>"
