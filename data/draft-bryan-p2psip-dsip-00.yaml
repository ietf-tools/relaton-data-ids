abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the motivation, requirements, and architectural
    design for a distributed Session Initiation Protocol (dSIP). dSIP is a Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) based approach for SIP registration and resource discovery using distributed
    hash tables maintained with SIP messages. This design removes the need for central
    servers from SIP, while offering full backward compatibility with SIP, allowing
    reuse of existing clients, and allowing P2P enabled peers to communicate with
    conventional SIP entities. A basic introduction to the concepts of P2P is presented,
    backward compatibility issues addressed, and security considerations are discussed.
    dSIP is one possible implementation of the protocols being discussed for creation
    in the P2PSIP WG. In the context of the work being proposed, this draft represents
    a concrete proposal for the P2PSIP Peer Protocol, using SIP with extensions as
    the underlying protocol. In this architecture, no P2PSIP Client Protocol is needed,
    rather unmodified SIP is used for access by non-peers.</p>"
