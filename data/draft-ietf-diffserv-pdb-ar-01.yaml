abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a diffserv per-domain behaviour (PDB) called
    Assured Rate (AR). The AR PDB is suitable for carrying traffic aggregates that
    require rate assurance but do not require delay and jitter bounds. The traffic
    aggregate will also have the opportunity to obtain excess bandwidth beyond the
    assured rate. The PDB can be created using the diffserv AF PHB along with suitable
    policers at the domain ingress nodes.</p>"
