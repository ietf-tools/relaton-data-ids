abstract:
- content: <p>This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns
    about "pervasive monitoring" (PM) as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass-attack].
    It begins by describing the current criteria (discussed at the STRINT workshop
    [STRINT]) for addressing concerns about PM. It then examines terminology that
    has been used in IETF standards (and in academic publications) to describe encryption
    and key management techniques, with a focus on authentication vs. anonymity. Based
    on this analysis, it propose a new term, "opportunistic security" to describe
    a goal for IETF security protocols, one countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.</p>
