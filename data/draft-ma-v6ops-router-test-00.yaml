abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the test for the router and BRAS devices on
    the degree of IPv6 support. IPv6 functions and performance of the routers and
    BRAS widely deployed in current networks are included in testing items. It turns
    out that some specific IPv6 functions and performance are not well-supported by
    the router and BRAS devices. The test results have been discussed to share with
    internet community.</p>"
