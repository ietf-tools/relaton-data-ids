- content: "<p>This document offers a framework for IP multicast deployment in an
    MPLS environment. Issues arising when MPLS techniques are applied to IP multicast
    are overviewed. The pros and cons of existing IP multicast routing protocols in
    the context of MPLS are described and the relation to the different trigger methods
    and label distribution modes are discussed. The consequences of various layer
    2 (L2) technologies are listed. Both point-to-point and multi-access networks
