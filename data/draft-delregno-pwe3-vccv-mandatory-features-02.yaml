abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085]
    defines several Control Channel (CC) Types for MPLS PW's , none of which are preferred
    or mandatory. As a result, independent implementations of different subsets of
    the three options have resulted in interoperability challenges. In RFC5085 the
    CV type of LSP Ping is made the default for MPLS PW's and ICMP Ping is made optional.
    This however, is a recommendation and not a requirement for implementations which
    can also lead to interoperability challenges. To enable interoperability between
    implementations, this document defines a subset of control channels that is considered
    mandatory for VCCV implementation. This will ensure that VCCV remains the valuable
    tool it was designed to be in multi-vendor, multi-implementation and multi-carrier
    networks. This document also states requirements for the CV type too. This draft
    is specific to MPLS PW's and not L2TPv3 PW. For the L2TPv3 PW only one CC and
    CV type are specified and the issues raised in this draft do not arise.</p>"
