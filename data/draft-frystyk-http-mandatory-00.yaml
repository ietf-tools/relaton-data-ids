abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities
    than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from distributed authoring,
    collaboration, and printing, to various remote procedure call mechanisms. This
    document proposes the use of a mandatory extension mechanism designed to address
    the tension between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate
    extension of applications such as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The proposal
    associates each extension with a URI[2], and use a few new RFC 822[1] style header
    fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties
    involved in an extended transaction.</p>"
