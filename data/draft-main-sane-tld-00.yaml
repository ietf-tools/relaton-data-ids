abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo examines practical problems in the use of the ICANN generic
    top-level domains, in particular that they fail to provide a stable namespace
    that is required by some protocols. The practical problems are traced to underlying
    problems in domain name allocation policy in those domains. Possible solutions
    to the problem are discussed, including the possibility of a new top-level domain
    to be managed in accordance with IANA assigned-numbers principles.</p>"
