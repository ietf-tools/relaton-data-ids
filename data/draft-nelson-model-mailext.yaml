- content: "<p>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to propose an update to Internet
    RFC 1521 to include a new primary content-type to be Internet RFC 1521 to include
    a new primary content-type to be known as 'model'. RFC 1521[1] describes mechanisms
    for specifying and describing the format of Internet Message Bodies via content-type/subtype
    pairs. We believe that 'model' defines a fundamental type of content with unique
    presentational, hardware, and processing aspects. Various subtypes of this primary
    type are immediately anticipated but will be covered under separate documents.</p>"
