- content: "<p>This document discusses several scenarios that multiple replies for
    a single request are needed, with the ability to terminate the replies at any
    time. Such scenarios are not well supported by current NETCONF (Network Configuration)
    protocol. An extention at the NETCONF messaging layer is needed to fulfill the
    requirement.</p>"
