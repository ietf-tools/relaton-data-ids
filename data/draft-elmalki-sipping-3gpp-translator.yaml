abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETF meetings
    regarding the suitability of translators (i.e. NAT-PT) as mechanisms for IPv4
    to IPv6 transition. It has often been stated that NAT-PT is not a mechanism to
    be recommended in general to solve the IPv6-IPv4 transition problem. There have
    also been discussions regarding special scenarios where some form of translators
    could be deployed if their use is documented appropriately. The aim of this draft
    is to document the rationale for using translators in 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership
    Project) networks for IPv6-only SIP- based IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) services
    and to describe a solution to the problem.</p>"
