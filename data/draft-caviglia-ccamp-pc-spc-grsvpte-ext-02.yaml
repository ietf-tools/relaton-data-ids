abstract:
- content: <p>In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections controlled
    either by GMPLS (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by Management System (Permanent
    Connections - PC) may independently coexist, the ability of transforming an existing
    PC into a SPC and vice versa - without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being
    carried over it - is a valuable option. This applies especially when a GMPLS based
    Control Plane is first introduced into an existing network and there may be the
    need, from a Carrier point of view, to pass under GMPLS control existing connections
    already set up over Data Plane. In other terms, such operation could be seen as
    a way of transferring the ownership and control of an existing and in-use Data
    Plane connection between the Management Plane and the Control Plane, leaving its
    Data Plane state untouched. This memo provides a minor extension to GRSVP-TE signaling
    protocol, within GMPLS architecture, to enable such connection ownership transfer
    and describes the proposed procedures. Conventions used in this document The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC2119 [1].</p>
