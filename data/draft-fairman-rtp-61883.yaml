abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a payload format for transporting IEC 61883-1[2]
    (CIP) compliant IEEE1394 isochronous transport data using RTP. A 1394[3] CIP isochronous
    transport may carry a stream format, such as DV[4], AM824[5] or MPEG[6], that
    has been packetized for isochronous transport by the source. The format is opaque
    to the transport mechanism. The isochronous transport clock is derived from the
    1394 cycle timer clock. This protocol may be used to transport 1394 61883 streams
    between 1394 buses by IP, specifically Ethernet/IP.</p>"
