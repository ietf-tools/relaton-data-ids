abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently a path computation is the ability to find the path/s connecting
    two or more points of the network identified with addresses. The path selection
    can be driven requiring constraints and metric minimization in traversing the
    network. The computed paths may be used for realizing a network slice providing
    connectivity to applications that shall be able to reach addresses of the end-points.
    A cloud native application (CNA) becomes a network point only when an instance
    of it has been deployed in a site fulfilling the requirements for resources, scalability,
    reliability, security and costs... The process for identifying where to deploy
    a CNA is disjoined from path computation that is executed in a following step.
    If the path computation cannot satisfy the request not finding a connectivity
    solution, the chosen end-points shall be changed restarting the process from the
    selection of the deployment sites. The CNA problem can be generalized to all the
    cases where more end- points can be alternatives for terminating a path. For example,
    an enterprise site may be attached to the ISP backbone via more nodes in risk
    diversity belonging to different network segments. How computing the best connectivity
    in the ISP network including the selection of the best placement for the end-points
    in the enterprise sites? Where locating end-points of overlay network may be managed
    as well as an application.</p>"
