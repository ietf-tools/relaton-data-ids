abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a BGP Extension to protect the route information
    on the basis of authentication on the BGP message between BGP speakers,In this
    mechanism,an addtional Capabilty option(Authentication Code) and random number
    used for authentication are added to OPEN message,and the Authentication Capability
    is negotiated between BGP speakers,when they pass the negotiation and setup the
    Established relationship, all the successive message will be authenticated using
    MD5 algorithm,with the Marker field in the BGP message substituted with the MD5
    digest of the combination including message body.This mechanism can guard against
    that the BGP message be intercepted and tampered by the attacker.</p>"
