abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time media streams are not resilient against packet losses. RTP
    [1] provides all the necessary mechanisms to restore ordering and timing to properly
    reproduce a media stream at the recipient. RTP also provides continuous feedback
    about the overall reception quality from all receivers -- thereby allowing the
    sender(s) in the mid-term (in the order of several seconds to minutes) to adapt
    their coding scheme and transmission behavior to the observed network QoS. However,
    except for a few payload specific mechanisms [2], RTP makes no provision for timely
    feedback that would allow a sender to repair the media stream immediately: through
    retransmissions, retro-active FEC, or media-specific mechanisms such as reference
    picture selection.</p>"
