abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group is considering protocols
    for signaling information about a data flow along its path in the network. The
    NSIS suite of protocols is envisioned to support various signaling applications
    that need to install and/or manipulate such state in the network. Based on existing
    work on signaling requirements, this document proposes an architectural framework
    for these signaling protocols. This document provides a model for the network
    entities that take part in such signaling, and for the relationship between signaling
    and the rest of network operation. We decompose the overall signaling protocol
    suite into a generic (lower) layer, with separate upper layers for each specific
    signaling application. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
