abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is commonly used to protect HTTP and
    other protocols; it provides encrypted and authenticated conversations between
    a client and a server. In some scenarios, two TLS sessions are used, so that a
    third device can participate in the protected communication. In these cases, separate
    TLS sessions are run between the client and the middle device, on one side, and
    the middle device and the server on the other side. This provides the needed security,
    as long as the client, server, and middle device use appropriate and consistent
    security policies. However, this last part is problematic; how can the middle
    device know if a client trusts a server? At present, TLS provides no mechanism
    to coordinate policies, and there is no convenient way to do so. This note defines
    a TLS extension that allows a TLS server to provide a TLS client with all of information
    about the other TLS server (or servers) that are participating in the application
    layer traffic that the client needs to make a well-informed access control decision.
    This empowers the client to reject TLS sessions that include servers that it does
    not trust.</p>"
