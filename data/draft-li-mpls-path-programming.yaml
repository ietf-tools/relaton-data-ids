abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing has been proposed to cope with the use cases in traffic
    engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc. It can leverage existing MPLS
    dataplane without any modification. In fact, the label stack capability in MPLS
    would have been utilized well to implement flexible path programming to satisfy
    all kinds of requirements of service bearing. But in the distributed environment,
    the flexible programming capability is difficult to implement and always confined
    to reachability. As the introducing of central control in the network, the flexible
    MPLS programming capability becomes possible owing to two factors: 1. It becomes
    easier to allocate label for more purposes than reachability; 2. It is easy to
    calculate the MPLS path in a global network view. Moreover, the MPLS path programming
    capability can be utilized to satisfy more requirements of service bearing in
    the service layer which is defined as service-oriented MPLS path programming.
    This document defines the concept of MPLS path programming, then proposes use
    cases, architecture and protocol extension requirements in the service layer.</p>"
