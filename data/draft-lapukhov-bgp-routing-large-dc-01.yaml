abstract:
- content: <p>Some service providers build and operate data centers that support over
    100,000 servers. In this document, such data-centers are referred to as "large-scale"
    data centers to differentiate them the from more common smaller infrastructures.
    The data centers of this scale have a unique set of network requirements, with
    emphasis on operational simplicity and network stability. This document attempts
    to summarize the authors' experiences in designing and supporting large data centers,
    using BGP as the only control-plane protocol. The intent here is to describe a
    proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry.</p>
