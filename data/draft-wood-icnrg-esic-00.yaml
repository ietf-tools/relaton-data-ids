abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside an encrypted
    session between peers - a sender and receiver - that share a traffic secret, such
    as that which is derived from [CCNxKE]. The peers create an outer naming context
    to identify the encryption session in one direction between the sender and the
    receiver. The sender issues encrypted Interest messages to the receiver, who responds
    with encrypted Content Objects. Inside the outer context, the sender sends Interests
    with different names, for which the receiver may reply to or send InterestReturns
    in response. There does not need to be a naming relationship between the outer
    names and the inner names. The inner content is still protected by normal CCNx
    authentication mechanisms and possibly encrypted under other schemes.</p>"
