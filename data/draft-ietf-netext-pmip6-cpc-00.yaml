abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a central policy controlling network-based mobility
    management solution through Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA), and
    policy controller interactions between Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities(both Mobile
    Access Gateway and Local Mobility Anchor) under an AAA server and policy server
    group within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain. The AAA and policy interactions are not
    only used to download and update mobile node specific user data information between
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities and a remote policy store, but also update the local
    mobility anchor about the current location of the mobile node instead of signaling
    messages between the mobile access gateway and local mobility anchor.</p>"
