abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism based on COSE signatures to provide
    and verify the provenance of YANG data, so it is possible to verify the origin
    and integrity of a dataset, even when those data are going to be processed and/or
    applied in workflows where a crypto-enabled data transport directly from the original
    data stream is not available. As the application of evidence-based OAM automation
    and the use of tools such as AI/ML grow, provenance validation becomes more relevant
    in all scenarios, in support of the assuring the origin and integritu of datasets
    and/or data streams. The use of compact signatures facilitates the inclusion of
    provenance strings in any YANG schema requiring them.</p>"
