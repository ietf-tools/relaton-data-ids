abstract:
- content: "<p>An approach for achieving fault tolerance and load balancing in iSCSI
    using the iSNS discovery mechanism or iSCSI discovery session and the temporary
    redirection mechanism is outlined here. This approach requires no change to iSCSI
    or other protocols that initiators and targets implement. But the manner in which
    initiators perform target discovery, support the temporary redirection mechanism,
    and recover from failed iSCSI sessions affects their ability to support this approach.
    This paper provides implementation guidelines for iSCSI initiators to follow to
    support this form of fault tolerance and load balancing.</p>"
