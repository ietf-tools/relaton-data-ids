abstract:
- content: "<p>Typical use of DNS records enables resolving a server address, but
    this record extension authorizes clients to initiate a specific protocol. This
    document simply extends definitions for fields of a DNS SRV record as defined
    in [RFC2782] and appends '_c' to the label in the Proto field. This extension
    enables administrative control of a domain referenced by a client as it enables
    verification of permitted client addresses. This record extension is useful to
    authorize a client for a specific protocol and possibly useful for confirming
    veracity of a return path also referenced by a client. Although an in-addr.arpa
    IP address reverse DNS query may assert a domain, the domain referenced within
    client identification may be an alias and thus not match. In addition, specific
    protocol authorization for the client can not be deduced and reverse DNS information
    is optional, typically administered separately or not delegated, and thus often
    providing information of limited value.</p>"
