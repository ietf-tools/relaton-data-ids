abstract:
- content: "<p>A critical factor in achieving good performance for IP mobility protocols
    is the design of L2 handover. Handover occurs when a Mobile Node moves from one
    radio Access Point to another. If the new radio Access Point is associated with
    a new subnet, a change in routing reachability may occur and require L3 protocol
    action on the part of the Mobile Node or Access Routers. If no change in subnet
    occurs, the Access Point may still need to take some action to inform the Access
    Router about a change in on-link reachability. In either case, prompt and timely
    information from L2 to the parties involved about the sequencing of handover can
    help optimize handover at the IP level. This draft discusses requirements for
    an L2 handover protocol or API to support optimized handover.</p>"
