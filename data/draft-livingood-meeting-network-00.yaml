abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF participants need a highly reliable and responsive network, with
    sufficient bandwidth to avoid congestion, that enables work to be conducted without
    interruption or network limitation during an IETF meeting. Such a network enables
    in-person network attendees to get their work done. It also enables remote participants
    to have a good experience as well, via remote participation in working group meetings.
    This document makes suggestions about how to reduce complexity, reduce cost, and
    increase reliability of the IETF meeting network, which may be helpful in community
    discussion.</p>"
