abstract:
- content: "<p>The REGISTER function is used in a SIP system primarily to associate
    a temporary contact address with an address-of-record. This contact is generally
    in the form of a URI, such as Contact: &lt;sip:alice@pc33.atlanta.com&gt; and
    is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or hostname of the SIP
    UA. The problem is that network topology may have one or more SIP proxies between
    the UA and the registrar, such that any request travelling from the user's home
    network to the registered UA must traverse these proxies. The REGISTER method
    does not give us a mechanism to discover and record this sequence of proxies in
    the registrar for future use. This document defines an extension header field,
    'Path' which provides such a mechanism</p>"
