abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for facilitating
    dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes multiple virtual networks
    and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation one to a backup one during
    a scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as network disaster. Specifically,
    the necessity of interfaces between domain management systems to establish consistent
    end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple domain networks is addressed.</p>"
