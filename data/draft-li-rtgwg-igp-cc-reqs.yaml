abstract:
- content: "<p>Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP) such as IS-IS or OSPF is a fundamental
    building block for traditional routing system which is based on distributed computation
    model. Routing in networks based on centralized computation model such as Software
    Defined Network(SDN) may require special IGP extension to facilitate its operation
    in multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks. This document introduces
    an architecture of deploying IGP for central-controlled network, but it does not
    aim to provide a detailed description of all the architectural components. It
    also specifies a set of functional requirements which can be fulfilled by IGP
    with proper extension for the central-controlled network.</p>"
