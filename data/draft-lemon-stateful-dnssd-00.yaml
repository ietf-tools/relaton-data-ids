abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a stateful model for automating Multi-Link DNS
    Service Discovery, as an extension to the existing solution, which relies entirely
    on multicast DNS for discovering services, and does not formally maintain DNS
    zone state. When fully deployed this will confer several advantages: the ability
    to do DNS zone transfers, integrating with existing DNS infrastructure; the elimination
    of the need for regular multicast queries; and the ability for services to securely
    register and defend their names, preventing malicious spoofing of services on
    the network.</p>"
