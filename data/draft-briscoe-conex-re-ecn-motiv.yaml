abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for using a new protocol called
    re-ECN (re-inserted explicit congestion notification), which can be deployed incrementally
    around unmodified routers. Re-ECN allows accurate congestion monitoring throughout
    the network thus enabling the upstream party at any trust boundary in the internetwork
    to be held responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow to be caused. So,
    networks can introduce straightforward accountability for congestion and policing
    mechanisms for incoming traffic from end- customers or from neighbouring network
    domains. As well as giving the motivation for re-ECN this document also gives
    examples of mechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respond
    correctly to congestion. And it describes example mechanisms that ensure the dominant
    selfish strategy of both network domains and end- points will be to use the protocol
    honestly. Note concerning Intended Status: If this draft were ever published as
    an RFC it would probably have historic status. There is limited space in the IP
    header, so re-ECN had to compromise by requiring the receiver to be ECN-enabled
    otherwise the sender could not use re-ECN. Re-ECN was a precursor to chartering
    of the IETF's Congestion Exposure (ConEx) working group, but during chartering
    there were still too few ECN receivers enabled, therefore it was decided to pursue
    other compromises in order to fit a similar capability into the IP header.</p>"
