abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing is one of the core features in 5G. End-to-end network
    slice consists of 3 major types of network segments: Access Network (AN), Mobile
    Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN). This draft describes the procedure
    of mapping 5G end-to-end network slice to transport network slice defined in IETF.
    This draft also intends to expose some gaps in the existing network management
    plane and data plane technologies to support inter-domain network slice mapping.
    Further work may require collaboration between IETF and 3GPP (or other standard
    organizations). Data model specification, signaling protocol extension and new
    encapsulation definition are out of the scope of this draft.</p>"
