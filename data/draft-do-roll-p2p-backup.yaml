abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, a backup path setup mechanism is proposed for the P2P-RPL
    protocol in Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). This mechanism allows sensor
    nodes to send packets over the backup path without rediscovering the p2p path
    in case of path failure, thus improving the reliability of p2p transmission.</p>"
