abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Regional Paging (HMIPv6RP),
    a small and link-layer independent extension to the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 with
    regional registrations, to support power-constrained operation in the mobile nodes
    and to reduce routing state information in the visited domain. The extension allows
    a mobile node to enter a power saving idle mode during which its location is known
    with the coarse accuracy defined by a paging area. In the visited domain only
    the paging mobility anchor point (PMAP) is responsible for keeping the binding
    cache entries for idle mobile nodes and, it re-establishes the downlink routes
    on demand by means of paging. This does not require snooping of data packets but
    is a natural extension to network-level routing. Optionally, the mobile node and
    the visited domain can agree on time slot based paging used for Paging Agent Advertisements
    to restrict link interface power-on time in the mobile node.</p>"
