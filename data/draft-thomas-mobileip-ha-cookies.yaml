abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a means of performing authentication and authorization
    of Mobile IP V6 binding updates. It takes advantage of the pre-existing security
    relationship between the mobile node and its home agent to allow a correspondent
    node to decide wether or not it should believe a binding update, and to perform
    key distribution for authorizing future binding updates.</p>"
