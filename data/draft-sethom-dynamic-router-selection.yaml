- content: "<p>In a network topology where the host has multiple routers on its Default
    Router List, it is important to select the most suitable one according to nodeâ€™s
    application requirements. This document describes an extension to router advertisement
    message [RFC 1256, RFC 2461] for dynamic router selection. This new functionality
    is implemented in routers with additional capabilities.</p>"
