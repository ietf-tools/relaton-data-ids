abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to mobile node as the
    mobile node changes its point of attachment to the Internet. However, it is also
    required to provide proper QoS forwarding treatment to mobile node's packet stream
    at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive IP services can
    be supported over Mobile IP. This document describes requirements for an IP QoS
    mechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.</p>"
