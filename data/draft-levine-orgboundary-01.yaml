abstract:
- content: "<p>Often, the organization that manages a subtree in the DNS is is different
    from the one that manages the tree above it. Rather than describing a particular
    design, we describe an architecture to publish in the DNS the boundaries between
    organizations that can be adapted to various policy models.</p>"
