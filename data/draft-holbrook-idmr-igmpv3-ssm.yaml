abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) and the Multicast
    Listener Discovery Protocol Version 2 (MLDv2) are protocols that allow a host
    to inform its neighboring routers of its desire to receive IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
    transmissions, respectively. Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast
    in which a receiver is required to specify both the network-layer address of the
    source and the multicast destination address in order to receive the multicast
    transmission. This document defines the notion of an "SSM-aware" router and host,
    and clarifies and (in some cases) modifies the behavior of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 on
    SSM-aware routers and hosts to accommodate source-specific multicast. This document
    updates the IGMPv3 and MLDv2 specifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
