abstract:
- content: "<p>Considering computing and networking is quite different in terms of
    resource granularity as well as their status stability, a hierarchical segment
    routing is proposed and introduced as an end-to- end CATS process. However, it
    brings about potential problems as illustrated in [I-D.yuan-cats-end-to-end-problem-requirement].
    In order to solve the mentioned problems and to improve and perfect a hierarchical
    solution, corresponding aggregation methods are discussed and hierarchical entries
    are proposed in this draft.</p>"
