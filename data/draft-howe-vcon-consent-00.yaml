abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a consent attachment type for Voice Conversations
    (vCon), establishing standardized mechanisms for recording, verifying, and managing
    consent information within conversation containers as defined in the vCon core
    specification. The consent attachment addresses privacy compliance challenges
    through structured metadata including consenting parties, temporal validity periods,
    and cryptographic proof mechanisms. The specification defines the mandatory and
    optional fields for consent attachments, including expiration timestamps, party
    references, dialog segments, and consent arrays. It supports granular consent
    management through purpose-based permissions and integrates with the AI Preferences
    vocabulary for automated processing systems. The attachment type incorporates
    SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) for cryptographic transparency
    and provides integration patterns for consent ledger services. Key features include
    automated consent detection during conversation processing, auditable consent
    records with cryptographic proofs, support for consent revocation through superseding
    statements, and integration with existing privacy regulations. The consent attachment
    enables organizations to maintain compliance while providing sufficient structure
    for automated processing and verification of consent throughout the vCon lifecycle.</p>"
