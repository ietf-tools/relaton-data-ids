abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs) use common pieces of resource along their paths. This can help save network
    resources and is useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or when two LSPs do
    not need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is responsible
    for path computation with such requirement. Existing extensions to the Path Computation
    Element Protocol (PCEP) allow one path computation request for an LSP to be associated
    with other (existing) LSPs through the use of the PCEP Association Object. This
    document extends PCEP in order to support resource-sharing- based path computation
    as another use of the Association Object to enable better efficiency in the computation
    and in the resultant paths and network resource usage.</p>"
