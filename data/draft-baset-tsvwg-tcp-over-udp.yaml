abstract:
- content: "<p>We present TCP-over-UDP (ToU), an instance of TCP on top of UDP. It
    provides exactly the same congestion control, flow control, reliability, and extension
    mechanisms as offered by TCP. It is intended for use in scenarios where applications
    running on two hosts may not be able to establish a direct TCP connection but
    are able to exchange UDP packets.</p>"
