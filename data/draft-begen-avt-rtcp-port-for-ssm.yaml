abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) has an attribute that allows
    RTP applications to specify an address and a port associated with the RTP Control
    Protocol (RTCP) traffic. In RTP-based source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions,
    the same attribute is used to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback
    Target in the SDP description. However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM
    session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid ambiguity, and
    thus, is required to be derived from the "m=" line of the media description. Similarly,
    in any-source multicast (ASM) sessions, there is no explicit way to specify the
    destination RTCP port. Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line imposes an unnecessary
    restriction. This document removes this restriction by introducing a new SDP attribute.</p>
