abstract:
- content: "<p>In order for SIP applications to work, they will frequently need to
    collect user input and provide feedback to users. Traditionally, user input has
    been done in the PSTN through DTMF. Much work has occurred on extending these
    DTMF models into the domain of SIP, typically by transporting DTMF digits or user
    input through some SIP message to an application server. We propose a broader
    framework for stimulus using markup. The approach can support traditional DTMF
    user input, but also a rich variety of devices, user interfaces and stimulus that
    goes well beyond DTMF.</p>"
