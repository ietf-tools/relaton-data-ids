abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a multicast solution which provides adaptive
    stateless traffic engineering along an explicit P2MP path/tree. Each portion of
    the tree is encoded by a most efficient encoding method. A tree portion includes
    all or some of the links/branches/subtrees from any number of nodes on the tree.
    An IPv6 extension header is used to encapsulate a packet which is to be multicast
    at the ingress. The overhead of the encapsulated packet is minimal. The packet
    is delivered to the egresses along the tree. There is no state stored in the core
    of the network.</p>"
