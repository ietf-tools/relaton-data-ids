abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS queries over HTTPS (DoH) hides DNS query information by (HTTPS)
    encryption. However, DoH providers know both query source IP addresses and DNS
    queries, and it is a privacy issue of DoH. It is possible to hide query source
    IP addresses from DoH providers by existing protocol (HTTP) and implementations
    (HTTP proxy software). This document proposes the use of DoH via HTTP proxy services.</p>"
