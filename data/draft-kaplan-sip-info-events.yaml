- content: "<p>This document defines the INFO method and a mechanism for defining,
    negotiating and exchanging Info Packages in it. INFO requests are used within
    SIP INVITE-created dialogs, for applications which need to exchange session-related
    information inside the INVITE-created dialog. This draft addresses issues and
    open items from RFC 2976, and replaces it.</p>"
