abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term
    that refers to a toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for performance
    measurement. Over the years various OAM tools have been defined for various layers
    in the protocol stack. This document summarizes some of the OAM tools defined
    in the IETF in the context of IP unicast, MPLS, MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP),
    pseudowires, and TRILL. This document focuses on tools for detecting and isolating
    failures in networks and for performance monitoring. Control and management aspects
    of OAM are outside the scope of this document. Network repair functions such as
    Fast Reroute (FRR) and protection switching, which are often triggered by OAM
    protocols, are also out of the scope of this document. The target audience of
    this document includes network equipment vendors, network operators and standards
    development organizations, and can be used as an index to some of the main OAM
    tools defined in the IETF. This document provides a brief description of each
    of the OAM tools in the IETF. At the end of the document a list of the OAM toolsets
    and a list of the OAM functions are presented as a summary.</p>"
