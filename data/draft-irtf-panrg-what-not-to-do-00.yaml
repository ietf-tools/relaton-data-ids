abstract:
- content: "<p>At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research Group, Oliver
    Bonaventure led a discussion of mostly-unsuccessful attempts to exploit Path Awareness
    to achieve a variety of goals, for a variety of reasons, over the past decade.
    At the end of that discussion, the research group agreed to catalog and analyze
    these ideas, in order to extract insights and lessons for path-aware networking
    researchers. This document contains that catalog and analysis.</p>"
