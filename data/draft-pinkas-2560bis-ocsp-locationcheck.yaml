abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2560 [RFC2560] allows CAs to designate one or more OCSP Responders
    for being responsible to provide the revocation status of the certificates they
    issue under a given CA key. This document introduces a new feature that allows
    allows CAs to split the workload between different sets of OCSP Responders in
    a way that is analogous to the way CRLs can be split between different sets of
    CRL issuers (using the cRLDistributionPoints extension). This new feature allows
    a CA to designate one or more OCSP Responders for being responsible to provide
    the revocation status for a subset of the certificates they issue under a given
    CA key. This document defines a critical extension that may only be placed in
    an OCSP certificate and the way it shall be processed by OCSP clients.</p>"
