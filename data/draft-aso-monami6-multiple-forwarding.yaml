abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers a mobile terminal with multiple interfaces
    which uses Mobile IPv6[1]. With multiple interfaces, the mobile terminal may use
    them simultaneously for communication with a peer device. Hence enabling the mobile
    terminal to achieve fault tolerance, load balancing and so on. This document deals
    with the mobile terminal with multiple interfaces, so it is possible that each
    kind/type of interface may have its own characteristics or differences. In particular,
    we take a closer look at the path between mobile terminal and its home agent.
    In the case when the mobile terminal has multiple interfaces, there exists several
    paths to the home agent. A general approach would be to first take a look at effective
    use of the multiple interfaces from a pure Mobile IPv6 perspective. As a matter
    of course, RFC3775 is used as the basic reference with which we consider the multiple
    interfaced mobile terminal operating in a Mobile IPv6 environment.</p>"
