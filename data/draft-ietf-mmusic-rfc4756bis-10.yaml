abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the semantics for grouping the associated source
    and FEC-based (Forward Error Correction) repair flows in the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP). The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the
    SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888). These semantics allow the description of grouping
    relationships between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or
    repair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide support for additive
    repair flows. SSRC-level (Synchronization Source) grouping semantics are also
    defined in this document for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using
    SSRC multiplexing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
