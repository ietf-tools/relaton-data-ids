abstract:
- content: "<p>While traditional IP multicast schemes (RFC 1112) are scalable for
    very large multicast groups, they have scalability issues with a very large number
    of distinct multicast groups. This document describes Xcast (Explicit Multi-unicast),
    a new multicast scheme with complementary scaling properties: Xcast supports a
    very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast achieves this by explicitly
    encoding the list of destinations in the data packets, instead of using a multicast
    group address. This document discusses Xcast concepts and options in several areas;
    it does not provide a complete technical specification. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
