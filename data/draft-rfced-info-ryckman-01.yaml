abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a method for delivering alarm information over
    the Internet. All communication shall use an encryption algorithm for transmission
    of the data. An immediate response from the host will be used for verification
    of receipt of the message. This transmission method may be use as a backup transmission
    method to traditional dial-up or leased line methods, or as a primary transmission
    method with traditional methods becomming the backup. Due to the required security
    of the data being transmitted, the encryption algorithm used will only be released
    on a need to know basis to software developers in the Alarm/Security Industry.
    A non-disclosure agreement will be required. Terms and conditions of the licensing
    will depend on the intended purpose for use and may require a non-competition
    agreement or licensing fees. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has
    assigned port 1733 for the registered use of SIIPAT transmissions.</p>"
