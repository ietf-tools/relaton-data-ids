abstract:
- content: <p>Internet Service Providers (operators) are facing problems where localized
    congestion prevents full utilization of the path between sender and receiver at
    today's "broadband" speeds. Operators desire to control this congestion, which
    often appears to be caused by a small number of users consuming a large amount
    of bandwidth. Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle this
    congestion can be expensive and may not result in improvements for all users so
    network operators have sought other ways to manage congestion. The current mechanisms
    all suffer from difficulty measuring the congestion (as distinguished from the
    total traffic). The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestion
    along any path visible at the Internet Layer. This document describes example
    cases where this mechanism would be useful.</p>
