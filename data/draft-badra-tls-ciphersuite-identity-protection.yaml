abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of cipher suites to add client credential
    protection to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. By negotiating one
    of those ciphersuites, the TLS clients will be able to determine for themselves
    when, how, to what extent and for what purpose information about them is communicated
    to others. The ciphersuites defined in this document can be used only when public
    key certificates are used in the client authentication process.</p>"
