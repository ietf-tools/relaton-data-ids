abstract:
- content: "<p>A transparent and authentic Transparent Registry service in support
    of a supply chain's integrity, transparency, and trust requires all peers that
    contribute to the Registry operations to be trustworthy and authentic. In this
    document, a countersigning variant is specified that enables trust assertions
    on Merkle-tree based operations for global supply chain registries. A generic
    procedure for producing payloads to be signed and validated is defined and leverages
    solutions and principles from the Concise Signing and Encryption (COSE) space.</p>"
