abstract:
- content: "<p>The IDNA is a key issue for the IUCG as a paradigm for the future of
    the Internet. There is therefore a need to make sure its description document
    set reflects a complete IETF and users consensus. To help this, this memo keeps
    track of the WG-IDNABIS/LC requested and received answers. The IAB Draft on IDN
    has been added because some remarks have been made which are important. The author
    is quoted if the comment is not from IUCG</p>"
