abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is specifying Diameter extensions to support mobility service
    authorization and home network prefix allocation for Proxy Mobile IPv6. The protocol
    operates between a Local Mobility Anchor and a AAA server. Furthermore, the associated
    specification extends the existing protocol for network access service to support
    dynamic assignment and discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor during the authentication
    procedure. The AAA server maintains mobile nodes' profile in a policy store, which
    includes information about the assigned Local Mobility Anchor as well as the home
    network prefix. This document proposes a further extension to allow Local Mobility
    Anchors benefit from the AAA server's policy store and resolve an unknown mobile
    node's IP address into a routable address of its assigned Local Mobility Anchor.</p>"
