abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard profile for Bogon Origin Attestations
    (BOAs). A BOA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying
    that an IP address block holder has not authorised any Autonomous System (AS)
    to originate routes that are equivalent to any of the addresses listed in the
    BOA. A BOA also provides a means of verifying that a BGP speaker is not using
    an AS without appropriate authority. The proposed application of BOAs is intended
    to fit within the requirements for adding security measures to inter-domain routing,
    including the ability to support incremental and piecemeal deployment of such
    measures, and does not require any changes to the specification of the Border
    Gateway Protocol.</p>"
