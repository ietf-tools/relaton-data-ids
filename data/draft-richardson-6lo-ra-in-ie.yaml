abstract:
- content: "<p>In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal],
    opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels.
    An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically by every router to keep all
    nodes in sync. This document provides a mechanism by which other small ICMPv6
    packets, such as Router Advertisements may be carried within the Enhanced Beacon,
    providing standard IPv6 router/host protocol.</p>"
