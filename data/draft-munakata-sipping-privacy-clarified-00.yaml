abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an informational RFC to clarify the use of privacy
    mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that is specified in RFC 3323
    and extended in subsequent RFCs, such as RFC 3325. It is intended to clarify the
    semantics of each privacy header value (priv-value) and the handling of the relevant
    target SIP headers for each of the priv-value. It also provides some guidelines
    on providing privacy considerations for future specifications that define SIP
    headers which may be influenced by the privacy mechanism.</p>"
