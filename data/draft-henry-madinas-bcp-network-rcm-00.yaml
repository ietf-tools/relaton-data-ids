abstract:
- content: "<p>End devices are implementing Randomized and Changing MAC addresses
    (RCM), with the advertised goal of improving the user privacy, by making the continued
    association between a MAC address and a personal device more difficult. RCM may
    be disruptive to some network services. This document is a collection of best
    practices for the general implementation of network services within an RCM context.</p>"
