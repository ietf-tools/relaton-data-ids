abstract:
- content: "<p>Reverse tunneling in RFC3024 [RevTun] introduces new packet loss scenarios
    at the HA and also incurs similar packet routing issues as RFC3220 [MIPv4] between
    Foreign Agents, during a handoff. Whether a Co- located Care-of-Address or a Foreign
    Agent Care-of-Address is used during Mobile IP registration, any packets from
    the new Foreign that are received at the Home Agent before the visitor list has
    been updated will be dropped. In addition, any in-flight packets from the old
    Foreign agent will be dropped once the visitor list has been updated.</p>"
