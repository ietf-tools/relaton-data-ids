abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two SDP attributes: 'groupe' and 'mid'. They
    allow to group together several 'm' lines for two different purposes: for lip
    synchronization and for receiving media from a single flow (several media streams),
    encoded in different formats during a particular session, in different ports and
    host interfaces.</p>"
