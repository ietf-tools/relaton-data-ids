abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document defines a general multicast YANG service
    model. This document intent to provide a general and all-round multicast service
    model, and guides the deployment of multicast technology. This model includes
    many of the existed multicast technology. But this document does not define any
    specifically and detailed YANG model of multicast protocol. The multicast model
    can be used with YANG models of specifically multicast technologies, such as PIM,
    MLD, and BIER and so on. This document proposes a general and all-round multicast
    service YANG model, which provides explanations and guidelines for the deployment
    of multicast service in all kinds of multicast scenarios. The multicast technologies
    include BIER multicast, PIM multicast, MPLS multicast and so on. And also, there
    defines several possible RPCs about how to interact between multicast service
    model and multicast device model.</p>"
