abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the application of a set of protocols for configuring
    a SIP user agent. The SIP user agent must discover how and from where to retrieve
    its initial configuration and be notified of changes and updates which impact
    its configuration. The objective is to define a means for automatically configuring
    a user agent such that it can be functional without user or administrative intervention.
    The framework for discovery, delivery, notification and updates of user agent
    configuration is defined here. This framework is also intended to ease ongoing
    administration, configuration and upgrading of large scale deployments of SIP
    user agents. The contents and format of the configuration data to be defined is
    outside the scope of this document.</p>"
