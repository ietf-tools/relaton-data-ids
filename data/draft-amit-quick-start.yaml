abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport
    protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed sending rate at
    the start and at times in the middle of a data transfer. While Quick-Start is
    designed to be used by a range of transport protocols, in this document we describe
    its use with TCP. By using Quick-Start, a TCP host, say, host A, would indicate
    its desired sending rate in bytes per second, using a Quick Start Request option
    in the IP header of a TCP packet. A Quick-Start request for a higher sending rate
    would be sent in a TCP packet. Each router along the path could, in turn, either
    approve the requested rate, reduce the requested rate, or indicate that the Quick-Start
    request is not approved. If the Quick-Start request is not approved, then the
    sender would use the default congestion control mechanisms. The Quick-Start mechanism
    can determine if there are routers along the path that do not understand the Quick-
    Start Request option, or have not agreed to the Quick-Start rate request. TCP
    host B communicates the final rate request to TCP host A in a transport-level
    Quick-Start Response in an answering TCP packet. Quick-Start is designed to allow
    connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused bandwidth
    along the path, and all of the routers along the path support the Quick-Start
    Request.</p>"
