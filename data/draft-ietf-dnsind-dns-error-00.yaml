abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS protocol defines a 4-bit RCODE field in the header of the DNS
    envelope. This field is used to indicate the completion status of requests. Defined
    values exist to describe successful completion as well as a variety of error conditions
    that could result from DNS server operations. As DNS has been expanded to perform
    additional functions, the number of possible error conditions has increased significantly,
    and the field no longer has space for new error codes to be added. To address
    this problem, a new RR type is defined. The Error Record contains a machine-readable
    extended error value, as well as an optional human-readable ASCII text string.
    Additionally, it contains a domain-name source field to identify the entity generating
    the error condition. This RR may also be used in non- error conditions to provide
    extended information about server responses, such as security information on specific
    records in the response.</p>"
