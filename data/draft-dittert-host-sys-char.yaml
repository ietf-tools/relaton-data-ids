abstract:
- content: "<p>The interoperability of configuration services based on the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [1] in an environment of heterogeneous clients
    depends on clients accurately identifying themselves and their relevant characteristics
    to configuration servers. The class identifier provided through DHCP option 60
    [2] helps in this regard, but such identifiers essentially only enable clients
    and servers that are 'good friends' to find each other. This draft proposes the
    definition of three options that convey particular, generally useful information
    about the client system. This enables all servers to recognize this information,
    and is a step toward a richer form of interoperability for configuration services.
    The options in question are Option 93 - Client System Architecture Option 94 -
    Client Network Device Interface Option 97 - UUID/GUID-based Client Identifier
    Subsequent to IANA issuing the above DHCP option numbers, the DHCP Working Group
    has determined that use of these options is not appropriate. As a result, it was
    agreed in the August 1998 IETF DHCP WG meeting that use of Options 93, 94, and
    97 as described in this draft would be allowed until August of 2004 (six years),
    after which time the option numbers would be made available for new options. In
    the interim, it is expected that systems using Options 93, 94, and 97 will be
    redefined to use Options 60 and 61. It is allowable that systems may use both
    methods during the 6 year interim period as a means of migrating to exclusive
    use of Options 60 and 61 for this functionality by the end of the interim period.
    The DHCP Working Group has agreed that this draft will be published as an Informational
    RFC to document the expected term of use for Options 93, 94, and 97 as defined
    in this ID.</p>"
