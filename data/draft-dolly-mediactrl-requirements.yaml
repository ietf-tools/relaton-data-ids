abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the communication between an application server
    and media server. The current work in SIPPING and XCON working groups show these
    logical entities but do not address the physical decomposition and the protocol
    between the entities. This document presents the requirements from a media server
    control protocol (MCP) that enables an application server to use a media server.
    It will address the aspects of announcements, IVR and conferencing media services.</p>"
