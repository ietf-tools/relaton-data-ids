abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands
    on a communication network. SUPA considers two types of network services, the
    inter Data Center (DC) communication and Virtual Private Networks (VPN). This
    document describes the SUPA basic architecture, its elements and interfaces. The
    main SUPA architecture entities are the Network Service Agent (NSA) and the Application-based
    Policy Decision (ABPD). NSA is a functional entity that creates and runs network
    services/ ABPD is a functional entity, which 1) enables the generation, maintenance
    and release of i) actual/detailed network topologies and ii) VPN and inter DC
    service specific abstractions and 2) mapping between the VPN and inter DC service
    service specific abstractions and the network topology and configuration.</p>"
