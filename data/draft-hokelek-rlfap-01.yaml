abstract:
  content: "<p>This draft describes a new loop-free IP fast reroute mechanism which
    enhances the IP Fast-ReRoute (IPFRR) [1,15] by introducing the concept of pre-computed
    remote Loop-Free Alternate Paths (rLFAPs) on top of the IPFRR local LFAP. In rLFAP,
    a router which is adjacent to the failed resource switches over to pre-computed
    LFAPs, if they exist, immediately after failure detection. Multi-hop neighbors
    (MNBs) are notified about this remote failure as quickly as possible using fast
    failure notification mechanism. Upon receipt of failure information, MNBs activate
    their pre-computed remote LFAPs that they maintain for protecting against remote
    failures within their multi-hop neighborhoods. In the worst case, where IPFRR
    results in forming micro-loops, rLFAP completely prevents micro-loops for single
    link failures and quickly converges to a loop-free path in case of multiple link
    failures.</p>"
