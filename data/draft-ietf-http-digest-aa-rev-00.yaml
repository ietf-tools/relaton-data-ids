abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol referred to as 'HTTP/1.0' includes the specification for
    a Basic Access Authentication scheme. This scheme is not considered to be a secure
    method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the
    network as clear text. A specification for a different authentication scheme is
    needed to address this severe limitation. This document provides specification
    for such a scheme, referred to as 'Digest Access Authentication'. Like Basic,
    Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a communication know
    a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this verification can be done without
    sending the password in the clear, which is Basic's biggest weakness. As with
    most other authentication protocols, the greatest sources of risks are usually
    found not in the core protocol itself but in policies and procedures surrounding
    its use. This is the final draft of any document under this name. Digest and Basic
    Authentication from the HTTP/1.1 specification will be combined and issued as
    a document titled 'Authentication in HTTP'.Our intent is that RFC 2068 and RFC
    2069 will go to draft standard as a pair of documents, but with all authentication
    schemes (Digest and Basic) documented together in a single place. This transition
    has not yet taken place.</p>"
