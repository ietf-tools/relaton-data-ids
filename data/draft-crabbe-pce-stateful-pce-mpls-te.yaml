- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
    describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful control. This document
    describes the objects and TLVs to be used with these PCEP extensions to control
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths
    (TE LSP) via a stateful PCE.</p>"
