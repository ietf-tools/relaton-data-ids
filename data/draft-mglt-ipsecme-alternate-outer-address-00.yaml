abstract:
- content: "<p>Current IKEv2 protocol has been designed to establish VPNs with the
    same outer IP addresses as those used for the IKEv2 channel. This describes the
    alternate outer IP address extension, and IKEv2 extension that enables the VPN
    End User to negotiate a VPN on different interfaces as those used for the IKEv2
    channel. Thus, this extension makes possible a VPN End User with multiple interfaces
    to set an IPsec tunnel on each interface with a Security Gateway by using a single
    IKEv2 channel instead of using an IKEv2 channel per interface. Similarly, for
    distributed Security Gateways, it also makes possible to split the IKEv2 and IPsec
    traffic on different interfaces.</p>"
