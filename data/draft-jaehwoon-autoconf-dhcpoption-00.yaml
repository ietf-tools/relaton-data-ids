abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a wireless network composed of
    mobile nodes which can communicate with each other via multiple wireless links.
    The modified MANET architecture is now standardizing that can resolve the multi-link
    subnet issue. In this draft, we define two DHCP options in order that a MANET
    Router (MR) gets the network prefix assigned to the connected MANET. The one is
    the MANET prefix request option used by a MR when it wants to know the network
    presix allocated to the MANET. The other is the MANET prefix option that DHCP
    server provides the MANET prefix to the requesting MR.</p>"
