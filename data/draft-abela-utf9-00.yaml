abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10646 defines a multi-octet character set called the Universal
    Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems. Multi-octet
    characters, however, are not compatible with many current applications and protocols,
    and this has led to the development of a few so-called UCS transformation formats
    (UTF), each with different characteristics. UTF-9, the object of this memo, has
    the characteristic of preserving the full ISO-Latin1 range, providing compatibility
    with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on ISO-Latin1 values.
    ISO-Latin1 is almost as widespread as ASCII in many countries, especially in most
    of western Europe, and is the default character set for HTML. A compatible encoding
    seems desirable, where possible.</p>"
