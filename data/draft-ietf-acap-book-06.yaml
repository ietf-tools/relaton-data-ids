abstract:
- content: "<p>Storing URLs [URL] for later access has become common in Internet applications
    (for example, web browsers, FTP clients); these saved URLs have become known as
    bookmarks. It would be desirable to access one's bookmarks from multiple clients
    and multiple machines. The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides
    an ideal mechanism for storage of bookmarks, providing for ease of coordination
    and synchronization of bookmarks between diverse applications and systems, as
    well as for hierarchy, inheritance, and sharing between users. This specification
    defines a standard ACAP dataset class for bookmarks.</p>"
