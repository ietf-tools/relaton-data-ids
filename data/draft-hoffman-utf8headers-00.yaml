abstract:
- content: "<p>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these
    users throughout the world have names that are not normally represented by the
    users with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would therefore like to
    use their real names in their mailbox names. These users are also likely to use
    non-ASCII text in their common names and subjects of email messages, both in what
    they send and what they receive. This protocol specifies how to represent all
    headers of email messages encoded in UTF-8.</p>"
