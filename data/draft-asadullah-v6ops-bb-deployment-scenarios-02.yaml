abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides detailed description of IPv6 deployment and
    integration methods and scenarios in today's Service Provider (SP) Broadband (BB)
    networks in coexistance with deployed IPv4 services. Cable/HFC, BB Ethernet, xDSL
    and WLAN are the main BB technologies that are currently deployed, and discussed
    in this document. In this document we will discuss main components of IPv6 BB
    networks and their differences from IPv4 BB networks and how IPv6 is deployed
    and integrated in each of these BB technologies using tunneling mechanisms and
    native IPv6.</p>"
