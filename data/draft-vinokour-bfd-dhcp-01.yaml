abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for configuring Bidirectional Forwarding
    Detection (BFD) by an IP Edge device using DHCPv4 or DHCPv6. It provides motivation
    for the new functionality, defines new DHCP options to assist with the task and
    outlines the rules for configuring BFD on an IP endpoint for different network
    topologies. The document also discusses endpoint behavior upon BFD failure. Comments
    on this draft should be directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org.</p>"
