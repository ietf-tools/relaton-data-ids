abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) includes a suite of
    security services that has been expanded by numerous specifications over the years,
    there is no single place that explains how to use SIP to establish confidential
    media sessions. Additionally, existing mechanisms have some feature gaps that
    need to be identified and resolved in order for them to address the pervasive
    monitoring threat model. This specification describes best practices for negotiating
    confidential media with SIP, including both comprehensive protection solutions
    which bind the media to SIP-layer identities as well as opportunistic security
    solutions.</p>"
