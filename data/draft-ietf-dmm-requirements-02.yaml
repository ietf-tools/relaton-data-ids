abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management
    (DMM) in IPv6 deployments. The traditionally hierarchical structure of cellular
    networks has led to deployment models which are in practice centralized. Mobility
    management with logically centralized mobility anchoring in current mobile networks
    is prone to suboptimal routing and raises scalability issues. Such centralized
    functions can lead to single points of failure and inevitably introduce longer
    delays and higher signaling loads for network operations related to mobility management.
    The objective is to enhance mobility management in order to meet the primary goals
    in network evolution, i.e., improve scalability, avoid single points of failure,
    enable transparent mobility support to upper layers only when needed, and so on.
    Distributed mobility management must be secure and compatible with existing network
    deployments and end hosts.</p>"
