abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a strategy by which Provider Equipment (PE)
    can be dynamically provisioned for inclusion in PE-based Layer 2 Virtual Private
    Networks (L2VPNs). This layered strategy utilizes the Remote Authentication Dial
    In User Service (RADIUS) protocol as a centralized control mechanism and can be
    used in conjunction with other proposed mechanisms. The mechanisms described in
    this document enhance those established by RFC 2868 and conform to those described
    by the L2VPN Framework.</p>"
