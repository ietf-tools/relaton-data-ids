abstract:
- content: "<p>The CDNI Metadata Interface enables interconnected CDNs to exchange
    content distribution metadata for the purpose of content acquisition and delivery.
    The CDNI metadata associated with a piece of content provides a downstream CDN
    with the information necessary for the downstream CDN to service content requests
    on behalf of an upstream CDN in accordance with the delivery policies defined
    by the upstream CDN. This document describes the core set of CDNI metadata that
    all interconnected CDNs must support.</p>"
