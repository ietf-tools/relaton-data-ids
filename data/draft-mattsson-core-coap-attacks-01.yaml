abstract:
- content: "<p>Being able to securely read information from sensors, to securely control
    actuators, and to not enable distributed denial-of-service attacks are essential
    in a world of connected and networking things interacting with the physical world.
    This document summarizes a number of known attacks on CoAP and show that just
    using CoAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not enough for
    secure operation. The document also summarizes different denial-of-service attacks
    using CoAP. The goal with this document is motivating generic and protocol-specific
    recommendations on the usage of CoAP. Several of the discussed attacks can be
    mitigated with the solutions in draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag.</p>"
