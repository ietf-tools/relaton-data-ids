abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is submitted as input to the draft PINT (PSTN and Internet
    Internetworking) Informational RFC. This document describes an internetworking
    architecture of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the Internet
    based on the Lucent prototype. This architecture enables access to PSTN services
    from the Internet. The four basic PSTN services that could be made available to
    an Internet User are described. We have used the World Wide Web as an example
    to show how these PSTN services can be seamlessly integrated into the Internet.
    Next a Service Support Transport Protocol for reliable transfer of service request
    from the Internet to the PSTN network is described. A simple Management Information
    Base (MIB) that is used for uploading information and performing authentication
    checks is then described.</p>"
