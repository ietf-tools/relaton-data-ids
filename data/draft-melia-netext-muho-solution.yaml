abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 in order to
    support multihomed mobile nodes (MN). These extensions are intended to permit
    such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on multiple interfaces in a simultaneous
    and possibly discriminated manner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain. A typical
    usage of these extensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination through multiple
    interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN interface to VOIP traffic
    and another MN interface to HTTP traffic). The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt
    to increment in a backward compatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.
    In addition these extensions use, when possible, existing specifications related
    to multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement of Netext
    Working Group.</p>"
