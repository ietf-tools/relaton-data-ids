abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport
    layer Protocol specifies that servers and clients should support groups with a
    modulus length of k bits, where the recommended minumum value is 1024 bits. Recent
    security research has shown that a minimum value of 1024 bits is insufficient
    against state-sponsored actors. As such, this document formally updates the specification
    such that the minimum recommended value for k is 2048 bits and the group size
    is 2048 bits at minimum. This RFC updates RFC4419 which allowed for DH moduli
    less than 2048 bits.</p>"
