abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes IBM's support for running LU6.2 applications over
    a TCP/IP network. This support is provided using a subset of the X/Open architecture
    for Multiprotocol Transport Networking, which is a general protocol conversion
    architecture for running any application over any transport protocol. This draft
    is being distributed to members of the Internet community in order to solicit
    their reactions to the proposals contained in it. While the issues discussed may
    not be directly relevant to the research problems of the Internet, they may be
    interesting to a number of researchers and implementers. Any questions or comments
    relative to the contents of this draft should be sent to the following Internet
    address: carmich@us.ibm.com.</p>"
