abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a socket API for the multihoming shim layer.
    The API aims to enable interactions between the applications and the multihoming
    shim layer for advanced locator management and also for accessing to information
    about failure detection and path exploration. This document is based on an assumption
    that a multhomed host is equipped with a 'shim' layer which essentially maintains
    mappings between identifiers and locators at the IP layer. SHIM6 and HIP are examples
    of this shim layer. Hence, the API can be commonly used by SHIM6 and HIP.</p>"
