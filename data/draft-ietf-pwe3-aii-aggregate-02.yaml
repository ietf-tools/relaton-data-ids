abstract:
- content: "<p>The signaling protocols used to establish point-to-point pseudowires
    include type-length-value (TLV) fields that identify pseudowire endpoints called
    attachment individual identifiers (AIIs). This document defines AII structures
    in the form of new AII TLV fields that support AII aggregation for improved scalability
    and Virtual Private Network (VPN) auto-discovery. It is envisioned that this would
    be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where pseudowires
    are established between selected local and remote provider edge (PE) nodes based
    on customer need. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
