abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Lower than Best-Effort (LBE) per-hop behavior
    (PHB) for use within and between Differentiated Services domains [3]. The primary
    objective of this LBE PHB is to separate LBE traffic from best-effort traffic
    in congestion situations, i.e., when resources become scarce. Furthermore, LBE
    traffic gets a minimal share of bandwidth so that it will not be fully preempted
    by best-effort traffic. This is achieved by discarding LBE packets more aggressively
    than best-effort packets while trying to enqueue them in case of congestion. There
    are numerous uses for this PHB, e.g., for transmission of background traffic such
    as bulk data transfers of minor importance, backup data traffic during working
    hours or traffic caused by web search engines while gathering information from
    web servers. Thus, it constitutes the network equivalent to a background priority
    for processes in an operating system. Moreover, it is particularly useful in cases
    when packets of a better service are re-marked by a node for subsequently receiving
    a forwarding treatment that is equivalent to the best-effort service. In this
    situation the LBE PHB helps to protect other best-effort packets from experiencing
    unfair forwarding treatment because it avoids their preemption by re-marked packets.
    For instance, this case occurs when heterogeneous multicast groups should be supported.</p>"
