abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for CR-LDP signaling.
    Recently, several routing protocol extensions for advertising resource information
    in addition to topology information have been proposed for use in distributed
    constraint-based routing. In such a distributed routing environment, however,
    the information used to compute a constraint-based path may be out of date. This
    means that label requests may be blocked by links or nodes without sufficient
    resources. This draft specifies crankback routing extensions for CR-LDP so that
    the label request can be retried on an alternate path that detours around the
    blocked link or node upon a setup failure. Furthermore, the proposed crankback
    routing schemes can be also applied to end-to-end LSP restoration by indicating
    the location of the failure link or node. This would significantly improve the
    recovery ratio for failed LSPs, especially in situations where a large number
    of setup requests are triggered at the same time.</p>"
