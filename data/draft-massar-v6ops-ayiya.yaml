abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a tunneling protocol that can be encapsulated
    in any other protocol. Using authentication tokens multiple tunnels can be created
    from behind the same NAT. The tokens allow one to identify the sender of the packet
    thus making it possible to automatically switch over the endpoint. This protocol
    is intended as an alternative to the proto-41 protocol in use for tunneling IPv6
    over IPv4 packets over the internet. Due to the authentication this protocol is
    especially useful for dynamic non-24/7 endnodes which are located behind NATs
    and want to use for instance a IPv6 Tunnel Broker. The protocol can carry any
    payload and thus is not limited to only IPv6 over IPv4 but can also be used for
    IPv4 over IPv6 and many other combinations of protocols.</p>"
