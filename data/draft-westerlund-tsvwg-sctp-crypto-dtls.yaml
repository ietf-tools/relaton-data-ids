abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a usage of Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) 1.2 or 1.3 to protect the content of Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) packets using the framework provided by the SCTP CRYPTO chunk which we
    name DTLS in SCTP. DTLS in SCTP provides encryption, source authentication, integrity
    and replay protection for the SCTP association with mutual authentication of the
    peers. The specification is also targeting very long-lived sessions of weeks and
    months and supports mutual re-authentication and rekeying with ephemeral key exchange.
    This is intended as an alternative to using DTLS/SCTP (RFC 6083) and SCTP-AUTH
    (RFC 4895).</p>"
