- content: "<p>This draft is to facilitate the understanding of the data plane enhancement
    solutions, which are suggested currently or can be suggested in the future, for
    deterministic networking. This draft provides criteria for classifying data plane
    solutions. Examples of each category are listed, along with reasons where necessary.
    Strengths and limitations of the categories are described. Suitability of the
    solutions for various services of deterministic networking are also briefly mentioned.</p>"
