abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet users currently cannot participate in wide-area IP multicast
    sessions, because their first-hop routers (or beyond) do not support IP multicast
    routing. We describe an application level (UDP-based) tunneling mechanism that
    allows non-multicast-connected users - with no modification to their operating
    systems - to automatically receive a large class of multicast sessions, pending
    the deployment of multicast in their upstream routers.</p>"
