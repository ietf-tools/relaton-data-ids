abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPsec Architecture [RFC2401] and IPsec transform RFCs [RFC2402,
    RFC2406] define certain mechanisms for IP multicast traffic. The recent revisions
    to each of the protocol documents [ESPbis, AHbis] propose changes to those semantics.
    However, neither the existing nor proposed semantics are sufficiently general
    such that IPsec can be used to protect the wide variety of IPv4 and IPv6 multicast
    applications that are expected by the IP multicast community. In particular, they
    are not compatible with the needs of the protocols developed in the MSEC WG and
    for Source Specific Multicast [RFC3376, SSM-ARCH]. This document reviews these
    semantics and proposes some minor changes, which would enable IPsec to be suitable
    for these uses.</p>"
