abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new approach by leveraging Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI) architecture to verify the authenticity of the mapping
    origin of an IPv4 address block. MOA is a newly defined cryptographically signed
    object, it provides a means that the address holder can authorize an IPv6 mapping
    prefix to originate mapping for one or more IPv4 prefixes. When receiving the
    MOA objects from the relying partie, PE device can verify and discard invalid
    address mapping announcements from unauthorized IPv6 mapping prefixes to prevent
    IPv4 prefix hijacking.</p>"
