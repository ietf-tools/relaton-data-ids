abstract:
- content: "<p>In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue may
    occur when pseduonode nickname mechanism in [TRILLPN] is used. This draft is to
    solve RPF check failure issue through centralized replication for BUM traffic
    solution. The basic idea is that all ingress RBs send BUM traffic to a centralized
    node through unicast TRILL encapsulation, the centralized node decapsulates the
    unicast TRILL packet. Then the centralized node searches its multicast forwarding
    table to replicates a copy of the BUM traffic to destination RBs through TRILL
    unicast encapsulation. Through centralized replication solution, only unicast
    forwarding behavior is required between edge RB and centralized RB, so no RPF
    check function is required on any device in TRILL campus through centralized replication
    solution and no RPF check failure issue occurs.</p>"
