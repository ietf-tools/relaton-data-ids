abstract:
- content: "<p>The Address Resolution Protocol specifies the scheme to resolve the
    hardware address of a host by using its IP address. The hardware addresses are
    normally unique for each hardware module because they were assigned by manufacturers;
    but there is much less control on the uniqueness of IP addresses on a LAN. With
    the booming network popularity, the possibility of the same IP address being used
    on different hosts is increasing. The duplication may come from users' or network
    administrators' mistakes, or configuration errors on host addresses assigning
    programs such as BOOTP or DHCP servers. This document is to define an extension
    to the original ARP protocol to prevent a newly configured host from making much
    damage to a host that has been the owner of the same IP address. The solution
    is based on the de-facto gratuitous ARP packets with modification on a host's
    behavior when an address duplication is detected.</p>"
