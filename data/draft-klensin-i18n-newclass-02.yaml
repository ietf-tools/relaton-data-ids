abstract:
- content: "<p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for placing multilingual names
    (more properly, names normally written in non-ASCII character sets) into the DNS
    or addressing the need for multilingual access to the Internet in other ways.
    Most of them involve, to one extent or another, workarounds to the current system.
    This document proposes a 'go back and fix it' approach, replacing the 'IN' Class
    in the DNS with one that is not limited to ASCII from its initial definitions.
    Some of the deployment issues, politics, and other drawbacks are also briefly
    discussed.</p>"
