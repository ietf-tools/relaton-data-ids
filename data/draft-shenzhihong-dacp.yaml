abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Data Access and Collaboration Protocol
    (DACP), a communication protocol designed to support cross-node, cross-process
    data access in scientific and distributed computing environments. DACP provides
    standardized streaming-based data interactions over the Arrow Flight protocol
    and defines a unified Streaming DataFrame (SDF) model, which acts as a high-performance
    abstraction for accessing and processing both structured and unstructured data.</p>"
