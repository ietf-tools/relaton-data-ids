abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast forwarding in a network provides advantages in improving
    the network usage and performance. In some cases it helps improve the operations
    in managing network. The major challenge in multicast operations is in managing
    the per-flow states in the network as required by all the legacy multicast frameworks.
    This document specifies a bitmap forwarding extension to SRv6 to support state-free
    forwarding model in a network.</p>"
