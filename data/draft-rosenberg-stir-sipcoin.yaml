abstract:
- content: "<p>Robocalling has become an increasing problem in the Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN). While techniques like verified caller ID can help reduce
    its impact, ultimately robocalling will continue until economically it is no longer
    viable. This document proposes a new type of cryptocurrency, called SIPCoin, which
    is used to create a tax - in the form of computation - that must be paid before
    placing an inter-domain call on the SIP-based public telephone network. SIPCoin
    maintains complete anonymity of calls, is non-transferable between users avoiding
    its usage as an exchangeable currency, causes minimal increase call setup delays,
    and makes use of traditional certificate authority trust chains to validate proofs
    of work. SIPCoin is best used in concert with whitelist based techniques to minimize
    costs on known valid callers.</p>"
