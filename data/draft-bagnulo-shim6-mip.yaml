abstract:
- content: "<p>In this note, we explore the interaction between the SHIM protocol
    and MIPv6 protocol, identifying potential benefits and difficulties. The analysis
    will consider the two modes of operation of MIPv6: the Bidirectional Tunnel (BT)
    mode where the communication is routed through the Home Agent and the Route Optimization
    (RO) mode, where the communication flows directly between the Correspondent node
    and the mobile node.</p>"
