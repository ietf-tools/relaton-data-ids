abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication
    framework for email to permit verification of the source and contents of messages.
    This document specifies an adjunct mechanism to aid in assessing messages that
    do not contain a DKIM signature for the domain used in the author's address. It
    defines a record that can advertise whether they sign their outgoing mail, and
    how other hosts can access those records.</p>"
