abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism which enhances Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol signaling to support the creation of a transient binding cache entry
    which is used for inter-MAG handover optimization. This mechanism is applicable
    to the mobile node's inter-MAG handover while using a single interface or different
    interfaces. The handover problem space using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol
    is analyzed and the use of transient binding cache entries at a mobility anchor
    is described. The specified extension to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol ensures
    optimized forwarding of downlink as well as uplink packets between mobile nodes
    and the network infrastructure and avoids superfluous packet forwarding delay
    or even packet loss.</p>"
