abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has selected Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP
    Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS). IMS is part of Release 5 of the 3GPP
    specifications. Although SIP is a protocol that fulfills most of the requirements
    for establishing a session in an IP network, SIP has never been evaluated against
    the specific 3GPP requirements for operation in a cellular network. In this document,
    we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support SIP for Release 5 of
    the 3GPP IMS in cellular networks. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
