abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a base profile of S/MIME for use with the US
    Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory
    published by the United States Government which outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic
    algorithm policy for US national security applications. This profile applies to
    the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National
    Security Systems that employ S/MIME. It is also appropriate for all other US Government
    systems that process high-value information. This memo is not an IETF standard,
    and has not been shown to have IETF community consensus. This profile is made
    publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other
    system deployments.</p>"
