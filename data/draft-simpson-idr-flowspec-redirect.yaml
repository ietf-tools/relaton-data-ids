abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications but the
    primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic filtering
    actions for DDoS mitigation. The flow-spec standard [RFC 5575] defines a redirect-to-VRF
    action for policy-based forwarding but this mechanism can be difficult to use,
    particularly in networks without L3 VPNs. This draft proposes a new redirect-to-IP
    flow-spec action that provides a simpler method of policy-based forwarding. This
    action is indicated by the presence of a new BGP extended community in the flow-spec
    route. Many routers already support a redirect-to-IP filter action and, in this
    case, the only new functionality implied by this draft is the ability to signal
    the action using flow-spec.</p>"
