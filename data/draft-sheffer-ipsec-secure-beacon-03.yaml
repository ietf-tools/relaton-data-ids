abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote access clients, in particular IPsec-based ones, are heavily
    deployed in enterprise environments. In many enterprises the security policy allows
    remote-access clients to switch to unprotected operation when entering the trusted
    network. This document specifies a method that lets a client detect this situation
    in a secure manner, with the help of a security gateway. We propose a minor extension
    to IKEv2 to achieve this goal.</p>"
