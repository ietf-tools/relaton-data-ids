abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new, 'fast-track' handshake mechanism for TLS.
    A fast-track client caches a server's public parameters and negotiated parameters
    in the course of an initial, enabling handshake; these need not be resent on subsequent
    ones. The new mechanism reduces both network traffic and flows, and requires no
    additional server state.</p>"
