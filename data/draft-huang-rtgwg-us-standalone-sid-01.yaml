abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for establishing
    networking connections anywhere and anytime, alongside the availability of highly
    distributive any-cloud services. Such a demand motivates the need to efficiently
    interconnect heterogeneous entities, e.g., different domains of network and cloud
    owned by different providers to reduce cost, e.g., overheads and end-to-end latency,
    while ensuring the overall performance satisfies the requirements of the applications.
    Considering that different network domains and cloud providers may adopt different
    types of technologies, the key to interconnection and efficient coordination is
    to employ a unified interface that can be understood by heterogeneous parties,
    which could derive the consistent requirements of the same service and treat the
    service traffic appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies.
    This document provides use cases and problem statements from two main Internet
    traffic categories: one is the traditional north-south traffic which is defined
    from clients to entities (such as servers or DCs), and the other is east-west
    traffic, which refers to traffic between entities (such as inter-server or inter-
    service).Furthermore,the requirements for a standalone Service ID are also detailed
    in this document.</p>"
