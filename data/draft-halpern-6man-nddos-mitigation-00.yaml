abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been observed that with the large space of IPv6 addresses within
    a subnet, remote attackers can send packets that saturate a rotuers ND cache,
    and potentially saturate a subnet with ND Soliciation messages as well. Some operational
    techniques and small protocol adjustments have been proposed that can help alleviate
    this problem. This draft proposes a slightly more drastic optional behavior for
    routers, which can nearly eliminate this problem.</p>"
