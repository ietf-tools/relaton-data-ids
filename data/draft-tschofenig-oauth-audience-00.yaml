abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token specification allows any party in possession
    of a bearer token to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating
    possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent misuse, two important security
    assumptions must hold: bearer tokens must be protected from disclosure in storage
    and in transport and the access token must only be valid for use with a specific
    resource server (the audience) and with a specific scope. This document defines
    a new header that is used by the client to indicate what resource server, as the
    intended recipient, it wants to access. This information is subsequently also
    communicated by the authorization server securely to the resource server, for
    example within the audience field of the access token.</p>"
