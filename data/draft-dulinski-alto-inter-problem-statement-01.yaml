abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers an approach to the optimization of the traffic
    generated by the overlay (peer-to-peer) applications, where some information on
    inter-AS (Autonomous System) paths is obtained with the usage of dedicated communication
    scheme known as inter-ALTO communication. The large amount of network traffic
    generated by overlay applications requires effective management. This traffic
    traverses inter-AS links and thus generates substantial costs for the operators
    and poses problems with overload on the external and internal links. The traffic
    is not time-stable as the peers connect and disconnect very often. Additionally,
    when the overlay traffic is observed on inter-AS links, it can be seen that sources
    and destinations change in a very short period of time. The ALTO (Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization) service provides the information that enables more efficient
    management of the overlay traffic. Such applications can use the information to
    perform better-than-random peer selection. The ALTO servers are responsible for
    a pre-selection procedure; the final selection is done by overlay clients and
    then the ALTO protocol conveys network information to applications. To be credible,
    this information should be as close to real network situation as possible. However,
    some types of data are not hold by an operator, but they should be gained on the
    basis of the additional information exchange with other AS operators. This document
    presents rationale for the need of introduction of the inter-ALTO communication.</p>"
