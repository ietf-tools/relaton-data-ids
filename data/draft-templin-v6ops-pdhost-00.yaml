abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. The requesting
    router then acts as a router between the downstream- attached hosts and the upstream
    provider network. The router could also act as a host under the weak end system
    model, and otherwise behaves as a standard router. This document considers the
    case when the "requesting router" is actually a host, and receives a prefix that
    it can use for multi-addressing purposes. The host does not connect any downstream-attached
    networks, and uses the prefix solely for its own multi-addressing purposes.</p>
