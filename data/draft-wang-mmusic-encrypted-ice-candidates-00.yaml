abstract:
- content: <p>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of
    creating peer-to-peer connections. To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer
    connection, client private IP addresses can be included in this candidate collection,
    but this has privacy implications. This document describes a way to share local
    IP addresses with local peers without compromising client privacy. During the
    ICE process, local IP addresses are encrypted and authenticated using a pre-shared
    key and cipher suite before being put into ICE candidates as hostnames with an
    ".encrypted" pseudo-top- level domain. Other peers who also have the PSK are able
    to decrypt these addresses and use them normally in ICE processing.</p>
