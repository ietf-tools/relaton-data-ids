abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the minor changes in protocol processing rules
    for the PIM-SM [PIMSM] protocol to support source specific multicast (SSM) routing
    semantics over the SSM address range [EXPRESS][SSM]. Used in combination with
    IGMPv3 [IGMPV3], the SSM delivery model can be supported with current protocol
    implementations. IGMPv3 can be used for communicating source specific (S,G) channel
    memberships to local routers; PIM-SM can be used for construction of SSM forwarding
    trees. This document describes the processing rules for PIM-SM in the SSM address
    range to support construction of SSM delivery trees.</p>"
