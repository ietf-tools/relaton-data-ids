abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an architectural framework for transporting SS7 signaling
    information over Internet Protocol networks. It describes a Signaling Gateway
    which acts as a bridge between the SS7 and IP networks. The Signaling Gateway
    can be configured as an SS7 end-node or as a Signal Transfer Point (STP) deployed
    singly or in a mated pair configuration. An application program interface (API)
    allows multiple remote devices, such as Media Gateways and Media Gateway Controllers,
    to register with the Signaling Gateway using TCP or UDP. The API consists of MTP
    and SCCP primitives which remote devices can use to send and receive ISUP and
    TCAP messages to effect PSTN call control and access Intelligent Network databases.
    The MTP and SCCP primitives ensure that application states (available, unavailable
    or congested) are propagated into the SS7 network. This memo also identifies some
    functional and performance requirements for SS7 signaling transport to IP-based
    application processes residing on one or more client hosts.</p>"
