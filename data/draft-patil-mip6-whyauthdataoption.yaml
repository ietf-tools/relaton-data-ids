abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 defines a set of messages that enable the mobile node (MN)
    to authenticate and perform registration with its home agent (HA). These authentication
    signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent are secured by an IPsec
    SA that is established between the MN and HA. The MIP6 Working group ID draft-ietf-mip6-auth-
    protocol-04.txt specifies a mechanism to secure the binding update and binding
    acknowledgement messages using an authentication option, similar to authentication
    option in Mobile IPv4, carried within the messages that are exchanged between
    the MN and HA to establish a binding. This document provides the justifications
    as to why the authentication option mechanism is needed for Mobile IPv6 deployment
    in certain deployment environments.</p>"
