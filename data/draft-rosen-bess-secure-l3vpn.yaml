abstract:
- content: <p>The Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology described in RFC
    4364 is focused on the scenario in which a network Service Provider (SP) maintains
    a secure backbone network and offers VPN service over that network to its customers.
    Customers access the SP's network by attaching "Customer Edge" (CE) routers to
    "Provider Edge" (PE) routers, which exchange cleartext IP packets. PE routers
    generally serve multiple customers, and prevent unauthorized communication among
    customers. Customer data sent across the backbone (from one PE to another) is
    encapsulated in MPLS, using an MPLS label to associate a given packet with a given
    customer. The labeled packets are then sent across the backbone network in the
    clear, using MPLS transport. However, many customers want a VPN service that is
    secure enough to run over the public Internet, and which does not require them
    to send cleartext IP packets to a service provider. Often they want to connect
    directly to edge nodes of the public Internet, which does not provide MPLS support.
    Each customer may itself have multiple tenants who are not allowed to intercommunicate
    with each other freely. In this case, the customer many need to provide a VPN
    service for the tenants. This document describes a way in which this can be achieved
    using the technology of RFC 4364. The functionality assigned therein to a PE router
    can be placed instead in Customer Premises Equipment. This functionality can be
    augmented by transmitting MPLS packets through IPsec Security Associations. The
    BGP control plane sessions can also be protected by IPsec. This allows a customer
    to use RFC 4364 technology to provide VPN service to its internal departments,
    while sending only IPsec-protected packets to the Internet or other backbone network,
    and eliminating the need for MPLS transport in the backbone.</p>
