abstract:
- content: "<p>General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface protocol
    between a label switch and a controller, and it provides connection, configuration,
    event, performance management and synchronization. Traditionally, network management
    services are classified into five categories: those are configuration, performance,
    fault, accounting, and security management. The companion draft document discussed
    the implementation complexity of a label switch and the efficiency of resource
    usage according to the location of network management functions. This document
    defines managed objects to support network management services in the GSMP interface.</p>"
