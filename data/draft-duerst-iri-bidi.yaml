abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes how to deal with Internet identifiers containing
    characters from scripts such as Arabic and Hebrew, which use right-to- left or
    bidirectional writing. The solution proposed addresses three different contexts:
    The purely graphical representation of such identifiers, e.g. on paper, the embedding
    of such identifiers into running text with established rules for bidirectionality,
    and the processing and resolution of such identifiers.</p>"
