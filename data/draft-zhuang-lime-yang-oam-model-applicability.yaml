abstract:
- content: "<p>A generic YANG data model for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) has been defined in [GENYANGOAM], with the intention that technology-specific
    extensions will be developed to be able reference/use the Generic YANG model.
    In this document, we describe the applicability of the generic YANG OAM data model
    to specific OAM technologies. To be concrete, we also demonstrate the usability
    and extensibility of the generic YANG OAM model with OAM protocols such as IP
    Ping, traceroute, BFD and MPLS LSP Ping.</p>"
