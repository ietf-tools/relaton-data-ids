abstract:
- content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) exhibit characteristics unlike
    other more traditional IP links. LLNs are a class of network in which both routers
    and their interconnect are resource constrained. LLN routers are typically resource
    constrained in processing power, memory, and energy (i.e. battery power). LLN
    links are typically exhibit high loss rates, low data rates, are are strongly
    affected by environmental conditions that change over time. LLNs may be composed
    of a few dozen to thousands of routers. A new protocol called the IPv6 Routing
    Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has been specified for routing
    in LLNs supporting multipoint-to-point, point- to-multipoint traffic, and point-to-point
    traffic. Since RPL's publication as an RFC, several large scale networks have
    been succesfully deployed. The aim of this document is to provide deployment experience
    on real-life deployed RPL-based networks.</p>"
