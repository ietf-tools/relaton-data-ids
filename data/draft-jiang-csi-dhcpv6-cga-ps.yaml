abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes potential issues in the interaction between
    DHCPv6 and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs). Firstly, the scenario
    of using CGAs in DHCPv6 environments is discussed. Some operations are clarified
    for the interaction of DHCPv6 servers and CGA-associated hosts. We then also discuss
    how CGAs and DHCPv6 may have mutual benefits for each other, including using CGAs
    in DHCPv6 operations to enhance its security features and using DHCPv6 to provide
    the CGA generation function.</p>"
