abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast
    Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping requires the ability to identify the location
    of multicast routers. Since snooping is not standardized, there are many mechanisms
    in use to identify the multicast routers. However, this can lead to interoperability
    issues between multicast routers and snooping switches from different vendors.
    This document introduces a general mechanism that allows for the discovery of
    multicast routers. This new mechanism, Multicast Router Discovery (MRD), introduces
    a standardized means of identifying multicast routers without a dependency on
    particular multicast routing protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
