abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a one-way measurement of an IPsec packet edge-to-
    edge delay. Delay detection is enabled by a sender of an IPsec packet that includes
    a timestamp declaring the time at which it was sent. The receiver of the datagram
    can then judge how recently it was sent and choose a policy action, which could
    include discarding packets deemed to be 'too old' (having a timestamp too far
    into the past) or 'too new' (having a timestamp that is too far into the future).
    This provides a freshness policy check, which can be valuable irrespective of
    whether the IPsec policy also includes replay protection.</p>"
