abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides examples of the Internet Small Computer Systems
    Interface (iSCSI; or SCSI over TCP) name construction and discussion of discovery
    of iSCSI resources (targets) by iSCSI initiators. This document complements the
    iSCSI protocol document. Flexibility is the key guiding principle behind this
    document. That is, an effort has been made to satisfy the needs of both small
    isolated environments, as well as large environments requiring secure/scalable
    solutions. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
