abstract:
- content: "<p>The canonical format for the RFC Series has been plain-text, ASCII-
    encoded for several decades. After extensive community discussion and debate,
    the RFC Editor will be transitioning to XML as the canonical format, with different
    publication formats rendered from that base document. These changes are intended
    to increase the usability of the RFC Series by offering documents that match the
    needs of a wider variety of stakeholders. With these changes, however, comes an
    increase in complexity for authors, consumers, and the publisher of RFCs. This
    document serves as the framework that describes the problems being solved and
    summarizes the many documents that capture the specific requirements for each
    aspect of the change in format.</p>"
