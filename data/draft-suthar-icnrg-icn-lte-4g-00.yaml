abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile networks using LTE, 4G are complex. Managing mobility and content
    delivery using IP is complex and not optimized. IP unicast routing from server
    to clients is used for delivery of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE),
    where each user gets separate stream. From bandwidth and routing perspective this
    approach is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast technologies have emerged recently
    for mobile networks, but their deployments are very limited or at an experimental
    stage due to complex architecture and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly
    evolving technology for efficient multimedia content delivery, however majority
    of the work is focused either on fixed networks or unlicensed WiFi-based wireless
    networks. The main focus of this draft is on native deployment of ICN in cellular
    mobile networks by embedding into 3GPP protocol stack at IP level or replacing
    IP for non-IP datagrams. ICN has an inherent capability for anchorless mobility,
    security and it is optimized for content delivery using local caching at the edge.
    We believe that native or dual stack (with IP) deployment will bring all inherent
    benefits of ICN and help in optimizing mobile networks.</p>"
