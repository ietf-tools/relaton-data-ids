abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end disjoint
    LSPs in a multiple area domain, as required for inter-area end-to-end protection.
    This mechanism relies on the joint computation of the working and backup LSPs
    segments in each area. A new RSVP-TE object called the Associated Route Object,
    ARO, is defined and used in the signaling messages in support of this scheme.</p>"
