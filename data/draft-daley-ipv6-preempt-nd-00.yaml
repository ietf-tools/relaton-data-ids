abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain circumstances, a host knows that it will be receiving data
    at an IP address for which its neighbours have no neighbour cache entry. Where
    the expected packets are required to be received promptly, or there is significant
    chance of packet loss in a neighbour discovery exchange from the peer to the host,
    it may be advantageous to install a neighbour cache entry on the peer before it
    is required. This document proposes a mechanism whereby hosts can choose to preemptively
    populate their peer's neighbour cache to forestall later neighbour discovery exchanges.</p>"
