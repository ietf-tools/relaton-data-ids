abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) option
    to convey the IPv6 prefix used to build IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses. When conveyed
    in a DNS query, the option communicates the IPv6 prefix used in the network from
    which the query was originated. Such a network is assumed to enable a Network
    Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 clients to IPv4 servers (NAT64) function.
    DNS64-capable servers will use that prefix to build synthesized AAAA records,
    rather than relying on a preconfigured prefix. When conveyed in a DNS reply, the
    option conveys the IPv6 prefix that is used by a DNS64-capable server to synthesized
    AAAA records. Such information helps to automatically detect mismatches between
    the local NAT64 configuration and the one enforced at the DNS64 server. Also,
    security-aware and validating hosts may use the new EDNS0 option to signal the
    presence of a NAT64 function. That signal is used by the DNS server to fill the
    additional section of the AAAA reply in order to supply A RRs of the target. Dual
    queries and delays are thus avoided. This document updates RFC 6147.</p>"
