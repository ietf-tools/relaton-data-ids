abstract:
- content: "<p>The K-12 community traditionally has not had this level of staffing
    available for telecommunications planning. This document is intended to bridge
    that gap and provides a recommended technical direction, an introduction to the
    role the Internet now plays in K-12 education and technical guidelines for building
    a campus data communications infrastructure that provides internetworking services
    and connections to the Internet. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
