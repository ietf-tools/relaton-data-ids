abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts in IPv4 networks typically acquire addresses by use of DHCP,
    and retain that address and only that address while the DHCP lease remains valid.
    In IPv6 networks, hosts may use DHCPv6, but may instead autoconfigure their own
    global addresses, and potentially use many privacy addresses over time. This behaviour
    places an additional burden on network operators who require address accountability
    for their users and devices. There has been some discussion of this issue on various
    mail lists; this text attempts to capture the issues to encourage further discussion.</p>"
