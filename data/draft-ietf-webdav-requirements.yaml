abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a list of features in the form of requirements
    for a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning protocol which, if implemented,
    would improve the efficiency of common remote editing operations, provide a locking
    mechanism to prevent overwrite conflicts, improve link management support between
    non-HTML data types, provide a simple attribute-value metadata facility, provide
    for the creation and reading of container data types, and integrate versioning
    into the WWW. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does
    not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
