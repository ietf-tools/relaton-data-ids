abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, the M-PIN FULL protocol for two factor authentication
    and key exchange is described. This protocol mutually identifies a Client to a
    Server and the Server to the Client, and agrees between them a cryptographic strong
    encryption key for subsequent communication. M-PIN FULL requires an external Trusted
    Authority to issue secrets to participating Clients and Servers.</p>"
