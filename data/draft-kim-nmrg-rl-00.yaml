abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an intelligent reinforcement learning agent
    system to autonomously manage agent path-planning over a communication network.
    The main centralized node called by the global environment should not only manage
    all agents workflow in a hybrid peer-to-peer networking architecture and, but
    transfer and share information in distributed nodes. All agents in distributed
    nodes are able to be provided with a cumulative reward for each action that a
    given agent takes with respect to an optimized knowledge based on a to-be-learned
    policy over the learning process. A reward from the global environment is reflected
    to the next optimized action for autonomous path management in distributed networking
    nodes.</p>"
