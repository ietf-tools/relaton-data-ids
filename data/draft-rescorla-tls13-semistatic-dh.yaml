abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] specifies a signed Diffie-Hellman exchange
    modelled after SIGMA [SIGMA]. This design is suitable for endpoints whose certified
    credential is a signing key, which is the common situation for current TLS servers.
    This document describes a mode of TLS 1.3 in which one or both endpoints have
    a certified DH key which is used to authenticate the exchange.</p>"
