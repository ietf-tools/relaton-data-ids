abstract:
- content: <p>This document reformulates the definition of TCP/IP checksum. The new
    formulation is equivalent to the traditional one, but it uses much simpler mathematics,
    avoiding concepts like "one's complement sum". This document attempts to be helpful
    for both newbies and seasoned engineers when considering checksum problems. Practical
    calculation and software examples are included.</p>
