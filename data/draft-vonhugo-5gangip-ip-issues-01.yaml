abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents considerations related to open and upcoming
    issues with upcoming new communication systems denoted as 5G aiming to set a basis
    for documenting problem space, use-cases, and potential solutions related to next-generation
    network infrastructure. The draft reviews currently investigated topics, including
    both inputs from IETF and from other SDOs as well as research activities. Further
    the outcome of recent discussions at side sessions during IETF meetings are recaptured
    to help identifying a starting point for future thoughts.</p>"
