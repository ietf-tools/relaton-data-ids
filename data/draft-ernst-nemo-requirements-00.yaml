abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous
    Internet connectivity to mobile hosts only (host mobility support). In contrast,
    network mobility support (NEMO support) deals with situations where an entire
    network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability
    in the topology. In this situation, mobility support is to provide continuous
    Internet sessions not only to the router connecting the mobile network to the
    global Internet, but also to nodes behind the mobile router. This document tries
    to identify what constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of a
    potentially and ideally good solution, and what requirements solutions must comply
    with. Our main aim is to raise the discussion on the mailing list.</p>"
