abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simple voice stream multiplexing method which
    is designed to reduce the IP-UDP header overhead of RTP (real-time transport protocol)
    streams and to decrease the number of packets in the end-to-end transport functions.
    The proposed multiplexing method is to concatenate RTP packets destined for the
    same Internet Telephony Gateway (IP-GW) into a single UDP packet. The benefits
    of this method are that no new additional headers are required and the current
    well-defined H.323 and RTP standards can be used. Furthermore, this method is
    a general RTP packet multiplexing method that is applicable not only to an IP-GW
    but also to other multiplexing applications, as well as trunking VoIP streams
    application with insertion and deletion of RTP streams on the way.</p>"
