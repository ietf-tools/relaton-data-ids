abstract:
- content: "<p>While the RTP payload format defined in RFC 2250 is generally applicable
    to all forms of MPEG audio or video, it is less suitable for MPEG 1 or 2, layer
    III audio (commonly known as 'MP3'). The reason for this is that an MP3 frame
    is not a true 'Application Data Unit' - it contains a back-pointer to data in
    earlier frames, and so cannot be decoded independently of these earlier frames.
    Because RFC 2250 defines that packet boundaries coincide with frame boundaries,
    it handles packet loss inefficiently when carrying MP3 data. The loss of an MP3
    frame will render some data in previous (or future) frames useless, even if they
    are received without loss. In this document we define a new RTP payload format
    for MP3 audio. The new format is essentially the same as that defined in RFC 2250,
    except for a data-preserving rearrangement of the original MPEG frames, so that
    packet boundaries now coincide with true MP3 'Application Data Units'. This new
    format is therefore more data efficient in the face of packet loss.</p>"
