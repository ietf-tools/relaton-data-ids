abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the AVORS (Avoiding Registration Storms) concept
    that allows the resumption of active UE (User Equipment) registrations on other
    SIP Proxies within the SIP voice architecture. The concept can be mapped on any
    architecture having a distributed structure and could work for different protocols.
    In this document, the concept is exemplary explained regarding an architecture
    for voice and could also be mapped on a 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)
    architecture. The AVORS concept increases service continuity, improves network
    resilience and offers savings potential. Additionally, this document gives an
    outlook regarding stateless voice architectures, load calculation aspects, and
    Service Based Interfaces (SBI) with session data base interworking. Security aspects
    are considered in the security chapter. As stated above the AVORS principle is
    not only limited to the SIP protocol and could be adopted by other protocols.</p>"
