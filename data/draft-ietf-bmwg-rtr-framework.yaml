abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses and proposes a framework for the development of
    IP performance benchmarking methodologies in the case of systems under test (SUT)
    running IETF routing protocols. The intent of this document is to facilitate the
    use of existing metrics developed by the BMWG and other working groups. This will
    be accomplished by specifying router configuration and state parameters and characterizing
    their effect on IP packet forwarding in terms of these existing metrics. The terms
    defined in this memo will be used in addition to terms defined in RFCs 1242, 2285,
    and 2544 and 2761. This memo is a product of the Benchmarking Methodology Working
    Group (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</p>"
