abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP address space is a fixed size, fully recyclable resource which
    must be shared amongst the entire Internet community in order to achieve global
    connectivity. Similarly, the routing table entries in the routers that comprise
    the backbone are a scarce resource. Squandering either of these resources can
    lead to an Internet in which some systems have significantly reduced reachability.</p>"
