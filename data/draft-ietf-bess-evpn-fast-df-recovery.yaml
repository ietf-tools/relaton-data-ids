abstract:
- content: "<p>The Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution provides Designated
    Forwarder election procedures for multihomed Ethernet Segments. These procedures
    have been enhanced further by applying Highest Random Weight (HRW) Algorithm for
    Designated Forwarded election in order to avoid unnecessary DF status changes
    upon a failure. This document improves these procedures by providing a fast Designated
    Forwarder (DF) election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with
    the multihomed Ethernet Segment. The solution is independent of the number of
    EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment and it is performed via a simple signaling
    between the recovered PE and each of the other PEs in the multihoming group.</p>"
