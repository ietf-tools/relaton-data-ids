abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an AsciiDoc syntax extension called AsciiRFC,
    designed for authoring IETF Internet-Drafts and RFCs. AsciiDoc is a human readable
    document markup language which affords more granular control over markup than
    comparable schemes such as Markdown. The AsciiRFC syntax is designed to allow
    the author to entirely focus on text, providing the full power of the resulting
    RFC XML through the AsciiDoc language, while abstracting away the need to manually
    edit XML, including references. This document itself was written and generated
    into RFC XML v2 (RFC7749) and RFC XML v3 (RFC7991) directly through asciidoctor-rfc,
    an AsciiRFC generator.</p>"
