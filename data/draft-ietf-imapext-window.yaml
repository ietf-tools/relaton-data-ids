abstract:
- content: "<p>The WINDOW extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
    permits windowing of the results of specific IMAP commands, so that clients can
    retrieve the results in ranges to implement paging of results or virtual scrollbars.
    This eliminates the need to get and manage the entire result set, improving scalability
    for large mailboxes and slow connections.</p>"
