abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL uses distribution trees to deliver multi-destination frames.
    Multiple trees can be used by an ingress RBridge for flows regardless of the VLAN,
    Fine Grained Label (FGL), and/or multicast group of the flow. Different ingress
    RBridges may choose different distribution trees for TRILL Data packets in the
    same VLAN, FGL, and/or multicast group. To avoid unnecessary link utilization,
    distribution trees should be pruned based on VLAN and/or FGL and/or multicast
    destination address. If any VLAN, FGL, or multicast group can be sent on any tree,
    for typical fast path hardware, the amount of pruning information is multiplied
    by the number of tree; however, there is a limited capacity for such pruning information.
    This document specifies an optional facility to restrict the TRILL Data packets
    sent on particular distribution trees by VLAN, FGL, and/or multicast group thus
    reducing the total amount of pruning information so that it can more easily be
    accommodated by fast path hardware.</p>"
