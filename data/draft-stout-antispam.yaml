abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo gives an implementation recommendation for SMTP [1] MTAs
    (Mail Transfer Agents) to make them more capable of reducing the impact of spam(*).
    Although this recommendation is not the 'final solution', if applied on enough
    SMTP MTAs on the Internet, the recommendation will force spammers into the open,
    where they can be dealt with. A brief summary of the recommendation is: o Register
    all MTAs within DNS o Verify the combination of sender and sending MTA</p>"
