abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the application of IP over a cable data network
    service environment configured as a logical IP subnetwork (LIS). Specifically,
    this document describes the cable data network interfaces to support IP, IP service
    features, IP address assignment using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP),
    Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and other service-specific issues relating
    to supporting IP over cable data network service. This document considers only
    directly connected IP end-stations and the router operating in the conventional
    LAN based paradigm over a cable data network. As background information, this
    document also provides an overview of the cable data network service, the architecture
    and the related network interfaces. This document does not specify an Internet
    Standard of any kind. It is presented for discussion purposes only.</p>"
