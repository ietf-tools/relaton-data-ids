abstract:
- content: "<p>With bidirectional tunneling in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the communication
    between any two Mobile Nodes is required to traverse the Local Mobility Anchor
    (LMA). This is the case even when the communicating Mobile Nodes are attached
    to the same Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG). This document introduces two messages
    between the LMA and the MAG enabling local forwarding by the MAG. Such forwarding
    avoids the delay due to bidirectional forwarding, and reduces the traffic load
    on the LMA.</p>"
