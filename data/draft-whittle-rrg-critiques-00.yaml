abstract:
- content: <p>This ID will contain the full-length versions of all critiques which
    were not included in full in the RRG Report. It may also point to discussions
    I consider significant, and include any "rebuttals" or "reflections" which were
    not included in full in the Report. This ID is to support and document the IRTF
    Routing Research Group discussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010.
    It is not a formal product of the RRG. To what extent its contents are supported
    by RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.</p>
