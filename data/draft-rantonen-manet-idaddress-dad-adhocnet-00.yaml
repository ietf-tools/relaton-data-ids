abstract:
- content: "<p>Many kinds of mobile user equipments may want to join or create wireless
    local area network. Today connectivity is usually based on using the IP address
    as the identifier for the device. However, such kinds of devices do not necessary
    have a static IP address. Some autoconfiguration procedures are developed for
    fixed networks, but those procedures have requirements that Manet does not satisfy.
    For ad hoc networks, some IPv6 address autoconfiguration solutions are developed
    during recent years. In this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile
    ad hoc network nodes will be described. A hardware based addressing will be presented
    as one approach to create a temporary IPv6 address. Furthermore, a solution for
    minimizing Duplicate Address Detection procedures while generating a globally
    unique IPv6 address will be explained.</p>"
