abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces the concept of a SCHClet, a modular, atomic sub-function
    within the SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) framework. Drawing an analogy
    from chiplet technology in integrated circuits, a SCHClet is envisioned as a self-contained
    unit that encapsulates a specific SCHC function or set of functions. This modular
    approach allows for tailored implementations that can meet diverse use cases without
    the overhead of a full SCHC apparatus. By decomposing SCHC functionality into
    SCHClets, the framework becomes more adaptable, extensible, and easier to deploy
    generic network environments, applicable, but not limited to constrained networks.
    A technology which uses a SCHClet can be considered as built using the SCHC Framework.
    A generic SCHC Framework implementation which has all SCHClets implemented MUST
    be able to interoperate with any SCHClet, provided it has the corresponding configuration.
    For example, if one IPsec end-point uses a minimal SCHClet implementation, the
    other end-point may use a full SCHC implementation with the corresponding configuration.
    It may be said that a SCHClet is the minimal sub-function corresponding to a given
    SCHC Context. In this sense, we can see Ack-On-Err Fragmentation as a SCHClet.
    We may consider the Ack- Always Fragmentation as a SCHClet. Or we may consider
    the baseline fragmentations from RFC8724 (NoAck, AckAlways, AckOnErr) as a SCHClet,
    with the parameters defining which fragmentation mode is used. In any case, a
    developer may chose to use only the NoAck fragmentation (for example), and in
    this case they are using the NoAck Fragmentation SCHClet, which can even be further
    restricted to a fixed set of parameters, with different parameters unsupported
    by the implementation.</p>"
