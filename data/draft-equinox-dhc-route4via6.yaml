abstract:
- content: "<p>// This draft lives at https://github.com/eqvinox/dhc-route4via6 As
    a result of the shortage of IPv4 addresses, installations are increasingly recovering
    IPv4 addresses from uses where they are not strictly necessary. One such situation
    is in establishing next hops for IPv4 routes, replacing this use with IPv6 addresses.
    This document describes how to provision DHCP-configured hosts with their routes
    in such a situation.</p>"
