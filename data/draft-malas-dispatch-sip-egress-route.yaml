abstract:
- content: "<p>In some cases a UA (or proxy) within a Session Initiation Protocol
    [RFC3261] Service Provider (SSP) has multiple parallel egress proxy options to
    reach an ingress proxy within another SSP to reach the target UA. If the originating
    SSP uses ENUM to identify the ingress proxy of the target SSP, there is currently
    no way for the ENUM NAPTR response to identify a specific preferred egress proxy
    from the set of multiple parallel proxies. This draft solves this problem by defining
    a method for returning deterministic routing information within an ENUM NAPTR
    response enabling the UA (or proxy) to choose a preferred egress proxy. Using
    this information, the originating UA now sends the SIP request through the predetermined
    preferred egress proxy to reach the target SSP's proxy. This document describes
    several methods to make this determination by incorporating variables into a SIP
    service URI contained in the E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) response.</p>"
