abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the DNS, there is no mechanism for authoritative servers to
    advertise which transport methods they are capable of. If secure transport methods
    are adopted by authoritative operators, transport signaling would be required
    to negotiate how authoritative servers would be contacted by resolvers. This document
    provides two new Resource Record Types, NS2 and NS2T, to facilitate this negotiation
    by allowing zone owners to signal how the authoritative nameserver(s) for their
    zone(s) may accept queries.</p>"
