abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the resource control mechanisms utilized by
    existing P2P applications. The intent of this document is to generate discussion
    in the community about resource control and provide guidance for DECADE requirements.
    For example, some of these resource control functions could be supported DECADE
    to enable better usability of in-network storage for a wide range of P2P applications.</p>"
