abstract:
- content: '<p>Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the network.
    Accurately detect problems is very challenging for network operators in production
    networks. Good results require a lot of expertise and knowledge around both the
    implied network technologies and the connectivity services provided to customers,
    apart from a proper monitoring infrastructure. In order to facilitate network
    anomaly detection, novel techniques are being introduced, including programmatical,
    rule-based and AI-based, with the promise of improving scalability and the hope
    to keep a high detection accuracy. To guarantee acceptable results, the process
    needs to be properly designed, adopting well-defined stages to accurately collect
    evidence of anomalies, validate their relevancy and improve the detection systems
    over time, iteratively. This document describes a well-defined approach on managing
    the lifecycle process of a network anomaly detection system, spanning across the
    recording of its output and its iterative refinement, in order to facilitate network
    engineers to interact with the network anomaly detection system, enable the "human-in-the-loop"
    paradigm and refine the detection abilities over time. The major contributions
    of this document are: the definition of three key stages of the lifecycle process,
    the definition of a state machine for each anomaly annotation on the system and
    the definition of YANG data models describing a comprehensive format for the anomaly
    labels, allowing a well-structured exchange of those between all the interested
    actors.</p>'
