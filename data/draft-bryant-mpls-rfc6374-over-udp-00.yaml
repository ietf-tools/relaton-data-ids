abstract:
- content: "<p>In draft-bryant-mpls-synonymous-flow-labels the concept of MPLS synonymous
    flow labels (SFL) was introduced and it was shown how they could be used to support
    RFC6374 loss measurements. In draft-bryant- mpls-sfl-control the request, lifetime
    management and withdrawal of SFLs was described. In this memo we show how these
    two protocols can be run over UDP to support the operation of RFC6374 in systems
    that do not support the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) (RFC5586).</p>"
