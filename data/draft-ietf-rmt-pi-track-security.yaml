abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the security issues within the TRee-based ACKnowledgement
    (TRACK) reliable multicast protocol instantiation, and identifies some constraints
    and requirements for security provisions for this protocol. Based on the constraints
    and requirements, the document proposes a separation of data packet confidentiality
    and authentication, from transport layer protection. It proposes that TRACK be
    primarily concerned with group authentication of control and data packets, to
    protect against attacks on the transport infrastructure. It proposes that data
    confidentiality and source authentication be provided separately from this low
    level group authentication, ideally at the application level. We show that this
    is particularly important for TRACK, because of the requirement that the interior
    control nodes only OPTIONALLY have access to the data packet payload.</p>"
