abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing provides the ability to partition a physical network
    into multiple logical networks of varying sizes, structures, and functions so
    that each slice can be dedicated to specific services or customers. Network slices
    need to co-exist on the same network while ensuring slice elasticity in terms
    of network resource allocation. The Differentiated Service (Diffserv) model allows
    for carrying multiple services on top of a single physical network by relying
    on compliant domains and nodes to provide forwarding treatment (scheduling and
    drop policy) on to packets that carry the respective Diffserv code point. This
    document adopts a similar approach to Diffserv and proposes a scalable approach
    to realize network slicing in IP/MPLS networks. The solution does not mandate
    Diffserv to be enabled in the network to provide a specific forwarding treatment,
    but can co-exist with and complement it when enabled.</p>"
