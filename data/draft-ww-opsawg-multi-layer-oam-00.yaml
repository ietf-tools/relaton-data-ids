abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms [RFC6291]
    are basic building blocks for every communication layer and technology. The current
    practice is that many technologies and layers have their own OAM protocols. In
    the current situation there is a little or no re-use of software and hardware
    in the existing OAM protocols. Vendors and operators waste a lot through the whole
    OAM life-cycle when a new technology is introduced. Integration of OAM across
    multiple technologies is extremely difficult. In many cases it is desirable to
    have a generic OAM to cover heterogeneous networking technologies. An example
    to this generic approach is the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection [BFD] mechanism
    that offers a way to monitor, troubleshoot and maintain the network and services
    in support multi-layer OAM independent of media, data protocols, and routing protocols.
    Generic OAM tools can be deployed over various encapsulating protocols, and in
    various medium types. An example of an environment in which a generic and integrated
    OAM protocol would be valuable is Service Function Chaining. A Service Function
    Chaining is composed by series of service Functions, that can act in different
    layers but providing an end-to-end chain or path from a source to destination
    in a given order [I.D-ietf-sfc-problem- statement]. In service function chaining
    environment it is necessary to provide end to end OAM across certain or all entities
    and involving many layers. OAM information should be exchanged between service
    functions in different layers while using various encapsulating protocols. In
    some cases OAM should cross different administration and/or maintenance domains.
    This document sets out the problem statement and architecture for the Generic
    OAM in the Service Layer Routing. This document will cover at least the basic
    OAM functions and information such as Connectivity Verification (CV), Path Verification
    and Continuity Checks (CC),Path Discovery / Fault Localization and Performance
    Monitoring necessary to monitor and maintain the network.</p>"
