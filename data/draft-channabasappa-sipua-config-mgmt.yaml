abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides use cases for the configuration and management
    of SIP-based devices (SIP client and applications) based on available IETF protocols
    and related methodologies. The use cases have been made generic enough to take
    into account common network topologies and requirements in SIP service deployments.
    Based on the use cases, we present a preliminary analysis of available IETF protocols
    that meet these requirements and highlight some of the limitations.</p>"
