abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be
    World IPv6 Day, on which some major organisations are going to make their content
    available over IPv6. With the likes of Google and Facebook providing IPv6 access
    to their production services and domains, it is very likely we will see more IPv6
    traffic flowing across the Internet than has ever been seen before. With this
    in mind, it seems timely to issue a call to arms for systems and network administrators
    to review their organisation's IPv6 capabilities in order to mitigate common causes
    of IPv6 connectivity problems in advance of the day. The increased traffic on
    World IPv6 Day should also create an excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour
    and performance of IPv6; it is thus very desirable to have appropriate measurement
    tools in place in advance. We discuss some appropriate tools from the network
    and application perspective.</p>"
