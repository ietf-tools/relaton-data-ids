abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes RESTful EPP (REPP), a data format agnostic,
    REST based Application Programming Interface (API) for the Extensible Provisioning
    Protocol [RFC5730]. REPP enables the development of a stateless and scalable EPP
    service. This document includes a mapping of [RFC5730] [XML] EPP commands to a
    RESTful HTTP based interface. Existing semantics as defined in [RFC5731], [RFC5732]
    and [RFC5733] are retained and reused in RESTful EPP.</p>"
