abstract:
- content: "<p>6to4 [1] defines a mechanism for allowing sites to communicate using
    IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet. It does so by assigning a block of IPv6 addresses
    corresponding to any 'public' (globally-scoped) IPv4 address, and a means of tunneling
    IPv6 traffic destined for such addresses over the IPv4 Internet. In this way,
    any site which is connected to the IPv4 Internet and which has at least one global
    IPv4 address assigned to it, can communicate with IPv6.</p>"
