abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an enhanced approach to data protection for
    computer applications by requiring them to cryptographically sign or label data
    generated using granted permissions. This would allow the host system to manage
    the storage and transport of generated data, ensuring a granular level of control
    and ultimately protecting user data more effectively.</p>"
