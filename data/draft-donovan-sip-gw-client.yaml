abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a functional model of a gateway between the
    Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN) and a SIP-based IP network providing
    telephony service. In this document, the SIP-based IP network will be referred
    to as Telephony over IP Service (TIPS). The primary function of the gateway is
    to handle connections involving one or more PSTN phones (i.e.; PSTN black phones)
    as if those PSTN phones are SIP clients. The goal of this approach is to ensure
    that SIP-based TIPS service logic applies to both native Internet- based SIP clients
    and PSTN phones without modification.</p>"
