abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies methods for text media handling in multi-party
    calls, where the text is carried by the RTP protocol. Real-time text is carried
    in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103. Centralized multi-party handling
    of real-time text is achieved through a media control unit coordinating multiple
    RTP text streams into one single stream RTP session, identifying each stream with
    its own CSRC. Identification for the streams are provided through the RTCP messages.
    This mechanism enables the receiving application to present the received real-time
    text medium in different ways according to user preferences. Some presentation
    related features are also described explaining suitable variations of transmission
    and presentation of text. Call control features are described for the SIP environment,
    while the transport mechanisms should be suitable for any IP based call control
    environment using RTP transport. Two alternative methods using a single RTP stream
    and source identification inline in the text stream are also described.</p>"
