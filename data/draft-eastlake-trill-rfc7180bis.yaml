abstract:
- content: "<p>Since publication of the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
    of Links) base protocol in 2011, active development of TRILL has revealed errata
    in RFC 6325 and areas that could use clarifications or updates. RFCs 7177, 7357,
    and [rfc6439bis] provide clarifications and updates with respect to Adjacency,
    the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) protocol, and Appointed
    Forwarders respectively. This document provides other known clarifications, corrections,
    and updates. It obsoletes RFC 7180 (the previous TRILL clarifications, corrections),
    updates RFC 7177, updates RFC 7179, and updates RFC 6325.</p>"
