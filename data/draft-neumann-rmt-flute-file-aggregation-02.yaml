abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces a logical and physical file aggregation scheme
    for File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE). The logical file aggregation
    mechanism is a generalized grouping mechanism, allowing to logically group files.
    The physical file aggregation scheme allows, additionally to a logical grouping,
    to more efficiently use Forward Error Correction (FEC) in the context of FLUTE,
    in particular when dealing with a large number of "small" files. Unlike a solution
    based on the creation of an archive, the object aggregation scheme (1) avoids
    the need to perform preliminary transformations on the content and (2) preserves
    the possibility to extract a subset of the content, which may be critical aspect
    with some partially reliable broadcasting test cases.</p>
