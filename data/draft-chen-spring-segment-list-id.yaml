abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an ordered list
    of instructions, called segments. The ingress node prepends a SR header to a packet
    containing a set of "segments". A segment can represent any instruction topological
    or service-based. The Segment Routing architecture can be implemented using MPLS
    with no change to the forwarding plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label.
    An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels, but it has implications
    on label stack depth. This document describes how to decrease the depth of the
    label stack in order to do effective Segment Routing operation.</p>
