abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) provides a generic framework
    for configuring and managing various storage entities and their usage attributes
    in an IP-based storage network. iSNS integrates Fibre Channel name server and
    DNS mechanisms into a common naming and resource-discovery framework. The iSNS
    Protocol (iSNSP) defines how entities communicate with the iSNS server to discover
    and utilize available networked storage resources. The iSNS server MAY be supported
    by a consolidated iSNS directory database, which serves as a repository to store
    information about various storage resources, providing easy access to topology
    information for storage entities.</p>"
