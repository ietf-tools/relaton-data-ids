abstract:
- content: <p>This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet
    electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates, and clarifies several previous
    documents, making all or parts of most of them obsolete. It covers the SMTP extension
    mechanisms and best practices for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide
    details about particular extensions. Although SMTP was designed as a mail transport
    and delivery protocol, this specification also contains information that is important
    to its use as a "mail submission" protocol for "split-UA" (User Agent) mail reading
    systems and mobile environments. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
