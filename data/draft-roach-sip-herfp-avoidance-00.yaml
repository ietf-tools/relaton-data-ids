abstract:
- content: "<p>The processing of SIP reqeusts by certain types of proxies can lead
    to situations in which multiple non-sucessful responses are generated, only one
    of which is ultimately reported to the originator of the response. In many cases,
    these non-successful responses indicate conditions that can be addressed by the
    requestor, and then retried; therefore, the elision of them by proxies can lead
    to a decrease in the rechability of certain network entites. This document defines
    a mechanism that can be employed to avoid the dropping of such requests with minimal
    implementation complexity.</p>"
