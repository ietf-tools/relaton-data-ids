abstract:
- content: "<p>To solve the inefficient route problem of PMIPv6, a variety of mechanisms
    were proposed. The mechanism was also proposed to support PMIPv6 RO handover according
    mobile node's movements. Efficient PMIPv6 RO handover SHOULD be considered to
    reduce handover latency and to support communication with route optimization disabled
    mobile node's remote node. In this draft, we proposed a mechanism that can solve
    handover latency in PMIPv6 RO handover. And we introduce a few of messages to
    apply proposed mechanism.</p>"
