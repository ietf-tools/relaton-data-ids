abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes data structures and API support for Mobile
    IPv6 as an extension to the Advanced Socket API for IPv6. Just as the Advanced
    Sockets API for IPv6 gives access to various extension headers and the ICMPv6
    protocol, this document specifies the same level of access for Mobile IPv6 components.
    It specifies a mechanism for applications to retrieve and set information for
    Mobility Header messages, Home Address destination options, and Routing Header
    Type 2 extension headers. It also specifies the common data structures and definitions
    that might be used by certain advanced Mobile IPv6 socket applications. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
