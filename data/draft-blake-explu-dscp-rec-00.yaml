abstract:
- content: <p>Some network operators implementing Diffserv are purported to remark
    some IP packets with non-zero DSCP values to the default DSCP value '000000' at
    their ingress network boundaries. This behavior is often not strictly necessary
    to protect an operator's network resources, and it impedes end-to-end experimentation
    of new differentiated services. This document recommends that Diffserv network
    operators refrain from remarking packets received with an EXP/LU DSCP value [RFC2474][RFC8436]
    that is not in use within the operator's network, and recommends that operators
    forward these packets at each Diffserv node (DS-node) using the Default "best-effort"
    PHB.</p>
