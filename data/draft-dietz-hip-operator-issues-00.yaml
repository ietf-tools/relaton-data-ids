abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discuss the potential issues that arise when the Host
    Identity Protocol (HIP) will be introduced in a operator network, especially in
    the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) of the 3GPP systems. It discusses mobile network
    specific issues like charging, lawful interception as well as common issues like
    where to associate the HIP ID or privacy issues. The document tries to make the
    HIP community aware of those issues and wants to stimulate discussion on those
    topics.</p>"
