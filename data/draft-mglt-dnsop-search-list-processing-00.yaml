abstract:
- content: <p>Domain Names can be Qualified or Unqualified Domain Names. Qualified
    Domain Names are resolved over the public DNS infrastructure, whereas Unqualified
    Domain Names are resolved using search lists. How search lists are generated and
    interpreted varies from one application to another and from one operating system
    to another. This makes Unqualified Domain Name resolution unpredictable, non deterministic,
    and as such neither reliable nor stable. In addition, there is neither clear rules
    to define whether a name is a Qualified or an Unqualified Domain Name. This also
    contributes in making the naming resolution unreliable, as the resolution of a
    given name can result in different responses. As a consequence, most resolution
    systems currently end with a "try and error" strategy. More specifically, according
    to some system dependent heuristics, a resolver initiates an Unqualified (resp.
    Qualified) Domain Name resolution, and, in case of a NXDOMAIN response, fails
    back in a Qualified (resp. Unqualified) Domain Name resolution. Such strategies
    were acceptable as the probability of collision between domains within search
    list and those published in the public DNS infrastructure remains low. In the
    context of the generalization of Top Level Domain, this assumption is not acceptable
    anymore, resulting in an unreliable and unstable naming resolution. This document
    describes how search list should be generated and interpreted. Then, it describes
    how resolvers distinguish between Qualified and Unqualified Domain Names as well
    as how to resolve them.</p>
