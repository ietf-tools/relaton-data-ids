abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines general extensions for Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) to carry messages, as specified
    by a key management protocol, in order to secure the media. These extensions are
    presented as a framework, to be used by one or more key management protocols.
    As such, their use is meaningful only when complemented by an appropriate key
    management protocol. General guidelines are also given on how the framework should
    be used together with SIP and RTSP. The usage with the Multimedia Internet KEYing
    (MIKEY) key management protocol is also defined. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
