abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an opportunity in successor-to-IKE to fix two major problems
    that have plagued IKEv1: a misunderstanding about what is identity, and having
    to send certificates every time because you don't know if the other party already
    has your certificate. This proposal covers both topics at once because it turns
    out that they are related.</p>"
