abstract:
- content: '<p>One goal of this document is to define approaches to achieve a "once
    and only once" delivery of messages. The EDIINT AS2 protocol is implemented by
    a number of software tools on a variety of platforms with varying capabilities
    and with varying network service quality. Although the AS2 protocol defines a
    unique "Message-ID", current implementations of AS2 do not provide a standard
    method to prevent the same message (re-transmitted by the initial sender) from
    reaching back-end business applications at the initial receiver. A second goal
    is to reduce retransmissions and failures when AS2 is used in a synchronous mode
    for transmitting MDNs. There can be a large latency between receipt of the POSTed
    entity body and the MDN response caused by the operations of decompressing, decrypting,
    and signature checks. Uncoordinated timeout policies and intermediate devices
    dropping connections have interfered with reliable data exchange. The use of an
    HTTP 102(Processing) status code is described to mitigate these difficulties.
    Use of these reliability features is indicated by presence of the "AS2-Reliability"
    value in the EDIINT-Features header. Intended Status The intent of this document
    is to be placed on the RFC track as an Informational RFC. Feedback Instructions:
    NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: This section should be removed by the RFC editor prior to
    publication. If you want to provide feedback on this draft, follow these guidelines:
    -Send feedback via e-mail to the ietf-ediint list for discussion, with "AS2 Reliability"
    in the Subject field. To enter or follow the discussion, you need to subscribe
    to ietf-ediint@imc.org. -Be specific as to what section you are referring to,
    preferably quoting the portion that needs modification, after which you state
    your comments. -If you are recommending some text to be replaced with your suggested
    text, again, quote the section to be replaced, and be clear on the section in
    question.</p>'
