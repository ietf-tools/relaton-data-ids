abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses security threats to NETLMM-based mobility management
    with a focus on threats on the interface between mobile nodes and access routers.
    Threats to the NETLMM protocol itself, which runs between the access routers and
    mobility anchor points, are similar to those faced by other protocols between
    network entities like routers. These threats are handled in the NETLMM protocol
    specification. In contrast, threats on the interface between mobile nodes and
    access routers are different, because the access routers are presenting the NETLMM
    domain as a single subnet, in order to allow mobile nodes to continue using the
    same IP address as they move from one access router to another.</p>"
