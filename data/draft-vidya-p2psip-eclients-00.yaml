abstract:
- content: "<p>RELOAD [1] defines a class of devices termed as clients that may attach
    to peers and use the overlay, without having to provide overlay routing or storage.
    These devices may attach to the identity owner on the overlay or to any arbitrary
    peer. This document provides a mechanism to attach to any arbitrary peer with
    some state on the overlay for routing purposes. This avoids needing application
    specific means of providing a destination list for contact information for the
    client and also inherently handles client mobility.</p>"
