abstract:
- content: "<p>In Network virtualization (NV) technology, Virtual Network Embedding
    (VNE) is a problem to map a virtual network to the substrate network. It has a
    great impact on the performance of virtual network and resource utilization of
    the substrate network. An efficient embedding strategy can maximize the acceptance
    ratio of virtual networks to increase the revenue for Internet service provider.
    Several works have been appeared on the design of VNE solutions, however, it has
    becomes a challenging issues for researchers. To solved the VNE problem, reinforcement
    learning (RL) can play a vital role to make the VNE problem more intelligent and
    efficient. Moreover, RL has been merged with deep learning techniques to develop
    adaptive models with effective strategies for various complex problems. In RL,
    agents can learn desired behaviors (e.g, optimal VNE strategies), and after learning
    and completing training, it can embed the virtual network to the subtract network
    very quickly and efficiently. RL can reduce the complexity of the VNE method,
    however, it is too difficult to apply RL techniques directly to VNE problems and
    need more research study. In this document, we are presenting a problem statement
    to motivate the research community to solve the VNE problem using reinforcement
    learning.</p>"
