abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a mechanism to support detached Additional Authenticated
    Data (AAD) in JWE (JSON Web Encryption), allowing the AAD to be derived from context-specific
    information, such as session identifiers, algorithm identifiers, and identifiers
    of communication endpoints, rather than being transmitted in-band. This mechanism
    strengthens security by mitigating risk against unknown-key-share attacks and/or
    other exploitation techniques that depend on some type of confusion over the role
    played by each party. The document explains how to integrate this functionality
    into JWE, covering both JWE JSON Serialization and JWE Compact Serialization.</p>"
