abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks
    Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream
    CDN (dCDN). This document supplements the CDNI Metadata Footprint Types defined
    in RFC 8006. The Footprint Types defined in this document can be used for Footprint
    objects as part of the Metadata interface (MI) defined in RFC 8006 or the Footprint
    &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) defined in RFC 8008. The defined
    Footprint Types are derived from requirements raised by Open Caching but are also
    applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</p>"
