abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6 networks, there remains a need to provide IPv4 service for
    some residual devices. This document describes a mechanism for allocating IPv4
    addresses to such devices, using DHCPv4 with an IPv6 transport. It is done by
    putting a special relay agent function (Client Relay Agent) on the client side,
    as well as extending the behavior of the server; in the case where DHCP server
    only supports IPv4 transport, a relay agent is extended to support IPv6 transport
    (IPv6-Transport Relay Agent) and relay DHCP traffic for the server, with a new
    Relay Agent Information sub-option added to carry the IPv6 address of the Client
    Relay Agent. DHCPv4 over IPv6 has been developed in the IETF, and some implementations
    and deployments have been carried out. But this mechanism is not recommended for
    future implementation or deployment.</p>"
