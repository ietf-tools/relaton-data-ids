abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the framework and the operational procedure
    for deterministic networking with work conserving packet schedulers that guarantee
    end-to-end latency bounds to flows. Schedulers in core nodes of the network do
    not need to maintain flow states. Instead, the entrance node of a flow marks an
    ideal service completion time, called Finish Time (FT), of a packet in the packet
    header. The subsequent core nodes update FT by adding a delay factor, which is
    a function of the flow and upstream nodes. The packets in the queue are served
    in the ascending order of the FT. This technique is called Fair Queuing (FQ).
    The result is that flows are isolated from each other almost perfectly. The latency
    bound of a flow depends only on the flow's intrinsic parameters, except the link
    capacities and the maximum packet lengths among other flows sharing each output
    link with the flow.</p>"
