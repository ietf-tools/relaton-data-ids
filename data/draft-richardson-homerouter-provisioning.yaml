abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a method to provisioning an 802.1AR-style certificate
    into a router intended for use in the home. The proceedure results in a certificate
    which can be validated with a public trust anchor ("WebPKI"), using a name rather
    than an IP address. This method is focused on home routers, but can in some cases
    be used by other classes of IoT devices. (RFCEDITOR please remove: this document
    can be found at https://github.com/mcr/homerouter-provisioning)</p>'
