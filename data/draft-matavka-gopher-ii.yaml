abstract:
- content: "<p>The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old. Changing practices and
    unofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ, but remain
    largely compatible with, the technical specifications first established in its
    first informational document, *The Internet Gopher Protocol (a distributed document
    search and retrieval protocol)*, known as *RFC 1436*. Therefore, this document
    attempts to establish a contemporary specification of the Gopher communications
    protocol, departing as little as possible from current practice.</p>"
