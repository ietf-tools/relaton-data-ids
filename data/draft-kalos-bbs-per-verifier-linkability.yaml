abstract:
- content: "<p>The BBS Signatures scheme defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures],
    describes a multi-message digital signature, that supports selectively disclosing
    the messages through unlinkable presentations, built using zero-knowledge proofs.
    Each BBS proof reveals no information other than the signed messages that the
    Prover chooses to disclose in that specific instance. As such, the Verifier (i.e.,
    the recipient) of the BBS proof, may not be able to track those presentations
    over time. Although in many applications this is desirable, there are use cases
    that require the Verifier be able to track the BBS proofs they receive from the
    same Prover. Examples include monitoring the use of access credentials for abnormal
    activity, monetization etc.. This document presents the use of pseudonyms with
    BBS proofs. A pseudonym, is a value that will remain constant each time a Prover
    presents a BBS proof to the same Verifier, but will be different (and unlinkable),
    when the Prover interacts with a different Verifier. This provides a way for a
    recipient (Verifier) to track the presentations intended for them, while also
    hindering them from tracking the Prover's interactions with other Verifiers.</p>"
