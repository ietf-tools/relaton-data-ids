abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6 enables mobile
    devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing
    the IP address. PMIPv6 also provides limited multi- homing support to multi-mode
    mobile devices. The IETF is working on optimizations for PMIPv6. While multi-homing
    item has been proposed to be part of the approved work, discussions showed there
    are still many controversial issues to be addressed (i.e. the no-host modification
    theorem). This document explores solutions for the multi-homing use case aiming
    at helping PMIPv6 development where possible.</p>"
