abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profiles for
    compression of RTP/UDP/IP (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User Datagram Protocol,
    Internet Protocol), UDP/IP and ESP/IP (Encapsulating Security Payload) headers.
    These profiles inherit most of their functionality from the RFC 3095 profiles,
    with the exception that efficient support for out-of-order delivery of packets
    is added to these new profiles. The profiles defined in this document do not provide
    mechanisms to alleviate the issues with reordering in the R mode, and these profiles
    SHOULD be used only in the U/O modes.</p>"
