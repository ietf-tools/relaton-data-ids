abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the multihoming issues in Mobile IP networks.
    It specifies the basic multihoming scenario, a mobile node is multihomed to multiple
    home agents within an AS, then describes the multihoming method for this basic
    scenario. The principle of the multihoming method in this document is that multiple
    home agents share security associations established between a mobile node and
    a home agent. By sharing security associations among home agents who serve the
    same home link, we can reduce the burden of MN to manage the HA list. This document
    points out technical issues related to sharing security associations among home
    agents and specifies possible solutions for them. Also, this document describes
    how to extend the basic multihoming method to more complicated multihoming cases
    such as multiple home agents in different AS.</p>"
