abstract:
- content: "<p>The multicast operation of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)
    routing protocol (MAODV) is intended for use by mobile nodes in an ad hoc network.
    It offers quick adaptation to dynamic link conditions, low processing and memory
    overhead, and low network utilization. It creates bi-directional shared multicast
    trees connecting multicast sources and receivers. These multicast trees are maintained
    as long as group members exist within the connected portion of the network. Each
    multicast group has a group leader whose responsibility is maintaining the group
    sequence number, which is used to ensure freshness of routing information.</p>"
