abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better
    response time, control over data and carbon energy saving by moving the computing
    services towards the edge of the network in scenarios of 5G MEC (Multi-access
    Edge Computing), virtualized central office, and others. Providing services by
    sharing computing resources from multiple edges is emerging and becoming more
    and more useful for computationally intensive tasks. The service nodes attached
    to multiple edges normally have two key features, service equivalency and service
    dynamism. Ideally they should serve the service in a computational balanced way.
    However lots of approaches dispatch the service in a static way, e.g., to the
    geographically closest edge, and they may cause unbalanced usage of computing
    resources at edges which further degrades user experience and system utilization.
    This draft provides an overview of scenarios and problems associated. Networking
    taking account of computing resource metrics as one of its top parameters is called
    Compute First Networking (CFN) in this document. The document identifies several
    key areas which require more investigations in architecture and protocol to achieve
    the balanced computing and networking resource utilization among edges in CFN.</p>"
