abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
    and Conformance (DMARC) causes problems to indirect mail flows. This document
    proposes a protocol to establish forwarding agreements whereby a mailbox provider
    can whitelist indirect mail flows directed toward its users by maintaining per-user
    lists of agreements.</p>"
