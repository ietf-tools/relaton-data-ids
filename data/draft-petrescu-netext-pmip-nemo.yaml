abstract:
- content: <p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol supports Mobile Hosts moving independently,
    but not Mobile Routers in charge of moving networks. This draft addresses this
    problem. The goal is to allow bidirectional communication between a Local Fixed
    Node (in the moving network) and a Correspondent Node (situated arbitrarily somewhere
    in the Internet). First, a mechanism of "prefix division" is presented, whereby
    the Home Network Prefix typically assigned by PMIPv6 to a MH is used by MR to
    form Mobile Network sub-Prefix(es); they are used by LFNs within the moving network
    to form addresses; this avoids changes in the PMIPv6 protocol specification. A
    second mechanism proposes enhancements to the use of the DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation
    protocol entities informing the PMIPv6 entities about the allocated MNP; this
    is achieved by equaling MNID and DUID.</p>
