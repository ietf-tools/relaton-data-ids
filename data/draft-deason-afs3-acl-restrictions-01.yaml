abstract:
- content: "<p>The AFS-3 ACL 'a' bit gives users unfettered power to grant, or revoke,
    privileges, with no provision for enforcing site policy. This memo provides several
    alternative mechanisms for creating restrictions on what powers the 'a' bit denotes.
    Three alternative mechanisms for restricting the power of the 'a' bit are proposed:
    a method for overlaying the ACL with a site-controlled ACL; a method for masking
    the ACL with a site-controlled privilege mask; and a finely granular meta-acl
    mechanism for restricting to whom privileges may be delegated, and which privileges
    may be given to different classes of principals. This memo will serve as a basis
    for the ACL restriction discussion with the AFS-3 protocol working group. The
    intended goal of this discussion is to reach consensus on standardization of one
    or more solutions, and then publish a BCP status memo.</p>"
