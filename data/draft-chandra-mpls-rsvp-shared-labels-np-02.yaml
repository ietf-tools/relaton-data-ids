abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routed RSVP-TE tunnels provide the ability to use a shared
    MPLS forwarding plane at every hop of the Label Switched Path (LSP). The shared
    forwarding plane is realized with the use of 'Traffic Engineering (TE) link labels'
    that get shared by LSPs traversing these TE links. This paradigm helps significantly
    reduce the forwarding plane state required to support a large number of LSPs on
    a Label Switching Router (LSR). These tunnels require the ingress Label Edge Router
    (LER) to impose a stack of labels. If the ingress LER cannot impose the full label
    stack, it can use the assistance of one or more delegation hops along the path
    of the LSP to impose parts of the label stack. The procedures for a Point of Local
    Repair (PLR) to provide local protection against link failures using facility
    backup for Segment Routed RSVP-TE tunnels are well defined and do not require
    specific protocol extensions. This document defines the procedures for a PLR to
    provide local protection against transit node failures using facility backup for
    these tunnels. The procedures defined in this document include protection against
    delegation hop failures.</p>"
