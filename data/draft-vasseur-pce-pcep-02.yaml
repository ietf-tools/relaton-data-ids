abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Path Computation Element communication
    Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
    a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. Such interactions include
    path computation requests and path computation replies as well as notifications
    of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of MPLS and GMPLS
    Traffic Engineering. The PCEP protocol is designed to be flexible and extensible
    so as to easily allow for the addition of further messages and objects, should
    further requirements be expressed in the future.</p>"
