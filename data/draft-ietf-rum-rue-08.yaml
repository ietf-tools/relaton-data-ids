abstract:
- content: <p>Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which
    a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired
    user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via a videophone
    to the deaf/HoH user and an audio telephone call to the hearing user. The CA interprets
    using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link. Often
    the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency termed a "provider" in
    this document. The provider also provides a video service that allows users to
    connect video devices to their service, and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/HoH
    users. It is desirable that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing
    or hearing impaired user conform to a standard so that any device may be used
    with any provider and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of hearing or
    hearing impaired users work. This document describes the interface between a videophone
    and a provider.</p>
