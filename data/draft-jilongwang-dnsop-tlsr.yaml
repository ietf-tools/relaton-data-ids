abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the definition of a new DNS resouce record type
    named TLSR, and then discusses a new framework for certificate revocation and
    certificate status verification. This document can solve the existing problems
    in the current certificate revocation schemes. This requires matching improvements
    in TLS client software, but no change in TLS server software.</p>"
