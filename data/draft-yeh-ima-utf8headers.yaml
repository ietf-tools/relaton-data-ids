abstract:
- content: "<p>Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
    capability to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected information in specific
    header fields, and to use international characters in envelope addresses. It also
    requires being able to express those addresses and information based on them in
    mail header fields. This document specifies the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8,
    rather than ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header fields. This form
    is permitted in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as specified
    in an associated specification.</p>"
