abstract:
- content: "<p>The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks is subject to a set of one or more specific optimization criteria, referred
    to as objective functions (e.g., minimum cost path, widest path, etc.). In the
    Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture, a Path Computation Client (PCC) may
    want a path to be computed for one or more TE LSPs according to a specific objective
    function. Thus, the PCC needs to instruct the PCE to use the correct objective
    function. Furthermore, it is possible that not all PCEs support the same set of
    objective functions; therefore, it is useful for the PCC to be able to automatically
    discover the set of objective functions supported by each PCE. This document defines
    extensions to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to allow a PCE to indicate
    the set of objective functions it supports. Extensions are also defined so that
    a PCC can indicate in a path computation request the required objective function,
    and a PCE can report in a path computation reply the objective function that was
    used for path computation. This document defines objective function code types
    for six objective functions previously listed in the PCE requirements work, and
    provides the definition of four new metric types that apply to a set of synchronized
    requests. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
