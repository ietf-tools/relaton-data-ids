abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the issues facing nomadic communications in
    an IP-based environment. While cellular systems epitomise current concepts of
    mobility, there is an industry need to support similar functions in non-cellular
    environments as well. Unfortunately, solutions defined to-date by the cellular
    industry tend to be closely tied to the technology employed over the radio link
    (e.g. GSM, cdma2000, UMTS, EDGE). To facilitate discussion, this document begins
    with a high-level description of functional entities comprising an Open IP Network
    Infrastructure. It then defines an abstract model of the access link used to connect
    a mobile host to the network. Using these entities and model, we then go on to
    discuss the issues facing nomadic computing that could be usefully addressed by
    an IETF working group like CRAPS.</p>"
