abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the exhaustion of global IPv4 address space, there are demands
    arising for IPv4 address sharing between end users. In such context, different
    users can employ the same address, but different ports. This document defines
    two DHCP options for assigning a set of ports to a device. One is used for allocating
    continuous port set, while the other is designed for non-continuous port set allocation.</p>"
