abstract:
- content: "<p>Providing an existing scalable authorization infrastructure for mobile
    nodes is needed for IPv6-based mobility. SIM Authentication provides a protocol
    for authenticating and authorizing services. It uses an authorizing home domain
    defined by the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). The protocol is an Internet Control
    Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) [17] extension. It can leverage the existing
    SIM authorization infrastructure for automatic bootstrapping of security association
    between the mobile node and a service, where the service can be e.g. authorized
    last-hop VPN setup for network access or Mobile IPv6 mobile-home security association
    setup.</p>"
