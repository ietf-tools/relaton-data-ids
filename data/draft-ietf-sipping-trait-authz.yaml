abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lays out a set of requirements related to trait-based
    authorization for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). While some authentication
    mechanisms are described in the base SIP specification, trait-based authorization
    provides information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of
    a participant in a session. This approach provides a richer framework for authorization,
    as well as allows greater privacy for users of an identity system. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
