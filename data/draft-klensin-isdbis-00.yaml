abstract:
- content: <p>The current IETF standard-track maturity level definitions, including
    the assumption that most specification of successful protocols would advance rapidly
    to Internet Standard, the never-used automatic expiration mechanism, and the STD
    nnnn designation, have not worked well. Users of IETF Standards have found it
    difficult to determine what standards were associated with others in groups, the
    actual status of specifications within a related group, and the level of interoperability
    testing and deployment and use for any given standard or set of features. The
    community has rarely used the "requirement level" mechanism in recent years. There
    is now an errata mechanism for published RFCs, but the errata lists do not provide
    authoritative, consensus-based, corrections to standards- track documents. This
    document suggests that all of those issues are symptoms of a single system of
    interrelated issues and problems and proposes an integrated solution.</p>
