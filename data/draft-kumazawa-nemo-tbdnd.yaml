abstract:
- content: "<p>When multiple Mobile Routers share the same prefix, a Home Agent must
    be able to verify whether the Mobile Routers share the same Mobile Network or
    not. Otherwise, the Home Agent may not be able to forward a data packet to a correct
    recipient since the recipient may not be connected to the mobile router the Home
    Agent chooses to forward the packet. This document describes a Token based Duplicate
    Network Detection mechanism that enables a Home Agent to detect whether multiple
    Mobile Rotuers claiming the same prefix are in the same Mobile Network.</p>"
