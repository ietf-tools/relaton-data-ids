abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an option for specifying lifetime of other
    configuration options. It's mainly intended for the stateless DHCP, but also useful
    when there are no addresses or other entities with lifetimes that can tell the
    client when to contact the DHCP server and update its configuration.</p>"
