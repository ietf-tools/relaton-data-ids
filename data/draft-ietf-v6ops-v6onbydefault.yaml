abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses problems that can occur when dual stack nodes
    that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6
    environments. The problems include application connection delays, poor connectivity,
    and network insecurity. The purpose of this memo is to raise awareness of these
    problems so that they can be fixed or worked around, not to try to specify whether
    IPv6 should be enabled by default or not.</p>"
