abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [1], is a network-
    based mobility management protocol. It uses a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and
    a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move around within a domain while
    keeping their address or address prefix stable. Although the issues of mobile
    multicast in the PMIPv6 network are being discussed in the Multimob WG, how to
    provide the service connectivity when the multicast source is moving is still
    a problem for the PMIPv6. This document proposes and analyzes the potential solutions
    of the multicast source mobility in PMIPv6.</p>"
