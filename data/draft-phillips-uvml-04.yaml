abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML),
    a syntax for the structured representation of opinion in free text. Using UVML,
    opinions can be encoded in text, image, or video, and reliably interpreted by
    either human readers or automated-agents. UVML supports both rating and ranking
    semantics. Ratings may be scored using symbols associated with the five most commonly
    used opinion dimensions: quality(*), importance(!), outlook($), support- opposition(+),
    and likelihood(%). In addition, UVML defines a syntax for optionally including
    a demographic signature by which voters can publish basic demographic information
    with their UVML votes. The design of UVML leverages cross-cultural sentiment and
    voting-systems scholarship.</p>"
