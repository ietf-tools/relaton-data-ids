abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2724 presented an analysis and taxonomy of RTFM attributes, and
    proposed adding new attributes and new types of attribute. Many of those 'new'
    attributes, especially the distribution-valued attributes, have now had several
    years implementation experience. This document proposes that these attributes
    be implemented, i.e that the RTFM Architecture and Meter MIB RFCs be re-written
    to include them.</p>"
