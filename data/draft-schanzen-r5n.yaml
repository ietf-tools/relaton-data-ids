abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the R^5N DHT technical specification. R^5N is
    a secure distributed hash table (DHT) routing algorithm and data structure for
    decentralized applications. It features an open peer- to-peer overlay routing
    mechanism which supports ad-hoc permissionless participation and support for topologies
    in restricted-route environments. This document defines the normative wire format
    of protocol messages, routing algorithms, cryptographic routines and security
    considerations for use by implementers. This specification was developed outside
    the IETF and does not have IETF consensus. It is published here to guide implementation
    of R^5N and to ensure interoperability among implementations including the pre-existing
    GNUnet implementation.</p>"
