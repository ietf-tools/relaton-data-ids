abstract:
- content: "<p>DIAMETER is an authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) protocol
    used for network access services, such as dial-up (NASREQ) and Mobile IP. Some
    DIAMETER servers maintain state information of active sessions on the access servers,
    which is used mostly to enforce some local policy decisions. This extension describes
    an extension to the DIAMETER protocol that allows the server to query for active
    session state information from access servers in order to rebuild state information
    should it be lost for any reason.</p>"
