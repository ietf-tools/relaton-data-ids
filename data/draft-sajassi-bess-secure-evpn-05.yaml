abstract:
- content: "<p>The applications of EVPN-based solutions ([RFC7432] and [RFC8365])
    have become pervasive in Data Center, Service Provider, and Enterprise segments.
    It is being used for fabric overlays and inter- site connectivity in the Data
    Center market segment, for Layer-2, Layer-3, and IRB VPN services in the Service
    Provider market segment, and for fabric overlay and WAN connectivity in Enterprise
    networks. For Data Center and Enterprise applications, there is a need to provide
    inter-site and WAN connectivity over public Internet in a secured manner with
    same level of privacy, integrity, and authentication for tenant's traffic as IPsec
    tunneling using IKEv2. This document presents a solution where BGP point-to-multipoint
    signaling is leveraged for key and policy exchange among PE devices to create
    private pair-wise IPsec Security Associations without IKEv2 point-to-point signaling
    or any other direct peer-to-peer session establishment messages.</p>"
