abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to use Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) as a Transport Medium for the Certificate management protocol version 2
    (CMPv2) and Lightweight CMP Profile [Lightweight-CMP-Profile] which is a subset
    of CMPv2 defined for Constrained devices. The CMPv2 defines the interaction between
    various PKI entities for the purpose of certificate creation and management. The
    CoAP is an HTTP like client-server protocol used by various constrained devices
    in the IoT and industrial scenarios. Constrained devices are devices that have
    low memory or CPU or power constraints and avoid the use of complex protocols
    like TCP to save resources.</p>"
