abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the protocol used between elements of a physically
    decomposed multimedia gateway, i.e., a Media Gateway and a Media Gateway Controller.
    The protocol presented in this document meets the requirements for a media gateway
    control protocol as presented in RFC 2805. This document replaces RFC 3015. It
    is the result of continued cooperation between the IETF Megaco Working Group and
    ITU-T Study Group 16. It incorporates the original text of RFC 3015, modified
    by corrections and clarifications discussed on the Megaco E-mail list and incorporated
    into the Study Group 16 Implementor's Guide for Recommendation H.248. The present
    version of this document underwent ITU-T Last Call as Recommendation H.248 Amendment
    1. Because of ITU-T renumbering, it was published by the ITU-T as Recommendation
    H.248.1 (03/2002), Gateway Control Protocol Version 1. Users of this specification
    are advised to consult the H.248 Sub-series Implementors' Guide at http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/com16/implgd
    for additional corrections and clarifications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
