abstract:
- content: "<p>We call virtual private networks (VPNs) based on Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) 'MPLS VPN'. This document discusses motivation and a model of
    interworking among MPLS VPNs. It then proposes functional capabilities for the
    interworking such as realization of security, mapping of the QoS class, dynamic
    routing information distribution. Considering easy provisioning, we focus on an
    interworking where each MPLS network is once terminated and IP header look-up
    is executed at an egress/ingress Label Switching Router (LSR), and IP over ATM
    (RFC1483) is used for interworking connections.</p>"
