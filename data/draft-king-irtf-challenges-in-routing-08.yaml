abstract:
- content: <p>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an interface
    on a network device. Routing protocols were developed based on the assumption
    that a destination address had this semantic. Over time, routing decisions have
    been enhanced to determine paths on which packets could be forwarded according
    to additional information carried principally within the packet headers, and dependent
    on policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers. Many proposals
    have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing additional information
    into existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses, or by adding fields
    to the packets. The intent is always to facilitate routing decisions based on
    these additional semantics in order to provide differentiated paths to enable
    forwarding of different packet flows on paths that may be distinct from those
    derived by shortest path first or path vector routing. We call this approach "Semantic
    Routing". This document describes the challenges to the existing routing system
    that are introduced by Semantic Routing. It then summarizes the opportunities
    for research into new or modified routing and forwarding approaches that make
    use of additional semantics. This document is presented as a study to support
    further research into clarifying and understanding the issues. It does not pass
    comment on the advisability or practicality of any of the proposals and does not
    define any technical solutions.</p>
