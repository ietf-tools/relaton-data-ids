abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP), which
    allows transparent routing of IP packets to mobile hosts in the Internet, while
    using only the mobile host's 'home' IP address. No changes are required in stationary
    hosts that communicate with mobile hosts, and no changes are required in mobile
    hosts above the IP level. IMHP quickly converges to optimal routing following
    the movement of a mobile host, while maintaining the 'weak security' model of
    today's Internet. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those
    of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the Mobile IP Working
    Group or the IETF. It is our hope to better explain the issues and to stimulate
    discussion, in order to assist the Working Group in its efforts to develop a single
    Group draft protocol specification. This document has not been approved by the
    Mobile IP Working Group.</p>"
