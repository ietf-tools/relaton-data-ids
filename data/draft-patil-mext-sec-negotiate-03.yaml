abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKEv2 for securing the signaling
    and user traffic. A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does not adequately
    address various deployment scenarios. The one-size- fits-all security approach
    is ill suited for Mobile IPv6, as different deployments have different security
    requirements. Multiple alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have
    been proposed and are being considered for standardization. When multiple security
    protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6 nodes, there is a need
    to negotiate the choice of security protocol between a mobile node and home agent
    a priori. This document proposes a method for negotiating the security protocol
    to be used between mobile IPv6 nodes.</p>"
