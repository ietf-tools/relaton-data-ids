abstract:
- content: "<p>In discussions between IETF and ITU regarding administration of services
    specificed according to RFC 2916 [ENUM], it is observed that several documents
    talk about registries and registrars in a way which is not in accordance with
    normal use in the DNS. To help the discussions, IETF has via the ISOC Sector Membership
    in ITU-T submitted this text to the Q.1/2 Rapporteurs meeting in Oslo 25th - 29th
    June 2001.</p>"
