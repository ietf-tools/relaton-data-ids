abstract:
- content: "<p>The RFC Editor is both the publisher and the archivist for the RFC
    Series. This document applies specifically to the archivist role of the RFC Editor.
    It provides guidance on when and how to preserve RFCs, and the tools required
    to view or re-create RFCs as necessary. This document also highlights where gaps
    are in the current process, and where compromises are suggested to balance cost
    with ideal best practice.</p>"
