abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Managment(DMM) aims to eliminate the centralized
    anchor point of current IP mobility solutions to get better scalability and optimize
    the data plane routing. Many soulutions have been proposed in DMM working group
    but before defining any new DMM protocol, it is a good approach to investigate
    first whether it is feasible to deploy current IP mobility protocol in DMM scenario
    in a way that can meet all the requirment of DMM.This document discusses the way
    of the deployment of current IP mobility protocol in DMM scenario and analyses
    the gaps between this approach and the DMM requirment.</p>"
