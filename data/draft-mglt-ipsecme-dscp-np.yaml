abstract:
- content: <p>IPsec supports "classifier" mechanism to send traffic with specific
    Differentiated Services Field Codepoints (DSCP) over different tunnels. However,
    such classification is not explicitly notified to the other peer. This document
    specifies the DSCP Notification Payload, which, in a CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchange,
    explicitly mentions which DSCP code points will be tunneled in the newly created
    tunnel.</p>
