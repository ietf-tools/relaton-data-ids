abstract:
- content: "<p>An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities
    has created a need to deliver optimized content for each device. This specification
    defines a set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints,
    to address this. They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation;
    just as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer,
    Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.</p>"
