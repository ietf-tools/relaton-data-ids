abstract:
- content: "<p>In Internet telephony, the call control functions of a traditional
    circuit switch are replaced by a IP-based call controller that must provide features
    normally provided by the traditional switch, including operating as a SSP for
    IN features. A traditional switch is armed with an IN call model that provides
    it a means to reach out and make service decisions based on intelligence stored
    elsewhere. Internet call controllers, by contrast, do not have an IN call model.</p>"
