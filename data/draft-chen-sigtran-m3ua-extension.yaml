abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4666 defines M3UA a protocol for supporting the transport of any
    SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services
    of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. M3UA is designed for SEP-(TDM)-SG-(IP)-IPSEP
    and IPSEP-(IP)-IPSEP applications, so the network level management function isn't
    required. But when M3UA is used in IP based signaling network, the network level
    management function needs to be extended. This document provides the proposals
    for extending M3UA signalling network route management. This document is consistent
    with RFC4666 in other sides.</p>"
