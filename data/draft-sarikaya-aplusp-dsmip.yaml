abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes how to use IPv6 Port Range transition technique
    in mobile networks for Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6). Using the client based
    DSMIPv6, a mobile node (MN) which is a dual-stack node can be assigned with a
    shared IPv4 Home Address (HA) together with a port range from the home agent.
    HA is co-located with Port Range Router (PRR). IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation is used
    to convey IPv4 traffic between the network and the mobile node (MN). HA, acting
    as PRR receives incoming IPv4 datagrams and determines the routing identifier
    (IPv6 address) to use to forward the traffic to the appropriate MN among those
    sharing the same IPv4 address. In the binding mode, HA finds the binding cache
    entry for this MN and then encapsulates the IPv4 datagram in an IPv6 one and forwards
    the encapsulated datagram to MN. The stateless mode is also described. Within
    this memo, Mobile network could be WiMAX network or 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE)
    network.</p>"
