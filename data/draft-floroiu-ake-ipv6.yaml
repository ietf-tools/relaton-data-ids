abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an authenticated key exchange scheme enabling
    two nodes to establish a security association in a way robust to man in the middle
    attacks. The scheme is based on owner-bound IP addresses and DNS lookups. The
    proposed scheme relies on the fact that an attacker cannot timely produce a piece
    of information to match the output of a one way function.</p>"
