abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents. This framework
    defines the procedures for creating, refreshing, and terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state. These procedures provide
    no tools to avoid replaying event notifications that have already been received
    by a user agent. This memo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the
    subscriber to condition the subscription request to whether the state has changed
    since the previous notification was received. When such a condition is true, either
    the body of a resulting event notification or the entire notification message
    is suppressed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
