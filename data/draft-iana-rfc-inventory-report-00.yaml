abstract:
- content: '<p>This RFC archives the report on the ICANN/IANA "RFC Inventory" Project.
    This project examined older RFCs for "IANA Actions", that is, actions that need
    to be performed by ICANN/IANA as part of the protocol parameters portion of the
    IANA Functions Contract, that were not completed, not properly referenced or,
    in some other fashion, required re-examination for incomplete IANA Actions. The
    goal was to ensure that, for all RFCs, the IANA Actions had been identified and
    completed as accurately as possible. In order to ensure that this report is available
    in a format that is accessible to the IETF, this RFC is available in two formats:
    an ASCII format which contains a summary of the graphics and charts contained
    in the report to the IESG; and a PDF version which contains all the graphics and
    charts in their original presentation.</p>'
