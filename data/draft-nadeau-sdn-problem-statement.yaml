abstract:
- content: <p>Software Driven Networks (SDN) is an approach to networks that enables
    applications to converse with and manipulate the control software of network devices
    and resources. SDNs are comprised of applications, control software, and interfaces
    to services that are hosted in an overlay or logical/virtual network as well as
    those possibly same components that comprise the underlying physical network.
    Modern applications require the ability to easily interact and manipulate these
    resources. Applications can benefit from knowing the available resources and from
    requesting that the network makes the resources available in specific ways. To
    this end, there is a requirement to couple applications more closely to the underlying
    resources on which they depend, consume and interact with. SDN infrastructure
    and components exist in most deployed networks today. Some of these components
    are being standardized by various organizations, as as well some being already
    standardized by the IETF. However, no standards or open specifications currently
    exist to facilitate end-to-end operation of a software defined network, specificlly
    one that provides open APIs for applications to control the network services and
    functions offered by device control planes or other "controlling" software. The
    goal of this document is to outline the problem area of SDN for the IETF.</p>
