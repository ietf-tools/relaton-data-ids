abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] specifies Selective
    Acknowledgements (SACKs) to allow a transport layer data receiver to acknowledge
    DATA chunks which arrive out-of-order. In SCTP, SACK information is advisory because
    the data receiver is permitted to renege; that is, later discard a DATA chunk
    which previously has been SACKed. Since delivery of a SACKed out-of-order DATA
    chunk is not guaranteed, a copy of this DATA chunk MUST be kept in the data sender's
    retransmission queue until this DATA chunk is cumulatively acked. This document
    specifies Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements (NR- SACKs), an extension to
    SCTP's acknowledgment mechanism. NR-SACKs enable a data receiver to explicitly
    acknowledge out-of-order DATA chunks that have been delivered to the receiving
    application. (Recall that, in SCTP, out-of-order data sometimes can be delivered.)
    NR-SACKs also enable a data receiver to indicate any out-of-order DATA chunks
    on which the receiver guarantees never to renege. As opposed to SACKed DATA chunks,
    a sender can consider NR-SACKed DATA chunks as never requiring retransmission,
    thus freeing space in the data sender's retransmission queue sooner.</p>"
