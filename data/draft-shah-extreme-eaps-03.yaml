abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Ethernet Automatic Protection Switching
    (EAPS) (tm) technology invented by Extreme Networks to increase the availability
    and robustness of Ethernet rings. An Ethernet ring built using EAPS can have resilience
    comparable to that provided by SONET rings, at a lower cost and with fewer constraints
    (e.g., ring size).</p>"
