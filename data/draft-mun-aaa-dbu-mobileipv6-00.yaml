abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the procedure of how dose the Mobile Node(MN)
    exchange the messages with it's Corresponeant Node(CN) by using the secure communication
    platform, the AAA infrastructure that consists of the many AAA servers in different
    domains when the MN is about to enter the visited link. The MIPv6 node (MN, CN
    or both) has the unique identifier, NAI (Network Access Identifier) to distinguish
    itself from others and by parsing the NAI[5], we can get the information on which
    domain the MN belongs.</p>"
