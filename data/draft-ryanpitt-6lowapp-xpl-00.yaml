abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an Extensible Presentation Language (XPL) and
    XPL Type Resolution Protocol to be used as the basis for building protocols in
    the application area addressed by the IETF 6lowpan and proposed 6lowApp Working
    Groups. This comprises applications for highly resource-constrained devices over
    wireless networks, where the devices are: power-constrained; ubiquitous; potentially
    very small; heterogeneous; have very short duty cycles (e.g. 0.1%); and are installed
    or used for many years on end, e.g. 'smart' electricity meters, electric cars,
    etc.</p>"
