abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the IPv6 extensions to support an experiment
    in which new IPv6 Routing headers that support stateless replication are implemented
    and deployed for IPv6 Segment Routing Networks. Collectively, these headers are
    called Multicast Routing Header (MRH). One purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate
    that the MRH can be implemented and deployed in a production network. Another
    purpose is to encourage replication of the experiment.</p>"
