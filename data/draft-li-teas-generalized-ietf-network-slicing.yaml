abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF network slice has been introduced to meet specific service requirements,
    such as the connectivity requirements and the associated network capabilities
    such as bandwidth, latency, jitter and network functions with the resource behaviors
    such as computing and storage availability. For the realization of IETF network
    slices, one or more network resource partitions (NRPs) can be created in the network.
    Each NRP is a collection of network resources (buffer, queuing, scheduling, etc.)
    allocated in the underlay network. The connectivity constructs from one or more
    IETF network slices can be mapped to an NRP. NRP specific identifiers could be
    carried in the IETF network slice packets, which could be used to determine the
    set of network resources to be used for the processing and forwarding of the packets
    in the corresponding NRP. With the development of IETF network slicing technologies
    and the deployment of IETF network slices in different types of networks, there
    are emerging requirements about the new capability and functionality of IETF network
    slices. To meet those requirements, it is expected that the concept IETF network
    slice and NRP needs be generalized. This document describes the considerations
    about possible generalization of IETF network slice and NRP.</p>"
