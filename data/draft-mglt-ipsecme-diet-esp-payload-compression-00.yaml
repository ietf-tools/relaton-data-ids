abstract:
- content: "<p>ESP is a IPsec protocol that takes as input a Clear Text Data and outputs
    an encrypted ESP packet according to IPsec rules and parameters stored in different
    IPsec databases. Diet-ESP compresses the ESP fields. However, Diet-ESP does not
    consider compression of the Clear Text Data. Instead, if compression of the Clear
    Text Data is expected protocols like ROHCoverIPsec can be used. ROHCoverIPsec
    remains complex to implement in IoT devices, as states, and negotiations are involved
    between the compressors and decompressors of the two IoT devices. Most of this
    complexity can be avoided by considering the parameters that have been negotiated
    by IPsec. This document describes an extension of the Diet-ESP Context that enables
    the compression of the Clear Text Data, without implementing the complex ROHCoverIPsec
    framework. As opposed to ROHCoverIPsec the compression is not generic and as such
    all communication will not benefit from this compression. However, we believe
    this extension addresses most of IoT communications.</p>"
