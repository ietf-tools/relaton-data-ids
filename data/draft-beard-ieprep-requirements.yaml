abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines requirements that need to be met in IP-based
    networks to enable and support communications for National Security/Emergency
    Preparedness (NS/EP) operations. It provides a template from which an emergency
    service can be negotiated and provides a set of requirements that should be met
    for acceptable emergency communication services. The focus here is on network
    requirements, rather than requirements for particular applications. The requirements
    are general and are intended to provide wide latitude in implementation options
    for service providers.</p>"
