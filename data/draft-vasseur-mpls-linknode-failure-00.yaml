abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this draft is to provide a method to distinguish a link
    from a node failure using RSVP hello extensions. In a network making use of MPLS
    Traffic Engineering Fast Reroute as specified in [FAST-REROUTE], efficient use
    can be made of the network links when protecting against link/node failures. As
    described in [FACILITY], excess capacity used for bypass tunnels can be shared
    between bypass tunnels providing protection for mutually exclusive failures of
    different links or nodes. This results in significant bandwidth savings under
    the single failure assumption. Making use of the single failure assumption implies
    the need to distinguish a link from a node failure. However, the mechanisms currently
    available for failures detection do not always allow to distinguishing a link
    from a node failure.</p>"
