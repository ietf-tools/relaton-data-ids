abstract:
- content: <p>In order to support arbitrary network topologies and multi-homing the
    IETF Homenet Architecture [RFC7368] requires that a routing protocol operates
    inside each home network. For interoperability reasons it is necessary for there
    be a single "mandatory to implement" routing protocol. With the Homenet Working
    Group unable to reach clear consensus on which protocol that should be the Working
    Group Chairs (with the support of the Internet Area Director) declared rough consensus
    that the chosen protocol is BABEL [RFC6126]. This document (not intended for publication
    as an RFC) serves as an additional record of that decision.</p>
