abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate
    routers to run explicit tree-building protocol or to maintain multicast-related,
    per-flow state. IGP protocols are extended to carry BFR-Id and other encapsulation
    informations that are used by traditional path computing algorithm using link
    metric for a loop-free best path selection. This document defines a constrained
    based path selection using IGP flexible Algorithm for BIER.</p>
