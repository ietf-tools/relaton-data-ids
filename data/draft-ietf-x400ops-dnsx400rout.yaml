abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a method of storing in the Internet Domain Name
    System the routing information needed by X.400 MTAs within an X.400 MHS. Routing
    information can be managed in a distributed rather than a centralized way. MTAs
    located on Internet hosts can retrieve the routing information querying the DNS
    instead of having fixed tables which need to be centrally updated and distributed.
    This document specifies a prototype standard proposal. This memo is a joint effort
    of X400 operation working group and RARE Mail and Messaging working group.</p>"
