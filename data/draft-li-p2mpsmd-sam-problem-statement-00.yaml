abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, more and more Internet streaming services are getting increasingly
    popular among users. With the increasing growth of streaming media traffic, network
    awareness and policy-based control are required for providing higher QoE to the
    end users and better OAM support to the service providers. They are especially
    important for point to multipoint streaming media delivery for the edge network.
    However, most of the existing technologies or protocols, such as IP multicast,
    do not provide the network aware and policy-based control mechanisms. This document
    presents the problem statements in point to multipoint streaming media delivery
    for edge network, explains why network awareness and policy-based control should
    be urgently addressed for the point to multipoint streaming media delivery in
    the edge network and introduces what's should be further considered in the future.</p>"
