abstract:
- content: "<p>This document motivates the need for the Multicast Routing Monitor
    (MRM) [MRM] protocol by describing the niche that exists for a router-based multicast
    management protocol. Using the 'sufficient and necessary' argument, we suggest
    that existing protocols and techniques lack important management functionality.
    This document briefly describes the methodology used by MRM, justifies the existence
    of MRM, and describes some of the scenarios in which MRM will be of value.</p>"
