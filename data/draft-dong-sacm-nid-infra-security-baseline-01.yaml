abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of the companion documents which describes the
    infrastructure layer security baseline YANG output for network infrastructure
    devices. The infrastructure layer security baseline covers the security functions
    to secure the device itself, and the fundamental security capabilities provided
    by the device to the upper layer applications. In this specific document, the
    integrity measurement, cryptography algorithms, key management, and certificate
    management are sorted out to generate the data model.</p>"
