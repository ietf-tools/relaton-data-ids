abstract:
- content: "<p>Industry needs the CDN interconnection to provide the CDN service that
    may cover a wider geographical area and a better service quality. In the real
    pragmatic operation, the relationship between two CDNs should concern many factors(for
    instance, CDN or CP may select the downstream CDN based on some principals or
    conditions or service authorizations), hence the CDN interconnection is defacto
    a sort of constrained interconnection. This document will give the use cases to
    indicate the models of how the CDN interconnection may be used and the associated
    examples for the use cases will be listed subsequently.</p>"
