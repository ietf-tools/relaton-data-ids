abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is a protocol that allows a mobile node (MN)
    to maintain connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) via the Internet while
    changing its point of attachment. In MIPv6, a MN cannot know which packet is the
    last packet with the previous CoA (PCoA) as the destination address. In this draft,
    we define the format and the usage of the Flush message, in order for the MN to
    know the last packet with the PCoA as the destination address sent by the home
    agent (HA) and/or a CN.</p>"
