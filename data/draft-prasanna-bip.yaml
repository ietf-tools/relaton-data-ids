abstract:
- content: "<p>Billing information protocol is a simple protocol that can be used
    by servers to indicate the charging information incurred due to a specific operation
    with a client. In many situations a client, like a SIP user agent may need to
    know the charging information about a specific interaction with the server. This
    document defines the BIP (Billing Information Protocol) that can be used as a
    standard way to share this charging information. BIP supports simple indication
    of charging information. The protocol defines a generic representation on the
    number of units charged, the charge incurred per unit etc. This will be useful
    for implementing services like advice of charge. The protocol is targeted for
    VoIP usages, however any generic client-server interaction can use this protocol.</p>"
