abstract:
- content: "<p>There is no requirement for identities asserted by a UA in a SIP message
    to be anything other than the user's desired alias. A Network Asserted Identity
    is an identity initially derived by a SIP network intermediary as a result of
    an authentication process. This draft describes short term requirements for the
    exchange of Network Asserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected
    trusted nodes and to User Agents securely connected to such networks.</p>"
