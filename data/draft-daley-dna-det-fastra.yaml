abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbour Discovery forces routers responding to Router Solicitations
    to delay a random interval of 0-500 ms in order to prevent contention and bandwidth
    utilization by multiple responding routers. Routers receiving solicitations may
    need to quickly send responding Router Advertisements faster than allowed in IPv6
    Neighbour Discovery.</p>"
