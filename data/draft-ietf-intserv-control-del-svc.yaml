abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the network element behavior required to deliver
    Controlled Delay service in the Internet. Controlled delay service provides three
    levels of delay control; network elements, when overloaded, are required to control
    delay by denying service requests. However, there are no quantitative assurances
    about the absolute level of delay provided. The controlled delay service is designed
    for service-adaptive and delay-adaptive applications; i.e., applications that
    are prepared to dynamically adapt to changing packet transmission delays and to
    dynamically change the level of packet delivery delay control they request from
    the network when their current level of service is not adequate. The controlled
    delay service imposes relatively minimal requirements on network components that
    implement it, and is intended to be usable in situations ranging from small centrally
    managed private IP networks to the global Internet. This specification follows
    the service specification template described in [1].</p>"
