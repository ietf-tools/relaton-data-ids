abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a backward-compatible optimization for the
    Database Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. In this optimization, a router
    does not list a Link State Advertisement (LSA) in Database Description packets
    sent to a neighbor, if the same or a more recent instance of the LSA was listed
    in a Database Description packet already received from the neighbor. This optimization
    reduces Database Description overhead by about 50% in large networks. This optimization
    does not affect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary information from
    Database Description packets. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
