abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a Wireless Channel Model Based rate control
    scheme for improving the behavior of real time multimedia streams with TFRC [2]
    in wireless-wired heterogeneous networks. Based on wireless channel characteristics,
    the method can first identify the level of packet losses of two different types
    by sending large and small packets alternately, then adopt different adaptive
    rate control strategies to increase the network throughput and decrease congestion
    packet loss rate, to improve transmission quality of real-time multimedia stream.
    The proposed method is compared with previously reported algorithms [3-4] by simulation.
    It is shown from the simulation results in different network topology environments,
    the performance the proposed algorithm is better than existing algorithms in the
    aspects of network bandwidth utilization and congestion packet loss control. Parts
    of this method published in the IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference
    (WCNC2007) and in a pending China patent (access number: CN101686100).</p>"
