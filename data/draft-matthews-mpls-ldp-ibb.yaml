abstract:
- content: "<p>This contribution proposes modifications to the LDP and CR-LDP protocols
    that allow an LDP or CR-LDP session to be reestablished using a new TCP connection
    if the old TCP connection goes down unexpectedly. It also proposes that, in certain
    situations, an LSR continue to use the label bindings associated with a session
    for a short time after the session goes down, to allow forwarding to continue
    uninterrupted while the two peer LSRs attempt to reestablish the session. These
    modifications allow an LSR to easily implement hitless software upgrades and hitless
    activity switches.</p>"
