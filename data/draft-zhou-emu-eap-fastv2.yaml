abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    based Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST) protocol version
    2. EAP-FAST is an EAP method that enables secure communication between a peer
    and a server by using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually
    authenticated tunnel. Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used
    to convey authentication related data between the EAP peer and the EAP server.</p>"
