abstract:
- content: "<p>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the
    ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss and one-way
    and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel
    throughput. This capability, in addition, provides operators with greater visibility
    into the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning,
    troubleshooting, and evaluation. This document specifies protocol mechanisms to
    enable the efficient and accurate measurement of these performance metrics in
    MPLS networks.</p>"
