abstract:
- content: "<p>It is highly desired, in several cases, to take into account Traffic
    Engineering (TE) node capabilities during Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) selection,
    such as, for instance, the capability to act as a branch Label Switching Router
    (LSR) of a Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) LSP. This requires advertising these capabilities
    within the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP). For that purpose, this document specifies
    Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
    traffic engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane and data
    plane traffic engineering node capabilities. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
