abstract:
- content: "<p>There are benchmarking methodologies addressing the performance of
    network interconnect devices which are IPv4 or IPv6-capable. However, the IPv6
    transition technologies are outside of their scope. This document provides complementary
    guidelines for evaluating the performance of IPv6 transition technologies. The
    methodology also includes a tentative metric for benchmarking scalability.</p>"
