abstract:
- content: "<p>A new type of key is defined to address the problems of performance
    in large delegeted zones and issues of liability of registrars with regards to
    the storing of public keys belonging to zone cuts. This new key type also brings
    DNSSEC more in line with the DNS treatment of zone cuts and speeds recovery in
    handling key exposure. The new type of key is a referral record that is stored,
    signed, at the parent zone's place for the delegation point. A resolver receiving
    this record is being informed that there are genuine public keys at the child's
    authoritative name servers. The parent no longer needs to store the child's public
    keys locally.</p>"
