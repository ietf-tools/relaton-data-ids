abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new options for Broadcast and Multicast Service
    controller discovery in an IP network. Broadcast service is being developed for
    3G wireless networks. Users of the service interact with a controller in the network
    to derive informations that are required to receive broadcast service. Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol can be used to configure the controller IPv4 addresses
    or fully qualified domain names in the user's devices. This document defines the
    related options and option codes.</p>"
