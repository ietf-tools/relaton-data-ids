abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol.
    Web-related technologies are advancing and number of Web- based systems are increasing.
    Management systems that adopt Web- related technologies or that have browser-based
    management interface are getting common. It is natural to expect that there is
    a standard network operation and management protocol to be used over HTTP. Currently,
    however, there are few efforts in this area. Although NETCONF[RFC6241] once defined
    itself to be sent over SOAP/ HTTPS[RFC4743], supposedly due to unfamiliarity to
    SOAP or lack of bi-directional capability, such efforts aren't successful enough[I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc4743-rfc4744-to-historic].
    But now, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP equipped with bi-directional capability,
    is available[RFC6455]. This memo describes how NETCONF should be treated over
    WebSocket protocol.</p>"
