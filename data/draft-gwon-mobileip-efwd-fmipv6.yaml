abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces a low latency and low loss handover protocol that
    enhances the performance of forwarding from previous care-of address for Mobile
    IPv6, namely eFWD. The eFWD allows a mobile node to control and initiate creation
    of a bi-directional tunnel between the old and the new access routers subsequent
    to link layer handover. The eFWD handover reduces IP handover latency by eliminating
    new care-of address acquisition time and by identifying new access router information
    in advance utilizing Candidate Access Router Information Discovery (CARID) process
    detailed in this memo. The eFWD protocol removes extra burden on link layer by
    eliminating any requirement on pre-triggers.</p>"
