abstract:
- content: "<p>Many applications require the ability to send cryptographically secured
    messages. While the IETF has defined a number of formats for such messages (e.g.
    CMS) those formats use encodings which are not congenial for Web applications.
    This document describes a new cryptographic message format which is based on JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) and thus is easy for Web applications to generate and parse.</p>"
