abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper focuses upon the simplification of the presentation for
    Defining the New Schematic of what was called the IPv7 and IPv8 IP Protocol Specifications.
    Which is accomplished by first, Renaming these Protocols to 'IPt1' and 'IPt2',
    where the 't' represents 'Tele-Communications-Specification'. And second, by eliminating
    either all, or most of the extraneous information, which is not essential (at
    least not anymore) for understanding the overall Schematic Structure, nor the
    benefits, these Protocol Specifications actually represent. Which is further emphasized
    with a comparison, that uses The New and the Modern Binary Systems. Where is it
    shown that an increase in efficiency still exist, while the Number of IP Addresses
    remains Astronomically Large in both cases. In other words, the 'IPt1' and 'IPt2'
    IP Specifications represents a format, which is nothing more than a 'Telephone
    Number Implementation' that can be used as the primary IP Addressing format in
    any Telecommunications System, regardless of the choice for the Method in Binary
    Enumeration. Which means, in essence, this a Telecommunications Protocol that
    is essentially the 'Computer's Telephone Number'.</p>"
