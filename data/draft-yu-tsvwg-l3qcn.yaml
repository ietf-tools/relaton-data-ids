abstract:
- content: "<p>The more demands for the lossless and low latency network in the modern
    datacenter appear because the proliferation of demanding applications. Some congestion
    control schemes such as CN, PFC, ETS which is introduced by IEEE 802.1 focus on
    the L2 network domain. While current TCP/IP stacks can't meet these requirement
    on L3 or above networks. This draft introduces the L3QCN(Layer 3 Quantized Congestion
    Notification), an end to end congestion control scheme which adopt QCN and DCQCN
    on L2 network. It specifies protocols, procedures, and managed objects to support
    congestion control on the datacenter network.</p>"
