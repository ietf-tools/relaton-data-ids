    Internet. It defines an XML format for messages that are transfered between clients

    by the server, along with the parameters to use in the invocation, or the result
    of an invocation. Procedure parameters and results can be scalars, numbers, strings,
    dates, etc.; they can also be complex record and list structures. This document
    specifies a how to use the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) to transfer
    messages encoded in the XML-RPC format between clients and servers. This memo
