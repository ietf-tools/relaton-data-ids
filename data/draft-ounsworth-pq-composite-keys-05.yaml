abstract:
- content: <p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
    of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor the new incoming
    algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for the required data lifetimes.
    The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptalanysis,
    while the incoming post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
    mathematics as well as hardware and software implementations that have not had
    sufficient maturing time to rule out classical cryptanalytic attacks and implementation
    bugs. Cautious implementers may wish to layer cryptographic algorithms such that
    an attacker would need to break all of them in order to compromise the data being
    protected using either a Post-Quantum / Traditional Hybrid, Post-Quantum / Post-Quantum
    Hybrid, or combinations thereof. This document, and its companions, defines a
    specific instantiation of hybrid paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic
    algorithms are combined to form a single key, signature, or key encapsulation
    mechanism (KEM) such that they can be treated as a single atomic object at the
    protocol level. This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey and CompositePrivateKey,
    which are sequences of the respective structure for each component algorithm.
    Explicit pairings of algorithms are defined which should meet most Internet needs.
    This document is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents that define
    the structure and semantics of composite signatures and encryption, such as [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs]
    and [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-kem].</p>
