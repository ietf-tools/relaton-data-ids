abstract:
- content: "<p>When using a TURN relay, ICE connectivity checks require an explicit
    permission or channel binding to be established for each peer address to be checked.
    This requires the answerer to send its candidate addresses to the offerer via
    the rendezvous server, which can impose a latency penalty when the rendezvous
    server is centrally located. This document defines a new type of TURN permission
    that will allow any ICE connectivity check message that contains the offerer's
    ufrag value to be accepted on a relay address for delivery over the associated
    TURN tunnel.</p>"
