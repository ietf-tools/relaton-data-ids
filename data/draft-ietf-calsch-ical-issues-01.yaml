- content: "<p>This document is an IETF CALSCH working group document. The document
    is used as a tool for recording issues and their resolution with mailing list
    discussions. This Issues Document is intended to track the resolution of issues
    related to the 'Core Object Specification' deliverable. The most current version
    of this document can be found on the IETF CALSCH Working Group document archive
    at http://www.imc.org. Issues within this document are classified as either being
    OPEN or RESOLVED. Additionally, an issue may be found to no longer be a concern
    and may be classified as WITHDRAWN. Issues falling into each of these categories
    are listed in a separate section. An issue is documented with a short summary
    title, a brief description, and a list of identified alternatives. A resolved
    issue will also include a description of the resolution and the date/venue that
    the resolution was reached. Distribution of this document is unlimited.</p>"
