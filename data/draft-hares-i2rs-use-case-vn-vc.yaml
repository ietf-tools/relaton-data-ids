abstract:
- content: "<p>Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and abstract
    the network in order to present virtual or abstract resources to third-party applications
    running in software. Applications can utilize a programmable interface to receive
    these virtual or abstract resource descriptions in a form that allows monitoring
    or manipulation of resources within the network. The Interface to the Routing
    System (I2RS) provides an interface directly to the routing System to monitor
    best paths to any destination or change routes in the routing information base
    (RIB) or MPLS Label Information Base (LIB). The I2RS interfaces may be combined
    with other interfaces to the forwarding plane (ForCES (RFC3746)), device configuration
    (NETCONF), or mid-level/peer-to-peer (ALTO, draft-ietf- alto-protocol) system
    to create these virtual pathways. This document outlines how SDN networks can
    use the I2RS interface to implement an automated set of network services for the
    Virtual Connection on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD). These
    systems provide service routing a better way to create paths within a hub and
    spoke environment, and provide service routing the ability to create pathways
    based on service.</p>"
