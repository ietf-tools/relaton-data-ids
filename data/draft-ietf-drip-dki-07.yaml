abstract:
- content: "<p>The DRIP Entity Tag (DET) public Key Infrastructure (DKI) is a specific
    variant of classic Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) where the organization is
    around the DET, in place of X.520 Distinguished Names. Further, the DKI uses DRIP
    Endorsements in place of X.509 certificates for establishing trust within the
    DKI. There are two X.509 profiles for shadow PKI behind the DKI, with many of
    their X.509 fields mirroring content in the DRIP Endorsements. These PKIs can
    at times be used where X.509 is expected and non- constrained communication links
    are available that can handle their larger size. It is recommended that a DRIP
    deployment implement both of these along side the Endorsement trees. C509 (CBOR)
    encoding of all X.509 certificates are also provided as an alternative for where
    there are gains in reduced object size.</p>"
