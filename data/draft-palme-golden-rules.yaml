abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the following rules, which to some extend can be
    regarded as the golden rules of IETF, even though there are exceptions when these
    rules should not be adhered to. - Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative
    in what you send - Do not munge forwarded data - Modify as late as possible -
    Cause no harm - Leave nothing undefined - Keep it simple, stupid - No voting,
    rough consensus - Plain ASCII text is enough</p>"
