abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies transfer protocols for instant messages and
    presence information. The Presence Information Transfer Protocol (PITP) allows
    clients to set presence information for presentities they control and to request
    presence information from other presentities. The Instant Message Transfer Protocol
    (IMTP) allows clients to send and receive instant messages. Both protocols can
    also be used to relay instant message and presence requests between servers as
    necessary. These protocols are specified in the same document because they have
    very similar structure. However, they are two logically separate protocols. Sections
    specific to one or the other protocol will be recognizeable by a leading 'PITP'
    or 'IMTP'.</p>"
