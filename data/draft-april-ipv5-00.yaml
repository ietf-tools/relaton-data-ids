abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite IPv6 was developed to replace IPv4, the transition process
    did not and will not ramp up as expected. Major reason for stalled deployment
    is non-technical, but historical knowledge as well as established processes. The
    missing part between IPv4 and IPv6 is designed to help the migration efforts by
    addressing the non- technical needs for a smooth transition.</p>"
