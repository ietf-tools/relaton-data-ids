abstract:
- content: "<p>The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local
    MAC (medium access control), which has been described in [RFC5415].There are many
    functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that have not yet been clearly defined whether
    they belong to either the AP (Access Point) or the AC (Access Controller)in the
    Split and Local modes. Because different vendors have their own definition of
    these two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC layer functions continue
    to be mapped differently to either the AP or AC. If there is no clear definition
    of split MAC and local MAC, then operators will not only need to perform vendor
    specific configurations in their network but will continue to experience difficulty
    in interoperating APs and ACs from different vendors.</p>"
