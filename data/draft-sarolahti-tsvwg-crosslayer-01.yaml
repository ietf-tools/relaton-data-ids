abstract:
- content: "<p>Several types of explicit cross-layer communication schemes have been
    proposed to enhance the transport protocol performance. However, various challenges
    with such schemes have been identified, for example concerning the interactions
    with the middleboxes and tunnels in the network. This document discusses different
    types of explicit cross-layer notification mechanisms that have been proposed
    to enhance end-to-end transport performance. We analyze the different mechanisms
    using a taxonomy based on what kind of network interactions they require, and
    discuss the benefits and disadvantages different approaches have. The objective
    is to get a common understanding of the possibilities and challenges with these
    mechanisms, with pointers to past discussions on this topic, and to describe the
    possible next steps towards removing barriers from explicit cross-layer communication
    in future protocols.</p>"
