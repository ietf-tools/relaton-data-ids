abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of location presence. Presence is defined
    as the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the
    network. Presence data is general information about the state of a user like "on-line"
    and "off-line". Location presence extends conventional presence by taking the
    physical location of a user into account. Location presence is information about
    the geographical position of a user. Subscriptions and notifications of location
    presence are supported by defining an event package within the general SIP event
    notification framework. This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence
    Profile (CPP) framework.</p>
