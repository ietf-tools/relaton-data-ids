abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a structured framework for orchestrating, managing,
    and monitoring In-Network Computing Functions (ICFs) in Cooperative Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (C-ITS). For example, in the context of Vehicle-to-Everything
    (V2X) communications, efficient management of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications
    and their integration with C-ITS can greatly benefit from in-network computing.
    By leveraging ICFs, it becomes possible to optimize real- time communication,
    streamline traffic management, and enhance data processing and security services
    at the network edge.</p>"
