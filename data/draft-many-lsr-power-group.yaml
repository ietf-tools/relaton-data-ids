abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces Power Groups. A Power Group is a hierarchical
    abstraction of power consumed by hardware components. In IS-IS, interfaces can
    reference the Power Group to which they belong. Therefore, Power Groups provide
    a method of organizing interfaces into groups by power characteristics. The TE
    path placement algorithm can use Power Group membership information to implement
    TE policy. Power Group information is particularly useful when implementing TE
    policies that support power- savings and sustainability.</p>"
