abstract:
- content: "<p>In mobile IPv6 networks, a mobile node must register its new care of
    address with its home agent after changing its attachment point, so that it can
    maintain connectivity with peers. In the deployment of MIPv6, there may be multiple
    home agents for load balancing and/or reliability. In the case of load balancing,
    some mobile nodes may register their care of addresses with one home agent, and
    other mobile nodes may register their care of addresses with other home agents.
    Some applications may need to query the MIPv6 service status of a mobile node
    from home agents, such as the care of address, the life time of binding, or other
    information associated with mobile node that is stored on home agents. In order
    to satisfy this requirement, the first step is to locate which home agent the
    mobile node belongs to, that is to say to confirm which home agent to query. This
    document describes a protocol which can be used to locate the home agent that
    a mobile node belongs to.</p>"
