abstract:
- content: "<p>Optical networks which support a large number of emerging applications,
    such as 5G, Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of things, autonomous driving,
    etc., play an increasingly important role in the current world. All the time spectrum
    resources in optical networks have been treated equally. All spectrum resources
    form a resource pool which is allocated to applications bit by bit until it is
    all used up. Although this pattern reduces the complexity of resource maintenance,
    it has poor flexibility and high operation complexity for different types of applications.
    This draft proposes a framework of centralized control and distributed function
    slicing for fast connection establishment and fault recovery in optical networks.
    The proposed framework divides all spectrum resources into four functional areas,
    i.e., optical channel area, fault recovery area, resource pool area, and the reserved
    functional area. A functional area is responsible for a specific network function.
    This framework improves the flexibility of optical networks and can achieve fast
    connection establishment and fault recovery for the request with a highest service
    level.</p>"
