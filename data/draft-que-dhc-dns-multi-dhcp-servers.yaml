abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-dhc-addr-registration] specifies how a host register its
    self-generated addresses in DNS through DHCPv6 server. [RFC3315] allows multiple
    DHCPv6 servers working in an administrative domain. There exists a scenario that
    the client may register its addresses in multiple servers for some reasons such
    as higher availability and etc. This document defines a mechanism to ensure the
    multiple servers could work properly during updating DNS.</p>"
