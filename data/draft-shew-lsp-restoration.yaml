abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for fast detection of MPLS LSP
    failure when a link fails and scales to all LSPs affected by the failure. Fast
    detection enables ingress LERs to quickly recover onto backup LSPs. A performance
    improvement in the reliability of LSPs is expected. The mechanism described relies
    on a node and network architecture that integrates L1/L2/L3 technology.</p>"
