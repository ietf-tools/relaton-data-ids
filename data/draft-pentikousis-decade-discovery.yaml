abstract:
- content: "<p>A DECADE system must provide discovery mechanisms which enable the
    automatic configuration of DECADE clients with all information necessary to contact
    appropriate DECADE servers in the network. Typically, this configuration information
    would include the domain name or IP address of each DECADE server that should
    be considered by the client. Ideally, a DECADE discovery mechanism should capitalize
    upon existing Internet protocols, such as DHCP, which is widely deployed today.
    This document discusses DECADE server discovery and, as a first step towards automatic
    discovery, specifies how a DECADE client can obtain server location information
    using DHCP. To this end, it defines two DHCPv6 options which can be used to automatically
    provision the domain name or IP address of suitable servers in a DECADE system.</p>"
