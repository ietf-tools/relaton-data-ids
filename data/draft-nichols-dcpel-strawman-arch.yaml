abstract:
- content: "<p>Diffserv (RFC 2474, 2475, and 3086) made explicit that IP QoS can be
    separated into the differentiated treatment given to packets in the forwarding
    path and the task of configuring these forwarding path components to allocate
    QoS according to policy and availability. The IETF Diffserv WG described the forwarding
    path architecture in detail and specified some specific forwarding path elements.
    This draft attempts a similar approach of specifying the elements of a diffserv
    control plane, gives a general architecture and example solution that fits into
    this architecture, and lays out some issues. An example of a diffserv control
    plane architecture is presented, derived from the control plane described in RFC2638,
    and an example implementation of that approach is briefly described. The authors
    hope to stimulate a discussion of the architectural model and its elements and
    to elicit more example solutions that may fit, change, or extend the model. A
    control plane must be configurable, secure, and monitorable. The authors believe
    the operations and management issues of a diffserv control plane must be made
    explicit and the approach to solving them properly constrained. Resolving operational
    and management issues is key to moving to availability of IP QoS. A pdf version
    of this document is available at: www.pollere.com at Resources: Current Work.</p>"
