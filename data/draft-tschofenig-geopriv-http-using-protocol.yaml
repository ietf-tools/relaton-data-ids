abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach to to use Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP) over Transport Layer Protocol (TLS) to transport Presence Information Data
    Format Location Objects (PIDF-LO) (see RFC 4119). It is a GEOPRIV using protocol
    as described in Section 5.2 or RFC 3693 to resolve an identifier, which denotes
    a reference, to a PIDF-LO. The document assumes that the HTTP client possesses
    the reference that is obtained using a mechanism that are outside the scope of
    this document and conveys it to the HTTP server in order to retrieve a PIDF-LO
    in a response.</p>"
