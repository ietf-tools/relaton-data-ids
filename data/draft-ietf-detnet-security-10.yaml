abstract:
- content: "<p>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees
    to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency.
    As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in addition to the best practice security
    measures taken for any mission-critical network, additional security measures
    may be needed whose purpose is exclusively to secure the intended operation of
    these novel service properties. Designers of DetNet components (such as routers)
    that provide these unique DetNet properties have the responsibility to uphold
    certain security-related properties that can be assumed by DetNet system- level
    designers. For example, the assumption that network traffic associated with a
    given flow can never affect traffic associated with a different flow is only true
    if the underlying components make it so. This document addresses DetNet-specific
    security considerations from the perspective of both the DetNet component designer
    and the DetNet system-level designer. It is assumed that both classes of reader
    are already familiar with network security best practices for the data plane technologies
    underlying a given DetNet implementation. Component-level considerations include
    isolation of data flows from each other, ingress filtering, and detection and
    reporting of packet arrival time violations. System-level considerations include
    a threat model and a taxonomy of relevant attacks, including their potential impacts
    and mitigations. A given DetNet may require securing only certain aspects of DetNet
    performance, for example extremely low data loss rates but not necessarily bounded
    latency. Therefore this document provides an association of threats against various
    use cases by industry, and also against the individual service properties as defined
    in the DetNet Use Cases. This document also addresses common DetNet security considerations
    related to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be identified
    as supported by DetNet), thereby complementing the Security Considerations sections
    of the various DetNet Data Plane (and other) DetNet documents.</p>"
