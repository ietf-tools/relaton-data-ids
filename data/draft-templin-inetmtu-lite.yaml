abstract:
- content: "<p>The nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the Internet has become
    1500 bytes, but existing IP/*/IPv4 tunneling mechanisms impose an encapsulation
    overhead that can reduce the effective path MTU to smaller values. Additionally,
    existing IP/*/IPv4 tunneling mechanisms are limited in their ability to discover
    and utilize larger MTUs. This document specifies minimal mechanisms for conveying
    packets over IP/*/IPv4 tunnels that address these issues.</p>"
