abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an application programming interface (SGCI)
    and a corresponding protocol (SGCP) for controlling Voice over IP (VoIP) Gateways
    from external call control elements. The SGCP assumes a call control architecture
    where the call control 'intelligence' is outside the gateways and handled by external
    call control elements. The document is structured in 5 main sections: * The introduction
    presents the basic assumptions and the relation to other protocols such as H.323,
    RTSP, SAP or SIP. * The interface section presents a conceptual overview of the
    SGCP, presenting the naming conventions, the usage of the session description
    protocol SDP, and the five procedurs that compose SGCP: Notifications Request,
    Notification, Create Connection, Modify Con- nection and Delete Connection. *
    The protocol description section presents the SGCP encodings, which are based
    on simple text formats, and the transmission procedure over UDP. * The security
    section presents the security requirement of SGCP, and its usage of IP security
    services (IPSEC). * An example section presents two detailed examples of call
    set up procedures using SGCP. * The description of the changes between version
    1.0 and version 1.1</p>"
