abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses. It describes three HTTP headers,
    Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which carry state information between participating
    origin servers and user agents. The method described here differs from both Netscape's
    Cookie proposal [Netscape], and [RFC2965], but it can, provided some requirements
    are met, interoperate with HTTP/1.1 user agents that use Netscape's method. (See
    the HISTORICAL section.) This document defines new rules for how cookies can be
    shared between servers within a domain. These new rules are intended to address
    security and privacy concerns that are difficult to counter for clients implementing
    Netscape's proposed rules or the rules specified by RFC 2965. This document reflects
    implementation experience with RFC 2965 and obsoletes it.</p>"
