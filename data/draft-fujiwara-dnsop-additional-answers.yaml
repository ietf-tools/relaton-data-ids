abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes to document the ability to provide multiple
    answers in single DNS response. For example, authoritative servers may add a NSEC
    resource record or A/AAAA resource records of the query name. This is especially
    useful as, in many cases, the entity making the request has no a priori knowledge
    of what other questions it will need to ask. It is already possible (an authoritative
    server MAY already sends what it wants in the additional section). This document
    does not propose any protocol changes, just explanations of an already acceptable
    practice.</p>"
