abstract:
- content: "<p>A communication network includes an access network element that delivers
    data to/from the user and an associated core network element providing connectivity
    with the application servers. Multiconnectivity scenarios are common where a device
    can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication networks based on different
    technology implementations and network architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. A smart
    combination and selection of access and core network paths that can dynamically
    adapt to changing network conditions can improve quality of experience for a user
    in a multiconnectivity scenario and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.
    This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles.
    It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a multi access management
    services framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination of
    uplink and downlink access and core network paths, ensuring better network efficiency
    and enhanced application performance.</p>"
