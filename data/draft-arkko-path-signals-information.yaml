abstract:
- content: "<p>Path signals are messages seen by on-path elements examining transport
    protocols. Current preference for good protocol design indicates desire for constructing
    explict rather than implicit signals to carry information. For instance, the ability
    of various middleboxes to read TCP messaging was an implicit signal that lead
    to difficulties in evolving the TCP protocol without breaking connectivity through
    some of those middleboxes. This document discusses the types of information that
    could be passed in these path signals, and provides some advice on what types
    of information might be provided in a beneficial manner, and which information
    might be less likely to be revealed or used by applications or networks.</p>"
