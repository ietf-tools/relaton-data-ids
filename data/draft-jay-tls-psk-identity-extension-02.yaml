abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Key Exchange Mechanism is primarily used
    in constrained environments where resource intensive Asymmetric Cryptography cannot
    be used. In the Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, constrained devices are
    commonly used for collecting data via sensors for use in home automation, smart
    energy etc. In this context, DTLS is being considered as the primary protocol
    for communication security at the application layer and in some cases, it is also
    being considered for network access authentication. This document provides a specification
    for a new extension for Optimizing DTLS and TLS Handshake when the Pre-Shared
    Key (PSK) based Key Exchange is used. This extension is aimed at reducing the
    number of messages exchanged and the RTT of the TLS &amp; DTLS Handshakes.</p>"
