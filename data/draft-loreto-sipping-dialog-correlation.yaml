abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new header field for use with SIP. The Same-
    Session header field is used to logically correlate an existing SIP dialog with
    a new SIP dialog when the media sessions established by both dialogs can be considered
    a single logical session. This mechanism can be used to share the user interface
    and other resources between all the media streams from both sessions.</p>"
