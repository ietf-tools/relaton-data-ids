abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability and automation
    by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2 and the related
    Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) version 2 and the HTTP Transfer for
    the Certificate Management Protocol. It specifies a subset of CMP and CRMF focusing
    on typical uses cases relevant for managing certificates of devices in many industrial
    and IoT scenarios. To limit the overhead of certificate management for more constrained
    devices only the most crucial types of transactions are specified as mandatory.
    To foster interoperability also in more complex scenarios, other types of transactions
    are specified as recommended or optional.</p>"
