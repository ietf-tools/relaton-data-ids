abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter of Things (DoT) protocol is intended to provide a real-
    time metering framework for IoT applications in resource-constraint gateways.
    Respecting resource capacity constraints on edge devices establishes a firm requirement
    for a lightweight protocol in support of fine-grained telemetry of IoT deployment
    units. Such metering capability is needed when lack of resources among competing
    applications dictates our schedule and credit allocation. In response to these
    findings, the authors offer the DoT protocol that can be incorporated to implement
    real-time metering of IoT services for prepaid subscribers as well as Pay-per-use
    economic models. The DoT employs mechanisms to handle the composite application
    resource usage units consumed/charged against a single user balance. Such charging
    methods come in two models of time-based and event-based patterns. The former
    is used for scenarios where the charged units are continuously consumed while
    the latter is typically used when units are implicit invocation events. The DoT-enabled
    platform performs a chained metering transaction on a graph of dependent IoT microservices,
    collects the emitted usage data, then generates billable artifacts from the chain
    of metering tokens. Finally it permits micropayments to take place in parallel.</p>"
