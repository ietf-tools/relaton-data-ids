abstract:
- content: "<p>The NFS (Network File System) version 4[rfc3530] (NFSv4) specifies
    a flavor of Access Control Lists (ACLs) that apply to file system objects. ACLs
    specify an access level for a number of entities. The NFSv4 ACLs model resembles
    that of Windows NT. A POSIX draft[posixacl] proposes another, more restrictive
    ACL model. Many systems implement this proposed standard. Differing in syntax,
    semantics and extensiveness, it is only feasible to create a correct representation
    for POSIX ACLs with NFSv4 ACLs. This does not hold for an attempt to represent
    arbitrary NFSv4 ACLs with POSIX ACLs.</p>"
