abstract:
- content: "<p>Use of Public key cryptography is becoming widespread on the Internet
    in such applications as electronic mail and IP Security (IPSEC). Currently, however,
    a common public key certificate infrastructure does not exist which is interoperable
    with other systems and ubiquitous. In light of this, we describe a protocol which
    may be used to exchange or retrieve certificates (essentially signed public keys)
    with or from another entity. The protocol may be used to request certificates
    from a directory/name server or from the entity who owns the certificate.</p>"
