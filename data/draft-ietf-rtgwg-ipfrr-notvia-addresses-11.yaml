abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents an illustrative framework for providing fast
    reroute in an IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding to "not-via"
    addresses. The general approach described here uses a single level of encapsulation
    and could be used to protect unicast, multicast, and LDP traffic against link,
    router, and shared risk group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.
    The mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of the general
    approach and do not constitute a protocol specification. The document represents
    a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication
    and is published as a document of record. Further work is needed before implementation
    or deployment.</p>
