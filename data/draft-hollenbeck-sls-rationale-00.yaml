abstract:
- content: "<p>Developing technology to support truly internationalized Internet identifiers
    is proving difficult within the framework of the existing Domain Name System (DNS).
    At the same time, the DNS continues to do an excellent job at serving its original
    mandate for providing efficient mappings between machine-readable labels and network
    resources. However, it is clear that the existing DNS cannot be transformed into
    a service that can handle the more human-oriented identification services it is
    now being asked to provide. This document describes the rationale for a directory
    layer above the existing DNS that can better solve these problems.</p>"
