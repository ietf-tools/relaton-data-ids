abstract:
- content: '<p>There appear to be some recent trends in the IETF, involving both published
    documents and proposals, to use Informational Documents to effectively update
    Standards Track ones, presenting documents as normative while avoiding the requirements
    for a higher level of community review and consensus and relationship tracking
    that would be required, in practice, for Standards Track updates RFC 4460, titled
    "Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Specification Errata and Issues"
    and RFC 8540, titled "Stream Control Transmission Protocol: Errata and Issues
    in RFC 4960", were published as Informational documents although their clear intent
    is to update, or posit alternatives to some of the provisions of, RFcs 2960 and
    4960 respectively. This critique suggests that it is undesirable for the IETF
    to publish documents of that type and form, explains the reasons, and identifies
    several alternatives.</p>'
