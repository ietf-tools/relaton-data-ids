abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet Draft describes a new Standards Action BGP community,
    LAST_RESORT. This community provides a simple and easily deployable solution to
    a certain class of BGP "wedgies". Initial deployment is expected to be achieved
    by voluntary use in the network operator community-at-large. Long-term adoption
    via software enforcement of the community, will improve global behavior, and simplify
    router configurations. The Standards Action range of communities (previously limited
    to the "well-known" communities) ensures that the expectation of (eventual) router
    support is reasonable.</p>
