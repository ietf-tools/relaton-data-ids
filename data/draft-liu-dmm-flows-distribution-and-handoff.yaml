abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has a normative description of the service flow management
    technology based on mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). It makes the upgrade of management model
    in MIPv6 from the entire node granularity to the single service flow granularity.
    It proposes a distributed mobility management solution, DMIPv6, which is compatible
    with MIPv6 and takes different mobility management strategies according to the
    Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service requirements of
    different service flows so as to achieve the service flow handoff and transmission
    path control. The standard also provides route optimization mechanism between
    the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't support mobile
    IPv6.</p>"
