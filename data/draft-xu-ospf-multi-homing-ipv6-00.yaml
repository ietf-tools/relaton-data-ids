abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, routing protocols make routing decisions solely based
    on destination IP addresses, packets towards the same destination will be delivered
    to the same next hop no matter where they come from. These protocols work well
    with simple networks that have only one egress router. However, in the multi-homing
    scenario, packets may be dropped if forwarded only based on destination addresses.
    This document defines enhancements to the OSPFv3 protocol that allow simple and
    flexible operations, with which packets will be routed towards the corresponding
    upstream ISPs based on both destination and source addresses.</p>"
