abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4.1 draft protocol to
    allow NFS clients to act as pNFS data servers towards other NFS clients. The intention
    is to reduce the load on the actual data servers by allowing some trusted clients
    to share the contents of their data caches with other clients.Keywords The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in [RFC2119].</p>
