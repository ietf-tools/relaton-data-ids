abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a great challenge in cabling deployment for an enterprise-
    scale data center. An error in wire-connection between switches could lead to
    a reduction in network throughout or unreachable for some routers within network
    in an even worse case. In addition, it is also a tough task to find and repair
    the error connection among numerous wires. A method to address this error in switch
    connection would save a great amount of time and cost in modern data center construction.
    Here, this draft introduces an approach for auto-assignment of IP addresses for
    wired switches, which allows data to be transmitted via a cable that is connecting
    two arbitrary interfaces from two switches.</p>"
