abstract:
- content: <p>Some Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) applications
    require the transport of cryptographic keying material; this document specifies
    a set of Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) providing native Diameter support of cryptographic
    key delivery. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in
    full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. This document may not
    be modified, and derivative works of it may not be created, except to format it
    for publication as an RFC or to translate it into languages other than English.

    its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute
    working documents as Internet- Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid
    for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
    documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
