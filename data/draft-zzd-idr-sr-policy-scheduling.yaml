abstract:
- content: "<p>Path scheduling is required in many network scenarios. For example,
    some links or nodes will be shut down in the tidal network when the traffic decreases,
    which may lead to the expiration of some routing paths. This document proposes
    extensions to BGP SR Policy to indicate the effective time and expiration time
    for routing paths to enable path scheduling.</p>"
