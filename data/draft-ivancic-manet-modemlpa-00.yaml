abstract:
- content: "<p>Nework devices and applications are increasingly connected to a variety
    of smart modems whose incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied over time
    to suit the channel characteristics. Such rate changes can result from use of
    adaptive coding and modulation. The link rate and conditions offered by the modem
    to connected devices therefore vary. In order for connected devices and applications
    to get the most out of the modem's link capacity, it is necessary for the applications
    and connected devices to condition traffic. Thus, they need some knowledge of
    the modem's link conditions. This document describes one simple method for a modem
    to advertise link rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages, and discusses
    alternative approaches to communicating this information. While the mechanism
    in this document is described in the context of a modem, it can also be broadly
    applied to other scenarios such as cryptographic devices.</p>"
