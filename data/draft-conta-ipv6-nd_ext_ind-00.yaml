abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism that can be seen as an extension to
    the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. It allows a node to solicit and be advertized an
    IPv6 address corresponding to a given link-layer address. Because the known parameter
    is the link layer address, the mechanism is called Inverse Neighbor Discovery.
    It specifically applies to Frame Relay nodes that may have a Data Link Connection
    Identifier (DLCI), the Frame Relay equivalent of a link-layer address, associated
    with an established Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC), but do not know the IPv6
    address of the node at the other end of the circuit. It may also apply to other
    networks with similar behavior.</p>"
