abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has a normative description of the service flows based
    on IPv6. It makes the upgrade of management model from the entire node granularity
    to the single service flow granularity, with the compatibility to the existing
    mobile IPv6. It shows a distributed, compatible with mobile IPv6 network layer
    mobility solution, which would take different mobility management strategies according
    to the Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service requirements
    of the different service flows so as to achieve the service flow granularity switching
    and transmission path control. And the standard will also provide route optimization
    mechanism between the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't
    support mobile IPv6, playing a role in promoting the development of new applications
    and business based on mobile IPv6.</p>"
