abstract:
- content: "<p>A dual-end recursive PCE-based computation procedure (DRPC) is proposed
    to compute shortest constrained inter-domain traffic engineering label switched
    paths based on BRPC in Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
    (GMPLS) networks. By recursively performing shortest path algorithm and transferring
    the segmental path computation result from both ends bi-directionally, they meet
    at one of the Middle PCEs, generating a directional shortest path graph into which
    the two shortest path trees are stitched together. Therefore, the end-to-end constrained
    inter- domain traffic engineering label switched path, even k shortest paths can
    be gained from the directional shortest path graph directly.</p>"
