abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF)
    is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest
    to intrusion detection and response systems, and to the management systems which
    may need to interact with them. The goals and requirements of the IDMEF are described
    in [2]. Two implementations of the IDMEF data format have been proposed: one using
    the Structure of Management Information (SMI) to describe a MIB, and the other
    using a Document Type Definition (DTD) to describe XML documents. Both representations
    appear to have their good and bad traits, and deciding between them is difficult.
    To arrive at an informed decision, the working group tasked the authors to identify
    and analyze the pros and cons of both approaches, and to present the results in
    the form of an Internet-Draft. The initial version of this draft was reviewed
    by the IDWG at the February, 2000 interim meeting where it was tentatively decided
    that the XML/DTD solution was best at fulfilling the IDWG requirements. This decision
    was finalized at the March, 2000 IETF IDWG meeting.</p>"
