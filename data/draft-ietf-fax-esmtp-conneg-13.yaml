abstract:
- content: "<p>A message originator sometimes sends content in a form the recipient
    cannot process or would prefer not to process a form of lower quality than is
    preferred. Such content needs to be converted to an acceptable form, with the
    same information or constrained information (e.g., changing from color to black
    and white). In a store-and-forward environment, it may be convenient to have this
    conversion performed by an intermediary. This specification integrates two ESMTP
    extensions and three MIME content header fields, which defines a cooperative service
    that permits authorized, accountable content form conversion by intermediaries.
