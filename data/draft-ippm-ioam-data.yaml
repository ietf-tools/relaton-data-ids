abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses
    a path between two points in the network. This document discusses the data fields
    and associated data types for in-situ OAM. In-situ OAM data fields can be embedded
    into a variety of transports such as NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, native IPv6
    (via extension header), or IPv4. In-situ OAM can be used to complement OAM mechanisms
    based on e.g. ICMP or other types of probe packets.</p>"
