abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions are used to advertise TE Link
    State Advertisements (LSAs) containing information about TE-enabled links. The
    only addresses belonging to a router that are advertised in TE LSAs are the local
    addresses corresponding to TE-enabled links, and the local address corresponding
    to the Router ID. In order to allow other routers in a network to compute Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) to a
    given router's local addresses, those addresses must also be advertised by OSPF
    TE. This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF TE to advertise a router's
    local addresses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
