abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an IP fast re-route mechanism that provides backup
    connectivity in the event of a link or router failure. In the absence of single
    points of failure and asymmetric costs, the mechanism provides complete protection
    against any single failure. If perfect repair is not possible, the identity of
    all the unprotected links and routers is known in advance. This IP Fast Reroute
    advanced method was invented in 2002 and draft (draft-bryant-ipfrr-tunnels-00.txt)
    describing it was submitted to the IETF in May 2004. It was one of the first methods
    of achieving full repair coverage in an IP Network, and as such the draft has
    been widely referenced in the academic literature. The authors DO NOT propose
    that this IPFRR method be implemented since better IPFRR advanced method capable
    of achieving full repair coverage have subsequently been invented.</p>"
