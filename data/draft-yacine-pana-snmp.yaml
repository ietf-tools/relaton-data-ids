abstract:
- content: "<p>The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) does not necessarily act as an
    Enforcement Point (EP) to prevent unauthorized access or usage of the network.
    When a PANA Client (PaC) successfully authenticates itself to the PAA, EP(s) (e.g.,
    access routers) will need to be suitably notified. The PANA working group mandates
    the use of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to deliver the authorization
    information to one or more EPs when the PAA is separated from EPs. The present
    document provides the necessary information and extensions needed to use SNMP
    as the PAA-2-EP protocol.</p>"
