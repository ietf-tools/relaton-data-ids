abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) telephony is increasing fast.
    VoIP's paradigm and the features it offers differ significantly from that of regular
    telephony, and, as a result, its monitoring requirements do so as well. This draft
    employs use cases to derive these requirements and introduces SIPFIX, an extension
    to IPFIX (IP Flow Information eXchange), that meets them.</p>"
