abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an autonomic mechanism for resource-based network
    services deployment and management, using the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol
    (GRASP) to dynamically exchange the information among the autonomic nodes. It
    supports the coordination and consistently operations within an autonomic network
    domain. This mechanism is generic for most, if not all, of kinds of network resources,
    although this document only defines the process of quality transmission service
    deployment and management. It can be easily extended to support network services
    deployment and management that is based on other types ofnetwork resources.</p>"
