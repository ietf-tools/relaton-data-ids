abstract:
- content: "<p>This document motivates the need for clarifications of client behavior
    in cases of HTTP redirect to a content delivery network (CDN) when the redirected
    object contains relative references. This document focuses on HTTP Adaptive Streaming
    (HAS) use cases, but it might be possible to generalize to other use cases. The
    goal of this document is to present the current status of things and to explore
    potential solutions.</p>"
