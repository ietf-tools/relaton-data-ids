abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is defined as a service over a
    provider managed IP or MPLS network which emulates a virtual private LAN segment.
    All customer sites in the VPLS appear to be on the same LAN regardless of their
    location. This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing networks using Virtual Private Lan Service (VPLS).</p>"
