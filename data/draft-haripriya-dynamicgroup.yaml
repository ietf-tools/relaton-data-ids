abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements, semantics, schema elements,
    and operations needed for a dynamic group feature in LDAP. A dynamic group is
    defined here as a group object with a membership list of distinguished names that
    is dynamically generated using LDAP search criteria. The dynamic membership list
    may then be interrogated by LDAP search and compare operations, and may also be
    used to find the groups that an object is a member of. This feature eliminates
    a huge amount of the administrative effort required today for maintaining group
    memberships and role-based operations in large enterprises.</p>"
