abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive
    resolver to use opportunistic encryption (that is, encryption with optional authentication)
    when communicating with authoritative servers. The motivating use case for this
    method is that more encryption on the Internet is better, and opportunistic encryption
    is better than no encryption at all. The method here is optional for both the
    recursive resolver and the authoritative server. Nothing in this method prevents
    use cases and methods that can use, or require, authenticated encryption.</p>"
