abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a list of operational security requirements for
    the infrastructure of large IP networks (such as routers and switches). The goals
    of this document are to serve as a collection of ideas for security features that
    would improve operational security and to assist consumers of network equipment
    in communicating their security requirements to vendors. The requirements in this
    document are NOT considered to be best current practice (BCP). Comments to:</p>"
