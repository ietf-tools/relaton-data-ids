abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurately detect network anomalies is very challenging for network
    operators in production networks. Good results require a lot of expertise and
    knowledge around both the implied network technologies and the specific service
    provided to consumers, apart from a proper monitoring infrastructure. In order
    to facilitate the detection of network anomalies, novel techniques are being introduced,
    including AI-based ones, with the promise of improving scalability and the hope
    to keep a high detection accuracy. To guarantee acceptable results, the process
    needs to be properly designed, adopting well-defined stages to accurately collect
    evidence of anomalies, validate their relevancy and improve the detection systems
    over time. This document describes the lifecycle process to iteratively improve
    network anomaly detection accurately. Three key stages are proposed, along with
    a YANG model specifying the required metadata for the network anomaly detection
    covering the different stages of the lifecycle.</p>"
