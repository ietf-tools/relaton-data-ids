abstract:
- content: "<p>While WebRTC has been very sucessful in a wide range of scenarios,
    its adoption in the broadcasting/streaming industry is lagging behind. Currently
    there is no standard protocol (like SIP or RTSP) designed for ingesting media
    into a streaming service using WebRTC and so content providers still rely heavily
    on protocols like RTMP for it. These protocols are much older than WebRTC and
    by default lack some important security and resilience features provided by WebRTC
    with minimal overhead and additional latency. The media codecs used for ingestion
    in older protocols tend to be limited and not negotiated. WebRTC includes support
    for negotiation of codecs, potentially alleviating transcoding on the ingest node
    (wich can introduce delay and degrade media quality). Server side transcoding
    that has traditionally been done to present multiple renditions in Adaptive Bit
    Rate Streaming (ABR) implementations can be replaced with simulcasting and SVC
    codecs that are well supported by WebRTC clients. In addition, WebRTC clients
    can adjust client- side encoding parameters based on RTCP feedback to maximize
    encoding quality. Encryption is mandatory in WebRTC, therefore secure transport
    of media is implicit. This document proposes a simple HTTP based protocol that
    will allow WebRTC based ingest of content into streaming servics and/or CDNs.</p>"
