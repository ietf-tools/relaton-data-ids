abstract:
- content: "<p>Users having trouble with the Internet are directed to contact their
    designated Network Service Center. The Network Service Center creates a Trouble
    Ticket which is registered with the Ticket Tracking System. The ticket is an agreement
    to obtain closure with the user. Network Service Centers can fix problems, track
    the work of others, or transfer responsibility for the ticket to other Network
    Service Centers using a formal hand-off procedure. Ticket hand-offs are coordinated
    by the Ticket Tracking System and ticket progress is monitored by the Ticket Support
    Centers. User complaints with the problem resolution process may be lodged with
    a Ticket Support Center, which will act on behalf of the user in resolving the
    problem.</p>"
