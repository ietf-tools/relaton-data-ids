- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to identify the protocols and applications
    that break with NAT enroute. The document also attempts to identify any known
    workarounds. This document attempts to capture as much information as possible,
    but is by no means a comprehensive coverage. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
