abstract:
- content: "<p>In light of the expiration of the primary RSA patent, it is proposed
    that the RSA algorithm replace the DSS and Diffie-Hellman as the MUST implement
    algorithms in the S/MIME profile. This draft will describe only the proposed changes
    to the S/MIME Version 3 Certificate Handling RFC [SMIMEV3CERT], and the rest of
    that RFC will remain identical.</p>"
