abstract:
- content: "<p>In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as also in IEEE Bridged Networks,
    the switches simply flood multicast traffic on all ports in the LAN by default.
    Multicast Snooping can be used to avoid the unnecessary flooding as defined in
    [MAGMA-SNOOP] and [PIM-SNOOP]. When the number of Pseudo Wires (PWs) and refresh
    messages increases dramatically, it is desirable to reduce the messages exchanged
    between VPLS PE routers to improve scalability. This document describes the procedures
    and recommendations for using LDP for distributing Multicast state information
    between VPLS PE routers.</p>"
