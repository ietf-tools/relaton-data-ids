abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), in RFC 5730, defines the
    use of authorization information to authorize a transfer. The authorization information
    is object-specific and has been defined in the EPP Domain Name Mapping, in RFC
    5731, and the EPP Contact Mapping, in RFC 5733, as password-based authorization
    information. Other authorization mechanisms can be used, but in practice the password-based
    authorization information has been used at the time of object create, managed
    with the object update, and used to authorize an object transfer request. What
    has not been fully considered is the security of the authorization information
    that includes the complexity of the authorization information, the time-to-live
    (TTL) of the authorization information, and where and how the authorization information
    is stored. This document defines an operational practice, using the EPP RFCs,
    that leverages the use of strong random authorization information values that
    are short-lived, that are not stored by the client, and that are stored using
    a cryptographic hash by the server to provide for secure authorization information
    used for transfers.</p>"
