abstract:
- content: "<p>The Lightweight Underlay Network Ad hoc Routing (LUNAR) Protocol is
    intended for use by mobile nodes in small size wireless ad hoc networks. LUNAR
    operates at layer 2.5. It emulates a single-hop IP subnet with unicast as well
    as broadcast communication primitives. DHCP and ARP messages are intercepted and
    serve as hooks for self- configuration of IP addresses as well as the mapping
    of IP addresses to the underlying layer 2.5 multihop routes.</p>"
