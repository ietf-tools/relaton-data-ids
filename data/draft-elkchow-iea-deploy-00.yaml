abstract:
- content: "<p>International Email Addresses (IEA) are far from the global reality.
    The current de-facto language of the Internet is English. Even today, many of
    the users of the Internet do not speak English as their primary language. The
    next billion users of the Internet are likely to be even less familiar with English.
    IEA is probably the first application needed in a truly internationalized Internet.
    The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) Working Group defined the RFCs to
    support internationalized email. The time may now finally have come to develop
    best practices and to discuss the deployment challenges for IEA.</p>"
