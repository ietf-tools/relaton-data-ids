abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS0) option
    that allows DNS clients and servers to signal support for DNS protocol capabilities.
    Clients and servers that support this option can take advantage of new DNS protocol
    features when completing a transaction, and by caching the set of capabilities
    advertised by a DNS server, a DNS client can utilize any mutually supported DNS
    protocol capability in subsequent queries.</p>"
