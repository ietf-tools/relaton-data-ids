abstract:
- content: "<p>The Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Network Programming framework
    enables a network operator or an application to specify a packet processing program
    by encoding a sequence of instructions in the IPv6 packet header. Following the
    SRv6 Network Programming concept, this document defines SRv6 based mechanisms
    for inter-layer network programming, which can help to integrate the packet network
    layer with its underlying layers efficiently. For inter-layer path programming,
    a new SRv6 behavior is defined for steering packets to underlay network connections.
    The applicability of this new SRv6 behavior in typical scenarios is illustrated.</p>"
