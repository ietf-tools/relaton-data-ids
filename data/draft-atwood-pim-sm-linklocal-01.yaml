abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes some additions to the specification of the Protocol
    Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) Protocol regarding security issues
    of its link-local messages. Although the new specifications for IPsec architecture
    (RFC 4301) and Authorization Header (RFC 4302) permit the use of anti-replay,
    they counsel against its use for multi-sender, multicast Security Associations.
    This makes PIM-SM vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attack. In this document,
    a new proposal is presented to protect PIM link-local messages while activating
    the anti-replay mechanism as well. This proposal builds on the new Security Association
    lookup method that has been specified in RFC 4301 and RFC 4302.</p>"
