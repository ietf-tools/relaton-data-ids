abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec/ESP secure every single IP packets exchanged between two nodes.
    This makes security transparent to the applications, as opposed to TLS or DTLS
    for example. IPsec/ESP has not widely been used to secure application because
    IPsec is implemented in the kernel space, and IPsec/ESP security rules are defined
    on the device -- similarly to firewall. In addition, IPsec/ESP introduces network
    overhead on an IP packet basis, as opposed as TLS/DTLS that introduces network
    overhead on an UDP or TCP segment basis. This mostly impacts devices that do not
    perform IP fragmentation. Such drawbacks are not anymore valid for IoT, and the
    IPsec/ESP may even better fits IoT usage and security requirements. IoT device
    are usually hardware dedicated for a given task or a given application which makes
    Kernel / user land split less significant. IoT devices send data that is most
    likely expected to fit in a single IP packet. Eventually, configuring IPsec/ESP
    security rules provides the ability to enforce the security of the device, as
    security is not handled on a per-application basis. Then the database structure
    of the IPsec/ ESP security policies perfectly match sleeping nodes. This document
    defines Diet-ESP that adapts IPsec/ESP for IoT. The goal of Diet-ESP is to reduce
    the size of the IPsec/ESP packet sent on the wire. As a result Diet-ESP is expected
    to compress traditional IPsec/ESP packet without impacting the security provided
    by IPsec/ESP.</p>"
