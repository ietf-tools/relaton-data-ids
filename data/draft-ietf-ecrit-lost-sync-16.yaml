abstract:
- content: "<p>The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based
    protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information
    to service URIs and service boundaries. In particular, it can be used to determine
    the location-appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services.
    The main data structure, the &lt;mapping&gt; element, used for encapsulating information
    about service boundaries is defined in the LoST protocol specification and circumscribes
    the region within which all locations map to the same service Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) or set of URIs for a given service. This document defines an
    XML protocol to exchange these mappings between two nodes. This mechanism is designed
    for the exchange of authoritative &lt;mapping&gt; elements between two entities.
    Exchanging cached &lt;mapping&gt; elements, i.e. non-authoritative elements, is
    possible but not envisioned. In any case, this document can also be used without
    the LoST protocol even though the format of the &lt;mapping&gt; element is re-used
    from the LoST specification.</p>"
