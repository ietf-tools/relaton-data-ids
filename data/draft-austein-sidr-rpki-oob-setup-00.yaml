abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of
    the RPKI provisioning and publication protocols between two parties. The protocol
    is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can be passed back and forth
    by any mutually agreeable secure means. This setup protocol is not part of the
    provisioning or publication protocol, rather, it is intended to simplify configuration
    of these protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging BPKI keying material.</p>"
