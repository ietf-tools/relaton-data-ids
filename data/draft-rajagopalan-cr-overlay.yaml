abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers an overlay model for constraint-based intra- domain
    routing and describes a mechanism for efficient update propagation that can be
    used as the basis for this model. As a specific example, the incorporation of
    a constraint-based routing overlay on the OSPF protocol is discussed.</p>"
