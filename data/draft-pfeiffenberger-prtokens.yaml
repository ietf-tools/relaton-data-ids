abstract:
- content: "<p>Fraud detection often relies on high-entropy signals that can also
    be used to track users across sites. Probabilistic Reveal Tokens (PRTs) attempt
    to balance the needs of fraud detection and tracking prevention by sampling at
    a rate that is too low for scaled cross- site tracking, but sufficient for fraud
    detection in aggregate scenarios. This document describes the PRT protocol, which
    allows browsers to reveal sensitive signals (e.g., IP address) on a per-site basis
    with provable probability p_reveal, while websites can use PRTs to measure traffic
    quality and update denylists.</p>"
