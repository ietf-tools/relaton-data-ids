abstract:
- content: "<p>To evolve towards automated network OAM (Operations, administration
    and management), the monitoring of control plane protocols is a fundamental necessity.
    In this document, a network monitoring protocol (NMP) is proposed to provision
    the running status information of control plane protocols, e.g., IGP (Interior
    Gateway Protocol) and other protocols. By collecting the protocol monitoring data
    and reporting it to the NMP monitoring server in real-time, NMP can facilitate
    network troubleshooting. In this document, NMP for IGP troubleshooting are illustrated
    to showcase the necessity of NMP. IS-IS is used as the demonstration protocol,
    and the case of OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and other control protocols will
    be elaborated in the future versions. The operations of NMP are described, and
    the NMP message types and message formats are defined in the document.</p>"
