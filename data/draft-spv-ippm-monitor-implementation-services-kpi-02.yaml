abstract:
- content: "<p>We are using a new method to calculate services KPIs and metrics in
    the network using TWAMP protocol. This draft outlines the implementation of the
    service KPIs and there use cases in the service plane in the network. The KPIs
    discussed in this draft include Service Latency and Application Liveliness detection.
    Service latency is defined as the time spent by the packet when it is injected
    in the service module or service card till the time, serviced packet is received
    back by the TWAMP server. TWAMP server records the timestamp of the packet when
    it is injected into the service module and then again record the timestamp when
    it receives the packet afer service is applied in the data plane. Application
    Liveliness detection means whether the application is up and running in the network.
    In case you want to monitor the http application or the dns server and verify
    if they are up and running, this method is applicable. The implementation can
    be used for liveliness detection of any service in the network.</p>"
