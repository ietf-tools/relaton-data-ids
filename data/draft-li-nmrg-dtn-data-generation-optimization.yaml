abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Twin Network (DTN) can be used as a secure and cost-effective
    environment for network operators to evaluate network performance in various what-if
    scenarios. Recently, AI models, especially neural networks, have been applied
    for DTN performance modeling. The quality of deep learning models mainly depends
    on two aspects: model architecture and data. This memo focuses on how to improve
    the model from the data perspective.</p>"
