abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose several extensions to improve the security
    and performance of MIP6 Return Routability test. Our proposal enables CN and MN
    to promptly and reliably detect the on-path attack and reduce the signaling overhead
    in a secure, efficient and back- compatible way. The core idea is to use hash
    chain to replace home test procedure in some circumstances and we carefully integrate
    hash chain into original MIP6 RR test without introducing new vulnerabilities.
    Although it does slightly increase the management cost of CN, we show that the
    extended RR test is more secure and more efficient than other approaches.</p>"
