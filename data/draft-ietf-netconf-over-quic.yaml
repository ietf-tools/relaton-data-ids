abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
    install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. NETCONF
    can be carried over various transports such as TCP, SSH or else. QUIC provides
    useful semantics for Network management and NETCONF in particular as a single
    connection can carry multiple requests over streams, enabling much better efficiency
    and performance for both peers. QUIC provides shorter handshake and includes TLS.
    QUIC is also more adaptable to more difficult environments such as those with
    long delays. This document describes how to use NETCONF over the QUIC transport
    protocol, named NETCONFoQUIC.</p>"
