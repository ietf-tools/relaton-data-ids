abstract:
- content: "<p>Since large-scale Internetworks such as the public Internet must continue
    to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is clear that Autonomous
    Systems (ASes) must avoid injecting excessive de-aggregated prefixes into the
    interdomain routing system and instead mitigate de-aggregation internally. This
    document describes an Interior Routing Overlay Network (IRON) architecture developed
    by Boeing that supports sustainable growth within AS-interior routing domains
    while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to the exterior routing
    system. In addition to routing scaling, IRON further addresses other important
    issues including mobility management, mobile networks, multihoming, traffic engineering,
    NAT traversal and security. While business considerations are an important determining
    factor for widespread adoption, they are out of scope for this document.</p>"
