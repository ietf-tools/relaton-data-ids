abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the concept of the SRLG-based logical ring configuration
    and recovery method using the ring-SRLG for the purpose of restoration in mesh
    networks. In this restoration architecture, backup paths can be easily established
    through the end-to-end path, which follows the logical ring configuration. It
    guarantees the establishment of backup path disjointed from the working path.
    We also propose the GMPLS signaling extension for the end-to-end restoration based
    on the SRLG-based logical ring configuration.</p>"
