abstract:
- content: "<p>The Content-MD5: header specified in RFC 1864 has not been widely deployed,
    though this would be highly desirable for a number of reasons. The author conjectures
    that this lack of usage is due at least in part to the requirement that only originating
    user agents may add a Content-MD5: header. This proposal updates RFC 1864 to remove
    that requirement, and defines the header Content-MD5-Origin: for use by relaying
    hosts to indicate the point at which a Content- MD5: header was added.</p>"
