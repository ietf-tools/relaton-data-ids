abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a supporting draft to draft-arumuganainar-rtgwg-DPS-
    Requirements-01. The DPS draft talks about high level architecture to implement
    dynamic path selection based on application. The DPS draft suggests the implementation
    to be done in three steps: 1) DPS Signaling: Here participating routers communicate
    with each other to exchange application related information 2) Profile Based Filter:
    This section describes how packets can be classified and filtered 3) DPS Routing
    Frame Work: This ensures that separated traffic remains separated through out
    the network While overall architecture is still valid, this draft suggests an
    enhancement to the DPS Signaling component. The currently implemented technique
    uses BGP for the signaling requirements. Whilst this is good for certain cases,
    applications that can be off loaded to the secondary link are pre-decided. It
    restricts behavior from responding to dynamic network conditions. For example,
    a network administrator would want to off load some of the non-critical applications
    over the secondary link, however when there is acute congestion within the network,
    they might want the router to behave aggressively by off loading more applications
    to the secondary circuit. Yet while doing so there should not be any asymmetric
    routing on the network. Since BGP is essentially a control plane protocol, it
    is not aware of what is happening on the network in the forwarding plane, hence
    there is a need to do the signaling in the forwarding plane. This drafts suggest
    one such mechanism. Here the idea is to exchange the Path Preference information
    at layer 4 level. Such signaling could happen during TCP connection establishment
    phase. When done this way, a decision can be taken for each of the session and
    hence making it more dynamic than the one that can achieved through BGP.</p>"
