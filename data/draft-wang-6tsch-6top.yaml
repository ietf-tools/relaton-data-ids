abstract:
- content: "<p>The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept
    of link-layer resources in LLNs. Nodes are synchronized and follow a schedule.
    A time slot in that schedule corresponds to an atomic link-layer resource, and
    can be allocated to any pair of neighbors in the network. This allows the schedule
    to be built to tightly match each node's bandwidth, latency and energy constraints,
    while ensuring collision-free communication. The [IEEE802154e] standard does not,
    however, present a mechanism to do so, as building and managing the schedule is
    out of the standard's scope. Routing layers such as the IETF IPv6 Routing Protocol
    for LLNs (RPL) provide a mechanism to route multipoint-to-point traffic (from
    devices inside the LLN towards a central control point) and point-to-multipoint
    traffic (from the central control point to the devices inside the LLN). Network
    layer overlays cannot be optimized and adapted to take advantage of the cell-based
    topology created by the underlying TSCH MAC layer as a missing set of functionalities
    need to be defined. This document describes the 6TSCH Operation Sublayer (6top)
    and the main commands it provides to upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS.
    The set of functionalities includes feedback metrics from cell states so network
    layers can take routing decisions, TSCH configuration and control procedures,
    and the support for centralized and decentralized scheduling policies. In addition,
    6top can be configured to enable packet switching at layer 2.5, analogous to GMPLS.
    Once a multi-hop track is defined, input cells can be mapped to output cells and
    packets can be relayed without the need of higher layer routing. 6top defines
    the operations so input cells and output cells can be mapped and the configuration
    maintained.</p>"
