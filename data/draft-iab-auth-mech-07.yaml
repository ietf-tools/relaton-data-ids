abstract:
- content: "<p>Authentication is a common security issue for the design of Internet
    protocols. A wide variety of authentication technologies are available. A common
    problem is knowing which technology to choose or which of a variety of essentially
    similar implementations of a given technique to choose. This memo provides a survey
    of available authentication mechanisms and guidance on selecting one for a given
    protocol.</p>"
