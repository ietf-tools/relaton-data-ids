abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
    Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications, such as field
    monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
    has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551],
    RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes
    for LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point.
    RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from one or more roots that act as
    sinks. As a result, a DAG is partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented
    DAGs (DODAGs), one DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing
    protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops and lack of a loop free DODAG local repair
    mechanism are two open issues to be addressed. This draft introduces an alternative
    rank and an Objective Function to eliminate DODAG loops in RPL. Based on the proposed
    rank and Objective Function, this draft introduces a loop free DODAG local repair
    mechanism.</p>"
