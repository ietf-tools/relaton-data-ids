abstract:
- content: "<p>This document assumes basic familiarity with CLNP, ES-IS, IS-IS, ARP,
    and IP. The design in this document attempts to minimize routing control traffic
    and manual configuration. The issues involve judicious use of CLNP addressing
    whenever possible, protocol differentiation (also sometimes called encapsulation)
    for coexistence with other protocols running over the NBMA, enabling ESs to find
    an active IS, enabling ISs to find each other, optimizing routes across NBMA (eliminating
    double-hopping across NBMA), and efficient and reliable distribution of LSPs (link
    state packets) across NBMA.</p>"
