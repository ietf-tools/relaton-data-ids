abstract:
- content: <p>The IP Mobility Protocol [RFC3344] enables a mobile node maintain IP
    connectivity when it changes its location. However, it is not enough to enable
    the node to maintain L2 connectivity between mobile node and Ethernet service
    provider in order to support Ethernet service transport. This document describes
    "Ethernet Service Transport" mobility option for mobile IPv4 that is intended
    to assist home agent tunnel Ethernet packets from the home link to the FA on the
    foreign link during the datagram delivery process.</p>
