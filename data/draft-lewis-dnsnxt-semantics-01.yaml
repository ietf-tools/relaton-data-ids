abstract:
- content: "<p>In 'Domain Name System Security Extensions' (RFC 2065) the NXT Resource
    Record (along with SIG RR and KEY RR) is introduced to allow for secure denial
    of existence of either a domain name or a RRSet belonging to an existing domain
    name. The set of NXT records within a zone create a virtual 'chain' of RRSets
    within a zone by indicating, for each name within a zone, the RRSets for which
    it owns records and the next name in the zone. RFC 2065 discusses security extensions
    for static DNS zones. An Internet Draft, draft-ietf-dnssec-update-04.txt, becoming
    an RFC describes security in DNS zone which can be dynamically updated. In this
    document, the authors build upon them to: - define some terms used colloquially
    in the working group - describe the semantics of the NXT record in greater detail
    than the two existing documents, in order to achieve interoperability - introduce
    and discuss unresolved issues involving NXT records</p>"
