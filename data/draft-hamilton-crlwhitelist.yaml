abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe two extensions to the Certificate Revocation List v2 to
    more strongly identify revoked and legitimately issued certificates. This creates
    a means for non-CA OCSP responders which are fed by CRL and can parse these extensions
    to presume that unlisted or non- matching certificates from that Issuer are REVOKED
    rather than UNKNOWN, as well as creating a means by which the Issuer can provide
    digest values for stronger certificate authentication. Placing issuance data within
    the CRL in some ways violates the original intent of the CRL, but CRLv2 has places
    for Extensions. It is a logical extension to permit existing buildout to address
    newly- exploited vulnerabilities in the model. A new crlEntryExtension is defined
    to permit the optional provision of several hashes of each certificate on the
    list of revoked certificates. In addition, a new crlExtension is defined to provide
    serial numbers and hashes of issued certificates. Neither of these extensions
    needs to be marked critical, and the original semantics are preserved for existing
    clients. Notably, no data format or protocol of PKIX can currently utilize any
    extra hashes to provide any extra authentication or security. Nevertheless, until
    there is a standard way for the CA issuer to provide these digest values, it's
    impossible to build anything which uses them. The downside: Whitelist CRLs with
    strong certificate authentication data are *huge*. The canonical 1MB CRL example
    would, if extended with this extra information, balloon to at a minimum 2.5MB
    (presuming random 20-byte serial numbers) to a single-digest maximum of approximately
    400MB. CAs are encouraged not to alter their current CRL production, and produce
    these extensions only when needed by a certificate status server or consuming
    client.</p>"
