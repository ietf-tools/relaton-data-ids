abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a cryptographic transform which uses a stream
    cipher (which can generate keystream segments in arbitrary order) and a universal
    hash function to provide both privacy and authentication together, or either security
    service separately. This transform is efficient, provably secure, appropriate
    for network security, and is believed to be patent free.</p>"
