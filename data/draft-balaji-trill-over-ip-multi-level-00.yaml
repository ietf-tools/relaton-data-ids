abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL
    based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities or (c) Campus
    TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more ISPs that provide regular
    IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. A few solutions have been proposed as in [1] in the
    recent past that have not looked at the PB-like functionality. These solutions
    have not dealt with the details as to how these services could be provided such
    that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with issues like nick-name collisons
    for unicast (multicast is still TBD) being taken care of. It has been found that
    with extensions to BGP the problem statement which we will define below can be
    handled. Both control plane and data plane operations can be driven into the solution
    to make it seamlessly look at the entire set of TRILL sites as a single entity
    which then can be viewed as one single Layer 2 cloud. MAC moves across TRILL sites
    and within TRILL sites can be realized. This document / proposal envisions the
    use of BGP-MAC-VPN vrfs both at the IP cloud PE devices and at the peripheral
    PEs within a TRILL site providing Provider Backbone like functionality. We deal
    in depth with the control plane and data plane particulars for unicast (multicast
    is still TBD) with nick-name election being taken care of as part of the solution.</p>"
