abstract:
- content: "<p>The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MN implementing
    the single IP interface hiding mechanism. This document briefly introduces the
    single IP interface hiding mechanism and it derives the associated protocol operations
    to enable seamless flow mobility across multiple access networks. These extensions
    are intended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on multiple
    physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminated manner when attached
    to a PMIPv6 domain. A typical usage of these extensions is to perform downlink
    flow discrimination through multiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e.
    dedicate one MN physical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).
    The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward compatible
    manner the current PMIPv6 specification. In addition these extensions use, when
    possible, existing specifications related to multihoming support at IETF and conform
    to the problem statement of Netext Working Group.</p>"
