abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a real-time transport protocol (RTP) [1] payload
    format for AMR speech encoded [2] signals. It supports all 8 modes of the AMR
    speech codec and is as well prepared for future extensions, such as AMR wideband.
    Mode adaptation and discontinuous transmission (DTX) are supported as well. The
    proposed payload format allows large flexibility with a minimum of bitrate overhead.
    One or multiple speech frames can be trans- mitted in a single packet. Redundant
    transmission of previously transmitted frames (or parts thereof) is possible as
    well as parity code transmission. With one speech frame per packet the additional
    parity code transmission allows reconstruction of N previous lost speech frames
    when N consecutive correct packets are buffered in the receiver. This means a
    very high robustness while the receiver buffer size can be chosen according to
    the application. For implementation of this draft, please consider also the requirements
    of [12].</p>"
