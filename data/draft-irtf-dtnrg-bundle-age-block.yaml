abstract:
- content: "<p>As originally specified, [RFC5050] presumes that any DTN node will
    have access to accurate real world time. Experience has shown that there are devices
    and networks where accurate real world time is difficult or impossible to consistently
    obtain. This draft proposes an extension block that contains the current age of
    a bundle in order to support bundle expiration for nodes and networks that have
    faulty, intermittent, or no notion of the real world time. Bundle age may be used
    to expire bundles by a Bundle Protocol Agent which does not have access to accurate
    real world time. The bundle age must be updated at each hop in order to maintain
    accuracy.</p>"
