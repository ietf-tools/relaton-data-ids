abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) package
    to support fax calls. The package allows for fax calls to be supported in two
    different ways. The first one utilizes ITU-T Recommendation T.38 for fax relay
    under the control of the Call Agent. The second one lets the gateway decide upon
    a method for fax transmission as well as handle the details of the fax call without
    Call Agent involvement. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
