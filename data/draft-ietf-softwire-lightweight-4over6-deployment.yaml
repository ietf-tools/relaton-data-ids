abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism for providing IPv4 services to clients
    connected to a single-stack IPv6 network. The architecture is similar to DS-Lite,
    but the network address translation function is relocated from the tunnel concentrator
    to the tunnel client, hence reducing the amount of state which must be maintained
    in the concentrator to a per-customer level. This document discusses the applicability,
    describes various deployment models and provides deployment considerations for
    Lightweight 4over6.</p>"
