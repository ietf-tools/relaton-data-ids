abstract:
- content: "<p>In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node
    (MN) is assigned a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during the initial attachment
    for the Home Address (HoA) configuration. During the movements of the MN, this
    prefix is unchanged and unnecessary for the MN to reconfigure the HoA. However,
    the current protocol does not specify related operations to support the MN to
    timely receive and configure a new HNP when the allocated HNP changes. In this
    draft, this problem is discussed and a possible solution is proposed based on
    RFC 7077.</p>"
