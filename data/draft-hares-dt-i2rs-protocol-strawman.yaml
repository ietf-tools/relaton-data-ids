abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a strawman proposal for the I2RS protocol covering
    the ephemeral data store and data flow requirements not covered by i2rs publication/subscription
    service or traceability. It also proposes additions to YANG for the ephemeral
    data store and for additional data flow requirements. It proposes additions to
    the NETCONF and RESTCONF for these additions. Future versions of this document
    will propose changes to support the I2RS protocol security requirements.</p>"
