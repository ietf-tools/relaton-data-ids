abstract:
- content: "<p>The vision of a quantum internet is to enhance existing Internet technology
    by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. To achieve
    this goal, a quantum network stack should be built from the ground up to account
    for the fundamentally new properties of quantum entanglement. The first quantum
    entanglement networks have been realised [Pompili21.1], but there is no practical
    proposal for how to organise, utilise, and manage such networks. In this draft,
    we attempt to lay down the framework and introduce some basic architectural principles
    for a quantum internet. This is intended for general guidance and general interest,
    but also to provide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network
    specialists. This document is a product of the Quantum Internet Research Group
    (QIRG).</p>"
