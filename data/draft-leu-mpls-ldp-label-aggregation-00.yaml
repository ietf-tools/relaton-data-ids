abstract:
- content: "<p>The label distribution protocol specified in [1] describes a mechanism
    whereby one label switched router informs another of the meaning of labels used
    to forward traffic between and through them. This draft proposes a label aggregation
    technique to reduce the number of labels that need to be exchanged between two
    LSRs running LDP. This includes a method of signalling that LSRs are capable of
    label aggregation, determining when a label request can be aggregated on to an
    existing LSP and a method of signalling to upstream LSRs that the resulting label
    mapping is an aggregate.</p>"
