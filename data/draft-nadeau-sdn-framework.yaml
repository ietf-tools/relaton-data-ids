abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a framework for Software Defined Networks (SDN).
    The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space
    of SDN and to describe the relationships among the various components necessary
    to manipulate the components that comprise SDNs. SDN requires the specification
    of several key components including an "orchestrator" and various "plug-ins" between
    the orchestrator function and network resources. In addition to this, an orchestrator
    will require interconnection with standard policy bases, as well as other orchestrators
    in distributed environments or insofar as to support high-availability and fault-tolerance
    capabilities. To this end, several interfaces and mechanisms to address issues
    such as enabling the orchestrator to manipulate and interact with the control
    planes of devices such as routers and switches, as well as a discourse between
    different orchestrators will be described. The intent of this document is to outline
    what each interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces
    and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other
    documents.</p>
