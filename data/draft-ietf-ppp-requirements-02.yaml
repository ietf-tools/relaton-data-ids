abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the requirements for an Internet Standard Data
    Link Layer protocol to be used with point-to-point links. Although many industry
    standard protocols and ad hoc protocols already exist for the data link layer,
    none are both complete and sufficiently versatile to be accepted as an Internet
    Standard. In preparation to designing such a protocol, the features necessary
    to qualify a point-to-point protocol as an Internet Standard are discussed in
    detail. An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of several existing protocols
    on the basis of these requirements demonstrates the failure of each to address
    key issues. Historical Note: This was the design requirements document followed
    for RFC-1134 through the present. It is now published for completeness and future
    guidance.</p>"
