abstract:
- content: <p>This document is intended to allow the use of QUIC as an underlying
    transport protocol for RTP applications that commonly use SDP as a session signaling
    protocol to set up RTP connections, such as SIP and WebRTC. The document describes
    several new SDP "proto" and "attribute-name" attribute values in the "Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" IANA registry that can be used to describe
    QUIC transport for RTP and RTCP packets, and describes how SDP Offer/ Answer can
    be used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC. This document also contains non-normative
    guidance for implementers.</p>
