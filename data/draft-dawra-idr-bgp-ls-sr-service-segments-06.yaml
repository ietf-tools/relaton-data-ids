abstract:
- content: "<p>Service functions are deployed as, physical or virtualized elements
    along with network nodes or on servers in data centers. Segment Routing (SR) brings
    in the concept of segments which can be topological or service instructions. Service
    segments are SR segments that are associated with service functions. SR Policies
    are used for the setup of paths for steering of traffic through service functions
    using their service segments. BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables distribution of
    topology information from the network to a controller or an application in general
    so it can learn the network topology. This document specifies the extensions to
    BGP-LS for the advertisement of service functions along their associated service
    segments. The BGP-LS advertisement of service function information along with
    the network nodes that they are attached to, or associated with, enables controllers
    compute and setup service paths in the network.</p>"
