abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3226 mandated support for EDNS0 in DNS entities claiming to support
    either DNS Security Extensions or IPv6 address records. This requirement was motivated
    because these new features increase the size of DNS messages. If EDNS0 is not
    supported fall back to TCP will happen, having a detrimental impact on query latency
    and DNS server load.</p>"
