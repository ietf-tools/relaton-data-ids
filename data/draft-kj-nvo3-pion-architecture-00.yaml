abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces PSN independent overlay network (PION) architecture
    for intra- and inter-datacenter (DC) connections. The motivations, protocol layers,
    applications, and etc, for PION are also discussed. PION provides a virtualized
    underlying-PSN- independent network in order to maximize the reuse of IETF protocol
    definitions and implementations. The inter- and intra-DC connection provided by
    PION could be from endpoint to endpoint, or endpoint to network, or network to
    network. The packet transport capabilities provided by the overlay network are
    determined by the capability of the underlying PSN.</p>"
