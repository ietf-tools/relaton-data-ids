abstract:
- content: "<p>In the push toward Level 4 Autonomous Networks, CSPs must to adopt
    new processes and organizational changes, along with function-centric building
    blocks for higher autonomy. As intelligent agents evolve, network autonomy increasingly
    relies on deploying these agents, enabling self-management, self-healing, and
    adaptation with minimal human intervention. These agents facilitate the transition
    toward fully autonomous network operations across multiple layers, including services
    and resources. However, achieving Level 4 autonomy, where networks independently
    handle tasks across various domains, presents significant challenges, notably
    secure, efficient, and accurate multi-agent interactions. This document introduces
    a protocol- agnostic data model that enables multiple intelligent agents to communicate
    effectively using the model, ensuring end-to-end task execution and closed-loop
    operations in autonomous networks.</p>"
