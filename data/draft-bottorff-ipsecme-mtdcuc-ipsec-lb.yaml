abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec is of increasing importance within data centers to secure tunnels
    used to carry multi-tenant traffic encapsulated using the Network Virtualization
    over L3 (NVO3) protocols. Encrypting NVO3 tunnels provides defense against bad
    actors within the physical underlay network from monitoring or injecting overlay
    traffic from outside the NVO3 infrastructure. When securing data center tunnels
    using IPsec it becomes crucial to retain entropy within the outer IPsec packet
    headers to facilitate load balancing over the highly meshed networks used in these
    environments. While entropy is necessary to support load distribution algorithms
    it is also important that the entropy codes used retain integrity of flows to
    prevent performance deterioration resulting from packet re-ordering. Here, we
    describe a use case for load balancing IPsec traffic within multi-tenant data
    centers.</p>"
