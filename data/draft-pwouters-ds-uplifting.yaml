abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record
    (RR) Type Digest Algorithms IANA Registry to carry two new non-digest algorithm
    entries. The first new type value creates a generic method to embed a Parental
    RRtype within the DS record. The second new type value creates an Alias DS record
    to point to the actual DS record published in a different DNSSEC signed zone under
    DNS Provider change control. The DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record
    (RR) Type Digest Algorithms Registry is renamed to the DNSSEC Delegation Signal
    Registry. This document updates [many things which we should figure out].</p>"
