- content: "<p>This document defines the Origin attribute for cookies, which lets
    servers harmonize the security policy of their cookies with the widely used same-origin
    policy. Origin cookies provide both confidentiality and integrity, unlike the
    Secure attribute, which provides only confidentiality.Editorial Note (To be removed
