abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a new type of response for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) called a "Pending" response. A CoAP server can use a Pending response
    to indicate that it has accepted a request but has not yet started processing
    it or that processing the request will take longer than a client is typically
    willing to wait for a response.</p>
