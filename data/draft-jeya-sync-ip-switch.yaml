abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'Synchronous IP Switching' protocol provides a framework for synchronous
    communication among end stations through an ethernet switch. This proposal enhances
    the capability of an ethernet switch to forward the packets from a variety of
    real time applications in a synchronous manner with less delay variations and
    consistent throughput by introducing the concept of 'Time Switch'. This protocol
    proves its importance, as more and more applications need constant delay, effective
    bandwidth while forwarding their packets to their destination.</p>"
