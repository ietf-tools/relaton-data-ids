abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable
    for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis, and change
    management. Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network management together
    with AI, it allows the network management activities to take user intent or service
    requirements as input, automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies
    under realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment. Such environment that
    operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have AI driven Network
    Operations. AI driven Network Operations brings together existing technologies
    such as Network Digital Twin and AI which may be seen as the use of a toolbox
    of existing components enhanced with a few new elements. This document describes
    an architecture for AI driven network operations and shows how these components
    work together. It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the
    architecture and realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of the network
    service.</p>"
