abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) and
    JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) serializations with Ascon which is a
    NIST standard for lightweight cryptography. In 2019, as a part of CAESAR competition,
    Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a were selected as the first choice for the lightweight
    authenticated encryption [asconv1.2-caesar]. After, in 2023, National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected Ascon family of cryptographic algorithms
    to be the standard for lightweight cryptography [asconv1.2-nist]. In August 2025,
    NIST Special Publication 800-232 was released, defining Ascon-based lightweight
    cryptography standards for constrained devices [NIST.SP.800-232]. This recognition
    makes it particularly interesting to use Ascon with COSE and JOSE structures.
    This document does not define any new cryptography, only serializations of existing
    cryptographic systems described in [NIST.SP.800-232].</p>"
