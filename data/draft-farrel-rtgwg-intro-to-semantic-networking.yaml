abstract:
- content: "<p>Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing
    additional information in existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses
    themselves, or by adding fields. The intent is to facilitate enhanced routing/forwarding
    decisions based on these additional semantics to provide differentiated forwarding
    paths for different packet flows distinct from simple shortest path first routing.
    The process is defined as Semantic Networking. This document provides a brief
    introduction to Semantic Networking.</p>"
