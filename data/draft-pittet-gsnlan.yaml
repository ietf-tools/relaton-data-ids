abstract:
- content: "<p>This document further specifies a method for resolving IP addresses
    to HIPPI-6400 (High-Performance Parallel Interface) hardware addresses (HARP)
    and for emulating IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension
    of HARP. Furthermore, it is the goal of this memo to define a IP and HARP that
    will allow interoperability for HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 equipment both broadcast
    and non-broadcast capable networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
