abstract:
- content: "<p>The Media Sessions Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke
    many different types of services on IP media servers. Clients can use it define
    how multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individual
    or groups of users. MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing
    features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or
    personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams. As well, clients can
    use MSML with other languages such as the Media Objects Markup Language (MOML)
    or VoiceXML to interact with individual users or with groups of conference participants.</p>"
