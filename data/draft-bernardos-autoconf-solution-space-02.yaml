abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft aims at analysing the solution space for the ad hoc IP autoconfiguration
    problem, based on the problem statement draft and the MANET architecture draft.
    Some evaluation considerations, are also taken into account. This draft classifies,
    at a generic level, the solution space of the possible approaches that could be
    followed to solve the IPv6 autoconfiguration for MANETs problem. The various approaches
    of IPv6 autoconfiguration for MANETs are illustrated, and the benefits and tradeoffs
    in different aspects of IPv6 autoconfiguration are explored.</p>"
