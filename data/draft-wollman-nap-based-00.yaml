abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes NAP-based addressing, a scheme for abstracting
    and encoding hierarchical addresses in a name service in such a way as to allow
    the entities responsible for various levels in an address to change their portions
    independently and scaleably. As a byproduct, it also defines a particular addressing
    scheme which the author believes to be appropriate for the existing model of Internet
    connectivity.</p>"
