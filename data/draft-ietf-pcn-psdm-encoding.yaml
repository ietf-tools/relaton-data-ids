abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load- dependent
    packet re-marking mechanism and provides in Differentiated Services networks feedback
    to egress nodes about load conditions within the domain. It is used to support
    admission control and flow termination decision in a simple way. This document
    proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IP header for packet-specific dual
    marking (PSDM). PSDM encoding provides three different codepoints: not-ETM, not-ThM,
    and PM. Excess-traffic-marking may re-mark not- ETM-packets to PM and threshold-marking
    may re-mark not-ThM-packets to PM.</p>"
