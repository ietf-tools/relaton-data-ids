abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines two YANG modules: the first defines a minimal
    grouping for configuring an HTTP client, and the second defines a minimal grouping
    for configuring an HTTP server. It is intended that these groupings will be used
    to help define the configuration for simple HTTP-based protocols (not for complete
    web servers or browsers). Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft
    contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values at
    the time of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that are
    needed. No other RFC Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document.
    Artwork in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in progress.
    Please apply the following replacements (note: not all may be present): * AAAA
    --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto- types * DDDD --&gt;
    the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client- server * FFFF --&gt;
    the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client- server * GGGG --&gt;
    the assigned RFC value for this draft Artwork in this document contains placeholder
    values for the date of publication of this draft. Please apply the following replacement:
    * 2023-04-17 --&gt; the publication date of this draft The "Relation to other
    RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains the text "one or more YANG modules" and, later,
    "modules". This text is sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how
    many modules a draft defines. The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved
    by stating more directly how many modules are defined. The "Relation to other
    RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains a self- reference to this draft, along with
    a corresponding Informative Reference in the Appendix. The following Appendix
    section is to be removed prior to publication: * Appendix A. Change Log</p>'
