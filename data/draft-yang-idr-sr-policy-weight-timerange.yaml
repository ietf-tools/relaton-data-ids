abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR Policy is a set of
    candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists. In the scenario
    where there are multiple segment list paths, traffic load balancing can be achieved
    based on the weight value assigned to each path. Typically, the weight value for
    each path is fixed. This document defines an extension of BGP SR Policy for setting
    the weight value for each path based on time range.</p>"
