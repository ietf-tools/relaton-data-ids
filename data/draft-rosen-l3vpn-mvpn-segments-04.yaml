abstract:
- content: '<p>To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers (SPs) need
    to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as "P-tunnels") that enable the Provider
    Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast packets to each other.
    Some SPs organize their networks in a hierarchical manner, with the PE routers
    in "edge areas", and the edge areas connected to each other via a "core area".
    A P-tunnel that connects PE routers in different edge areas can be thought of
    as having three segments: a segment through one edge area, a segment through the
    core area, and a segment through the second edge area. It is desirable to preserve
    the independence of the core area by allowing it to use a different tunneling
    technology than that used in the edge areas. However, it is not desirable for
    the core area Border Routers (BRs) to participate in the MVPN-specific signaling,
    or even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs are in the edge areas that attach
    to it. This document specifies a simple method for segmenting MVPN P-tunnels at
    the BRs, subject to these constraints.</p>'
