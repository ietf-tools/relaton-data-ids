abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) aims at evolving the way network
    operators design, deploy and provision their networks by leveraging on standard
    IT virtualisation technologies to move and consolidate a wide range of network
    functions and services onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and
    storage. The primary target for operators, stimulated by the recent updates on
    NFV and SDN, is the network edge. In fact, operators are considering their future
    datacentres and Points of Presence (PoPs) as increasingly dynamic infrastructures
    where Virtualised Network Functions (VNFs) and on-demand chained services with
    high elasticity will be deployed. This document presents an orchestration framework
    for automated deployment of highly available VNF chains. Resiliency of VNFs and
    chained services is a key requirement for operators to improve, ease, automate
    and speed up services lifecycle management. The proposed VNFs orchestration framework
    is also positioned with respect to current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC)
    architectures and solutions.</p>"
