abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6
    and IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork. We propose a set of
    extensions to the PF_KEY framework which allows smooth and solid operation of
    IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment. The first extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE
    and is for migrating the endpoint addresses of a IPsec Security Association pair
    in tunnel mode. The second extension is named SADB_X_EXT_PACKET and allows IKE
    to make the right choice for address selection in bootstrapping process. Both
    extensions are helpful for assuring smooth interworking between Mobile IPv6 and
    IPsec/IKE and achieving performance optimization.</p>"
