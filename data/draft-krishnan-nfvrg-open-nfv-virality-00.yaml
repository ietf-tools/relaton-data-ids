abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the key goals of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is achieving
    energy efficiency through workload consolidation. A good example for maximizing
    energy savings is the Virtualization of Content Delivery Networks (vCDNs) NFV
    use case where the video streaming workloads exhibit significant difference between
    prime- time and non-prime-time usage of the infrastructure. This draft examines
    the practical challenges in maximizing energy efficiency for vCDN workloads. This
    draft proposes an open NFV architectural framework for conveying content virality
    information from Cloud applications such as YouTube, Twitter and mechanisms for
    leveraging it to maximize the energy efficiency for vCDN workloads.</p>"
