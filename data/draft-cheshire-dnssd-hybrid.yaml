abstract:
- content: "<p>Performing DNS-Based Service Discovery using purely link-local Multicast
    DNS enables discovery of services that are on the local link, but not (without
    some kind of proxy or similar special support) of services that are outside the
    local link. Using a very large local link with thousands of hosts improves service
    discovery, but at the cost of large amounts of multicast traffic. Performing DNS-Based
    Service Discovery using purely Unicast DNS is more efficient, but requires configuration
    of DNS Update keys on the devices offering the services, which can be onerous
    for simple devices like printers and network cameras. Hence a compromise is needed,
    that provides easy service discovery without requiring either large amounts of
    multicast traffic or onerous configuration.</p>"
