abstract:
- content: "<p>Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities [BGP-EXTCOMM] support
    IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support IPv6 Address Specific
    Extended Community. The lack of IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community may be
    a problem when an application uses IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, and
    one wants to use this application in a pure IPv6 environment. This document defines
    a new BGP attribute, IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community that addresses this
    problem. The IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community is similar to the IPv4 Address
    Specific Extended Community, except that it carries an IPv6 address rather than
    an IPv4 address.</p>"
