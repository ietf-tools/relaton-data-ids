abstract:
- content: <p>Content providers delivering content via CDNs will sometimes deliver
    content over HTTPS (or both HTTPS and HTTP) but configure the CDN to pull from
    the origin over cleartext and unauthenticated HTTP. From the perspective of a
    client, it appears that their requests and associated responses are delivered
    over HTTPS, while in reality their requests are being sent across the network
    in-the-clear and responses are delivered unauthenticated. This exposes user request
    data to pervasive monitoring [RFC7258]; it also means response data may be tampered
    with by active adversaries. Terminating TLS connections on a load balancer and
    contacting a backend over cleartext has long been common within data centers,
    but doing this TLS termination and downgrade to HTTP at a CDN introduces additional
    risk when the unprotected traffic is sent over the general Internet, sometimes
    across national boundaries. While it would be nice to say "never do this," customer
    demand, content provider use-cases, and market forces today make it impossible
    for CDNs to not support downgrade. However, following a set of best practices
    can provide visibility into when this is happening and can reduce some of the
    risks.</p>
