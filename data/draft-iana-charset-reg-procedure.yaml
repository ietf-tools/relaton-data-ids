abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) (RFC-2045, RFC-2046, RFC-2047,
    RFC-2231) and various other Internet protocols are capable of using many different
    charsets. This in turn means that the ability to label different charsets is essential.
    This document obsoletes the IANA Charset Registration Procedures originally defined
    in [RFC2978]. Specifically, this document completely revises the registration
    procedures and the charset registries. The charset registry is now divided into
    three parts with separate registration procedures for each. Note: The charset
    registration procedure exists solely to associate a specific name or names with
    a given charset and to give an indication of whether or not a given charset can
    be used in MIME text objects. In particular, the general applicability and appropriateness
    of a given registered charset to a particular application is a protocol issue,
    not a registration issue, and is not dealt with by this registration procedure.</p>"
