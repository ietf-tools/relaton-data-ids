abstract:
- content: "<p>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with
    the NETCONF protocol requires a structured data modeling environment which promotes
    human usability and multi-vendor interoperability. The Network Configuration Extensions
    (NCX) are a set of specifications intended to address NETCONF data modeling issues.
    This document defines an Access Control Model (ACM) suitable for use with the
    NETCONF protocol, intended to promote a more consistent, manageable, and interoperable
    infra-structure for ongoing development of NETCONF-based management interfaces.</p>"
