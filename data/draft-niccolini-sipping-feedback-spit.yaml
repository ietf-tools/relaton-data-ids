abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo analyzes the need for SIP extensions for SPIT (Spam Over
    Internet telephony) identification. This memo describes requirements and gives
    an overview of possible solutions to send feedback information using the SIP protocol
    for the scope of SPIT. Feedback information from the users to the SPIT identification
    system (e.g., working closely with the callee's SIP proxy server) are important
    for SPIT detection and prevention. The overall SPIT protection systems on the
    internet will benefit from such information. The basic idea is that each user
    who receives a SPIT session request, will send a feedback to SPIT identification
    system (for example, using a button on the user interface of the client). Information
    could be also exchanged among domains and/or servers in order to increase effectiveness
    of SPIT detection systems. The idea is that SIP proxy servers and/or B2BUAs include
    SPIT likeliness estimations (based on some knowledge they have which is out of
    the scope of this draft) as additional message headers (e.g. INVITE headers) when
    forwarding such messages to other domains. This memo identifies the parameters
    that the SPIT identification system may need in order to detect abusive behaviors;
    moreover it proposes an overview of technical solutions how such information can
    be sent back to the SPIT identification system by means of the SIP protocol. The
    memo also addresses the technical solutions on how forward information could be
    passed among domains as well as how communication initiation could be denied to
    users (e.g. blacklisted ones).</p>"
