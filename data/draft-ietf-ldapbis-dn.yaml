    to entries in the directory. This document defines the string representation used
    in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to transfer distinguished
    names. The string representation is designed to give a clean representation of
    commonly used distinguished names, while being able to represent any distinguished
    name. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
