abstract:
- content: <p>GREYLIST is a SMTP extension to formalize the widely supported Greylisting
    mail filtering method and to help support SMTP rejected transports by following
    a new formal structured 4yz server temporary rejection response by including a
    "retry=time-delay" tag string which SMTP clients can use to optimize the rescheduling
    of the mail delivery attempts. With adoption, network overhead reduction in wasteful
    mail delivery attempts will be realized.</p>
