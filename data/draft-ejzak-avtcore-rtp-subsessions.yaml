abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a means of multiplexing RTP streams having
    different media types within a single transport connection and a means of representing
    this multiplexing option in SDP so that network nodes can easily identify groups
    of RTP streams and their associated RTCP packets for differential treatment as
    necessary. This mechanism can be used to complement the BUNDLE multiplexing scheme,
    which uses the grouping framework to identify all media lines associated with
    a single transport connection, but provides no means for network nodes to group
    RTP streams and their RTCP packets for differential treatment. RTP subsessions
    is an alternative to the SHIM multiplexing proposal; it clearly partitions packets
    associated with different media lines without changing the format of individual
    RTP and RTCP packets, but it does not maintain a completely independent SSRC space
    for each media line, as does SHIM. RTP subsessions avoid SSRC conflicts by construction
    and can be used in all RTP topologies in which all systems implement RTP subsessions,
    although SSRC mapping might be needed when forwarding RTP streams from an unpartitioned
    RTP session into an RTP subsession.</p>"
