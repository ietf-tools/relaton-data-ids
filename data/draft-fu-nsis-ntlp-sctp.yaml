abstract:
- content: "<p>The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol currently
    uses TCP or TLS over TCP for connection mode operation. This document describes
    the usage of GIST over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The use
    of SCTP can take the advantage of features provided by SCTP, namely streaming-based
    transport, support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking, and the
    support of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance. Additionally,
    the support for some extensions of SCTP is also discussed, namely its Partial
    Reliability Extension and the usage of TLS over SCTP.</p>"
