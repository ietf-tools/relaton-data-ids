abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, it identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data
    storages for archiving and developing data sharing platform, and application units
    to be important system components for developing digital communities: i.e., building-scale
    and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines
    a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways,
    storages, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration
    of multiple facilities, data storages, application services such as central management,
    energy saving, environmental monitoring and alarm notification systems.</p>"
