abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the IP Flow Information Export
    (IPFIX) protocol specification in RFC 5101 and the IPFIX information model specified
    in RFC 5102 to support hierarchical structured data and lists (sequences) of Information
    Elements in data records. This extension allows definition of complex data structures
    such as variable-length lists and specification of hierarchical containment relationships
    between Templates. Finally, the semantics are provided in order to express the
    relationship among multiple list elements in a structured data record. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
