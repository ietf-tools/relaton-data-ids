abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the CoRIM schema that support
    Intel specific Attester implementations. Multiple Evidence formats are compatible
    with base CoRIM, but extensions to evidence formats may be required to fully support
    the CoMID schema extensions defined in this profile. The concise evidence definition
    uses the CoMID schema such that extensions to CoMID are inherited by concise evidence.
    Reference Value Providers may use this profile to author mainifests containing
    Reference Values and Endorsements. RATS Verifiers recognize this profile by it's
    profile identifier and implement support for the extentions defined.</p>"
