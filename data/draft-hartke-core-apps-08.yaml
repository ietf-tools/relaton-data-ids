abstract:
- content: <p>The application programmable interfaces of RESTful, hypermedia-driven
    Web applications consist of a number of reusable components such as Internet media
    types and link relation types. This document proposes "CoRE Applications", a convention
    for application designers to build the interfaces of their applications in a structured
    way, so that implementers can easily build interoperable clients and servers,
    and other designers can reuse the components in their own applications.</p>
