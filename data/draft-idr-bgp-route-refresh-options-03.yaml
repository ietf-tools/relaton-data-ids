abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC2918] defines a route refresh capability to be exchanged between
    BGP speakers. BGP speakers that support this capability are advertising that they
    can resend the entire BGP Adj-RIB-Out on receipt of a refresh request. By supporting
    this capability, BGP speakers are more flexible in applying any inbound routing
    policy changes as they no longer have to store received routes in their unchanged
    form or reset the session when an inbound routing policy change occurs. The route
    refresh capability is advertised per AFI, SAFI combination. There are newer AFI,
    SAFI types that have been introduced to BGP that support a variety of route types
    (e.g. IPv4/MVPN, L2VPN/EVPN). Currently, there is no way to request a subset of
    routes in a Route Refresh message for a given AFI, SAFI. This draft defines route
    refresh capability extensions that help BGP speakers to request a subset of routes
    for a given address family. This is expected to reduce the amount of update traffic
    being generated by route refresh requests as well as lessen the burden on the
    router servicing such requests.</p>"
