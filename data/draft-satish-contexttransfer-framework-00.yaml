abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile nodes enhance their connections across wireless media by establishing
    specific parameters at the FA/AR/AP in order to facilitate optimal usage of the
    resources as well as enhance the QoS as seen by a MN. During handover from one
    access router to another, a bandwidth-constrained mobile node MAY need to have
    state information passed from the previous router to the new one. This document
    proposes a context transfer framework that makes use of existing fast handoff
    signaling for context transfer as well as provide a mechanism for QoS negotiation
    and renegotiations. We also cover CT under CAR discovery. The suggested mechanism
    provides for context transfer so that the applications running on the mobile node
    could operate with minimal disruption.</p>"
