abstract:
- content: "<p>Bursty concurrent streams from holographic applications can cause congestion
    in wireless access networks, leading to increased delay and QoS issues. The egress
    server of a data center (DC egress) can regulate outbound network traffic and
    mitigate congestion if it obtains dynamic information about the wireless access
    network's queue and capabilities. The document proposes a network-assisted multi-
    flow transmission control scheme that leverages underlying link state information
    of access points to perform delay prediction and flow control at the DC egress
    to alleviate congestion and improve user experience.</p>"
