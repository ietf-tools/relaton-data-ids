abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which support
    the classification of packets for the purposes of treating certain classes or
    flows of packets in a particular way compared to other packets. The successful
    wide-scale deployment of these protocols depends on the ability to administer
    and distribute consistent policy information to the multiple devices in the network
    which perform the classification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result,
    there is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy administration
    and distribution that will enable interoperability among multiple devices and
    device types that must work together to achieve a consistent implementation of
    policy.</p>"
