abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead
    in many scenarios. However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may significantly degrade
    network and device performance in terms of link utilization, latency, memory usage
    and/or energy consumption. This document presents the problem statement regarding
    sender control of Delayed ACKs in TCP. The document discusses the scenarios and
    use cases in which sender control of Delayed ACKs offers advantages. Then, requirements
    for a potential solution are derived. Finally, a number of potential solutions
    are discussed, based on the requirements, and also considering pros and cons in
    each case.</p>"
