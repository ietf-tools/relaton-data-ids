abstract:
- content: "<p>As policy based networking has become a common place across the Internet
    with the advent of IPsec, firewalls and other initiatives, it is important for
    peering end nodes to understand where and why packets enroute are black-holed.
    End-to-end networking mandates that end nodes be cognizant of the impact policies
    along various points on the network will have on their packets. The objective
    of this document is to lay out a framework of policy requirements for end nodes.
    While the framework is focussed on IPSec based policies, it may be applicable
    across a wider policy base.</p>"
