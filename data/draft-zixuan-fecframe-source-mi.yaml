abstract:
- content: "<p>Per FEC Framework, FEC source packet carries source FEC payload ID
    for FEC protection of arbitrary packet flow. Source FEC payload ID will contain
    information identifying the source block and the position within the source block.
    However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, this document enables the
    receiver to get this information without appending source FEC payload ID. This
    information is obtained using the combination of information provided in the FEC
    payload header and source FEC payload mapping information unit (MIU). Therefore,
    both non-FEC- capable and FEC-capable receivers can work together in a multicast
    session. Two ways to signal the source block structure are defined, one for general
    procedure and anther for systematic procedure that the order of the packets in
    the source block is deterministic.</p>"
