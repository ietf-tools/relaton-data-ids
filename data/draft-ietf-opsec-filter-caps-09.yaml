abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC4778] lists operator practices related to securing networks. This
    document lists filtering and rate limiting capabilities needed to support those
    practices. Capabilities are limited to filtering and rate limiting packets as
    they enter or leave the device. Route filters and service specific filters (e.g.
    SNMP, telnet) are not addressed. Capabilities are defined without reference to
    specific technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies
    that implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports.
    Current implementations that support the capability are cited. Special considerations
    are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations
    of current implementations, trade-offs, etc.</p>"
