abstract:
- content: <p>rfc3927 defines the behavior "Proxy ARP for Everything" in case the
    only address present on the host is IPv4 link-local. However, it does not specify
    anything about the presence or absence of IPv6 global addressing. This results
    in the hosts assuming it has both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity in the scenario where
    the host itself is dualstack-enabled, but the network supplies only IPv6 configuration
    information. Some implementations in this case may decide to use IPv4, which results
    in long connection delays. This document proposes to avoid the "Proxy ARP for
    Everything" behavior if the host has been assigned an IPv6 address.</p>
