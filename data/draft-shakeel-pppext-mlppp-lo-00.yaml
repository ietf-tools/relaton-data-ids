abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new architecture for providing an enhanced
    way of fragmenting PPP protocol frames which is self-scalable to operate over
    a wide range of multiple links ranging from low-bitrate, sub-T1 line to very high
    speed SDH hierarchy. The scheme provides a relatively low overhead for fragmentation
    procedure and can scale very well to accommodate multiple and diverse types of
    communication links operating at different speed. In addition, the generated data
    fragments are distributed to the multiple communication links according to their
    QoS that maximize the real time utilization of the links. This proposal is not
    intended to limit the scope of functions and procedures described in RFC 1990[1].
    This proposal solicits a new type of fragmentation procedure that can be used
    along with other functions and features described in the RFC 1990.</p>"
