abstract:
- content: <p>Previous RFCs specify the procedures necessary to allow IP multicast
    traffic to travel from one site to another within a BGP/MPLS IP VPN (Virtual Private
    Network). However, it is sometimes desirable to allow multicast traffic whose
    source is in one VPN to be received by systems that are in another VPN. This is
    known as a "Multicast VPN (MVPN) extranet". This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514,
    and 6625 by specifying the procedures that are necessary in order to provide MVPN
    extranet service.</p>
