abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an adaptive congestion detection mechanism for
    high-throughput data transmission in wide area networks (WANs). With increasing
    network bandwidth (up to 800Gbps) and challenges in traditional TCP-based protocols
    (e.g., throughput degradation over long distances and high packet loss rates),
    the solution focuses on optimizing congestion identification while minimizing
    bandwidth overhead.</p>"
