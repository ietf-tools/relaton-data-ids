abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines monitoring and status MIBs for use when the (Internet
    Key Exchange) IKE protocol [IKE] is used to create IPsec security associations
    (SAs). As such, the MIBs provide the linkage between IKE (phase 1) SAs and the
    IPsec (phase 2) SAs created by those SAs. It does not define MIBs that may be
    used for configuring IPsec implementations or for providing low-level diagnostic
    or debugging information. It assumes no specific use of IPsec SAs, except that
    they were created using IKE. Further, it does not provide policy information.</p>"
