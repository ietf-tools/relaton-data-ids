abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP Level Multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in the
    BIER Use Cases document. HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's video streaming
    and delivery services such as HLS, AR/VR, etc., generally realized over IP Multicast
    as well as other use cases such as software update delivery. A realization of
    "HTTP Multicast" over "IP Multicast" is described for the video delivery use case.
    IP Multicast is commonly used for IPTV services. DVB and BBF also develope a reference
    architecture for IP Multicast service. A few problems with IP Multicast, such
    as waste of transmission bandwidth, increase in signaling when there are few users
    are described. Realization over BIER, through a BIER Multicast Overlay Layer,
    is described as an alternative. How BIER Multicast Overlay operation improves
    over IP Multicast, such as reduction in signaling, dynamic creation of multicast
    groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth wastage is described. We conclude with
    a few next steps.</p>
