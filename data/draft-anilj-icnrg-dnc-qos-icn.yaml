abstract:
- content: <p>Mechanisms for specifying and implementing end-to-end Quality of service
    (QoS) treatments in Information-Centric Networks (ICN) has not been explored so
    far. There has been some work towards implementing QoS in ICN; however, the discussions
    are mainly centered around strategies used in efficient forwarding of Interest
    packets. Moreover, as ICN has been tested mainly as an IP overlay, its QoS is
    still governed by the IP QoS framework and there is a need for implementing QoS
    in ICN natively. This document describes mechanisms to classify and provide associated
    "name-based" extensions to identify QoS within the framework of ICN's core design
    principles. The name-based design provides a mechanism to carry QoS information
    and implement the treatments as ICN packets travel across different routers in
    the ICN network. Detailed discussion is provided for QoS specific procedures in
    each of the ICN network elements i.e. consumer, producer, and forwarder.</p>
