abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposals in this document are experimental. While they may be
    deployed in the current Internet, they do not represent a consensus that this
    is the best method for high-speed congestion control. In particular, we note that
    alternative experimental proposals are likely to be forthcoming, and it is not
    well understood how the proposals in this document will interact with such alternative
    proposals. This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP's congestion
    control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.
    The congestion control mechanisms of the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion
    windows that can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. For example, for
    a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packets and a 100 ms round-trip time,
    achieving a steady-state throughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestion
    window of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at most one congestion event
    every 5,000,000,000 packets (or equivalently, at most one congestion event every
    1 2/3 hours). This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint. To address
    his limitation of TCP, this document proposes HighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation
    and feedback from the wider community.</p>"
