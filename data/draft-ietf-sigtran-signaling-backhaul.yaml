abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft discusses a framework for transporting signaling
    protocols (SS7, ISDN and DPNSS) over packet networks. The framework is referred
    to as signaling 'backhaul'. The backhaul takes place between a Media Gateway (MG)
    or Signaling Gateway (SG), which interfaces between the circuit world (PSTN) and
    the packet world (IP/ATM), and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC), which provides
    call processing. It is referred to as 'backhaul' because the gateway terminates
    the lower layers of the protocol (i.e. Layer 1 and 2) and backhauls the other
    layers to the MGC.</p>"
