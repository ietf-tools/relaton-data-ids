abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of a referral is to enable a given entity in a multiparty
    application to pass information to another party. This memo specifies a Generic
    Referral Object (GRO) to be used in the context of referrals. The proposed object
    is compact and is application- independent. Both IPv4 and IPv6 schemes are supported,
    as well as upper layer identifiers. Additional information to characterise an
    enclosed reference is also described. To allow proper interpretation of referrals,
    a new notion of scope identifiers is introduced.</p>"
