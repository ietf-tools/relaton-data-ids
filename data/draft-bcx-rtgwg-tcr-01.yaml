abstract:
- content: "<p>Token Cell Routing is a powerful yet hardware friendly method of constructing
    data plane packets to meet the needs of new applications. It is based on the use
    of token cells (special kinds of lightly structured tokens) to provide pointers
    to procedures pre- positioned in the forwarding layer together with the parameters
    needed to provide the required processing context. A packet can be composed from
    multiple token cells as needed to result in new new network processing and forwarding
    semantics.</p>"
