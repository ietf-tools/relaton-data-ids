abstract:
- content: <p>Low-resource devices in a Low-resource and Lossy Network (LLN) can be
    based on a mesh network using the IEEE 802.15.4 link standard. Security in these
    networks MUST be enforced at the link level. Provisioning the devices in a secure
    manner with keys (often called security bootstrapping) to encrypt and authenticate
    the link-layer messages is the subject of this specification. This proposal distinguishes
    itself from other bootstrap proposals by requiring that the devices can be secured
    in an order determined by the needs of the installation procedure. Other proposals
    use an "onion model", where first the devices one-hop away from the initial device
    (often the border router) are secured, followed by the devices that are one-hop
    away from already secured devices.</p>
