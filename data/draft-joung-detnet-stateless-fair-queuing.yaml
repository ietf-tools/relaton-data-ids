abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the framework and the operational procedure
    for deterministic networking with a set of work conserving packet schedulers that
    guarantees end-to-end (E2E) latency bounds to flows. The schedulers in core nodes
    do not need to maintain flow states. Instead, the entrance node of a flow marks
    an ideal service completion time according to a fluid model, called Finish Time
    (FT), of a packet in the packet header. The subsequent core nodes update FT by
    adding a delay factor, which is a function of the flow and upstream nodes. The
    packets in the queue of the scheduler are served in the ascending order of FT.
    This mechanism is called the stateless fair queuing. The result is that flows
    are isolated from each other almost perfectly. The latency bound of a flow depends
    only on the flow's intrinsic parameters, except the maximum packet length among
    other flows sharing each output link with the flow.</p>"
