abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes enhancements to CRTP, the header compression
    algorithm for RTP streams described in [RFC2508]. Each enhancement addresses issues
    with RFC2508 in different deployment scenarios. Each section below provides a
    description of the proposed enhancement, the scenario where it is useful and the
    justification for its use. Each of these enhancements could be evaluated separately.
    The enhancements are applicable both for IPv4 and IPv6. The IPCP option ‘IP header
    compression’ (described in RFC2509) is also extended to negotiate using the CRTP
    enhancements.</p>"
