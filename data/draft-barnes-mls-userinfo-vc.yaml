abstract:
- content: <p>This specification extends Message Layer Security (MLS) credentials
    framework with a new credential type, "UserInfoVC", based on the OpenID Connect
    UserInfo Verifiable Credential type "UserInfoCredential". A UserInfo Verifiable
    Credential encapsulates the UserInfo claims from the OpenID provider as a Verifiable
    Credential that can be presented to a third-party Verifier. These credentials
    can be easily provisioned to MLS clients using the OpenID Connect login flows,
    augmented with type "UserInfoCredential". The credential itself is an object associating
    identity attributes to the signature public key that the client will use in MLS,
    signed by the OpenID Provider. In situations where the OpenID Provider is distinct
    from the MLS Delivery Service, these credentials provide end-to-end secure identity
    assurance.</p>
