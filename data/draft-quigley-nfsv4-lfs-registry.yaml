abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very rigid
    policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and platform. As MAC
    systems are more widely deployed additional flexibility in mechanism and policy
    is required. Where traditional trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security
    (MLS) and integrity models, modern systems have expanded to include technologies
    such as type enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms it
    has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible to accomodate all parties
    in one security label format and model. To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label
    formats in a network, this document proposes a registry of label format specifications.
    This registry contains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and string
    preferences and associates those identifiers with an extensive document outlining
    the exact syntax and use of the particular label format.</p>"
