abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration
    datastores. However, client applications often need to examine system information
    to determine the appropriate configuration requirements. In addition, common system
    events such as a change in system capabilities may impact management applications.
    Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the managed system
    supported by a NETCONF server. This document defines a YANG module for the monitoring
    of system information, which allows a NETCONF client to identify system properties
    and receive notifications for system events.</p>"
