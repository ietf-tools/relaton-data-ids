    of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) specifications and products. It
    is intended to provide background information and to facilitate discussion within
    IETF Working Groups, most notably LDAPbis. This Internet-Draft highlights decisions
    made by group attending the ITU-T and ISO/IEC JTC1 Collaborative Meeting on the
    Directory in London in February 2003 for inclusion in an upcoming Proposed Draft
    Amendment (PDAM) to the ITU-T X.500 / IS 9594 Specification. It also identifies
    issues that the X.500 group would like to bring to the attention of the LDAPbis
    Working Group at the upcoming IETF meeting in March.</p>"
