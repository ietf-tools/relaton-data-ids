abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing in mobile ad-hoc network is achieved through the mutual cooperation
    of mobile devices that form routes in between two mobile nodes.It is one of the
    challenging issues in mobile ad-hoc network [1]. The current protocols for an
    ad-hoc network can generally be categorized into two groups i.e. pro-active and
    re-active[15,16,17,18]. Pro-active protocols by continuously evaluating the known
    and attempting to discover new routes. These protocols try to maintain the most
    up-to-date view of the network[2]. This allows them to efficiently forward packets
    as the route is known in advanced [14]. In contrast reactive protocols determine
    the route only when require [3, 5, 6]. Mobile Ad-hoc On Demand Data Delivery protocol
    (MAODDP) establishes route on demand and delivers the data at the same time one
    after the other [22].MAODDP support both unicast and multicast routing. It is
    designed to minimize reaction to topological changes. In order to ensure the freshness
    of route MAODDP uses combination of sequence numbers and broadcast ID. MAODDP
    is loop-free, self-starting protocol whic can scales to different size of networks.
    MAODDP offers quick adaptation to the dynamic link conditions and determines routes
    to the destinations on demand.</p>"
