abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an analysis and identification of the managed
    objects for dynamic configuration of middleboxes. The scope of the middleboxes
    to which these managed objects apply is limited to NATs and Firewalls. However,
    the managed objects as identified in this document are intended to provide a baseline
    for the dynamic configuration of other types of middleboxes. The applicability
    of existing Management Information Base (MIB) modules to the MIDCOM requirements,
    framework and semantics is described. Additional managed objects are identified
    to satisfy the entirety of the MIDCOM requirements, framework and semantics and
    to provide a complete MIDCOM MIB for NATs and Firewalls to fully realize the requirements
    of the MIDCOM protocol. The actual definition of any new managed objects is provided
    in a separate document [MDCMIB].</p>"
