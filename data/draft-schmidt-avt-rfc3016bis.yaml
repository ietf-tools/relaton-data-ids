abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload formats
    for carrying each of MPEG-4 Audio and MPEG-4 Visual bitstreams without using MPEG-4
    Systems. For the purpose of directly mapping MPEG-4 Audio/Visual bitstreams onto
    RTP packets, it provides specifications for the use of RTP header fields and also
    specifies fragmentation rules. It also provides specifications for Media Type
    registration and the use of Session Description Protocol (SDP). Comments are solicited
    and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at avt@ietf.org and/or
    the author(s). Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in
