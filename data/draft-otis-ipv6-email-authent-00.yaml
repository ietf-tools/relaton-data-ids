abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 facilitates network routing over an incredibly vast address space,
    but abuse mitigation resolving to underlying structures of routes or blocks of
    prefixes would be highly disruptive due to collateral effects. Use of domains
    minimizes unintended coincidental blocking while offering the consolidation necessary
    to facilitate connection management. Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring
    SMTP clients can be identified by an authenticated domain. DKIM is independent
    of intended recipients and domains accountable for having sent email. SPF normally
    requires several text based responses imposing high overhead to query various
    locations. These locations can be constructed by email-address local-part macros
    which can flood caches or leverage DNS name compression to further increase network
    DDoS amplifications when receivers' attempt to verify message sources which may
    then only offer authorization, not authentication of accountable domains. Most
    email abuse, including what might be imposed by SPF, is prevented with comprehensive
    mapping of the address space, but such mapping is impractical with IPv6. An effective
    authenticated domain name alternative is needed to provide basis for assessing
    and reacting to abusive behavior. For most high scale protocols, this involves
    cryptography.</p>"
