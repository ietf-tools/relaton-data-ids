- content: "<p>This is simplified iCalendar definistion. After having learned from
    RFC-2445. This document represents the common objects needed for basic calendaring.
    The VTODO, VJOURNAL, VTIMEZONE, recurrence rules (RDATE remains), and scheduling
    and their associated properties have been removed. These removals are expected
    to appear in new memos at a later time and will be independent extensions of this
    specification. The new EXTENSIONS property will exist to allow for compatible
    sets of extensions.</p>"
