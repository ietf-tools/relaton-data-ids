- content: "<p>Today, there are a variety of technologies available to network appliances
    and provide degrees of home automation and control. However, there is a lack of
    support for wide-area access control and interworking of these Networked Appliances
    (NA). The ability to provide such support will radically enhance peopleâ€™s ability
    to provide exciting new services. This document outlines a set of requirements
    for providing such support.</p>"
