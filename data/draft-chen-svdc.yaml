abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SVDC, a highly-scalable and low-overhead virtualization
    architecture designed for large layer-2 data center networks. By leveraging the
    emerging software defined network framework, SVDC decouples the global identifier
    of a virtual network from the identifier carried in the packet header. Hence,
    SVDC can scale to a large scale of virtual networks with a very short tag in the
    packet header, which is never achieved by previous network virtualization solutions.
    SVDC enhances MAC-in-MAC encapsulation in a way that packets with overlapped MAC
    addresses are correctly forwarded even without in-packet global identifiers to
    differentiate the virtual networks they belong to. Besides, scalable and efficient
    layer-2 multicast and broadcast within virtual networks are also supported in
    SVDC. This document also introduces a basic framework to illustrate SVDC deployment.</p>"
