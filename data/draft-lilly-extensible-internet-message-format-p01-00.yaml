abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in RFC 561
    has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed difficulties
    for some desirable operations such as digitally signed messages, have led to clutter
    in message content which in turn has led user agent implementers to suppress display
    of some originator message content, leading in some cases to user confusion, surprise,
    and embarrassment. This memo is part of a multi-document series that specifies
    an extensible message format which is intended to facilitate operations hampered
    by extensions to the current format and to reduce clutter in the user-to-user
    message content. This memo will present a brief history of the Internet Message
    Format evolution, will identify problems caused by changes that have been made,
    and will introduce terminology and concepts that will be used in other documents
    in the series.</p>"
