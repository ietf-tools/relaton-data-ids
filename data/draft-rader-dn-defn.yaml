abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of policy and technical development efforts related to the
    DNS are underway within the engineering community, ICANN-circles and elsewhere
    due to the evolving scope and utility of DNS, domain name registries and related
    entities. It is important that accepted definitions act as the foundation for
    this work. This document is an attempt to create an optional starting point for
    the requisite dialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and acceptance
    of these new technical and contractual protocols. This document obsoletes &lt;draft-rader-dnwhois-defn-00.txt&gt;,
    &lt;draft-ietf- provreg-dn-defn-01.txt&gt; and &lt;draft-rader-dn-defn-00&gt;.</p>"
