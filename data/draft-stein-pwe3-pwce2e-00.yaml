abstract:
- content: "<p>The PWE3 architecture document places the interworking function solely
    in the PE, so that the attachment circuit between PE and CE carries the native
    service. This is appropriate for a service provider that offers the customer a
    seamless alternative for transporting the native service. An alternative is to
    place the interworking function in the CE, with ethernet access from CE to PE.
    We present advantages of this approach and note required changes to the PWE architecture.</p>"
