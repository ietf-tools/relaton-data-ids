abstract:
- content: "<p>Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route
    leaks are provided in RFC 7908. This document describes a solution for detection
    and mitigation route leaks which is based on conveying route-leak protection (RLP)
    information in a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community. The RLP information
    is carried in a new well-known transitive BGP community, called the RLP community.
    The RLP community helps with detection and mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream
    from the leaking AS (in the path of the BGP update). This is an inter-AS (multi-hop)
    solution mechanism. This solution complements the intra-AS (local AS) route-leak
    avoidance solution that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.</p>"
