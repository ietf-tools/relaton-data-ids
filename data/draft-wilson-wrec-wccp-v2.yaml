abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes version 2.0 of the Web Cache Communication
    Protocol (WCCP). The WCCP V2.0 protocol specifies interactions between one or
    more routers and one or more web-caches. The purpose of the interaction is to
    establish and maintain the transparent redirection of selected types of traffic
    flowing through a group of routers. The selected traffic is redirected to a group
    of web-caches with the aim of optimising resource usage and lowering response
    times. The protocol does not specify any interaction between the web-caches within
    a group or between a web-cache and a web-server.</p>"
