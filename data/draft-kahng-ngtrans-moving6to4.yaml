abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new mechanism using 6to4 to solve mobility
    problems in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. This draft is based on the
    Architecture of Hierarchical Dual Stack Mobility Agent(HDSMA) that supports the
    IP version-independent mobility of mobile node and improves the registration efficiency
    and the performance[3]. The aim is to support 6to4 mechanism for IPv6 transition
    while mobile node only uses mobile IPv6 capability for mobility services.</p>"
