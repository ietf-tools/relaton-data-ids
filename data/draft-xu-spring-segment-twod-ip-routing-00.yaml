abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer traffic into a
    Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy), which represents the routing path by matching
    the destination address and the corresponding Binding Segment Identifier (BSID).
    However, determining the target SR Policy only based on destination aspect is
    incapable for demands for higher dimensional routing. Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP)
    routing is an Internet routing architecture that makes forwarding decisions based
    on source and destination addresses. TwoD-IP routing can easily express a routing
    policy between host to host, or network to network, and have much lower storage
    and calculation consumption compared to the higher dimensional routing. In this
    document, we extend SR to support TwoD-IP routing, illustrate some typical scenarios
    of SR with TwoD-IP routing to express the advantage of extending SR to support
    TwoD-IP routing, and describe the mechanism of how TwoD IP routing protocol cooperates
    with SR.</p>"
