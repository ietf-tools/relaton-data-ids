abstract:
- content: "<p>In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to display/ include
    the URI of the version it's editing while it's being edited. For instance, an
    editor might include this as meta information, or the author of a document might
    want to know the URI of the version before it's checked in. A well-known example
    is the W3C way of referring to document versions in recommendations: it contains
    references to 'the current version', to 'this version' and to the 'previous version'.
    Something like this is currently impossible with WebDAV versioning [RFC3253],
    as the version URI is determined at the time of CHECKIN. Distribution of this
    document is unlimited. Please send comments to the WebDAV versioning (delta-V)
    mailing list at ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org [1], which may be joined by sending
    a message with subject 'subscribe' to ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org [2].
    Discussions of the delta-V mailing list are archived at URL: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/
