abstract:
- content: "<p>This document moves RFC4743 (Using NETCONF over the Simple Object Access
    Protocol (SOAP)) and RFC4744 (Using the NETCONF Protocol over the Blocks Extensible
    Exchange Protocol (BEEP)) to HISTORIC status to reflect the fact that those two
    documents have shown very little (if any) implementations and deployment. Furthermore,
    no-one in the NETCONF WG is interested or volunteering to work on them anymore.</p>"
