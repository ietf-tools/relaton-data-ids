abstract:
- content: "<p>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with
    the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) requires a structured and secure
    operating environment that promotes human usability and multi-vendor interoperability.
    There is a need for standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for
    particular users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol
    operations and content. This document defines such an access control model. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
