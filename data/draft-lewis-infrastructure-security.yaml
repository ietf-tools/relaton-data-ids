abstract:
- content: <p>This RFC defines best current practices for implementing Service Provider
    network infrastructure protection for network elements. This RFC complements and
    extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704. RFC 2267 provides guidelines for filtering traffic
    on the ingress to service provider networks. RFC 3704 expands the recommendations
    described in RFC 2267 to address operational filtering guidelines for single and
    multi-homed environments. The focus of those RFCs is on filtering ingress packets
    ingress, regardless of destination, if those packets are have spoofed source address
    or fall within "reserved" address space. Deployment of RFCs 2267 and 3704 has
    limited the effects of denial of service attacks by dropping ingress packets with
    spoofed source addresses, which in turn offers other benefits by ensuring that
    packets coming into a network originate from validly allocated and consistent
    sources. This document focuses solely on traffic destined to the network infrastructure
    itself to protect the network from denial of service and other attacks. This document
    presents techniques that, together with network edge ingress filtering and RFC
    2267 and RFC 3704, create a layered approach for infrastructure protection. This
    document does not present recommendations for protocol validation (i.e. "sanity
    checking") nor does it address guidelines for general security configuration.</p>
