abstract:
- content: "<p>The finishing process for a document that is approved for publication
    as an RFC currently involves a somewhat detailed and lengthy process. The system
    that executes that process involves a number of different actors, each bringing
    competency with different aspects of the overall process. Ensuring that this process
    functions smoothly is critical to the mission of the organizations that publish
    documents in the RFC series. This document proposes a framework for that system
    that aims to provide clear delineations of accountability and responsibility for
    each of the actors in this system.</p>"
