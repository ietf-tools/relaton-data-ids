abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposal to add new event/signal packages and termi-
    nation classes to the Megaco protocol [3], to support an IP telephone MG. The
    proposal covers the requirements (section 3), design approach (section 4) and
    resource/termination model (section 5) to be used for IP telephones. The new event/signal
    packages and termination classes are defined in sections 6 and 7 respectively.
    Megaco protocol issues affecting effective implementation of IP telephones, including
    complexity, reliable transport, message encoding, security and others are presented
    in section 8. The proposal represents a current view from the TIA working group
    on IP telephone specification, TIA TR-41.3.4, with the intent of using this as
    part of its 'whole device' specification as a method of device control.</p>"
