abstract:
- content: "<p>Zoneprep intends to provide a framework for applying Charprep variants
    to zone file management. More specifically, Charprep profiles are used to generate
    a set of perceptually equivalent domains from a given primary domain, Zoneprep
    policy profiles are used to determine which among the generated set of Charprep
    variants to include into the DNS zone file. This document does NOT provide any
    specific Zoneprep policy profiles, instead it describes a framework for Zone Administrators
    (e.g. registries) to consider when implementing IDN. More importantly, to consider
    the policy on reserving and publishing variants from the given primary domain
    to the DNS zone files. This framework also leads into the discussion of provisioning
    protocol for IDN, more importantly for a server to announce its policies on reserved
    variants and zone variants, as well as for the client to further manage the IDN.
    This document will NOT describe extensively this issue, for further discussion
    please refer to [EPP- I], which incorporates this framework into EPP.</p>"
