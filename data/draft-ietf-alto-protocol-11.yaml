abstract:
- content: "<p>Networking applications today already have access to a great amount
    of Inter-Provider network topology information. For example, views of the Internet
    routing table are easily available at looking glass servers and entirely practical
    to be downloaded by clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network
    topology from the ISP or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point
    of view. In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization
    -- and a way to distribute it. The ALTO Service provides network information (e.g.,
    basic network location structure, preferences of network paths) with the goal
    of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving
    application performance. The basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps
    of a network. These maps provide simplified, yet enough information of a network
    for applications to effectively utilize. Additional services are built on top
    the maps. This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. Although
    the ALTO service would primarily be provided by the network (i.e., the ISP), content
    providers and third parties could also operate this service. Applications that
    could use this service are those that have a choice in connection endpoints. Examples
    of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"
