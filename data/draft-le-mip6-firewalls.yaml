abstract:
- content: "<p>Firewalls are an integral aspect of a majority of IP networks today
    given the state of security issues, threats and vulnerabilities to data networks.
    IP networks today are predominantly based on IPv4 technology and hence firewalls
    have been designed for these networks. IPv6 networks are growing at a slow rate.
    Firewalls for IPv6 networks are still maturing and in development. The IETF has
    recently standardized Mobile IPv6 which adds mobility support to IPv6. Given the
    fact that Mobile IPv6 is a recent standard, most firewalls available for IPv6
    networks today do not support Mobile IPv6. Unless firewalls are aware of Mobile
    IPv6 protocol details, these security devices will hamper large-scale deployment
    of the protocol. This document presents in detail some of the issues that people
    deploying IPv6 networks which include firewalls should consider when expanding
    the scope to support Mobile IPv6 as well. The issues are not only applicable to
    firewalls protecting corporate networks, but are also applicable in 3G mobile
    networks such as GPRS/UMTS and cdma2000 networks where packet filters are implemented
    in the GGSN in GPRS/UMTS networks and the PDSN in cdma2000 networks. The goal
    of this Internet draft is to highlight the issues with firewalls and Mobile IPv6
    and act as an enabler for further discussion. Issues identified here can be solved
    by developing appropriate solutions in the MIP6 WG.</p>"
