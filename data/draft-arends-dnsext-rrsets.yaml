abstract:
- content: "<p>In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally, there needs to be
    a mechanism that allows for unsigned RRsets in a secure zone. In the current definition
    of DNSSEC [RFC 2535], it is allowed to have 2 types of unsigned records, i.e.
    glue address RRsets and delegation point NS RRsets. There exists several reasons
    to allow other unsigned RRsets, all related to the scalability and maintenance
    of a secure zone.</p>"
