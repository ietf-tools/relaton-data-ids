abstract:
- content: "<p>There exist requirements of provider-provisioned virtual private networks
    (PPVPN) spanning multiple differently implemented SP networks from SPs perspective.
    This document proposes an interworking method at the interface for implementing
    PPVPNs spanning multiple SP networks with different technologies; it proposes
    the establishment of connections making use of GRE, IPsec, Frame Relay, or ATM
    connections at network interface, and describes how required services of the PPVPNs,
    such as security/privacy, quality of service, extranets, dynamic routing, and
    multicast, are achieved through network interface.</p>"
