abstract:
- content: <p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource
    ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are used to support
    Calls. Although it is stated that these mechanisms are applicable to any environment
    (including multi-area), the "Call Path" is determined hop-by-hop by each "Call
    Manager" in sequence along the path of the Call. However, it is desirable to allow
    the Call-initiator to identify the Call Path explicitly in some cases (especially
    in the multi-domain case). This document describes RSVP-TE signaling extensions
    to allow the Call-initiator to identify the Call Path explicitly when transit
    nodes (besides the Call-initiator and Call-terminator) are involved in these Calls.
    Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</p>
