abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of
    network applications and the network service in handling user data. This performance
    data provides information essential in validating service level agreements, fault
    isolation as well as early warnings of greater problems. This document describes
    IPFIX Information Elements related to performance measurement of network based
    applications. In addition, to the performance information several non-metric information
    elements are also included to provide greater context to the reports. The measurements
    use audio/video applications as a base but are not restricted to these class of
    applications.</p>"
