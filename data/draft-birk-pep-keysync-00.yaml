abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern users of messaging systems usually have multiple devices, and
    often desire to send and receive encrypted messages on some or all of their devices.
    Using encryption on multiple devices often results in situations where messages
    cannot be decrypted on the device used to read the message due to a missing private
    key. This document specifies a protocol for secure peer-to-peer synchronization
    of private keys across devices belonging to the same user (pEp Key Synchronization
    Protocol). The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols describe a set of conventions
    for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to the use and
    deployment of secure end-to-end interpersonal messaging. These include, but are
    not limited to, key management, key discovery, and private key handling.</p>"
