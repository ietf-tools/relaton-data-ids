abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise Equipment
    (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a mostly end-to-end
    connectivity while keeping the major threats outside of the home. It is based
    on an actual IPv6 deployment by Swisscom and proposes to allow all packets inbound/outbound
    EXCEPT for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as weak
    passwords) are well-known.</p>"
