abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming in
    order to stimulate discussion. This proposal is a middle ground between the NOID
    and CB128 proposals. This proposed solution relies on verification the crypto-based
    identifier properties (using public-key crypto during uncommon operations), while
    allowing locator rewriting by (border) routers, with no per-packet overhead. The
    solution does have something which could be viewed as a 'stack name' type of identifier,
    but this isn't exposed to upper layer protocols. Instead it ensures that all upper
    layer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while still seeing
    a stable IPv6 address, even though the address internally consists of 64-bits
    worth of subnet locator plus 64-bits of crypto-based identifier. This solution
    (and this draft) is remarkably similar to draft- nordmark-multi6-noid-00.txt;
    only issues related to prevention of redirection attacks differ.</p>"
