abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the decisions made in one pair of applications
    [4][5] that respectively serves and retrieve OpenPGP [3] Certificates and Revocation
    Signatures using the CERT Resources Record [2]. The intent is to provide a discussion
    on the kind of general updates needed to the CERT specification, and some suggested
    specific updates for the OpenPGP sub-type. It is offered in the hope that this
    specification, together with similar efforts for other applications, can be reviewed
    when designing a generic solution or guidelines for storing application keying
    material in the Domain Name System (DNS), should it ever happen.</p>"
