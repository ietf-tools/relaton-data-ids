abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an extension to the OAuth 2.0 Authorization
    Framework [RFC6749] to enable AI agents to obtain delegated access tokens to act
    on behalf of users. It introduces a new authorization request parameter, requested_agent,
    and defines a grant type, urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:agent- authorization_code,
    specifically designed to facilitate explicit user consent for an agent's actions
    and enable the agent to exchange an authorization code for a delegated access
    token using its own authentication credentials (an agent token). The extension
    ensures secure delegation, explicit user consent captured at the authorization
    server, and enhanced auditability through specific token claims that document
    the delegation path from the user to the agent acting via a client application.</p>"
