abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the control plane protocol requirements when
    NVE is not co-located with the hypervisor on a server. A control plane protocol
    (or protocols) between a hypervisor and its associated external NVE(s) is used
    for the hypervisor to populate its virtual machines states to the NVE(s) for further
    handling. This document illustrates the functionalities required by such control
    plane signaling protocols and outlines the high level requirements to be fulfiled.
    Virtual machine states and state transitioning are summarized to help clarifying
    the needed requirements.</p>"
