abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a new TLS Certificate Compression scheme which uses
    a shared dictionary of root and intermediate WebPKI certificates. The scheme smooths
    the transition to post-quantum certificates by eliminating the root and intermediate
    certificates from the TLS certificate chain without impacting trust negotiation.
    It also delivers better compression than alternative proposals whilst ensuring
    fair treatment for both CAs and website operators. It may also be useful in other
    applications which store certificate chains, e.g. Certificate Transparency logs.</p>"
