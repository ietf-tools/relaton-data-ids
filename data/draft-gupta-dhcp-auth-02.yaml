abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a new protocol for DHCP authentication within the
    general framework outlined in RFC 3118 [4]. This protocol uses public-key cryptography,
    in the form of digital signatures, for authentication. This simplifies key management
    and supports mutual authentication between clients and servers belonging to different
    administrative domains.</p>"
