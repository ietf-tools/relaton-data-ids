abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for
    SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to determine the reachability
    path of requests to a target. A new mechanism for media-loopback calls is also
    being defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated which result
    in media being looped back to the originator. This document is a strawman proposal
    for a means of performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback
    mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media-relaying
    B2BUAs.</p>"
