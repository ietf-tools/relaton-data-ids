abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain(SFC) is a ordered set of service functions.
    Packets flow restrictively at the service functions according to the order. To
    enable a network service, operator composes the service function chain logically.
    Though SFC is efficient where network/ service requirements are dynamically changing,
    the reliability of SFC should be guaranteed. This memo describes the considerations
    for benchmarking SFC reliability.</p>"
