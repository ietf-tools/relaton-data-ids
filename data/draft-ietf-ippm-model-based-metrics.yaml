abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new class of Model-Based Metrics designed
    to assess if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target
    Transport Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive
    subpaths. The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to critical infrastructure,
    such as network interconnections or even individual devices, to accurately detect
    if any part of the infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting
    the Target Transport Performance. Model-Based Metrics rely on mathematical models
    to specify a Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite, a set of IP diagnostic tests designed
    to assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet a predetermined
    Target Transport Performance over an Internet path. For Bulk Transport Capacity,
    the IP diagnostics are built using test streams and statistical criteria for evaluating
    the packet transfer that mimic TCP over the complete path. The temporal structure
    of the test stream (e.g., bursts) mimics TCP or other transport protocols carrying
    bulk data over a long path. However, they are constructed to be independent of
    the details of the subpath under test, end systems, or applications. Likewise,
    the success criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the subpath against
    criteria determined by protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport
    Performance of the complete path. The success criteria also does not depend on
    the details of the subpath, end systems, or applications.</p>"
