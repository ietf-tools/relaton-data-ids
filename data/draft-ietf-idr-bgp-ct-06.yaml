abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Intent Driven Service
    Mapping" to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes satisfying
    a certain SLA using BGP. The document describes a framework for classifying underlay
    routes into transport classes and mapping service routes to a specific transport
    class. The "Transport class" construct maps to a desired SLA and can be used to
    realize the "Topology Slice" in 5G Network slicing architecture. This document
    specifies BGP protocol procedures that enable dissemination of such service mapping
    information that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains
    may be administered by the same provider or by closely co-ordinating provider
    networks. A new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for this
    purpose that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding. This
    new address family is called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP CT. BGP CT makes
    it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination address, thus
    avoiding need of multiple loopbacks on the egress node. It carries transport prefixes
    across tunnel domain boundaries (e.g. in Inter-AS Option-C networks), which is
    parallel to BGP LU (SAFI 4). It disseminates "Transport class" information for
    the transport prefixes across the participating domains, which is not possible
    with BGP LU. This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled
    network. Just like BGP LU (SAFI 4), BGP CT family (SAFI 76) is used in inter-
    AS option-C networks. The Service Mapping procedures described in this document
    apply in the same manner to Intra-AS service endpoints as well as Inter-AS option-A,
    option-B, option-C variations. Examples of these variations are given in Appendix
    A.</p>
