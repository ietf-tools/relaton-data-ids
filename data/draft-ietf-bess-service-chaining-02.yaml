abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how service function chains (SFC) can be applied
    to traffic flows using routing in a virtual (overlay) network to steer traffic
    between service nodes. Chains can include services running in routers, on physical
    appliances or in virtual machines. Service chains have applicability at the subscriber
    edge, business edge and in multi-tenant datacenters. The routing function into
    SFCs and between service functions within an SFC can be performed by physical
    devices (routers), be virtualized inside hypervisors, or run as part of a host
    OS. A BGP control plane for route distribution is used to create virtual networks
    implemented using IP MPLS, VXLAN or other suitable encapsulation, where the routes
    within the virtual networks cause traffic to flow through a sequence of service
    nodes that apply packet processing functions to the flows. Two techniques are
    described: in one the service chain is implemented as a sequence of distinct VPNs
    between sets of service nodes that apply each service function; in the other,
    the routes within a VPN are modified through the use of special route targets
    and modified next-hop resolution to achieve the desired result. In both techniques,
    service chains can be created by manual configuration of routes and route targets
    in routing systems, or through the use of a controller which contains a topological
    model of the desired service chains. This document also contains discussion of
    load balancing between network functions, symmetric forward and reverse paths
    when stateful services are involved, and use of classifiers to direct traffic
    into a service chain.</p>"
