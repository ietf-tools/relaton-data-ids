abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a Per Domain Behavior that provides the ability
    to Diffserv nodes located outside Diffserv domain(s), e.g., receiver or other
    Diffserv enabled router to detect when the resources provided by the Diffserv
    domain(s) are not available. The unavailability of resources in the domain is
    monitored and detected by proportionally marking packets whenever the current
    link rate exceeds some pre-configured SLS agreed throughput (bandwidth) threshold.
    It is considered that the SLS agreed throughput threshold is not statically but
    loosely defined in order to allow a more efficient utilization of the Diffserv
    domain(s) and a simpler network management operation. This PDB can be applied
    in association with either a single Diffserv domain or multiple neighboring Diffserv
    domains, when a trust relationship exist between these multiple Diffserv domains.
    This specification is denoted as Resource Unavailability (RU) PDB and it follows
    the guidelines given in [RFC3086].</p>"
