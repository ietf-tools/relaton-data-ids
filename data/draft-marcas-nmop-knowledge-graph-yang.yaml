abstract:
- content: "<p>The success of the YANG language and YANG-based protocols for managing
    the network has unlocked new opportunities in network analytics. However, the
    wide heterogeneity of YANG models hinders the consumption and analysis of network
    data. Besides, data encoding formats and transport protocols will differ depending
    on the network management protocol supported by the network device. These challenges
    call for new data management paradigms that facilitate the discovery, understanding,
    integration and access to silos of heterogenous YANG data, abstracting from the
    complexities of the network devices. This document introduces the knowledge graph
    paradigm has a solution to this data management problem, with focus on YANG-based
    network management. The document provides background on related topics such as
    ontologies and graph standards, and shares guidelines for implementing knowledge
    graphs from YANG data.</p>"
