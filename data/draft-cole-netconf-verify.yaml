abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration
    management protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform sets of active
    tests (i.e., verification) against servers' running configuration over a period
    of time to afford the client and server a more robust and resilient configuration
    management capability. This is of value to commercial enterprise and public networks
    as well as wireless emergency and military networks. We propose an initial new
    NETCONF capability, i.e., verify. The verify capability is defined in the context
    of the verify.yang module listed in the appendix of this document. Associated
    with the verify operation are various test.yang modules to be defined elsewhere.
    However, this document defines a set of interoperability requirements on the development
    of the test.yang modules in order to be controlled through the verify capability.</p>"
