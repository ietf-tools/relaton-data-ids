abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes the use of a longer prefixes in PIO for SLAAC allowing
    a maximum prefix length of /80 with an IID of 48 bits. This would eliminate the
    race to the bottom concerns. This implementation uses the RA/PIO bits to carry
    the variable IID to ensure backwards compatibility. In the past, various IPv6
    addressing models have been proposed based on a subnet hierarchy embedding a 64-bit
    prefix. The last remnant of IPv6 classful addressing is a inflexible interface
    identifier boundary at /64. This document proposes flexibility to the fixed position
    of that boundary for interface addressing.</p>"
