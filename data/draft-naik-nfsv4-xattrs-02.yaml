abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to existing NFSv4 operations to allow
    file extended attributes (here forth also referred to as xattrs) to be manipulated
    in the protocol. An xattr is a file system feature that allows opaque metadata,
    not interpreted by the file system, to be associated with files and directories
    and are supported by many modern file systems. New file attributes are proposed
    to allow clients to query the server for xattr support, and new operations to
    get and set xattrs on file system objects.</p>"
