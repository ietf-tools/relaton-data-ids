abstract:
- content: "<p>In telecommunication networks, the signalling path between a calling
    user and a called user can be divided into smaller parts, referred to as traffic
    legs. Each traffic leg may span networks belonging to different operators, and
    will have its own characteristics that can be different from other traffic legs
    in the same call. The directionality in traffic legs relates to a SIP request
    creating a dialogue and stand-alone SIP request. This document defines a new SIP
    URI parameter, 'iotl', which can be used in a SIP URI to indicate that the entity
    associated with the address, or an entity responsible for the host part of the
    address, represents the end of a specific traffic leg. The 'iotl' parameter is
    defined in order to fulfil requirements from the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP), but it can also be used in other network environments.</p>"
