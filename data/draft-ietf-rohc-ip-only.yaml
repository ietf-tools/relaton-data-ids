abstract:
- content: "<p>The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC (RFC 3095) defines
    a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles)
    for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), IP/UDP, and also a profile
    for uncompressed packet streams. However, no profile was defined for compression
    of IP only, which has been identified as a missing piece in RFC 3095. This document
    defines a ROHC compression profile for IP, similar to the IP/UDP profile defined
    by RFC 3095, but simplified to exclude UDP, and enhanced to compress IP header
    chains of arbitrary length. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
