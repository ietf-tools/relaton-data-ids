abstract:
- content: "<p>Discovery of the correct Location Information Server (LIS) in the local
    access network is necessary for Devices that wish to acquire location information
    from the network. A method is described for the discovery of a LIS in the access
    network serving a Device. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options for
    IP versions 4 and 6 are defined that specify a domain name. This domain name is
    then used as input to a URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR) resolution process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
