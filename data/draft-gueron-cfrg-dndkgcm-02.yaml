abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an authenticated encryption algorithm called
    Double Nonce Derive Key AES-GCM (DNDK-GCM). It operates with a 32- byte root key
    and is designed to encrypt with a 24-byte random nonce and optionally to provide
    for key commitment. Encryption takes the root key and a 15-byte portion of the
    random nonce, and derives a fresh 32-byte encryption key and (optionally) a key
    commitment value. Then, it invokes AES-GCM with the derived key and the remaining
    bytes of the nonce, and outputs the ciphertext, authentication tag and the key
    commitment value. Although this is not the primary use case, it is also possible
    to use DNDK-GCM with a non-repeating but non-random nonce (i.e., a "counter- based
    nonce"). The low collision probability in a collection of 24-byte random nonces
    and the per-nonce derivation of an encryption key extend the lifetime of the root
    key, and the scheme can support processing up to 2^64 bytes under a given root
    key. DNDK-GCM introduces a relatively small overhead compared to using AES-GCM
    directly, and its security relies only on the standard assumption that AES acts
    as a pseudorandom permutation.</p>
