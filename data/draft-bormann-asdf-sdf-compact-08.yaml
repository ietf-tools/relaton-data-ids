abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models that describe
    Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for interaction over a network.
    It was created as a common language for use in the development of the One Data
    Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions. Tools convert this format to database
    formats and other serializations as needed. The SDF format is mainly intended
    for interchange between machine generation and machine processing. However, there
    is often a need for humans to look at and edit SDF models. Similar to the way
    Relax-NG as defined in ISO/IEC 19757-2 has an XML- based format and a compact
    format (its Annex C), this specification defines a compact format to go along
    SDF's JSON-based format. The present version of this document is mostly a proof
    of concept, but was deemed useful to obtain initial feedback on the approach taken.</p>"
