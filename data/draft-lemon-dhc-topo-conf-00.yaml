abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant functionality
    beyond that which is described in the DHCP base specifications. One aspect of
    this functionality is support for context-specific configuration information.
    This memo describes some such features and makes recommendations as to how they
    can be used.</p>"
