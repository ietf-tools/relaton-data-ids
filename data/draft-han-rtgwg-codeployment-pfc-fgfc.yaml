abstract:
- content: "<p>The demand for lossless network transmission and the application of
    flow control mechanisms have expanded from DCNs (Data Center Networks) to WANs(Wide
    Area Networks). To mitigate PFC - related issues in WANs, the fine - grained flow
    control is proposed. This mechanism aims to achieve precise control at flow /
    tenant levels, limits flow control to specified paths and slices, and provides
    intelligent congestion backpressure. As current DCN already adopts PFC mechanisms,
    the fine-grained flow control in WANs needs to work with PFC in DCNs to achieve
    end-to-end flow control.</p>"
