abstract:
- content: "<p>DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple
    paths for a DCCP session could improve resource usage within the network and,
    thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    to network failure. Multipath DCCP provides the ability to simultaneously use
    multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional
    DCCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service
    to applications as DCCP and it provides the components necessary to establish
    and use multiple DCCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</p>"
