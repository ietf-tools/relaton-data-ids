abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) addresses the needs
    of operators and application developers to represent multiple types of policy
    rules. This document defines a single common extensible framework for representing
    different types of policy rules, in the form of a set of information models, that
    is independent of language, protocol, repository, and the level of abstraction
    of the content of the policy rule. This enables a common set of concepts defined
    in this set of information models to be mapped into different data models that
    use different languages, protocols, and repositories to optimize their usage.
    The definition of common policy concepts also provides better interoperability
    by ensuring that each data model can share a set of common concepts, independent
    of its level of detail or the language, protocol, and/or repository that it is
    using. Specifically, this document defines three information models:</p>"
