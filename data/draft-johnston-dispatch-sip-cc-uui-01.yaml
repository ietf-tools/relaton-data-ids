abstract:
- content: "<p>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information
    Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed. As networks move to SIP it is
    important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP
    networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end
    transparency. This document discusses requirements and approaches. This extension
    will also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing similar services and interworking
    with ISDN services. Example use cases include an exchange between two user agents,
    retargeting by a proxy, and redirection. An example application is an Automatic
    Call Distributor (ACD) in a contact center.</p>"
