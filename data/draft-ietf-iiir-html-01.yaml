abstract:
- content: "<p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) can be used to represent Hypertext
    news, mail, online documentation, and collaborative hypermedia; Menus of options;
    Database query results; Simple structured documents with inlined graphics. Hypertext
    views of existing bodies of information. The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links
    related information throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for
    throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing linked information,
    and all W3 compatible programs are required to be capable of handling HTML. W3
    uses an Internet protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer
    representations to be negotiated between client and server, the result being returned
    in an extended MIME message. HTML is therefore just one, but an important one,
    of the representations used with W3. HTML is proposed as a MIME content type.</p>"
