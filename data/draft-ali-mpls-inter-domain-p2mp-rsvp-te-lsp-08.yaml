abstract:
- content: "<p>Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may
    be established using signaling techniques described in [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875]
    does not address many issues that comes when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in an inter-domain
    networks. Specifically, one of the issues in inter-domain networks is how to allow
    computation of a loosely routed P2MP-TE LSP such that it is re-merge free. Another
    issue is reoptimization of a P2MP-TE tree vs. reoptimization of an individual
    destination, as loosely routing domain border node is not aware of the reoptimization
    scope. This document provides a framework and required protocol extensions needed
    for establishing, controlling and reoptimizing P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in
    inter-domain networks. This document borrows inter-domain TE terminology from
    [RFC 4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document, a domain is considered to
    be any collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management
    or path computational responsibility. Examples of such domains include Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).</p>"
