abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet domain names are currently limited to a very restricted character
    set. This document proposes the introduction of a new 'zero-level' domain (ZLD)
    to allow the use of arbitrary characters from the Universal Character Set (ISO
    10646/Unicode) in domain names. The proposal is fully backwards compatible and
    does not need any changes to DNS. Version 02 is reissued without changes just
    to keep this draft available.</p>"
