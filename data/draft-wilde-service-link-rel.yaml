abstract:
- content: <p>Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that
    are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider.
    Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web services" or "Web APIs".
    This specification defines link relations that represent relationships from Web
    services or APIs to resources that provide documentation, descriptions, metadata,
    or status information for these resources. Documentation is primarily intended
    for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated
    consumers. Metadata provides information about a service's context. This specification
    also defines a link relation to identify status resources that are used to represent
    information about service status.</p>
