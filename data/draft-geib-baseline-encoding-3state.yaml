abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 2 transport services like MPLS offer only 2 states to encode
    ECN state, if DiffServ based Class of Service is operated. Still, a mechanism
    by which PCN egress nodes can differentiate between the normal behaviour state,
    admission stop state control state and flow termination state, by using PCN marking
    of packets is desirable. This document describes how threshold and excess marking
    can be combined with PCN baseline encoding. A minimalistic approach like the one
    described in the following has some obvious shortcomings. These shortcomings are
    also presented and discussed. Currently, the aim of this document is to trigger
    experimentation feasability studies. Standardisation will be pursued in the future
    based on the results of the studies.</p>"
