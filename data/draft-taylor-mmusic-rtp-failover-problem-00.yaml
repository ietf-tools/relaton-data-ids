abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-based functions that terminate large numbers of RTP media streams
    and that offer high availability, such as session border controllers or conference
    bridges, typically preserve the same IP address towards sources of RTP media across
    a failover event because it is impractical to signal a change of IP address towards
    large numbers of RTP sources sufficiently rapidly to keep media interruption intervals
    within acceptable limits. The need to preserve the IP address of RTP media terminating
    functions across a failover event imposes architectural requirements that can
    be difficult or costly to meet, particularly in network function virtualization
    environments. This document describes the problem, outlines the key requirements
    for a solution, and discusses the merits and shortcomings of various existing
    approaches to solving the problem, before arguing that a new solution is needed.</p>"
