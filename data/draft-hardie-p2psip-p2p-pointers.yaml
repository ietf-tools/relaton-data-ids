abstract:
- content: "<p>Identifying overlay networks and the resources found within in them
    presents a number of bootstrapping problems. While those hard problems are under
    discussion, this draft proposes a small set of URI-based mechanisms which are
    intended to be generically useful for providing pointers to peer-to-peer overlay
    networks in web pages, email messages, and other textual media.</p>"
