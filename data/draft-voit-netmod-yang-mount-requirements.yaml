abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications want simple ways to reference and access YANG objects
    and subtrees. These simplifications might include aliasing of local YANG information.
    These simplifications might include remote referencing of YANG information distributed
    across network. For such applications, development complexity is a barrier to
    YANG usage and therefore must be minimized. Specific aspects of complexity developers
    want to ignore include: o whether context specific aliases and paths to the same
    information can be exposed on a single device, o whether authoritative information
    is actually sourced from local or remote datastores, o whether the application
    needs to manage the overhead of session establishment and maintenance in order
    to access information on remote datastores, o whether objects have been locally
    cached or not, and o whether there is a mix of controllers, NMSs, and/or CLI which
    have access permission to update the primary copy of a particular object. The
    solution requirements described in this document detail what is needed to support
    application access to authoritative network YANG objects locally (via aliasing),
    or remotely from controllers or peering network devices in such a way to meet
    these goals.</p>"
