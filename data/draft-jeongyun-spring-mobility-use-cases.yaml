abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability for a node to specify a forwarding path, other than the
    normal shortest path, that a particular packet will traverse, benefits a number
    of network functions. Source-based routing mechanisms have previously been specified
    for network protocols, but have not seen widespread adoption. In this context,
    the term 'source' means 'the point at which the explicit route is imposed'. The
    objective of this document is to illustrate some use cases that need to be taken
    into account by the Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture.</p>"
