abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently a few routing protocols use IPSec for authenticating their
    protocol packets. There are known issues with using IPSec with the routing protocols
    and this draft proposes an alternative Generic Authentication mechanism that can
    be used so that these protocols do not depend upon IPSec for security. The mechanism
    introduced in this draft is generic and can be used by any protocol that currently
    uses IPSec for authentication. While this mechanism is generic, this draft specifically
    looks at OSPFv3 and how it can use the mechanism described herein.</p>"
