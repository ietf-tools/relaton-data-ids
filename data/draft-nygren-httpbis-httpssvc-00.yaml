abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies an "HTTPSSVC" DNS resource record type to facilitate
    the lookup of information needed to make connections for HTTPS URIs. The HTTPSSVC
    DNS RR mechanism allows an HTTPS origin hostname to be served from multiple network
    services, each with associated parameters (such as transport protocol and keying
    material for encrypting TLS SNI). It also provides a solution for the inability
    of the DNS to allow a CNAME to be placed at the apex of a domain name. Finally,
    it provides a way to indicate that the origin supports HTTPS without having to
    resort to redirects, allowing clients to remove HTTP from the bootstrapping process.
    By allowing this information to be bootstrapped in the DNS, it allows for clients
    to learn of alternative services before their first contact with the origin. This
    arrangement offers potential benefits to both performance and privacy. TO BE REMOVED:
    This proposal is inspired by and based on recent DNS usage proposals such as ALTSVC,
    ANAME, and ESNIKEYS (as well as long standing desires to have SRV or a functional
    equivalent implemented for HTTP). These proposals each provide an important function
    but are potentially incompatible with each other, such as when an origin is load-balanced
    across multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN). Furthermore, these each add potential
    cases for adding additional record lookups in-addition to AAAA/A lookups. This
    design attempts to provide a unified framework that encompasses the key functionality
    of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility for addressing similar
    future challenges.</p>'
