abstract:
- content: <p>This document is a companion to the ION working group's architecture
    document, "IPv6 over Non Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks". It provides
    specific details on how to apply the IPv6 over NBMA architecture to ATM networks.
    This architecture allows conventional host-side operation of the IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery protocol, while also supporting the establishment of 'shortcut' ATM
    forwarding paths (when using SVCs). Operation over administratively configured
    Point to Point PVCs is also supported. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
