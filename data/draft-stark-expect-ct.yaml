abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new HTTP header, named Expect-CT, that allows
    web host operators to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed Certificate
    Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts. When configured
    in enforcement mode, user agents (UAs) will remember that hosts expect SCTs and
    will refuse connections that do not conform to the UA's Certificate Transparency
    policy. When configured in report-only mode, UAs will report the lack of valid
    SCTs to a URI configured by the host, but will allow the connection. By turning
    on Expect-CT, web host operators can discover misconfigurations in their Certificate
    Transparency deployments and ensure that misissued certificates accepted by UAs
    are discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs.</p>"
