abstract:
- content: "<p>Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity which last longer than
    one retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance. The reason for the
    performance degradation is that TCP interprets segment loss induced by connectivity
    disruptions as a sign of congestion, resulting in repeated backoffs of the retransmission
    timer. This leads in turn to a deferred detection of the re-establishment of the
    connection since TCP waits until the next retransmission timeout occurs before
    attempting the retransmission. This document describes how standard ICMP messages
    can be exploited to disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss
    caused by long connectivity disruptions. Moreover, a revert strategy of the retransmission
    timer is specified that enables a more prompt detection of whether the connectivity
    to a previously disconnected peer node has been restored or not. The specified
    algorithm is a TCP sender-only modification that effectively improves TCP performance
    in presence of connectivity disruptions.</p>"
