abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual dial-up allows many separate and autonomous protocol domains
    to share common access infrastructure including modems, Access Servers, and ISDN
    routers. Previous RFCs have specified protocols for supporting IP dial-up via
    SLIP [1] and multiprotocol dial-up via PPP [2]. This document describes the Layer
    Two Forwarding protocol (L2F) which permits the tunneling of the link layer (i.e.,
    HDLC, async HDLC, or SLIP frames) of higher level protocols. Using such tunnels,
    it is possible to divorce the location of the initial dial- up server from the
    location at which the dial-up protocol connection is terminated and access to
    the network provided.</p>"
