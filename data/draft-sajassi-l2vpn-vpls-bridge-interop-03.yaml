abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the main motivations behind VPLS is its ability to provide connectivity
    not only among customer routers and servers/hosts but also among customer bridges.
    If only connectivity among customer IP routers/hosts was desired, then IPLS solution
    [IPLS] could have been used. The strength of the VPLS solution is that it can
    provide connectivity to both bridge and non-bridge types of CE devices. VPLS is
    expected to deliver the same level of service that current enterprise users are
    accustomed to from their own enterprise bridged networks today or the same level
    of service that they receive from their Ethernet Service Providers using IEEE
    802.1ad-based networks [P802.1ad] (or its predecessor â€“ QinQ-based network). When
    CE devices are IEEE bridges, then there are certain issues and challenges that
    need to be accounted for in a VPLS network. Majority of these issues have currently
    been addressed in IEEE 802.1ad standard for provider bridges and they need to
    be addressed for VPLS networks. This draft discusses these issues and wherever
    possible, the recommended solutions to these issues.</p>"
