abstract:
- content: "<p>VPN information can be piggybacked into BGP to allow a network-based
    VPN to auto-discover its membership and adequate information needed before any
    data exchange between private sites takes place across the backbone. Other drafts
    (e.g.[VPN-RFC2547]) also piggyback VPN information onto the backbone instance
    of BGP. However, [VPN- RFC2547] implicitly allows only for a single reachability
    mechanism (also BGP piggybacking) and a single tunneling mechanism (MPLS). This
    draft allows for the explicit indication of the reachability modes supported (e.g.
    piggybacking or virtual router) and the tunneling mechanisms supported, by a VPN
    device. The purpose of this draft is to define a common VPN information protocol
    that can be used for both piggybacking and virtual router schemes. It allows for
    the auto-discovery of the nodes in a particular VPN, the selection of the reachability
    mechanism to use, and the selection of the tunneling protocol to use.</p>"
