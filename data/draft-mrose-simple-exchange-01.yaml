abstract:
- content: "<p>The Common Presence and Instant Messaging profile (CPIM) is a set of
    syntax and semantics for instant messaging (IM) and online presence services,
    independent of the underlying transfer infrastructure. The Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) negotiates session information for media streams. This memo defines
    a BEEP profile, IMSX, for exchanging CPIM messages after SIP has performed signalling.</p>"
