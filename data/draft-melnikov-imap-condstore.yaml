abstract:
- content: "<p>Often, multiple IMAP clients need to coordinate changes to a common
    IMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients for the same user, and multiple
    users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients need a mechanism to synchronize
    state changes for messages within the mailbox. They must be able to guarantee
    that only one client can change message state (e.g., message flags or annotations)
    at any time. An example of such an application is use of an IMAP mailbox as a
    message queue with multiple dequeueing clients. The Conditional Store facility
    provides a protected update mechanism for message state information that can detect
    and resolve conflicts between multiple writers.</p>"
