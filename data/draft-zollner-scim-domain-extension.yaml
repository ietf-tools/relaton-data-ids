abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol supports
    creation and management of identity resources such as users between a client and
    a service provider. In some instances, a SCIM service provider may maintain a
    list of DNS domains that an organization using that service has registered for
    their exclusive use with the service. This registration of domains is frequently
    tied to some form of ownership verification for each domain. This document defines
    an extension to the SCIM protocol introducing a new 'VerifiedDomains' resource
    type in order to allow a SCIM client to confirm what domains have had ownership
    verified by the SCIM service provider, as well as some information about whether
    the User resource's userName and emails attributes require domain verification
    in order for a value to possess that domain suffix.</p>"
