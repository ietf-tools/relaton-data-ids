    management protocol that provides detailed information about IPv4 and Ipv6 packets
    traversing a network element. The primary function of LFAP is the reliable delivery
    of large volumes of packet header derived information from a network element,
    termed Connection Control Entity (CCE) to a Flow Accounting Server (FAS) of current
    or historical flows for billing, capacity planning security, or traffic engineering
    purposes.</p>"
