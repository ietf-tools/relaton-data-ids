abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft extends the existing PMIP-based mobility management protocol
    to support a more distributed model by introducing two new logical functions to
    enable distributed anchoring and location management. Given the consideration
    that, the MN may not always require the mobility support that requires the use
    of the global prefix and additional network resources, this draft supports the
    option to leverage the extended properties of IPv6 prefixes source address selection
    hint (i.e. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol and its Prefix Information Option)
    to enable the UE's selection of IPv6 prefix according to its service/application's
    mobility support requirement. When the extended prefix properties feature is supported
    by the MN, this draft enable the MN to select the appropriate prefix according
    to the mechanism as described in [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties]. Once the
    IPv6 prefix is determined, the rest of the DMM mechanism is similar to the luo
    draft [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].</p>"
