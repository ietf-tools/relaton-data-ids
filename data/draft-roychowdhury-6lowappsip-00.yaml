abstract:
- content: <p>The Smart Grid [8] initiative is an effort in modernization of the electricity
    grid using communication technology with the primary goals of reducing energy
    consumption, reducing cost (utilities and consumers), increasing reliability and
    the creation of new services for all participants in the value chain. The core
    focus of this initiative is the specification of a 'Communications Overlay' network
    which can help facilitate intelligent communication (discovery, session establishment,
    routing, addressing to name a few) between various nodes of the heterogeneous
    Smart Grid network. Roychowdhury Expires - April 2010 [page 1] Motivation for
    SIP as an application protocol for 6lowpan devices One of the 'network segments'
    of the Smart Grid network is the Home Area Network (HAN) and how residential and/or
    commercial devices (such as TV, washing machine, surveillance camera, etc.) interact
    with the smart meter/energy management system and vice-versa. This draft is an
    initial input for consideration of SIP as an appropriate application protocol
    for use inside devices that operate over low powered IP networks. The authors
    do NOT propose the use of SIP for all HAN devices. Rather, the authors believe
    that SIP is an appropriate protocol for certain categories of devices and therefore,
    the 6lowapp group should consider SIP as an appropriate protocol for the same.
    The final protocol that is ideal for a particular device communication will always
    be determined by the use-case(s) that are envisioned for the same. This draft
    does NOT discuss the use of SIP inside the smart meter (while the authors believe
    that the smart meter would also benefit from SIP, that is the scope of another
    draft and does not apply to the 6lowapp work). Therefore, in all diagrams and
    references, the authors have used the term 'Energy Management System (EMS)' to
    refer to the customer premise EMS that may or may not be the smart meter itself.
    Conventions used in this document In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent
    by the client and server respectively. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1]. The term
    EMS refers to the customer premise Energy Management System which may be the smart
    meter or an adjunct devices that communicates with the utility core network for
    the purposes of energy management and billing.</p>
