abstract:
- content: "<p>Always On/Dynamic ISDN (AO/DI) is a networking service that provides
    an always-available connection to TCP/IP-based services through a specific wide
    area connection. This service provides several advantages over current practices
    for dial-up access to Internet services. * For the end-user, there is no need
    to dial-up the service each time access is desired. * For the Internet service
    provider, it is possible to give the end-user a notification, such as the arrival
    of new mail. * For the Local Exchange Carrier, the switched circuit trunk utilization
    is more efficient.</p>"
