abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Application Level Gateway (ALG) for the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) by which IP addresses in the SIP message and
    in the SDP body are statically mapped from one group to another. The SIP ALG is
    a specific case of an Application Level Gateway as described in [1]. Transparent
    use of SIP-based devices in a Network Address Translation (NAT) scenario requires
    that modifications be made to the SIP messages. These modifications are performed
    by the ALG.</p>"
