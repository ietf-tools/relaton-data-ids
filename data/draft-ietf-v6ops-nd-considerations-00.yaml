abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a key protocol of IPv6 first-hop. ND uses
    multicast extensively and trusts all hosts. In some scenarios like wireless networks,
    multicast can be inefficient. In other scenarios like public access networks,
    hosts may not be trustable. Consequently, ND has potential issues in various scenarios.
    The issues and the solutions for them are documented in more than 30 RFCs. It
    is difficult to keep track of all these issues and solutions. Therefore, an overview
    and some guidelines are useful. This document firstly summarizes the known ND
    issues and optimization solutions into a one-stop reference. Analyzing these solutions
    reveals an insight: isolating hosts is effective in preventing ND issues. Four
    isolation methods are proposed and their applicability is discussed. Guidelines
    are then described for selecting a suitable isolation method based on the deployment
    scenario.</p>"
