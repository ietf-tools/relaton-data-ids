abstract:
- content: "<p>The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to
    be ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a limitation
    for deploying current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized,
    e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6. This evolution in user traffic demand is tackled
    by a different approach for IP mobility, called Distributed Mobility Management,
    which is focusing on moving the mobility anchors from the core network and pushing
    them closer to the users, at the edge of the network. The work presented here
    copes with the distributed approach, describing a novel solution for distributed
    mobility management support in a flat architecture without central mobility anchors.
    This document strictly abides by the two principles: (a)The movement of MN is
    transparent to CN. (b)MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related signaling.MAAR
    and AAA are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the host.</p>"
