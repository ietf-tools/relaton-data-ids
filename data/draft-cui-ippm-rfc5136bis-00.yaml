abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the metric of network capacity, including link
    capacity aspect, router capacity aspect and path capacity aspect. RFC5136 has
    defined link capacity and path capacity, where the router impact is implicitly
    considered in link capacity. However, in this document, router capacity is considerred
    as a separate factor of path capacity, no longer a factor of link capacity. This
    document explicitly describes the router capacity and its impact to network capacity,
    e.g. how to evaluate path capacity. This document is derived from RFC5136 and
    obsoletes RFC5136.</p>"
