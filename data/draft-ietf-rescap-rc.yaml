abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes version 3 of the Resource Catalog. The Resource
    Catalog (RC) is a service for storing and obtaining metadata that describes network-accessible
    resources. This service is primarily intended for use by clients prior to accessing,
    or attempting to access, a particular resource. The RC service may thus be used
    (for example) to inform a client as to which of a variety of features are supported
    by the resource, or which methods may be used to access the resource, or which
    of a small set of locations may be used to access the resource.</p>"
