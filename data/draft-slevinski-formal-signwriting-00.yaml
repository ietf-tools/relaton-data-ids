abstract:
- content: "<p>Sutton SignWriting is the universal and complete solution for written
    sign language. It has been applied by a wide and deep international community
    of sign language users. Sutton SignWriting is an international standard for writing
    sign languages by hand or with computers. From education to research, from entertainment
    to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people are using it to write
    signed languages. Formal SignWriting (FSW) is a faithful character-encoding of
    Sutton SignWriting based on 2-dimensional mathematics. FSW defines a formal language
    for written sign languages where any sign of any sign language can be written
    as a string of ASCII characters. The mathematical names are explained with tokens
    and regular expression patterns. Symbol keys reference the Sutton SignWriting
    Characters. Coordinates are used for 2-dimensional placement. Signs are written
    in a spatial SignBox, where each symbol is positioned with a 2-dimension coordinate.
    For sorting, each sign can have an optional temporal sequence of symbols that
    is outside of the SignBox. To create sentences, signs are written sequentially,
    interspersed with punctuation symbols. The styling string of Formal SignWriting
    uses a lite markup to define a variety of styling options. The entire sign can
    be customized for padding, coloring, and size. Individual symbols within a sign
    can be customized for coloring and size. For SVG, class names and IDs can be defined.
    The query language of Formal SignWriting uses a lite markup, similar to FSW, to
    define a variety of searching possibilities. The spatial SignBox can be searched
    for symbols or ranges of symbols. For each symbol or range, the search can specify
    if the symbol only needs to be found somewhere in the SignBox, or if the symbol
    needs to be found near certain coordinates. The temporal sequence can be searched
    for starting symbols, written as a sequential list of symbols and ranges of symbols.
    When searching the temporal sequence, the search results will be limited to signs
    that start with a matching temporal sequence. Each query string is transformed
    into one or more regular expressions. The regular expressions are used to quickly
    search large amounts of data. Formal SignWriting has been specifically designed
    to integrate with standard browser technology. Four main components make this
    integration possible: 1) Font Technology, 2) Scalar Vector Graphics, 3) HTML and
    CSS, and 4) a JavaScript Library. Formal SignWriting is ASCII based, so it is
    compatible with and optimized for UTF-8. A Unicode character design is proposed
    that is isomorphic to Formal SignWriting. This memo defines a conceptual character
    encoding map for the Internet community. It is published for reference, examination,
    implementation, and evaluation. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
