abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing transport protocols aren't designed to work well on multi-homed
    and multi-addressed hosts. TLC-FM is a transport layer common framework, which
    stores multihoming related information and provides common functions and multihoming
    functions for all the transport protocols. In this framework, address information
    for each remote host and some routing information for each next-hop is stored
    and shared by each transport protocol. Also in this framework, incoming packet's
    address fields are re-written from the on-wire address to the original one that
    is expected by transport protocols. This is true for outgoing packets as well.</p>"
