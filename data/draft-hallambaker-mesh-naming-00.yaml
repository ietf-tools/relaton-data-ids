abstract:
- content: "<p>The importance of naming in information systems is explained with reference
    to a typical use case. Existing Internet naming systems attempt to strike a balance
    between usability and machine readability. An alternative approach in which separate
    classes of identifiers are introduced for human and machine interaction is described.
    Human Interaction Identifiers are interpreted in the context in which they are
    used and are thus more compact and offer a superior user experience. Strong Internet
    Names are a form of Machine Interaction Identifier that are backwards compatible
    with existing Internet names that include a DNS address and are cryptographically
    bound to a security policy governing interpretation. The application of these
    approaches in the Mathematical Mesh is described. This document is also available
    online at http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-naming.html .</p>"
