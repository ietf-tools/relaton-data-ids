abstract:
- content: "<p>HNEWS [1] is an HTTP-tunneling variant of the NNTP news protocol. This
    document defines the format of Uniform Resource Locators(URLs) identifying news
    messages and groups provided by HNEWS servers. The syntax of 'hnews' URLs is designed
    to be compatible with the current common usage of the 'news' URL scheme. Specifically,
    the 'hnews' URL scheme is designed according to recommendations made in [NEWS_URL_SCHEME].
    [NEWS_URL_SCHEME] is based on the general specification of all URL schemes in
    'Uniform Resource Locators (URL): Generic Syntax and Semantics' [RFC URI SYNTAX].</p>"
