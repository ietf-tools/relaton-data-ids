abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like
    to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS network while
    reducing existing complexity.In this document, we propose to use the PCE as a
    central controller so that LSP can be calculated/signaled/initiated/downloaded/managed
    through a centralized PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while
    leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This draft describes
    the use cases for using the PCE as the central controller where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded/
    maintained through extending the current PCE architectures and extending the PCEP.</p>"
