abstract:
- content: "<p>The GeoPriv PIDF-LO specification provides a flexible and versatile
    means to represent location information. There are, however, circumstances that
    arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented so that
    the number of options that need to be implemented in order to make use of it are
    reduced. There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained
    in a PIDF-LO for message and call routing applications. For such applications
    to interoperate successfully location information will need to be normative and
    more constrained than is currently described in the PIDF-LO specification. This
    paper makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent and interpret locations
    in a PIDF-LO. It further looks at existing communications standards that make
    use of geodetic information for routing purposes and recommends a subset of GML
    that MUST be implemented by applications to allow message routing to occur.</p>"
