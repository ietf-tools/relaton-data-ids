abstract:
- content: "<p>Aggregation has been proposed as one possible solution to the scalability
    problem of the Internet Integrated Services. The current suggestions for aggregation
    are based on measurement-based admission control, which allows for the omission
    of RSVP soft state in the interior routers of an aggregating domain. However,
    measurement-based admission control has certain flaws which may lead to over-reservations
    on links in the network under certain conditions. This can result in packet losses
    for reserved traffic. Hence, we believe that it will be necessary to discuss the
    possibility of using parameter-based admission control with aggregation. In this
    document, we present a technique for using parameter-based admission control with
    aggregation as a basis for further discussions, and we evaluate possible advantages
    and disadvantages.</p>"
