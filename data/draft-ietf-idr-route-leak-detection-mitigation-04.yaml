abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition] provides a definition
    of the route leak problem, and also enumerates several types of route leaks. This
    document first examines which of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated
    by the existing origin validation (OV) [RFC 6811]. It is recognized that OV offers
    a limited detection and mitigation capability against route leaks. This document
    specifies enhancements that significantly extend the route-leak prevention, detection,
    and mitigation capabilities of BGP. One solution component involves carrying a
    per-hop route-leak protection (RLP) field in BGP updates. The RLP field is proposed
    be carried in a new optional transitive attribute, called BGP RLP attribute. The
    solution is meant to be initially implemented as an enhancement of BGP without
    requiring BGPsec [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol]. However, when BGPsec is deployed
    in the future, the solution can be incorporated in BGPsec, enabling cryptographic
    protection for the RLP field. That would be one way of implementing the proposed
    solution in a secure way. The document also includes a stopgap method for detection
    and mitigation of route leaks for an intermediate phase when OV is deployed but
    BGP protocol on the wire is unchanged.</p>"
