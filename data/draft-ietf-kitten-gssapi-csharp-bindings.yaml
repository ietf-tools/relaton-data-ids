- content: "<p>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
    offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety
    of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document specifies the C# language
    bindings for GSS-API which is described at a language independent conceptual level
    in RFC 2743 [RFC2743]. The GSS-API C# bindings were designed to emulate the Java
    bindings as defined in RFC 2853 [RFC2853].</p>"
