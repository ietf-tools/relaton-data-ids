abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure shell (SSH) traditionally offers its secure services over
    an insecure network using the TCP transport protocol. This document defines mechanisms
    to run the SSH protocol over HTTP/3 using Extended CONNECT. Running SSH over HTTP/3
    enables additional benefits such as the scalability offered by HTTP multiplexing,
    relying on TLS for secure channel establishment leveraging X.509 certificates,
    HTTP Authentication schemes for client and server authentication, UDP port forwarding
    and stronger resilience against packet injection attacks and middlebox interference.</p>"
