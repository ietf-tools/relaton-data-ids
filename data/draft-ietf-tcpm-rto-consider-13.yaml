abstract:
- content: <p>Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to
    ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion
    along a network path). While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss,
    protocols ultimately can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation
    to declare a packet "lost". Each implementation of a time-based loss detection
    mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness and therefore
    no implementation suits all situations. This document provides high-level requirements
    for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in the Internet. Within
    the requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars that best
    address each situation.</p>
