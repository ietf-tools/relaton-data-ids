abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the mechanism of IPv6 Multicast Source Routing
    (MSR6), covering the encapsulation and forwarding processes in the data plane.
    It introduces the hierarchical bitstring structure (HBS) to organize replication
    information, and represent more information than flat bit strings. It indicates
    multicast forwarding behavior based on the local bitstring forwarding table, requires
    less BIFT state and improve scalability.</p>"
