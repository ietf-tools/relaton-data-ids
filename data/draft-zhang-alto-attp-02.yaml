abstract:
- content: <p>Currently P2P applications have accounts for large cross-ISP traffic.
    This document proposes a method to reduce cross-ISP traffic by setting cooperative
    ISP-friendly trackers in the ISP's network. Through improving the random node
    selection mechanism in P2P tracker-based application, we can effectively reduce
    cross-ISP traffic as well as the cost of network equipments and network operation.
    Conventions used in this document In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent
    by the client and server respectively. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
