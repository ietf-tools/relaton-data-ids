abstract:
- content: "<p>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers, such as
    RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the Internet today to provide authentication
    and authorization services for dial-up computers. Mobile IP for IPv4 requires
    strong authentication between the mobile node and its home agent. When the mobile
    node shares an AAA Security Association with its home AAA server, however, it
    is possible to use that AAA Security Association to create derived Mobility Security
    Associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and again between the
    mobile node and the foreign agent currently offering connectivity to the mobile
    node. This document specifies extensions to Mobile IP registration messages that
    can be used to create Mobility Security Associations between the mobile node and
    its home agent, and/or between the mobile node and a foreign agent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
