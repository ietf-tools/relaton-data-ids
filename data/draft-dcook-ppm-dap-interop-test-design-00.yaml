abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a common test interface for implementations of
    the Distributed Aggregation Protocol for Privacy Preserving Measurement (DAP-PPM)
    and describes how this test interface can be used to perform interoperation testing
    between the implementations. Tests are orchestrated with containers, and new test-only
    APIs are introduced to provision DAP-PPM tasks and initiate processing.</p>"
