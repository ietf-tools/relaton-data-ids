abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency
    for critical flows. This document defines how to leverage Segment Routing over
    IPv6 (SRv6) to implement bounded latency. Specifically, new SRv6 SID function
    is used to specify transmission time (cycles) of a packet. When forwarding devices
    along the path follow the instructions carried in the packet, the bounded latency
    is achieved. This mechanism of latency guarantee is called Cycle Specified Queuing
    and Forwarding (CSQF) which is defined in [I-D.chen-detnet-sr-based-bounded-latency].</p>"
