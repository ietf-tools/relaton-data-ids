- content: "<p>At the first meeting of the Path Aware Networking Research Group, the
    research group agreed to catalog and analyze past efforts to develop and deploy
    Path Aware technologies, most of which were unsuccessful, in order to extract
    insights and lessons for path-aware networking researchers. This document contains
    that catalog and analysis.</p>"
