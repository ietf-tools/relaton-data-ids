abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol
    (LISP) to create Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). LISP is used to provide segmentation
    in both the LISP data plane and control plane. These VPNs can be created over
    the top of the Internet or over private transport networks, and can be implemented
    by Enterprises or Service Providers. The goal of these VPNs is to leverage the
    characteristics of LISP - routing scalability, simply expressed Ingress site TE
    Policy, IP Address Family traversal, and mobility, in ways that provide value
    to network operators.</p>"
