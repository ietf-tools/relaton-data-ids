abstract:
- content: "<p>Backup route is another route for a service which will be used when
    working path fails. Traditionally, this route is configured by operator manually
    and can't be updated when LSA changes. This document improves this traditional
    usage, and PCE (Path Computation Element) is applied for backup route.</p>"
