abstract:
- content: <p>The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains a field that identifies the address
    of a "root node". Intermediate nodes are expected to be able to look up that address
    in their routing tables. However, if the route to the root node is a BGP route,
    and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, this is not possible.
    This document specifies procedures which enable a MP LSP to be constructed through
    a BGP-free core. In these procedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced
    by an address which is known to the intermediate nodes.</p>
