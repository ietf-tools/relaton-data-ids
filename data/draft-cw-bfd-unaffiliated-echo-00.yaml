abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection protocol
    that can quickly determine a communication failure between devices and notify
    upper-layer applications [RFC5880]. BFD has asynchronous detecting mode and demand
    detection mode to satisfy different scenarios, also supports echo function as
    an adjunct to both modes to reduce the device requirement for BFD. Unaffiliated
    BFD echo function described in this document reuses the BFD echo function as described
    in [RFC5880] and [RFC5881], but independent of BFD asynchronous mode or BFD demand
    mode, that means it doesn't need BFD protocol capability of state machine, but
    only BFD echo function to a deployed device supporting BFD detection. When using
    unaffiliated BFD echo function, just the local device works on BFD protocol and
    the BFD peer doesn't, which only loopback the received BFD echo packets as usual
    data packets without enabling BFD protocol. Section 6.2.2 of [BBF-TR-146] describes
    one use case of the unaffiliated BFD echo function, and at least one more use
    case is known in the field BFD deployment.</p>"
