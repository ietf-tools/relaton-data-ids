abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a possible solution to the multihoming in IPv6 problem.
    It borrows from earlier 8+8 and GSE proposals but it diverts from these approaches
    in order to be more readily deployable. A source host that wants to initiate communications
    looks up the IPv6 addresses that will function as the transport-layer identifier
    and the IP-level locators for the remote end in the DNS and collapses both of
    its own addresses into a single one. This makes it possible to communicate without
    prior negotiation, but without opening the door to trivial identity theft that
    must be repaired by cryptographic means.</p>"
