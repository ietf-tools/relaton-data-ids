abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an Authentication
    Protocol for authentication of its peer before allowing Network Layer protocols
    to transmit over the link. PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [2] provides
    for a number of authentication mechanisms. This document specifies yet another
    authentication mechanism that may be used within the EAP framework. This document
    defines the KEA Public Key Authentication Protocol within PPP EAP. A side effect
    of KEA public key authentication is the creation of a session key for encryption
    of data on the PPP link.</p>"
