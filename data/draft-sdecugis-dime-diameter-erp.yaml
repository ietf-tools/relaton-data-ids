abstract:
- content: "<p>The EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) provides a mechanism to optimize
    EAP authentication delay in the case of re-authentication, which can be significant
    in roaming mobile situation. This mechanism assumes that a protocol for Authentication,
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) is available to transport ERP between the authenticator(s)
    and the EAP/ERP server. draft-gaonkar-radext-erp-attrs-03 specifies the transport
    of ERP using RADIUS. This document specifies the transport of ERP using Diameter.</p>"
