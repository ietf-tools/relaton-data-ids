abstract:
- content: "<p>Dissemination of the traffic flow specifications was first introduced
    in the BGP protocol via RFC 5575. In order to distribute the flow specifications
    from PCE controller to network device without BGP protocol it is desirable to
    extend PCEP with flow specification information. [I-D.li-pce-pcep-flowspec] specifies
    a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of flow specifications. The
    extensions include the instantiation, updation and deletion of flow specifications.
    Flow specifications downloaded to forwarding entries requires a reliable synchronization
    mechanism between the path computation clients (PCCs) and the PCE. This draft
    specify the flow specification synchronization mechanism for managing of flow
    specification (FLOwSPEC-DB) at node (PCC) aligning with FLOWSPEC-DB at PCE on
    initial session UP or session flap and specifies the required Path Computation
    Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions.</p>"
