abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores how existing IETF YANG models, specifically
    the Attachment Circuit (AC) and Traffic Engineering (TE) topology models, can
    be applied to support a representative Neotec use case involving dynamic AI model
    placement at Edge Cloud sites. The use case, derived from China Telecom's Neotec
    side meeting at IETF 122, involves selecting optimal Edge locations for real-time
    AI inference based on end-to-end network performance between street-level cameras
    and Edge Cloud compute nodes. By mapping the use case across multiple network
    segments and applying relevant YANG models to query bandwidth, latency, and reliability,
    this document serves as a practical exercise to evaluate model suitability and
    identify potential gaps. The goal is to inform future work under the proposed
    Neotec Working Group.</p>"
