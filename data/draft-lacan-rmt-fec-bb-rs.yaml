abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme for the Reed-
    Solomon forward error correction code and its application to reliable delivery
    of data objects on the packet erasure channel. The Reed-Solomon codes belong to
    the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, i.e, they enable a receiver
    to recover the k source symbols from any set of k received symbols. The implementation
    described here is compatible with the IPR-free implementation described in [5].</p>"
