abstract:
- content: "<p>The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to
    entries in the directory. Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1 in the X.500
    Directory protocols. In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, a string representation
    of distinguished names is transferred. This specification defines the string format
    for representing names, which is designed to give a clean representation of commonly
    used distinguished names, while being able to represent any distinguished name.</p>"
