abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands
    on a communication network. This document describes the SUPA basic architecture,
    its elements and interfaces. The main SUPA architecture entities are the Service
    Management (SM) and the Network Manager/Controller (NM/NC). The SM is a functional
    entity that creates and runs network services by using a set of NM/NCs. The NM/NC
    is a functional entity that provides one or more of the following functions: (1)
    the generation, maintenance and release of network topologies, (2) the generation,
    maintenance, and release of network service-specific abstractions, (3) the mapping
    between network service-specific abstractions and the network topology, and (4)
    the mapping between network service-specific abstractions and network device configuration.
    Both the SM and the NM/NC may be made up of multiple distinct entities that collectively
    perform their functions.</p>"
