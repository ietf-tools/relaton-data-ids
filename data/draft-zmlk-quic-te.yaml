abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for supporting QUIC-enabled service
    differentiation for traffic engineering through multipath and QUIC connection
    identifier (CID) encoding. This approach enables end-host networking stacks and
    applications to select packet routing paths in a wide area network (WAN), potentially
    improving the end-to-end performance, cost, and reliability. The proposed method
    can be used in conjunction with segment routing traffic engineering technologies,
    such as SRv6 TE.</p>"
