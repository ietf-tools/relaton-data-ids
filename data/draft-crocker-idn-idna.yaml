abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) use Unicode for domain name, rather
    than using a subset of ASCII. This increased name space, as well the requirement
    to maintain compatibility with the existing domain name service means that IDNs
    must be encoded in a form that can be supported without changes to any portion
    of the DNS that does not participate in the upgrade to IDN. This specification
    defines a mechanism called IDNA for handling them in a standard fashion and specifies
    an IDNA profile for domain names used as host references. IDNA allows non-ASCII
    characters to be represented using the same octets used in so-called host names
    today. This representation allows IDNs to be introduced with minimal changes to
    the existing DNS infrastructure. IDNA is only meant for processing domain names,
    not free text.</p>"
