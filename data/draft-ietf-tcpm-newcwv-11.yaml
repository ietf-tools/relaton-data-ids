abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism to address issues that arise when
    TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where the sending rate is
    limited by the application rather than the congestion window. It provides an experimental
    update to TCP that allows a TCP sender to restart quickly following a rate-limited
    interval. This method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
    traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if congestion
    is experienced. It also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion
    Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that RFC 2861 sought
    to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used solution. This
    document therefore recommends that the status of RFC 2861 is moved from Experimental
    to Historic, and that it is replaced by the current specification.</p>"
