abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) base specification defines set
    of basic information elements that can be used for describing a large share of
    the existing data models from different ecosystems. While these data models are
    typically very simple, such as basic sensors definitions, more complex models,
    and in particular bigger systems, benefit from ability to describe additional
    information on how different definitions relate to each other. This document specifies
    an extension to SDF for describing complex relationships and additional information
    about them.</p>"
