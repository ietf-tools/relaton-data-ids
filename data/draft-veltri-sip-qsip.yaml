abstract:
- content: "<p>This work describes an enhancement to SIP protocol for the interworking
    with QoS enabled IP networks. The proposed mechanism is simple and it fully preserves
    backward compatibility and interoperability with current SIP applications. The
    draft describes also, as an example, the application of this mechanism to a particular
    QoS enabled IP network, which implements Diffserv as transport mechanisms and
    COPS as protocol for QoS requests and for admission control.</p>"
