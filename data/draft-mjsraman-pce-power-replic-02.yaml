abstract:
- content: "<p>Power consumption in multicast replication operations is an area of
    concern and choosing suitable replication points that can decrease power consumption
    overall assumes importance. Multicast replication capacity is an attribute of
    every line card of major routers and multi-layer switches that support multicast
    in the core of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an enterprise network. Currently
    multicast replication points on Point-to-Multipoint Traffic Engineering Label-Switched-Paths
    (P2MP TE-LSPs) consume power while delivering multiple output streams of data
    from a given input stream. The multicast distribution trees are constructed without
    any regard for a proper placement of the replication points and consequent optimal
    power consumption at these points. This results in overloading certain routers
    while under-utilizing others. An optimal usage of these replication resources
    could substantially reduce power consumption on these routers. In this paper,
    we propose a mechanism by which P2MP TE-LSPs are constructed for carrying multicast
    traffic across multiple areas within a given AS. We propose that these LSPs be
    built by using the advertisements of the power-replication capacity ratio advertised
    by fine grained components such as multicast capable line-cards of routers and
    multi- layer switches deployed within an AS.</p>"
