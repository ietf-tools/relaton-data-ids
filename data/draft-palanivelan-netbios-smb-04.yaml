abstract:
- content: "<p>The Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol providing
    file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager, and other network operating
    systems. The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in the early
    1980s to allow applications to communicate over a network. The TCP/IP version
    called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT), was developed to support communications between
    symbolically named stations and transfer of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all
    three services (Name, Datagram and Session) supported by NetBIOS. This document
    attempts to provide, Control and Operational details on SMB over NetBT session,
    which is otherwise not clearly explained in the RFCs [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios
    specification] or any available documentation. This document is intended for documentation
    purpose and for informational use only.This document does not attempt to define
    a standard, rather tries explaining an existing implementation. This document
    puts together pieces of information scattered in multiple documents and offers
    a single complete documentation for this specific application (smb over NetBT).</p>"
