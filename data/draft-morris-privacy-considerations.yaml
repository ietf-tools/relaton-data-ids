abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to make protocol designers aware of privacy- related
    design choices and offers guidance for developing privacy considerations for IETF
    documents. While specifications cannot police the implementation community, nonetheless
    protocol architects must play in the improvement of privacy, both by making a
    conscious decision to design for privacy, and by documenting privacy risks in
    protocol designs. This document is discussed on the Internet Privacy Discussion
    mailing list (see https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy).</p>"
