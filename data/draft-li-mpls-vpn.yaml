abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed architecture for the construction
    of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This proposal differs from [1] and [2] in
    that the functionality of the VPN is shared by the Customer Premises Equipment
    (CPE). Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used as a tunneling mechanism
    across the ISP network.</p>"
