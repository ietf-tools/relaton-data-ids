abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture supports the use of multiple routing algorithms,
    i.e., different constraint-based shortest-path calculations can be supported.
    There are two standard algorithms: SPF and Strict-SPF, defined in Segment Routing
    architecture. There are also other user defined algorithms according to Flex-algo
    applicaiton. However, an algorithm identifier is often included as part of a Prefix-SID
    advertisement, that maybe not satisfy some scenarios where multiple algorithm
    share the same link resource. This document complement that the algorithm identifier
    can be also included as part of a Adjacency-SID advertisement.</p>"
