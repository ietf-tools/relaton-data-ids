abstract:
- content: "<p>Within OSPF, each prefix is advertised along with an 8-bit field of
    capabilities,by using the Prefix Options[RFC5340] and the flag flield in the OSPFv2
    Extended Prefix TLV [RFC7684]. However, for OSPFv3, all the bits of the PrefixOptions
    have already been assigned, and for OSPFv2, there are not many undefined bits
    left in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV. This document solves the problem of insufficient
    existing flags, and defines the variable length Prefix attributes Sub-TLV for
    OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 for the extended flag fields.</p>"
