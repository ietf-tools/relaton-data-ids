abstract:
- content: <p>Light-weight, multicast address discovery mechanisms that can be used
    by large scale client-server application deployments have been virtually non-existent
    in the past. This has resulted in many multicast client-server applications being
    deployed with "hard-coded" multicast addresses within the client workstations
    in order to provide "zero-configuration" operation of the application. Unfortunately,
    many of these hard-coded multicast addresses are often picked at random by the
    application developers resulting in multicast address collisions with other protocols/applications
    or conflicts with the multicast scoping plans of a network administrator. This
    document describes a "light-weight" multicast address discovery protocol that
    can be used by application clients to locate their nearest application server
    using well-known scope relative multicast addresses. Once located, the server
    can then communicate the multicast address(es) that have been configured on the
    server by the network administrator for use by the application. This permits applications
    be written to operate in a flexible "near-zero" configuration mode without having
    to use "hard-coded" addresses or rely on any other network service other than
    multicast and the existence of a nearby application server.</p>
