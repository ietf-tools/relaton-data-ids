abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to optimize the path between the
    multicast router and multicast source in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The basic
    idea is that when a multicast translation router has an IPv4 path and an IPv6
    path to the same multicast data source, and both IPv4 and IPv6 joins are received,
    only one path is used. One path is pruned, instead of the same traffic flowing
    over both v4 and v6 paths. By adding a metric to the IPv4 path, the multicast
    translation router can determine which path to receive multicast data: IPv4 path,
    IPv6 path or both. Therefore, an optimization path will typically be chosen when
    an identical v4/v6 traffic flow exists.</p>"
