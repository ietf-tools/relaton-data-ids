abstract:
- content: "<p>Members in a secure group may need to communicate to the GCKS to Deregister
    from the group, for SA resynchronization, or to request retransmission of a Rekey
    message. A simple solution is to keep the registration SA around, but that comes
    at the expense of O(n) SA maintenance, and storage at the GCKS. Each member is
    also responsible for maintaining an extra SA. We propose an efficient method for
    mem- bers to securely send messages to the GCKS, using the Rekey SA.</p>"
