abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an overview of the issues associated with the
    deployment of service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers, etc.) in large-scale
    environments. The term "service function chaining" is used to describe the definition
    and instantiation of an ordered list of instances of such service functions, and
    the subsequent "steering" of traffic flows through those service functions. The
    set of enabled service function chains reflects operator service offerings and
    is designed in conjunction with application delivery and service and network policy.
    This document also identifies several key areas that the Service Function Chaining
    (SFC) working group will investigate to guide its architectural and protocol work
    and associated documents.</p>
