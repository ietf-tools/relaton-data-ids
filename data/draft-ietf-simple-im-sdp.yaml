abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP instant messages currently follow a pager model, where there is
    no concept of a message session. It has been proposed that we also need a session
    based model, where the user experience would be more like a text conference or
    chat room. This draft proposes an extension to SDP that could be used to describe
    message sessions</p>"
