abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of devices
    that implement traffic control based on classification such as diff-serv code
    point (DSCP) criteria. The methodology is to be applied to measurements made on
    the data plane to evaluate the performance of the traffic control mechanisms.
    The methodology permits the specific traffic control mechanisms and configuration
    commands to vary between DUTs. The methodology provides procedures using existing
    Terminology to benchmark DUT performance traffic control mechanisms applied to
    physical and logical interfaces using DSCP as the classification criteria. This
    includes scenarios where Forwarding Congestion occurs due to interface congestion.</p>"
