abstract:
- content: "<p>A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet losses
    due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units is to simply duplicate
    the original packets and send each copy separated in time by at least T time units.
    This approach is commonly referred to as Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy
    or simply Delayed Duplication. This document defines an attribute to indicate
    the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the duplication delay in
    the Session Description Protocol.</p>"
