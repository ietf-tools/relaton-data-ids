abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport
    protocol that maps the SCSI family of application protocols onto TCP/IP. Datamover
    Architecture for iSCSI (DA) defines an abstract model in which the movement of
    data between iSCSI end nodes is logically separated from the rest of the iSCSI
    protocol in order to allow iSCSI to adapt to innovations available in new IP transports.
    While DA defines the architectural functions required of the class of Datamover
    protocols, it does not define any specific Datamover protocols. Each such Datamover
    protocol, defined in a separate document, provides a reliable transport for all
    iSCSI PDUs, but actually moves the data required for certain iSCSI PDUs without
    involving the remote iSCSI layer itself. This document begins with an introduction
    of a few new abstractions, defines a layered architecture for iSCSI and Datamover
    protocols, and then models the interactions within an iSCSI end node between the
    iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer that happen in order to transparently perform
    remote data movement within an IP fabric. It is intended that this definition
    will help map iSCSI to generic Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable IP fabrics
    in the future comprising TCP, the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),
    and possibly other underlying network transport layers, such as InfiniBand. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
