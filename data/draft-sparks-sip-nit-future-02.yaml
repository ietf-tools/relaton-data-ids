abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft explores several possible remedies for a set of issues that
    have been identified with the Session Initiation Protocol's non- INVITE transaction.
    These proposed solutions are in rough form and have not yet accumulated working
    group consensus. They range from minor extensions to protocol behavior to fundamentally
    changing the non-INVITE transaction model.</p>"
