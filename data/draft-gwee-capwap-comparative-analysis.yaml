abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to present a comparative evaluation
    of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol proposals.
    To the date of this document, the following four protocols have been proposed,
    namely CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol (CTP), Light Weight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP),
    Secure Light Access Point Protocol (SLAPP), Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP).
    Each of these protocols has its own unique strengths in fulfilling the CAPWAP
    Objectives through their own mechanisms and functionalities. The final CAPWAP
    protocol should comprise all of these strengths. This document gives a comparative
    study of the four proposed protocols based on the CAPWAP Objectives and makes
    recommendations on the combination of their strengths for the final CAPWAP protocol.</p>"
