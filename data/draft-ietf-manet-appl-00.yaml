abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo puts forth a set of questions regarding Mobile Ad hoc Network
    (MANET) routing protocol functionality and applicability. Authors of MANET routing
    protocol draft submissions are requested to include these questions (and corresponding
    answers) in a section in their submissions. The intent of this 'Applicability
    Section' is to aid readers unfamiliar with the details of each protocol's design
    in understanding the protocol's basic characteristics, functioning and mechanisms,
    as well as to provide a general description of the networking context for which
    the protocol was designed, and in which it is expected to perform well.</p>"
