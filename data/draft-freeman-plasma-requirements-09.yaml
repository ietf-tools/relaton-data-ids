abstract:
- content: "<p>S/MIME has a proven track record in delving confidentiality, integrity
    and data origination authentication for email. However, there are many situations
    where organizations want robust access control applied to information in messages.
    The Enhanced Security Services (ESS) RFC5035 for S/MIME defines an access control
    mechanism for email, but the access check happens after the data is decrypted
    by the recipient which devalues the protection afforded by the cryptography and
    provides very week guarantees of policy compliance. Another major issues for S/MIME
    is its dependency on a single type of identity credential, an X.509 certificate.
    Many users on the Internet today do not have X.509 certificates and therefore
    cannot use S/MIME. Furthermore, the requirement to discover the X.509 certificate
    for every recipient of an encrypted message by the sender has proven to be an
    unreliable process for a number of reasons. This document presents requirements
    for an alternative model to ESS to address the identified issues with access control
    to deliver more robust compliance with S/MIME protected messages. This document
    describes an access control model which uses cryptographic keys to enforce access
    control policy decisions where the policy check is performed prior to the decryption
    of the message contents. The model also abstracts the specifics of the authentication
    technology thereby removing the dependency on X.509 certificate making it possible
    for other forms of credential to be used for S/MIME enabling much broader adoption.
    This model can be instantiated in many areas using existing standards, or with
    only minor updates to existing standards. This model in not intended to be a one
    off just for email and can also be applied to other data types. The model also
    removes the dependency on the need to discover encryption certificates at send
    time. The name Plasma was assigned to this effort as part of the IETF process.
    It is derived from PoLicy enhAnced Secure eMAil.</p>"
