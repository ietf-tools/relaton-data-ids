abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the details of the PIM-SM [1,2,3] version 2
    implementation for UNIX platforms; namely SunOS and SGI-IRIX. A generic kernel
    model is adopted, which is protocol independent, however some supporting functions
    are added to the kernel for encapsulation of data packets at user level and decapsulation
    of PIM Registers. Further, the basic model for the user level, PIM daemon (pimd),
    implementation is described. Implementation details and code are included in supplementary
    appendices.</p>"
