abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPPM Working Group has developed a one way packet loss metric that
    measures the loss rate on a Poisson probe stream between two hosts. However, the
    impact of packet loss on applications is in general sensitive not just to the
    average loss rate, but alsoto the way in which packet losses are distributed in
    loss episodes (i.e., maximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets). This draft
    defines one-way packet loss episode metrics, specifically the frequency and average
    duration of loss episodes, and a probing methodology under which the loss episode
    metrics are to be measured.</p>"
