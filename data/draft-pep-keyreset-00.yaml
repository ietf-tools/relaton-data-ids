abstract:
- content: "<p>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of
    conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to
    the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end- to-end messaging. These
    include, but are not limited to, key management, key discovery, and private key
    handling (including peer- to-peer synchronization of private keys and other user
    data across devices). This document specifies the pEp KeyReset protocol that allows
    applications to provide simple high-level functionality to users needing to perform
    some of the aforementioned functions while still ensuring that the appropriate
    low-level changes in keyrings and trust management are handled consistently, and
    that communication of these changes to active partners (where necessary) happens
    seamlessly, without explicit action on the part of the user.</p>"
