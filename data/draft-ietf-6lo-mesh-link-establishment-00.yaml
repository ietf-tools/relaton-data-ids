abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for
    establishing and configuring secure radio links in IEEE 802.15.4 radio mesh networks.
    MLE extends IEEE 802.15.4 for use in multihop mesh networks by adding three capabilities:
    1) dynamically configuring and securing radio connections between neighboring
    devices, 2) enabling network-wide changes to shared radio parameters, and 3) allowing
    the determination of radio link quality prior to configuration. MLE operates below
    the routing layer, insulating it from the details of configuring, securing, and
    maintaining individual radio links within a larger mesh network.</p>"
