abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on
    digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel (TLS) or
    the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient revocation system
    is paramount. Although the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allows for
    efficient lookup of the revocation status of a certificate, the distribution of
    this information via HTTP (or very rarely) HTTPS is not particularly efficient
    for high volume websites without incurring in high distribution costs (e.g., CDN).
    In particular, this specification defines how to distribute OCSP responses over
    DNS and how to define OCSP-over-DNS URLs in certificates. The use of the DNS system
    to distribute such information is meant to lower the costs of providing revocation
    services (by leveraging the distributed nature of DNS cache) and increase the
    availability of revocation information (by providing an additional access method
    for revocation information retrieval).</p>"
