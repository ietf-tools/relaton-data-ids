abstract:
- content: "<p>To address the issue of lossless transmission for cross-data center
    services, the PFC (Priority-based Flow Control) mechanism can be extended to wide-area
    networks (WANs) to solve packet loss caused by network congestion and the problem
    of backpressure signal transmission between WAN and RoCEv2 network in data centers.
    By leveraging SRv6 and slicing technologies, it is possible to effectively control
    the propagation range and path of PFC backpressure signals in wide-area networks,
    thereby avoiding issues such as deadlocks and the excessive propagation of congestion
    scope. PFC is a hop-by-hop mechanism. Given that most current WAN devices do not
    support PFC function, this document proposes defining a new type of SRv6 SID End.X.PFC
    to indicate the PFC-capable interface in the WAN network.</p>"
