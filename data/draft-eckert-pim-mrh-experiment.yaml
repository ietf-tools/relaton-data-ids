abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes experimentation to evaluate benefits and feasibility
    of an IPv6 routing extension header based architecture, implementation and deployment
    of stateless IPv6 multicast specifically for IPv6 only networks using SRv6 for
    IP unicast. This experimentation intends to explore options to support easier
    proliferation of technologies developed by BIER-WG by providing an IPv6/SRv6 network
    optimized packet header and per-hop forwarding mechanisms than BIERin6. It also
    discusses how this work related to exploring advanced in-packet tree encoding
    mechanisms for both IPv6/ SRv6 networks as well as BIER networks as a related
    effort.</p>"
