abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is derived from the architecture and detailed functions
    of SDAF. It is a network function to perform a security analysis and provide analysis
    results in a 5G system with a service-based architecture (SBA). To this end, the
    concept of SDAF, the structure of internalizing the 5G system, and the communication
    interface used by SDAF are defined. It also defines the use cases that can utilize
    SDAF. This standard is based on the service and operation requirements for a 5G
    system with SBA.</p>"
