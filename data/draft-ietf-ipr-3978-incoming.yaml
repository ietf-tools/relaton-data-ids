- content: "<p>The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed
    to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and Internet
    communities while permitting the authors to retain as many rights as possible.
    This memo details the IETF policies on rights in Contributions to the IETF. It
    also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet. This memo
    obsoletes RFCs 3978 and 4748 and, with BCP 79 and RFC 5377, replaces Section 10
    of RFC 2026. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
