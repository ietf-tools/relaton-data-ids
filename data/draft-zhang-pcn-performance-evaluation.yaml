abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-Congestion Notification [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] approach
    proposes Admission Control to limit the amount of real-time PCN traffic to a configured
    level during the normal operating conditions, and Flow Termination used to tear-down
    some of the flows to bring the PCN traffic level down to a desirable amount during
    unexpected events such as network failures, with the goal of maintaining the QoS
    assurances to the remaining flows. Preliminary performance evaluation results
    on example admission and termination mechanisms were presented in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb]
    and in earlier versions of this draft. This draft presents the results of a follow-up
    simulation study.</p>"
