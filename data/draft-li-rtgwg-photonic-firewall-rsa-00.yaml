abstract:
- content: "<p>The photonic firewall oriented routing and spectrum allocation strategy
    in elastic optical networks is proposed. For the security detecting requirement,
    each light-path should pass through at least a photonic firewall. To reduce the
    blocking rate and improve the spectrum efficiency, the whole network is divided
    into several parts according to the locations of all deployed photonic firewalls.
    A photonic firewall is responsible for the security detecting for each part. This
    strategy has a low complexity and is suitable for large- scale optical networks.</p>"
