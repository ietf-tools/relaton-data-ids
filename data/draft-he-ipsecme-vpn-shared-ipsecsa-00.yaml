abstract:
- content: "<p>In a multi-VPN environment, currently, different IPsec tunnels (i.e.,
    different IKE SAs and Child SAs) have to be created to differentiate and protect
    the traffic of each VPN between the device and its peer. When the number of neighbors
    of a device and the number of VPNs increases, the number of IPsec tunnels also
    increases considerably. This results in the need for a large number of SAs, which
    exceeds the device's capacity. This document proposes a method for different VPNs
    to share the use of a single IPsec tunnel, which can greatly reduce the number
    of SAs required in a multi-VPN scenario.</p>"
