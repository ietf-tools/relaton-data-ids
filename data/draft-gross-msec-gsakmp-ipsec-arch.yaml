abstract:
- content: "<p>The Group Security Association Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP)is a
    distributed secure multicast framework and key management protocol. This specification
    defines the GSAKMP profile for the IP security architecture version 2 and extends
    the base GSAKMP protocol with the Security Association Management (SAM) message.
    The GSAKMP IPsec policy token explicitly authorizes which group members may exercise
    the speaker privilege. When an authorized group speaker endpoint multicasts a
    SAM message to a GSAKMP group, the SAM message configures that group's Security
    Policy Databases and Security Association Databases in compliance to a template
    within the GSAKMP IPsec policy token. In addition, this specification profiles
    the three supporting components: RFC2401-bis compliant IP security subsystem,
    Negative-acknowledgement Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol handler,
    and the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure.</p>"
