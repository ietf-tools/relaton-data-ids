abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols such
    as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP. Over the years, the industry has witnessed
    several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly
    used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides recommendations
    for improving the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations
    are applicable to the majority of use cases. This document was published as RFC
    7525 when the industry was in the midst of its transition to TLS 1.2. Years later
    this transition is largely complete and TLS 1.3 is widely available. Given the
    new environment, updated guidance is needed.</p>"
