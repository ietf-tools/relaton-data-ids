abstract:
- content: "<p>Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture for unicast
    traffic has been proposed to cope with the use cases in traffic engineering, fast
    re-reroute, service chain, etc. It can leverage existing MPLS dataplane without
    any modification. In fact, the label stack capability in MPLS would have been
    utilized well to implement flexible path programming to satisfy all kinds of requirements
    of service bearing. But in the distributed environment, the flexible programming
    capability is difficult to implement and always confined to reachability. As the
    introducing of central control in the network, the flexible MPLS programming capability
    becomes possible owing to two factors: 1. It becomes easier to allocate label
    for more purposes than reachability; 2. It is easy to calculate the MPLS path
    in a global network view. Moreover, the MPLS path programming capability can be
    utilized to satisfy more requirements of service bearing in the service layer
    which is defined as service-oriented MPLS path programming. This document defines
    the concept of MPLS path programming, then proposes use cases, architecture and
    protocol extension requirements in the service layer for the architecture of Source
    Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING).</p>"
