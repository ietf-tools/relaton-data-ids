abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses the inherent tussle between network functions
    and some aspects of privacy. There is clearly room for a much improved privacy
    in Internet communications, but there are also interesting interactions with network
    functions, e.g., what information networks need to provide a service. Exploring
    these limits is useful to better understand potential improvements.</p>"
