abstract:
- content: "<p>User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0. UMA defines how
    resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients operated by arbitrary
    requesting parties, where the resources reside on any number of resource servers,
    and where a centralized authorization server governs access based on resource
    owner policy. This specification defines a generic framework for building UMA
    claim profiles that can be used by client applications to obtain the necessary
    authorization to access protected resources. This revision of the specification
    is part of V0.9.</p>"
