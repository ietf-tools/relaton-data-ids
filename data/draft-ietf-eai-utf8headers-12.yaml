abstract:
- content: "<p>Full internationalization of electronic mail requires not only the
    capabilities to transmit non-ASCII content, to encode selected information in
    specific header fields, and to use non-ASCII characters in envelope addresses.
    It also requires being able to express those addresses and the information based
    on them in mail header fields. This document specifies an experimental variant
    of Internet mail that permits the use of Unicode encoded in UTF-8, rather than
    ASCII, as the base form for Internet email header field. This form is permitted
    in transmission only if authorized by an SMTP extension, as specified in an associated
    specification. This specification Updates section 6.4 of RFC 2045 to conform with
    the requirements. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
