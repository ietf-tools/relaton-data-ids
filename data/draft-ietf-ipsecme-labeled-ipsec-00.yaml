abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines two new Traffic Selector (TS) Types for Internet
    Key Exchange version 2 to add support for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security
    labels, also known as "Labeled IPsec". The two new TS Types are TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE_SECLABEL
    and TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE_SECLABEL, which are identical to their non- seclabel namesakes
    except for the addition of a variable length opaque field specifying the security
    label. These new Traffic Selector Types facilitate negotiating security labels
    as an additional selector of the Security Policy Database to further restrict
    the type of traffic allowed to be send and received over the IPsec SA.</p>
