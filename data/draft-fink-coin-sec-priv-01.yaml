abstract:
- content: "<p>With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber-security and data
    protection are of increasing importance. This is especially the case regarding
    cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with the physical world.
    Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to financial and physical damage
    and endanger human lives and well- being. Thus, hard security and privacy requirements
    are necessary to be met. Furthermore, a thorough investigation of incidents is
    essential for ultimate protection. In-network computing allows the processing
    of traffic and data directly in the network and at line- rate. Thus, the in-network
    computing paradigm presents a promising solution for efficiently providing security
    and privacy mechanisms as well as event analysis. This document discusses select
    mechanisms to demonstrate how in-network computing concepts can be applied to
    counter existing shortcomings of cyber-security and data privacy.</p>"
