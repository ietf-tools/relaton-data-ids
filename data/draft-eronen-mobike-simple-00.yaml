abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how existing NAT Traversal functionality could
    be leveraged to better support mobility and multihoming for IKEv2. The purpose
    is not to specify a finished solution, but rather to provide input for discussions
    in the MOBIKE WG. In particular, this draft raises questions to what extent the
    complexity present in the two other MOBIKE protocol proposals is actually necessary.
    These questions are not answered in this document, but are to be discussed in
    the MOBIKE WG.</p>"
