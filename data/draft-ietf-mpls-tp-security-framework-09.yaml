abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a security framework for the MPLS Transport Profile
    (MPLS-TP). MPLS-TP extends MPLS technologies and introduces new Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) capabilities, a transport-oriented path protection mechanism,
    and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management systems.
    This document addresses the security aspects relevant in the context of MPLS-TP
    specifically. It describes potential security threats as well as mitigation procedures
    related to MPLS-TP networks and to MPLS-TP interconnection to other MPLS and GMPLS
    networks. This document is built on RFC 5920 ("Security Framework for MPLS and
    GMPLS Networks") by providing additional security considerations that are applicable
    to the MPLS-TP extensions. All the security considerations from RFC 5920 are assumed
    to apply. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionality of a packet transport network.</p>
