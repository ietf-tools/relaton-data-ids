abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational draft presents a simulation study to compare the
    performance of two and three drop precedence levels in an Assured Forwarding traffic
    class for mixed TCP/UDP traffic. This is a revised and comprehensive version of
    our previous study presented at the March 99 IETF Meeting at Minneapolis. For
    this study, we consulted the principal authors of the Assured Forwarding Class
    to determine the parameter set and configurations under which it would be beneficial
    to have 3-drop preferences. The results presented here are based on 1296 simulations
    (different parameter/traffic pattern combinations). The results of the simulation
    study suggest that optimal number of drop precedence levels in a traffic class
    depends on the traffic load and amount of reserved traffic. In a mixed TCP- UDP
    traffic scenario, best performance can be achieved with either 2 or 3 levels of
    drop precedence if most of the TCP packets have 'better' drop precedence than
    excess UDP packets.</p>"
