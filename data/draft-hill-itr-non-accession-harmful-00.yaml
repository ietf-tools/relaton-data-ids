abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the treaties administered by the International Telecommunications
    Union is the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose
    is to promote the development of telecommunication services. The 1988 version
    of the ITRs opened the way for privatisation, liberalization, and the growth of
    the Internet and mobile networks. Given the subsequent significant structure and
    technological changes, the ITU membership agreed to meet in 2012 to revise the
    ITRs. While consensus was found on an overwhelming majority of the treaty text,
    some provisions proved to be controversial, leading to a split in the membership
    and sharp criticism of selected provisions. As a result, some ITU Member States
    did not sign the treaty. This document analyses that criticism and attempts to
    place it in context; it identifies problems that may arise if states to not accede
    to the treaty, and suggests a way forward, concluding that not acceding may have
    undesirable results for the citizens of non-signatory countries and for interoperability
    in general.</p>"
