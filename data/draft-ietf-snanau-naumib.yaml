abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing the configuration, monitoring and control of Physical
    Units (PUs) and Logical Units (LUs) in an SNA environment. PUs and LUs are two
    types of Network Addressable Units (NAUs) in the logical structure of an SNA network.
    NAUs are the origination or destination points for SNA data streams. This memo
    identifies managed objects for PU Type 1.0, 2.0 and Type 2.1 and LU Type 0, 1,
    2, 3, 4, 7. The generic objects defined here can also be used to manage LU 6.2
    and any LU-LU session. The SNA terms and overall architecture are documented in
    [1]. This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.</p>"
