abstract:
- content: <p>Many existing routers enable their data planes to keep forwarding data
    packets during the restart of their control plains. This functionality is called
    "graceful restart" or "non-stop forwarding". A router supporting graceful restart
    is able to provide more reliable packet forwarding service during system maintaining
    procedures and software-error recoveries. This informational document analyzes
    the issues with enhancing VRRP to support graceful restart and introduces several
    candidate solutions.</p>
