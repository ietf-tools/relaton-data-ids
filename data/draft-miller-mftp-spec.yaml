abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multicast File Transfer Protocol (MFTP) is a protocol that operates
    above UDP in the application layer to provide a reliable means for transferring
    files from a sender to up to thousands (potentially millions with network ''aggregators''
    or relays) of multiple receivers simultaneously over a multicast group in a multicast
    IP enabled network. The protocol consists of two parts; an administrative protocol
    to set up and tear down groups and sessions, and a data transfer protocol used
    to send the actual file reliably and simultaneously to the multiple recipients
    residing in the group.</p>"
