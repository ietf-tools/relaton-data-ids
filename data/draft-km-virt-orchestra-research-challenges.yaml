abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes open research challenges for emerging media-
    oriented ensemble applications. One such driving scenario is the network delivery
    of virtual orchestra that imposes multi-disciplinary challenges. Specifically,
    of interest are the group communication patterns in the production, delivery and
    consumption as different dimensions relating to the communication networks. This
    document brings forth current research and engineering challenges in immersive
    media ensembles. The network domain problems come down to the specification of
    coordination of the received content with dependency constraints. The challenges
    depict both real and quasi- realtime behavior. A number of endpoint actors get
    involved in delivering the ensemble aspect, the research challenges also describe
    the expectations from the end points.</p>"
