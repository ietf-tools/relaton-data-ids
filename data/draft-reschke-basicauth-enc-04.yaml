abstract:
- content: <p>The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not properly
    define how to treat non-ASCII characters. This has lead to a situation where user
    agent implementations disagree, and servers make different assumptions based on
    the locales they are running in. There is little interoperability for characters
    in the ISO-8859-1 character set, and even less interoperability for any characters
    beyond that. This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic",
    specifying the server's character encoding expectation, using a new authentication
    scheme parameter.</p>
