abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the analysis of the applicability of Abstraction
    and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration (POI),
    provided in RFC YYYY, to cover multi-layer service assurance scenarios. Specifically,
    the ACTN architecture enables the detection and handling of different failures
    that may happen either at the optical or the packet layer. It is assumed that
    the underlying transport optical network carries end-to-end IP services such as
    L2VPN or L3VPN connectivity services, with specific Service Level Agreement (SLA)
    requirements. RFC Editor: Please replace YYYY with the RFC number of draft-ietf-
    teas-actn-poi-applicability once it has been published. Please remove this note.
    Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each multi-layer (packet
    over optical) service assurance scenario with a specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain
    Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers Interface) in the ACTN
    architecture.</p>"
