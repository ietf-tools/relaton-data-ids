abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to debug customer reported
    problems and for regression testing if network or client software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between
    clients, and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signaling end-to-end. This draft
    describes requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP protocol data unit (PDU,
    or a SIP message) that marks the PDU as a candidate for logging. Such marking
    will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network
    operator and not used in regular client signaling. However, such marking can be
    carried end-to-end including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and
    terminates in different networks.</p>"
