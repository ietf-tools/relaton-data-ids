abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service
    to mobile nodes in the network domain which does not require the mobile nodes
    to be involved in IP mobility management. In other words, the PMIPv6 can transparently
    support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e. intra-domain roaming, to mobile nodes.
    However, if the mobile nodes move to other PMIPv6 domains, the nodes should have
    additional protocols for the inter-domain roaming although the domains also provide
    the transparent mobility. Hence, an inter-domain roaming solution would be needed
    for providing transparent mobility to mobile nodes that only move around among
    PMIPv6 domains. This document specifies the inter-domain roaming controlled by
    the networks adopting the PMIPv6.</p>"
