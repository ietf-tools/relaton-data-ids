abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines OODA-HTTP, a protocol extension and adaptive
    security framework that applies the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop to HTTP/HTTPS
    communications. OODA-HTTP introduces dynamic behavior at the application layer,
    enabling real-time detection, decision, and mitigation based on evolving threat
    contexts. Each HTTP request becomes not just a message, but an observation signal,
    a decision vector, and a defensive act. This framework introduces headers such
    as X-OODA-Action to carry contextual scores or actions across clients, servers,
    and intermediaries. OODA-HTTP transforms passive transport into active self-defense,
    offering resilience against classic and quantum threats. It is designed as a native
    defender of the World Wide Web \\[Gupta23]\\[Martinez22]\\[Wang21]\\[Kim23].</p>"
