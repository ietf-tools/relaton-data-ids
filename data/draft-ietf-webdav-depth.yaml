abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebDAV protocol specification [Goland et al., 1997] defines the
    DELETE, COPY and MOVE methods. However these methods have a scope of a single
    source resource. It is common for principals to wish to perform a DELETE, COPY
    or MOVE on a collection and all its internal members. This specification defines
    the DELETE-TREE, COPY-TREE and MOVE-TREE methods that perform the equivalent of
    DELETE, COPY and MOVE across a collection and all its progeny.</p>"
