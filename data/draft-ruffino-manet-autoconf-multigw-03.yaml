abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes AMG, a mechanism for stateless autoconfiguration
    of IPv6 addresses for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), connected to the Internet
    by means of one or more gateways. Network prefixes are disseminated by Internet
    gateways and are used by nodes to configure a set of global IPv6 addresses. An
    algorithm is specified, by which nodes can choose the optimal address for data
    traffic. Configured global addresses are also advertised to other MANET nodes,
    to minimize latencies in case of gateway failures, MANET partitions and mergers.
    The specified mechanism aims to be independent from any particular MANET routing
    protocol and to effectively exploit multiple gateways.</p>"
