abstract:
- content: "<p>In a real-time communication session, there may be a need or preference
    for receiving the same content in two or more simultaneous modalities. There may
    also be a need to prioritize which media to use for language communications. This
    document defines the semantics for grouping media in the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP) containing human languages in order to assign their relative priority and
    also grouping media that are desired to be received together. The semantics defined
    in this document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework. Applications
    are for example a possibility to indicate when a sign language is most desired,
    but written language an acceptable lower rated alternative, offered for the other
    party to select between. Applications are also for indication of need for both
    spoken and written content in a real-time call (captioning) together, or provision
    of both spoken language original and sign language interpretation of the original
    language together in a real- time session. These indications are specified for
    the sending and receiving direction separately.</p>"
