abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational document explains the specification of the queue
    protection algorithm used in DOCSIS technology since version 3.1. A shared low
    latency queue relies on the non-queue-building behaviour of every traffic flow
    using it. However, some flows might not take such care, either accidentally or
    maliciously. If a queue is about to exceed a threshold level of delay, the queue
    protection algorithm can rapidly detect the flows most likely to be responsible.
    It can then prevent harm to other traffic in the low latency queue by ejecting
    selected packets (or all packets) of these flows. The document is designed for
    four types of audience: a) congestion control designers who need to understand
    how to keep on the 'good' side of the algorithm; b) implementers of the algorithm
    who want to understand it in more depth; c) designers of algorithms with similar
    goals, perhaps for non-DOCSIS scenarios; and d) researchers interested in evaluating
    the algorithm.</p>"
