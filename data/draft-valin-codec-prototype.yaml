- content: "<p>This document provides a quick overview of a prototype codec combining
    a linear prediction layer (SILK) with an MDCT-based layer (CELT). These codecs
    are used because of the authors' familiarity with the source code, but it does
    not prevent inclusion of code from other codecs as well. This is a work in progress.</p>"
