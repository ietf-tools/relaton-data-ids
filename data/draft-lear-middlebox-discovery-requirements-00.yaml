abstract:
- content: "<p>The end to end nature of the Internet has been broken. Boxes within
    the middle of the network may change contents of packets at the Internet layer
    or above without the knowledge of the end devices. As these middleboxes such as
    NATs and firewalls have proliferated within the Internet, protocols are being
    developed to communicate with them. This document addresses requirements for discovery
    of those boxes.</p>"
