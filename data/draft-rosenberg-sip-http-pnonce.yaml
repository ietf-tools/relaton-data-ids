abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP Digest algorithm, specified in RFC 2617, allows for authentication
    of a request, along with integrity checks over the method, request URI, and optionally,
    the body. HTTP Digest is the primary client authentication mechanism used by SIP.
    However, Digest does not provide for integrity checks over several key SIP headers,
    including the To, From, Call-ID and Contact headers. We define a mechanism for
    supporting integrity over these headers, using a new algorithm we call predictive
    nonces. The mechanism requires no changes in clients, and no protocol changes.
    It requires only a change in the way the nonce is computed by servers.</p>"
