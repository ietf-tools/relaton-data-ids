abstract:
- content: "<p>It can be useful for applications to provide flow metadata information
    to on-path devices to influence flow treatment in the network. Provided that the
    network is able to provide useful feedback, this can also influence path selection
    if an application have multiple flow paths to choose from. This draft describes
    how this can be achieved by adding metadata to the STUN packets sent during the
    ICE connectivity checks or a slightly modified version of the keep-alive mechanism.
    Devices on the media path can use the metadata information to prioritize the flow,
    perform traffic engineering, or provide network analytics and notifications as
    requested by the endpoints. On-path devices can append or modify the existing
    metadata information in the STUN/ICE messages to enable feedback to other on-path
    devices or the applications in both ends of the media session. This document describes
    a framework mechanism for how such metadata can be transported by STUN when ICE
    is in use and it covers the endpoint and on path device processing. The functionality
    described here is referred to as MALICE.</p>"
