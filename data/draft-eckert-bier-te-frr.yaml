abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes protection methods for the BIER-TE architecture
    [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch]. These include 1+1 (live-live) path/tree [RFC7431] redundancy,
    1:1 path/tree protection, as well as fast reroute (FRR) methods. The latter may
    protect against link and/ or node failures and leverage infrastructure tunnels,
    BIER-in-BIER encapsulation, or header modification for implementation. In particular,
    this memo describes FRR for BIER-TE in detail. FRR for BIER-TE requires support
    from the BIER-TE controller and the BFRs that are attached to a link/adjacency
    for which FRR protection is desired. FRR relies on the BIER header described in
    [RFC8279] which is also used by BIER-TE. It does not require extensions or modifications
    to existing BIER-TE tables. However, the presented FRR procedures need some additional
    forwarding plane logic on the BFR. An additional table is needed that carries
    information about pre- computed backup paths. When a failure is detected, the
    information from this table is used to modify the bitstring in the BIER header
    before forwarding a packet over a backup path. To prevent undesired packet duplication,
    packets should be tunneled on the backup paths.</p>"
