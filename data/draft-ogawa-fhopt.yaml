abstract:
- content: "<p>When a standard Mobile IP node (MN) changes its wireless network attachment
    point (performs a handover), it gets new IP layer configuration information (a
    new network prefix and address of a new default gateway) from a new access router
    and tries to know whether it has moved to other subnet. If it has, it changes
    its IP layer configuration. During such a handover process,it cannot send and
    receive IP packets from its corresponding node(CN), so a service disruption is
    caused. In this document, we introduce new DHCP options. With them, DHCP servers
    can send new information before a handover to be used after the handover, and
    MNscan reduce handover process time.</p>"
