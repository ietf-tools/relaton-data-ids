abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising
    SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols. Because of interoperability
    concerns created by simultaneous use of the two protocols by a receiver, and some
    concerns with Sender-ID and compatibility with existing standards, the IESG required
    them to have Experimental status and invited the community to observe their deployments
    for a period of time, hoping convergence would be possible later. After six years,
    sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiment thus
    created can be considered concluded, and a single protocol can be advanced. This
    memo presents those findings.</p>"
