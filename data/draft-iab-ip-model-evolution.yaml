abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC attempts to document various aspects of the IP service model
    and how it has evolved over time. In particular, it attempts to document the properties
    of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications, especially
    properties that were (and, at times, still are) incorrectly perceived to exist
    as well as properties that would cause problems if changed. The discussion of
    these properties is organized around evaluating a set of claims, or misconceptions.
    Finally, this document provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
