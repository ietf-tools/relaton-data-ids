abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a service concept implementation of a Dynamic
    Call Screening Service (DCS) made available to WAP endpoints. This work builds
    on an existing Internet Call Waiting (ICW) [1] platform to provide enhanced call
    screening and control capabilities via the WAP interface to wireless handsets.
    This extends the current ICW [1] service to provide a 'WAP Proxy' which supports
    call screening notification and automatic disposition capabilities. In this way
    the service evolves from an Internet Call Waiting service for wireline subscribers
    to a network-based user agent with which users can register to direct incoming
    call n otifications to any of several endpoint device types depending on their
    current preferences and availability.</p>"
