    Key Encryption (MIKEY-SAKKE), a method of key exchange that uses Identity-based
    Public Key Cryptography (IDPKC) to establish a shared secret value and certificateless
    signatures to provide source authentication. MIKEY-SAKKE has a number of desirable
    features, including simplex transmission, scalability, low-latency call setup,
    and support for secure deferred delivery. This document is not an Internet Standards
