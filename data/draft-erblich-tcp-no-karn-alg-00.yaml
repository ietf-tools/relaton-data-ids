abstract:
- content: <p>Karn's algorithm specifies acknowledgements that are the result of segment
    retransmits should be ignored, not timed, and should not contribute to the smoothed
    round-trip-time (SRTT) because they are considered "ambiguous". It is also stated
    in Karn's paper that "If an acknowledgement arrives after the RTO has expired,
    it is highly likely to come very shortly after wards." In time, we have added
    the "fast retransmit" functionality, so we are not solely dependent on RTO for
    retransmits. Common sense dictates that if we receive an acknowledgement "very
    shortly after wards", that those acknowledgments should not be considered "ambiguous".
    These non-ambiguous acknowledgments should be added to the SRTT and trigger us
    to return to our previous non-congestion behavior.</p>
