abstract:
- content: "<p>The document [I-D.draft-mhkk-dmm-srv6mup-architecture] describes the
    Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture for Distributed Mobility Management. The
    proposed architecture converts the user mobility session information from the
    control plane entity to an IPv6 dataplane routing information. When there are
    multiple candidate instances located at different location to serve an user request,
    the MUP Provider Edge (PE) might prioritize the closest service location. However,
    the closest routing path might not be the optimal route. This document discusses
    how the mentioned MUP architecture can be leveraged to set up dataplane routing
    paths to the optimal service instance location with the assistance of computing-aware
    traffic steering capabilities. For each session request, based on the up-to- date
    collected computing and network information, the MUP controller can convert the
    session information to the optimal route.</p>"
