abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposal to extend the communications model for
    IP version 6 (IPv6) to support changing the transport address dynamically between
    two communicating end systems using a new IPv6 Destination Option. The proposal
    supports this dynamic address change for both TCP and UDP. The proposal has applicability
    in IPv6 for Dynamic Renumbering, Anycast Addresses, Multihoming, and Mobility.
    The proposal requires no changes to the existing TCP or UDP protocols, and is
    optional for IPv6 implementations.</p>"
