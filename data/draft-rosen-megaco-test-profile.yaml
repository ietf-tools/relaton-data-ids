abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a profile for use in interoperability testing
    of the Megaco/H.248 protocol and a set of scenarios to try increasingly difficult
    mechanisms in the protocol. To support early phase testing, it is useful to define
    a simple, easy to implement set of characteristics that allow initial implementations
    to get very basic functions working. By implementing this profile, testing a variety
    of MGs against a variety of MGCs is possible. The test scenarios describe high-level
    behavior expected by the MGs and MGCs, but not explicit message sequences. Also
    included is a set of test messages that may be used to verify early stage MG/MGC
    functionality. They could be used to test parsers, and they can be used to assure
    that implementations have base functionality prior to testing with devices that
    may not produce the same messages.</p>"
