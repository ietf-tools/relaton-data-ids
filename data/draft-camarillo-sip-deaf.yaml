abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to discover the need of transcoding services
    in a session established with SIP and how to invoke those transcoding services.
    Two models for transcoding services invocation are introduced; the conference
    bridge model and the third party call control model. Both models meet the requirements
    for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation to support deaf, hard of hearing
    and speech-impaired individuals.</p>"
