abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard profile for Bogon Origin Attestations
    (BOAs). A BOA is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying
    that an IP address block holder has not authorized any Autonomous System (AS)
    to originate routes that are equivalent to any of the addresses listed in the
    BOA, and also provides a means of verifying that BGP speaker is not using an AS
    as a BGP speaker without appropriate authority to use that AS. The proposed application
    of BOAs is intended to fit within the requirements for adding security measures
    to inter-domain routing, including the ability to support incremental and piecemeal
    deployment of such measures, and does not require any changes to the specification
    of BGP.</p>"
