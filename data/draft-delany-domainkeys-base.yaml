abstract:
- content: <p>"DomainKeys" creates a domain-level authentication framework for email
    by using public key technology and the DNS to prove the provenance and contents
    of an email. This document defines a framework for digitally signing email on
    a per-domain basis. The ultimate goal of this framework is to unequivocally prove
    and protect identity while retaining the semantics of Internet email as it is
    known today. Proof and protection of email identity may assist in the global control
    of "spam" and "phishing". This memo defines a Historic Document for the Internet
    community.</p>
