abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose the addition of ECN to MPLS switching. ECN enables end-
    end congestion control without necessarily depending on packet loss as the sole
    indicator of congestion. The proposal suggests having a single bit in the MPLS
    header to indicate ECN, and simple signaling at the time of setting up the LSP
    (Label Switched Path) for indication of ECN capability. This allows for incorporation
    of ECN in MPLS in a coordinated manner with IP and also in a backwards compatible
    fashion.</p>"
