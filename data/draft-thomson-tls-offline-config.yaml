abstract:
- content: "<p>Zero round trip operation in TLS relies on a client knowing about a
    server configuration prior to establishing a connection. TLS provides a mechanism
    for a server to provide a configuration during a handshake so that subsequent
    connections can send encrypted data in its first flight of messages. This document
    defines a format for this configuration information that can be used outside of
    TLS.</p>"
