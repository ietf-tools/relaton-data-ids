abstract:
- content: "<p>A scalable and centralized mechanism is required for a certificate-
    based administrative access to multitude of virtualized and physical network functions.
    While there are mechanisms that exist today to provide secure administrative command-line
    and API-based access, there are certain management and maintenance overheads as
    well as certain scalability challenges related to it. In this draft we discuss
    these challenges and propose a standardized, centralized server-based mechanism
    to authenticate a user over an SSH session using its client certificate.</p>"
