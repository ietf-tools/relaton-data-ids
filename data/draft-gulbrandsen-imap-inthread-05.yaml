abstract:
- content: "<p>The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command to operate
    on threads as well as individual messages. Other commands which search are implicitly
    extended. The THREAD=REFS extension provides a threading algorithm using (almost)
    only the References header field for use with the IMAP THREAD command.</p>"
