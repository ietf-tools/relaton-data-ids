abstract:
- content: "<p>Online traffic load distribution for a single class of service has
    been explored extensively given that extensions to IGP can provide loading information
    to network nodes. To perform traffic engineering of load distribution for multi-service
    networks, or off line traffic engineering of single service networks, a control
    mechanism for provisioning bandwidth according to some policy must be provided.
    This draft identifies the mechanisms that affect load distribution and the controls
    for mechanisms that affect load distribution to enable policy based traffic engineering
    of the load distribution to be performed. This draft identifies the mechanisms
    that affect load distribution and the control for those mechanisms to enable policy
    based traffic engineering of load distribution. This draft also presents guidelines
    for the use of these load distribution mechanisms in the context of single IP
    network administration.</p>"
