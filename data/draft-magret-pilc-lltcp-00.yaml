abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol enhancement allowing TCP connec-
    tions to switch from an active state to an idle state during a wire- less link's
    outage. Within such state all timers are cancelled and packets' transmission is
    suspended. The protocol defines a mechanism by which the mobile station may detect
    a link failure and changes TCP connections' state to idle. This same mechanism
    allows the mobile host to detect connectivity regain. All TCP connections are
    then resumed. The protocol defines how the supervisor host, which can monitor
    the wireless link quality, can alert the fixed host of a failure of the wireless
    link. The fixed host can suspend the outgoing activity with the unreachable mobile
    node. When the fixed hosts start receiving packets from the mobile node, the activity
    can be resumed. This protocol increases the capacity of both parties involved
    in a communication that is carried via a wireless link to handled connec- tivity
    disruption without impacting the overall performance of the TCP connections.</p>"
