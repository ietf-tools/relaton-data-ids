abstract:
- content: "<p>The CIFS/E (CIFS extensions for enterprise networks) family of protocols
    includes a protocol for browsing. Browsing is a mechanism for discovering servers
    that are running particular services (not just CIFS file services). Servers are
    organized into named groups called domains, which form browsing scopes. This document
    specifies version 1.15 of the browsing protocol. It also specifies the mailslot
    protocol, because the browsing protocol depends on it (and is the only CIFS/E
    protocol which does).</p>"
