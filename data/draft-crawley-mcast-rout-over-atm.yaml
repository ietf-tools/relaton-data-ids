abstract:
- content: "<p>As the use of IP multicasting and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
    technologies increases, it becomes important to think about ways that IP multicast
    routing protocols interface to ATM networks. The Multicast Address Resolution
    Server (MARS) [1] addresses the problem of determining group membership within
    a single ATM Logical IP Subnet (LIS) and provides a mapping between IP multicast
    addresses and ATM addresses while [2] looks at the issues of short cut routing
    for PIM Sparse Mode and CBT. In this document, the general problems of IP multicast
    routing protocols over ATM networks are explored and the issues related to the
    different forms of multicast routing protocols; dense vs. sparse, shared tree
    vs. source tree, etc. are addressed. Additionally, the issues related to short
    cut and QoS routing are discussed. This document is intended as a starting point
    for exploring the issues of IP multicast routing over ATM.</p>"
