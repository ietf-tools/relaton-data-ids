abstract:
- content: <p>RC4 is extremely weak as shown by RFC 6649 and RFC 7457, is prohibited
    in TLS by RFC 7465, is prohibited in Kerberos by RFC xxxx and it needs to be prohibited
    in all IETF protocols. Documents that provide technology that can only use RC4
    are obsoleted by this document, so this document obsoletes and moves to Historic
    RFC 3078 "Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) Protocol" (only supports
    RC4), RFC 4345 "Improved Arcfour Modes for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer
    Protocol" (note Arcfour and RC4 are synonymous), RFC 4757 "The RC4-HMAC Kerberos
    Encryption Types Used by Microsoft Windows" (only supports RC4) and RFC 6229 "Test
    Vectors for the Stream Cipher RC4" (provides test vectors for historic cryptography).
    RFC 2118, RFC 3961, RFC 4120, RFC 4253, RFC 6150, RFC 6649, RFC 7457, RFC 7905
    and RFC xxxx are updated to note the deprecation of RC4 in all IETF protocols.
    (Please do not confuse RFC 4757 with RFC 7457.)</p>
