abstract:
- content: "<p>It is getting popular to running data applications over general purpose
    hardware/chipsets, instead of customized and dedicated hardware/chipset. This
    way further decouples the software functions from the hardware. But moving data
    processing intensive applications to general purpose hardware is still challenging,
    although the industry has supplied some proprietary solutions. This document discusses
    the problems of data plane acceleration and proposes its framework.</p>"
