abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a number of problems encountered when implementing
    TLS 1.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS Extensions for clients, and their consequences. The problems
    include servers that refuse to connect with clients supporting newer versions
    of the protocol, or does not handle such negotiation properly. Other problems
    encountered are incorrect use of values in the protocol messages. The consequences
    of these problems range from delayed introduction of new protocol versions and
    features, to fallback mechanisms that may disable protocol security features,
    to implementations that cannot interoperate with some other implementations.</p>"
