abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario that
    has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that is assumed
    to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose
    from. It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls
    that effectively act as address-based filters. Host behavior in choosing a first-hop
    router may interact with source address selection in a given implementation. However,
    the selection of the source address for a packet is done before the first-hop
    router for that packet is chosen. Given that the network or host is, or appears
    to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has
    elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring
    routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information
    Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.
    It updates RFC 4861.</p>"
