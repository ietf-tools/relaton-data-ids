abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for enabling and configuring network
    access for IoT devices that are first authenticated at a server. In typical implementations,
    this server may be run by the manufacturer of the IoT device as an online cloud
    service. This specification is intended for off-the-shelf IoT devices that have
    just been purchased by the user. Many of these devices have only limited user
    interfaces that can be used for configuring network access credentials. The device
    configuration is also made more challenging by the fact that these devices may
    exist in large numbers.</p>"
