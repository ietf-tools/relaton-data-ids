abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a list of things that often delay processing of RFCs by IESG
    and/or the RFC Editor, and which are often preventable by RFC authors. The purpose
    of this document is to list in one place the most frequent causes of unnecessary
    delay, and thereby help RFC authors mini- mize such delays when possible. This
    document is emphatically NOT an expression of IESG policy, nor that of the RFC
    Editor, and is provided merely for informational pur- poses. When appropriate,
    this document attempts to provide references to other documents, some of which
    are expressions of IESG, IETF, and/or RFC Editor policy and others which are merely
    informational. Readers are advised to check the official status of each reference.
    The RFC Editor's instructions to RFC Authors are in [rfc-instruc- tions].</p>"
