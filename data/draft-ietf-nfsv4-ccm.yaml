abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a suite of new mechanisms under the GSS [RFC2743].
    Some protocols, such as RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203], use GSS to authenticate every message
    transfer, thereby incurring significant overhead due to the costs of cryptographic
    computation. While hardware-based cryptographic accelerators can mitigate such
    overhead, it is more likely that acceleration will be available for lower layer
    protocols, such as IPsec [RFC2401] than for upper layer protocols like RPCSEC_GSS.
    CCM can be used as a way to allow GSS mechanism- independent upper layer protocols
    to leverage the data stream protections of lower layer protocols, without the
    inconvenience of modifying the upper layer protocol to do so.</p>"
