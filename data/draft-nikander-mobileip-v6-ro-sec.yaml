    IPv6 (MIPv6) Route Optimization Security Design. The purpose of this document
    is to present the thinking and to preserve the reasoning behind the Mobile IPv6
    Security Design in 2001-2002. The document has two target audiences: (1) MIPv6
    implementors (so that they can better understand the design choices in MIPv6 security
    procedures); and (2) people dealing with mobility or multi-homing (so that they
    can avoid a number of potential security pitfalls in their design).</p>"
