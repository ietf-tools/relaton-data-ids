abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) policy enables instantiation of an ordered list
    of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering. When using SR policy
    in a time-variant network, delivering the time-variant information associated
    with paths is necessary in some scenarios. This document proposes extensions to
    PCE SR Policy to deliver the schedule information of candidate path (segment list)
    and its associated attributes.</p>"
