abstract:
- content: "<p>People often refer to things in the real world by a common name or
    phrase, e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title. These names are sometimes
    easier for people to remember and type than URLs. Furthermore, because of the
    limited syntax of URLs, companies and individuals are finding that the ones that
    might be most reasonable for their resources are being used elsewhere and so are
    unavailable. For the purposes of this document, a 'common name' is a word or a
    phrase, without imposed syntactic structure, that may be associated with a resource.</p>"
