abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this draft is to propose an IP service model for a
    non-packet switch capable optical network where G.LSPs are dynamically triggered
    by the IP layer and subsequently advertised for IP routing. The business model
    assumes that several IP service domains, some of which represent different administrative
    entities, share the same optical backbone and focuses therefore primarily on an
    overlay model. G-MPLS signaling (refer to [g-mpls]) with UNI support is assumed
    as underlying control plane protocol.</p>"
