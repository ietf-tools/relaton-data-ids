abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a scalable Route-By-Name Routing scheme for ICN.
    [ICN Challenges] describes three possible routing schemes: Route-By- Name Routing
    (RBNR), Lookup-By-Name Routing (LBNR), and Hybrid Routing (HR). Among them, RBNR
    has advantages in terms of performance and evolvability but scalability is a challenging
    issue. This memo proposes a RBNR scheme using hierarchically-organized name space
    for the scalability.</p>"
