abstract:
- content: "<p>A SIP overload control signalling protocol framework has previously
    been published, with the flexibility to allow different SIP request rate limiting
    algorithms to be selected. This document proposes a similar algorithm of maximum
    rate type with two advantages over existing proposals. Firstly, it exempts certain
    classes of SIP requests that are fundamental to correct operation of the SIP protocol
    which, if rejected by control, would worsen rather than improve SIP performance.
    Secondly, it allows target servers to control SIP traffic from sources not compliant
    with this document so that it can be deployed in heterogeneous network environments.</p>"
