abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides extensions to Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange
    (MILE). MILE describes a subset of Incident Object Description Exchange Format
    (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070. The Data Markers extension is aimed at exchanging
    data tags or markers that label categories of information that have significance
    in the exchange of incident information. These data marker extension is aimed
    at exchanging data tags or markers that label information exchanged during incident
    handling. Data markers include sensitivity and data handling requirements that
    can prevent possible criminal errors in mismarking data. Both network and information
    security incidents typically result in the loss of service, data, and resources
    both human and system. Existing extensions to the IODEF- Document Class for Reporting
    Phishing [RFC 5901] have already been introduced for network security incidents.
    Data markers introduce extensions for information security incidents so that network
    providers and Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) are equipped and
    ready to assist in communicating and tracing security incidents with tools and
    procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack. Data Markers also support
    Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) [RFC 6045] that outlines a proactive inter-network
    communication method to facilitate sharing incident handling data while integrating
    existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms
    for a complete incident handling solution. Combining these capabilities in a communication
    system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks. Policy guidelines
    for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium
    using the security recommendations and considerations.</p>"
