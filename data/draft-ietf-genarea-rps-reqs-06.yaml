abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has provided some tools for remote participation in its activities
    for many years, and some IETF participants have also used their own tools when
    they felt the need arise. The IETF now wishes to support enhanced remote participation
    that is as seamless as possible, improving the experience for the remote attendee
    at the IETF regular meetings and interim meetings without degrading the experience
    for the people that are physically present. Before deploying the new tools and
    services needed for this enhanced remote participation, the requirements for such
    tools and services, and the impacts they will make on the current procedures and
    infrastructure, must be defined. This document is meant to be that definition.</p>"
