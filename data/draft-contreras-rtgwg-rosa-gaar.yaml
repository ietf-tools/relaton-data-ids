abstract:
- content: "<p>The term 'service-based routing' (SBR) captures the set of mechanisms
    for the steering of traffic in an application-level service scenario. We position
    this steering as an anycast problem, requiring the selection of one of the possibly
    many choices for service execution at the very start of a service transaction.
    This document builds on the issues and pain points identified across a range of
    use cases, reported in [I-D.mendes-rtgwg-rosa-use-cases]. We summarize the key
    insights and provide a gap analysis with key technologies related to the problem
    of SBR, developed by the IETF over many years. We further outline the requirements
    to a system that would adequately close those gaps and thus address the pain points
    of our use cases. Those requirements will be used for outlining a suitable architecture
    framework in a separate document.</p>"
