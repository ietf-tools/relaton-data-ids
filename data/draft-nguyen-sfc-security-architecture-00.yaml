abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a special capability that
    defines an ordered list of network services as a virtual chain and makes a network
    more flexible and manageable. However, SFC is vulnerable to various attacks caused
    by compromised switches, especially the middlebox-bypass attack. In this document,
    we propose a security architecture that can detect not only middlebox-bypass attacks
    but also other incorrect forwarding actions by compromised switches. The existing
    solutions to protect SFC against compromised switches and middlebox-bypass attacks
    can only solve individual problems. The proposed architecture uses both probe-based
    and statistics-based methods to check the probe packets with random pre- assigned
    keys and collect statistics from middleboxes for detecting any abnormal actions
    in SFC.</p>"
