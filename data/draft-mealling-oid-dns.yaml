abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a 'resolution-mechanism'-independent architecture
    for Unifrom Resource Name (URN) usage and name space management. This non-monolothic
    architecture allows different components of the name space to be managed by the
    appropriate level of network authority. This not only integrates well with traditional
    Internet models, it allows flexibility in choice of implementation of support
    for each layer of the name space. An implementation for the architecture, using
    OIDs and DNS-based infrastructure, is outlined.</p>"
