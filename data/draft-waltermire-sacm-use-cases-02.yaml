abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies foundational use cases, derived functional
    capabilities and requirements, architectural components, and the supporting standards
    needed to define an interoperable, automation\\infrastructure required to support
    timely, accurate and actionable situational awareness over an organization's IT
    systems. Automation tools implementing a continuous monitoring approach will utilize
    this infrastructure together with existing and emerging event, incident and network
    management standards to provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities
    and network \\behavior. Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate
    and analyze relevant security and operational data to understand the organizations
    security posture, quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support
    organizational objectives while protecting critical information. Organizations
    will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities
    to collaborate with partners to identify and mitigate threats. Other automation
    tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based
    on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack
    surface.</p>"
