abstract:
- content: "<p>SLPv2 [1] has been widely implemented but not all features of the protocol
    are in common use. If these features were deprecated from the specification the
    protocol would be simpler, yet still perform its core function. The changes proposed
    in this document could be the basis for a revision of SLPv2 as it is considered
    for advancement to Draft Standard.</p>"
