abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the mirror protocol, an HTTP-based protocol
    for fetching mirrored HTTP resources. The primary use case for the mirror protocol
    is to support HTTP resource consistency checks in protocols that require clients
    have a consistent view of some protocol-specific resource (typically, a public
    key) for security or privacy reasons, including Privacy Pass and Oblivious HTTP.
    To that end, this document also describes how to use the mirror protocol to implement
    these consistency checks.</p>"
