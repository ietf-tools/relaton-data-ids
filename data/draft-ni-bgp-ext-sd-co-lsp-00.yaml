abstract:
- content: "<p>In some large scale L3VPN deployment scenarios like mobile backhaul
    network, it is required that tunnels between two PEs could be setup automatically
    driven by L3VPN service to reduce manual configuration effort. Moreover the tunnels
    must be setup co-routed for the goodness of performance monitoring and uniform
    protection behavior for link failure on two directions. This is described in [I-D.li-
    mpls-serv-driven-co-lsp-fmwk]. This document introduces a new BGP VT route based
    on [I-D.ni-bgp-ext-l3vpn-pm]. The route is utilized by on side PE to advertise
    Tunnel ID to other side PE, so inverse direction co-routed LSPs can be setup based
    on path information of member LSPs in the first tunnel.</p>"
