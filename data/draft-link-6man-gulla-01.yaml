abstract:
- content: <p>When an IPv6 prefix assigned to a link changes, hosts may not be explicitly
    notified about the change. Similarly, in some scenario a link attachement for
    the host may change without the host detecting it. In both cases the host does
    not receive any signals to trigger the network stack configuration refresh, so
    it may continue to use "old" addresses which are not valid for the link. This
    leads to packet loss and service disruption. This document proposes a mechanism
    to mitigate this issue. Routers are advised to send Router Advertisements containing
    distinct Prefix Information Options (PIOs) from different link-local addresses.
    This, in conjunction with RFC6724 (Default Source Address Selection) Rule 5.5
    and RFC8028 (first-hop selection requirements), enables hosts to detect prefix
    changes more rapidly and select the correct source address, thereby improving
    the robustness of SLAAC.</p>
