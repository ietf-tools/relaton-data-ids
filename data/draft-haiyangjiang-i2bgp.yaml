abstract:
- content: "<p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol for autonomous
    systems running on TCP. It is currently the only protocol capable of handling
    multiple connections between unrelated routing domains, such as the size of the
    Internet. BGP is built on the experience of EGP. The main function of BGP system
    is to exchange network access information with other BGP systems. However, it
    cannot fully utilizethe complete information in the domain to achieve the optimal
    decision. This document proposes I2BGP, which describes how to obtain desensitization
    information in the domain to optimize routing decisions.</p>"
