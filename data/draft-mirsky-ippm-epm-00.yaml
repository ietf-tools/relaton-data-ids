abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the error performance metric to
    characterize a packet-switched network's conformance to the pre- defined set of
    performance objectives. In this document, metrics that characterize error performance
    in a PSN are defined, as well as methods to measure and calculate them. Also,
    the requirements for an active OAM protocol to support EPM in PSN are discussed,
    and potential candidate protocols analyzed. All metrics and measurement methods
    are equally applicable to underlay and overlay networks.</p>"
