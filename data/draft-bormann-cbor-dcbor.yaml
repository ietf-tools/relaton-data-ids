abstract:
- content: <p>CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in
    its Section 4.2, providing some flexibility for application specific decisions.
    To facilitate Deterministic Encoding to be offered as a selectable feature of
    generic encoders, the present document discusses a Common CBOR Deterministic Encoding
    Profile that can be shared by a large set of applications with potentially diverging
    detailed requirements. The concept of Application Profiles is layered on top of
    the Common CBOR Deterministic Encoding Profile and can address those more application
    specific requirements. The document defines the application profile "Gordian dCBOR"
    as an example of an application profile built on the Common CBOR Deterministic
    Encoding Profile.</p>
