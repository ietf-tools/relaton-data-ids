abstract:
- content: "<p>Frequently a router may have multiple sources of information about
    paths through the network. For example, a router may be simultaneously learning
    routes from multiple routing domains, and may have static routes configured by
    the network manager. This paper resents a proposal for control of interactions
    between multiple routing protocols, including choice of routes when multiple IP
    routing protocols are being used simultaneously, as well as exchange of routes
    between routing protocols.</p>"
