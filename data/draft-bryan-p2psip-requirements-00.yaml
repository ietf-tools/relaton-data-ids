abstract:
- content: "<p>Though both SIP and various peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols have been
    widely deployed, there is no operational experience with SIP using overlay networks.
    Also, most p2p networks developed in the research community do not deal with NAT
    traversal. This document attempts to list the design requirements for a P2PSIP
    protocol taking into account the experience gained from both the p2p and the SIP
    communities. Special emphasis has been put on the SIP-DHT interface, on the overlay
    performance, on NAT traversal and on security.</p>"
