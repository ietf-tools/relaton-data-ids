abstract:
- content: "<p>There are no defined private-use namespaces in the Domain Name System
    (DNS). For a domain name to be considered private-use, it needs to be future-proof
    in that its top-level domain will never be delegated from the root zone. The lack
    of a private-use namespace has led to locally configured namespaces with a top-level
    domain that is not future proof. The DNS needs an equivalent of the facilities
    provided by BCP 5 (RFC 1918) for private internets, i.e. a range of short, semantic-free
    top-level domains that can be used in private internets without the risk of being
    globally delegated from the root zone. This document describes a particular set
    of code points which, by virtue of the way they have been designated in the ISO
    3166 standard, are thought to be plausible choices for the implementation of private
    namespaces that are anchored in top-level domains. The ISO 3166 standard is used
    for the definition of eligible designations for country-code top-level Domains.
    This standard is maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency. The ISO 3166 standard
    includes a set of user-assigned code elements that can be used by those who need
    to add further names to their local applications. Because of the rules set out
    by ISO in their standard, it is extremely unlikely that these user-assigned code
    elements would ever conflict with delegations in the root zone under current practices.
    In order to avoid the operational and security consequences of collisions between
    private and global use of these code elements as top-level domains, this document
    specifies that such top-level domains should never be deployed in the global namespace,
    and reserves them accordingly in the Special-Use Names Registry [RFC6761].</p>"
