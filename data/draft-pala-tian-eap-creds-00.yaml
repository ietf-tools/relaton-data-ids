abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that
    rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network
    access, the need for a standardized credentials provisioning and management framework
    is paramount. The 802.1x architecture allows for entities (e.g., devices, applications,
    etc.) to authenticate to the network by providing a communication channel where
    different methods can be used to exchange different types of credentials. However,
    the need for managing these credentials (i.e., provisioning and renewal) is still
    a hard problem to solve. Usually, credentails used in an access network can be
    in different levels (e.g., network-level, user-level) and sometimes tend to live
    unmanaged for quite a long time due to the challenges of operation and implementation.
    EAP-CREDS (RFC XXXX), if implemented in Managed Networks (e.g., Cable Modems),
    could enable our operators to offer a registration and credentials management
    service integrated in the home WiFi thus enabling visibility about registered
    devices. During initialization, EAP-CREDS also allows for MUD files or URLs to
    be transferred between the EAP Peer and the EAP Server, thus giving detailed visibility
    about devices when they are provisioned with credentials for accessing the networks.
    The possibility provided by EAP-CREDS can help to secure home or business networks
    by leveraging the synergies of the security teams from the network operators thanks
    to the extended knowledge of what and how is registered/ authenticated. This specifications
    define how to support the provisioning and management of authentication credentials
    that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired, WiFi, cellular,
    etc.) to users and/or devices by using EAP together with standard provisioning
    protocols.</p>"
