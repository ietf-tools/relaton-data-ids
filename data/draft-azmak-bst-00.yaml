abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP treats packet losses as an indication of congestion in the network,
    and it reduces transmission rates drastically until an optimal rate is found for
    data transmission. The problems that satellite and other wireless links pose to
    TCP have been addressed elsewhere (please see Section 2).</p>"
