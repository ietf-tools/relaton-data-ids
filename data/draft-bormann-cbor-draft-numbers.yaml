abstract:
- content: "<p>CBOR-based protocols often make use of numbers allocated in a registry.
    While developing the protocols, those numbers may not yet be available. This impedes
    the generation of data models and examples that actually can be used by tools.
    This short draft proposes a common way to handle these situations, without any
    changes to existing tools. Such changes are very well possible in the future,
    at which time this draft will be updated.</p>"
