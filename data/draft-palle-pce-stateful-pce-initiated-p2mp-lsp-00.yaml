abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate
    technology for the determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE
    LSPs. The extensions described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provide stateful
    control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSP) via PCE communication Protocol (PCEP), for a model where the Path
    Computation Client (PCC) delegates control over one or more locally configured
    LSPs to the PCE. Further [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the creation
    and deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model. This document
    provides extensions required for PCEP so as to enable stateful PCE- Initiated
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSP instantiation.</p>"
