abstract:
- content: "<p>Certificate chains often take up the majority of the bytes transmitted
    in TLS handshakes. Large handshakes can cause problems, particularly in constrained
    IoT environments. RFC 7925 defines a TLS certificate profile for constrained IoT.
    General purpose compression algorithms can in many cases not compress RFC 7925
    profiled certificates at all. By using the fact that the certificates are profiled,
    the CBOR certificate compression algorithms can in many cases compress RFC 7925
    profiled certificates with over 50%. This document specifies the CBOR certificate
    compression algorithm for use with TLS Certificate Compression in TLS 1.3 and
    DTLS 1.3.</p>"
