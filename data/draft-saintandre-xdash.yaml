abstract:
- content: <p>Historically, there has often been a perceived distinction between "standard"
    and "non-standard" parameters (such as media types and header fields), by prefixing
    the latter with the string "X-" or similar constructions (e.g., "x."). In practice,
    this convention causes more problems than it solves. Therefore, this document
    deprecates the "X-" convention for most application protocol parameters.</p>
