abstract:
- content: "<p>RADIUS has become the defacto protocol between network edge devices
    (e,g, dial NAS or Wireless AP) and a backend Authentication Server. In this environment
    the backend Server is often called a (RADIUS Server). RADIUS is gaining very broad
    penetration, even into homes, because of its use with wireless authentication.
    Because of the amount of deployed infrastructure already in place, we believe
    that RADIUS will not be supplanted by another authentication service in the foreseeable
    future. Because the widespread deployment in wireless has different infrastructure
    requirements than what is required for dialup, RADIUS requirements, especially
    trust between Edge devices and RADIUS Servers needs to be addressed. This document
    sets the requirements for RADIUS security and then sets forth technologies that
    will satisfy those requirements.</p>"
