abstract:
- content: "<p>Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the Quality
    of Experience (QoE) of network services. This document surveys a set of recommendations
    about the maximum latency tolerated by the users of services with delay constraints.
    Some recommendations already exist for e.g. VoIP, but emerging services as e.g.
    online gaming, have different requirements. Different papers in the literature
    reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a summary of the latency limits
    for each service is provided.</p>"
