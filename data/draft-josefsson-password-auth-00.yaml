abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a lack of a simple, standardized, secure and modern password-based
    mechanism for user authentication in application protocols. This document specify
    a challenge/response protocol that provide password-based authentication services.
    We describe how the protocol may be used as a GSS-API mechanism and, using the
    GS2 framework, how it may be used as a SASL mechanism. The protocol supports HMAC-SHA-256
    as the mandatory to implement algorithm, and it supports channel bindings. The
    intended use is by application protocol that today use CRAM-MD5 or DIGEST-MD5
    via SASL, or by GSS- API applications that needs a password based method. The
    protocol is applicable to other environments, such as EAP, should the need arise.
    See &lt;http://josefsson.org/password/&gt; for more information.</p>"
