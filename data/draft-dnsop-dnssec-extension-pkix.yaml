abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were standardized
    a couple of decades ago but it has not been widely deployed. Thus, a vast majority
    of DNS messages in the real world are still vulnerable to various kinds of integrity
    attacks like cache poisoning attacks. This document describes a mechanism that
    extends the current DNSSEC protocol in such a way that guarantees the integrity
    of DNS messages using PKIX certificates without any dependencies on other entities
    in the DNS infrastructure.</p>"
