abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers the optical network service model referred to
    as the 'domain services' model [1]. Under this model, the optical network provides
    a set of well-defined services to clients (IP and others). The signaling and routing
    interface between the client and optical networks is referred to as the User-Network
    Interface (UNI). This draft describes the services provided over the UNI, and
    the requirements on any signaling protocol used to invoke the services. This draft
    reflects ongoing work at the Optical Interworking Forum (OIF) and the Optical
    Domain Service Interconnect (ODSI) coalition on the optical UNI [2]. The relevance
    of this draft to the IETF is two-fold. First, for the signaling portion of the
    optical UNI, extensions of two MPLS signaling protocols are presently under consideration
    in the OIF: RSVP with TE extensions and LDP. The objective of this draft is to
    guide the adaptation of these protocols for UNI signaling. Second, to harmonize
    the signaling of UNI originated lightpath requests and peer model lightpath establishment
    mechanisms [1], alignment between OIF, ODSI and IETF lightpath parameters and
    signaling functionality is desirable. This draft aims to serve this purpose. The
    content of this draft is expected to evolve as work progresses on the optical
    UNI.</p>"
