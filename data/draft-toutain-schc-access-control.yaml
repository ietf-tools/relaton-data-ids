abstract:
- content: "<p>The framework for SCHC defines an abstract view of the rules, formalized
    through a YANG Data Model. In its original description, rules are static and shared
    by two endpoints. The use of YANG authorizes rules to be uploaded or modified
    in a SCHC instance and leads to some possible attacks if the changes are not controlled.
    This document defines a threat model, summarizes some possible attacks, and defines
    augmentation to the existing Data Model in order to restrict the changes in the
    rule and, therefore, the impact of possible attacks.</p>"
