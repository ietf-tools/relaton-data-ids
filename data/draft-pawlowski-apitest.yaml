abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Standards Process [RFC2026] requires that all IETF Standards
    Track specifications must have 'multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations'
    before they can be advanced beyond Proposed Standard status. This document specifies
    the test which the IESG will use to determine if an Application Programming Interface
    (API) specification document meets these requirements. It also discusses the rationale
    for this process.</p>"
