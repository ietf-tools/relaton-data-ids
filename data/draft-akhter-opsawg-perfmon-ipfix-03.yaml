abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of
    RTP based applications. This performance data provides information essential in
    validating service level agreements, fault isolation as well as early warnings
    of greater problems. This document describes IPFIX Information Elements related
    to RTP performance measurement of network based applications. In addition, to
    the performance information several non-metric information elements are also included
    to provide greater context to the reports. The measurements use audio/video applications
    as a base but are not restricted to these class of applications. These new IPFIX
    Information Elements can describe the entire duration of an RTP stream or a smaller
    time slice of it.</p>"
