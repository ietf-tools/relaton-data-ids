abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things is marching it's way towards completition. Nodes
    can use standards from the 6LoWPAN and ROLL WG to achieve IP connectivity. IEEE
    Standards ensure connectivity at lower layers for resource-constrained devices.
    Yet a central problem remains at a more basic layer without a suitable answer:
    how to initially configure the network. Without configuration the network never
    advances beyond a large box of nodes. Current solutions tend to be specific to
    a certain vendor, node type, or application. This document outlines exactly what
    problems are faced in solving this problem. General problems faced in any low-power
    wireless network are outlined first; followed by how these apply to bootstrapping.
    A selection of currently proposed techniques is presented. From these a more generic
    approach is presented, which can solve the problem for a wide range of situations.
    An emphasis is on performing this bootstrapping in a secure manner. This document
    does not cover operationg of the network securely. This document does provide
    the basis for allowing the network to operate securely however, by providing standard
    methods for key exchanges and authentication.</p>"
