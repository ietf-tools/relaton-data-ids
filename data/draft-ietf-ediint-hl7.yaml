abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the applicability of the Internet standardization
    efforts on secure electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions for Health Level-7
    (HL7), an EDI standard for healthcare used worldwide. This memo heavily relies
    on the work in progress by the IETF EDIINT working group. It is in most parts
    a restatement of the EDIINTs requirements document and application statement 1
    (AS#1) tailored to the needs of the HL7 audience. We tried to make this document
    as self consistent as possible. The goal is to give to the reader who is not a
    security or Internet standards expert enough foundational and detail information
    to enable him to build communication software that complies to the Internet standards.
    Even though we rely on and promote the respective Internet standards and drafts,
    we did not withstand from commenting on and criticising this work where we see
    upcoming problems in use with HL7 or other EDI protocols that have not been in
    the initial focus of the EDIINT working group. We make suggestions to add parameters
    to the specification of the MIME type for EDI messages [RFC 1767] in order to
    enhance functionality. We give use cases for a larger subset of disposition types
    and modifiers of message disposition notifications. One key issue where this memo
    goes beyond the current EDIINT drafts is the concept of non-repudiation of commitment
    to an EDI transaction. Secure EDI transactions should be regarded as ``distributed
    contracts,'' i.e. not only the sending and receiving of single messages should
    be non-refutable but also the connection between messages interchanges. In anticipation
    of this requirement HL7 usually requires a response message to be sent to acknowledge
    every transaction. We therefore have the requirement to securely couple an EDI
    response message to its request message. Given the current shape of RFC 1767 this
    is generally possible only if a response message is coupled with an MDN receipt
    and the combi</p>"
