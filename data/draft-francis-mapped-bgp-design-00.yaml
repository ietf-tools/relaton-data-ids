abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces Mapped-BGP, a routing protocol that uses BGP
    to distributed tunnel endpoint-to-prefix mappings. The goal of this draft are
    to present preliminary concepts and get feedback. It is not meant to be a fully-formed
    proposal. The goals of Mapped-BGP are: 1) to reduce the processing required to
    run BGP, 2) to speed up inter-domain convergence, 3) to improve the cross-ISP
    load balancing capabilities of BGP, and where possible, 4) to enable forms of
    address aggregation like geographical addressing (i.e. for IPv6). Improved address
    aggregation is unlikely to be very useful for IPv4, because most addresses have
    already been assigned. This design takes the position that Mapped BGP is useful
    even without better aggregation, because 1) FIB size can be reduced through FIB
    suppression with Virtual Aggregation, and 2) RIB size per se is not the growth
    bottleneck.</p>"
