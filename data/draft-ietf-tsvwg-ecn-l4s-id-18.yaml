abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network
    service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S). L4S uses an
    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP layer that is similar
    to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach, except as specified within. L4S uses
    'scalable' congestion control, which induces much more frequent control signals
    from the network and it responds to them with much more fine-grained adjustments,
    so that very low (typically sub-millisecond on average) and consistently low queuing
    delay becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization.
    Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very
    low delay at the same time, even during periods of high traffic load. The L4S
    identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly)
    traffic. It gives an incremental migration path so that suitably modified network
    bottlenecks can distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the
    Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and low loss
    of L4S traffic. This specification defines the rules that L4S transports and network
    elements need to follow with the intention that L4S flows neither harm each other's
    performance nor that of Classic traffic. Examples of new active queue management
    (AQM) marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time)
    are specified separately.</p>"
