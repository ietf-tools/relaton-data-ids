abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a secure method to configure a key for a node
    when it initially joins to network that is currently in operation. The method
    is suited for a scenario, where resource constrained objects are interconnected
    with each other and thus form a network called Internet of Things. It is assumed
    that communications for all nodes are based on TCP/IP protocols and some of the
    nodes use the constrained application protocol (CoAP). The method does not cover
    all operations of secure bootstrapping, but it is intended to securely support
    self-reconfiguration of the pre-installed temporary key of new node.</p>"
