abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource reservation needs to accommodate the rapidly growing size
    and increasing service diversity of the Internet. This memo first defines the
    scaling problem in today's Internet backbone, and briefly discusses several existing
    resource management approaches. Then we will present a distributed approach and
    introduce a protocol, called the Border Gateway Reservation Protocol (BGRP), for
    inter-domain resource reservation that can scale in terms of message processing
    load, state storage and control message bandwidth. The main idea of our approach
    is to build a sink tree for each domain network. Each sink tree aggregates reservations
    from all data sources in the network. Sink tree initiation, maintenance and termination
    involve only backbone border routers. Within each domain, the network service
    providers manage network resource and direct user traffic independently. At the
    border routers, the service providers can use BGRP to setup domain-level reservation
    trunks base on bi- lateral agreement. Since routers only maintain the sink tree
    information, the total number of reservation states at each router scales, in
    the worst case, linearly with the number of domains in the Internet. For bandwidth
    reservation, BGRP relies on differentiated services for data forwarding. As a
    result, the number of packet classifier entries is small. To reduce the protocol
    message traffic, routers may reserve domain bandwidth beyond the current load
    so that sources can join or leave the tree or change their reservation without
    having to send messages all the way to the root for every such change.</p>"
