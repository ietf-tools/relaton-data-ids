abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability of a hierarchy of PCEs to compute accurate end-to-end paths
    across multiple domains is recognized as an important requirement in many applications.
    This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) in
    order to provide new path-related bandwidth metrics, which a PCC, like a H-PCE
    (either stateful or stateless), can use from an erstwhile path computation to
    deploy multiple LSPs (having the same end-points and constraints) without additional
    requests, until either the remaining bandwidth along that path is all allocated
    or a deployment fails. This information would also be beneficial for implementing
    abstractions of the domain topology, building the abstract connectivity incrementally,
    based only on really used constraints, as soon as path computation results are
    returned.</p>"
