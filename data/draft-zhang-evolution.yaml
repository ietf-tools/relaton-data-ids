abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet routing scalability has long been considered a serious problem.
    Although many efforts have been devoted to address this problem over the years,
    the IETF community as a whole is yet to achieve a shared understanding on what
    is the best way forward. In this draft, we step up a level to re-examine the problem
    and the ongoing efforts. we conclude that, to effectively solve the routing scalability
    problem, we first need a clear understanding on how to introduce solutions to
    the Internet which is a global scale deployed system. In this draft we sketch
    out our reasoning on the need for an evolutionary path towards scaling the global
    routing system, instead of attempting to introduce a brand new design.</p>"
