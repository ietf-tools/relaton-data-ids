    controller discovery in an IP network. Broadcast and Multicast service over 3G
    wireless networks are being developed at the time of writing this document. Users
    of this service interact with a controller in the network to derive informations
    that are required to receive broadcast service. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    can be used to configure the controller IPv6 addresses in the user's devices.
    This document defines the related options and option codes.</p>"
