abstract:
- content: "<p>''mtrace'' [1] is a very useful tool for diagnosing IP multicast rout-
    ing problems, such as multicast routing loops and misconfigured mul- ticast routers,
    associated with source-rooted RPF-based distribution trees. For ''mtrace'' to
    be useful in a shared tree environment (e.g. PIM [2], CBT [3], GUM [4]) its behaviour
    must be modified. This draft speci- fies that behaviour, which is sufficiently
    general to be applicable to all shared tree types and operating modes. A new ''wildcard''
    mode of behaviour is also described, which allows a trace of a complete shared
    tree. Authentication is recommended in this mode because of its potential as a
    vehicle for denial of service attacks. It is intended that this draft become a
    document of the Mbone Deploy- ment (mboned) working group of the IETF. Therefore,
    comments are solicited and should be sent to mboned's mailing list &lt;mboned@network-
    services.uoregon.edu&gt; and/or the author.</p>"
