abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known
    as enterprise networks) for calls that undergo diversion. SIP is an Internet application-layer
    control (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions
    with one or more participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone
    calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched
    calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated Services Networks
    (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number of Ecma Standards and published also as
    ISO/IEC standards.</p>"
