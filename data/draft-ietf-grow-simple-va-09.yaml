abstract:
- content: "<p>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways. One of the most costly stresses
    is Forwarding Information Base (FIB) size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware
    simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router vendors must design routers
    that have adequate FIB. FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on
    the FIB by NOT loading selected RIB entries into the FIB. Simple Virtual Aggregation
    (S-VA) is a simple form of Virtual Aggregation (VA) that allows any and all edge
    routers to shrink their RIB and FIB requirements substantially and therefore increase
    their useful lifetime. S-VA does not increase FIB requirements for core routers.
    S-VA is extremely easy to configure considerably more so than the various tricks
    done today to extend the life of edge routers. S-VA can be deployed autonomously
    by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy
    routers in the ISP.</p>"
