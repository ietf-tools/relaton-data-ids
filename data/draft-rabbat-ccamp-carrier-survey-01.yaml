abstract:
- content: "<p>Optical transport networks operated using a GMPLS-based control plane
    enable todays network operators to offer valuable new services. With the completion
    of a number of GMPLS signaling and routing standards and the availability of products
    implementing them, providers are now looking at ways to enable additional features,
    such as shared-mesh restoration. These can be key to efficient network operation
    while providing strict performance guarantees. In that context, several areas
    of work still need to be addressed within the CCAMP WG of the IETF to develop
    interoperable, standards-based solutions that carriers can embrace. Towards that
    end, this document presents the results of a serious attempt to systematically
    gather and collate carrier inputs on strategies for shared-mesh restoration and
    the associated issues. The survey results are presented in aggregate form to provide
    an overview of carrier thinking, while retaining specific carrier response confidentiality.
    The goal is to highlight areas of carrier concerns, and identify specific work
    items to focus on and facilitate further discussion on them. This is to enable
    the CCAMP WG to pursue ongoing and further work in this area that is focused towards
    addressing the identified carrier requirements.</p>"
