abstract:
- content: <p>DNS over TLS (DoT) has been gaining attention, primarily as a means
    of communication between stub resolvers and recursive resolvers. There have also
    been discussions and experiments involving the use of DoT to communicate with
    authoritative nameservers (Authoritative DNS over TLS or "ADoT"), including communication
    between recursive and authoritative resolvers. However, we have identified a number
    of operational concerns with ADoT that have arisen as DNS operators have begun
    to experiment with and prepare for deploying DoT. These operational concerns need
    to be addressed prior to ADoT's deployment at scale by DNS operators in order
    to maintain the stability and resilience of the global DNS. The document also
    provides some suggested next steps to advance the operator community's understanding
    of ADoT's operational impact.</p>
