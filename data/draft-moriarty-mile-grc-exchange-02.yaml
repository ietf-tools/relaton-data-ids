abstract:
- content: "<p>Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs provide oversight (governance)
    of risks and compliance initiatives within an organization. GRC reports are increasingly
    provided in an XML format. This specification defines a common method to securely
    transport GRC and other XML reports. The defined messaging capability provides
    policy options and markings in an XML schema, options for confidentiality at the
    document/report level, and security for the end-to-end communication. XML reports
    may be shared between service providers and clients, enterprises, or within enterprises.
    Reports may also be exchanged for official purposes such as business report filings,
    compliance report filings, and the handling of legal incidents (eWarrant, eDiscovery,
    etc.) This work is a generalized format derived from the secure exchange of incident
    information defined by RFC6545, Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID).</p>"
