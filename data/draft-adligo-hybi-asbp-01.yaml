abstract:
- content: <p>ASBP (Asynchronous Services Bus Protocol) is a simple command based
    application-level protocol for routing data and messages. ASBP is intended to
    allow implementation of fully Asynchronous Service Bus Architectures, in a simple
    standardized manor. ASBP is intended to be layered over WebSocket or HTTP. The
    protocol consists of a simple UTF-8 key value(s) header and any arbitrary data
    (text, binary, XML, JSON, etc.), which the application's specific Command-Attendant
    or Command-Respondent processes. In addition this document touches on an extension
    to ASBP, CP (Conversation Protocol) a protocol used to facilitate communication
    between Asynchronous Service Busses implemented or hosted by different organizations.
    CP will be covered in more detail in another RFC still in progress. Internet-Draft
    This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the provisions of BCP
    78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
