abstract:
- content: <p>The "alert" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used in
    the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and
    responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the characteristics of the
    call that the user agent has originated or terminated. Based on the URNs in the
    Alert-Info header field, the user agent must select an the best available signal
    to present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call. This document
    describes a method by which a user agent's designer can, based on the user agent's
    signals and their meanings, constructing a finite state machine (FSM) to process
    the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in the
    definition of the "alert" URN namespace. In many situations, the resulting FSM
    is simpler and faster than the previously described selection algorithm.</p>
