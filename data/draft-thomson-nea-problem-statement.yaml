abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Endpoint Assessment (NEA) architectures have been implemented
    in the industry, e.g. [TNC, NAP, NAC], to assess the software or hardware configuration
    of endpoint devices for the purposes of monitoring compliance of endpoints to
    an organization's policy for access to the network, and optionally restricting
    or denying access until the endpoint has been updated to satisfy the requirements.
    While these architectures share common components and interfaces to support network
    endpoint assessment, these components are not interoperable because not all required
    protocols are standards. This document describes the problem these architectures
    are intending to address, defines common terminology and concepts, and identifies
    interfaces that are candidates for standardization.</p>"
