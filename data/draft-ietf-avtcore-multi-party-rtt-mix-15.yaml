abstract:
- content: <p>Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing are provided in this
    document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables source identification
    and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from different sources. The intended
    use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing
    an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multi-party real-time text session.
    The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the CSRC list in the RTP
    packet for source identification. The method makes use of the same "text/t140"
    and "text/red" formats as for two- party sessions. Solutions using multiple RTP
    streams in the same RTP session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some
    benefits over the RTP- mixer model. The possibility to implement the solution
    in a wide range of existing RTP implementations made the RTP-mixer model be selected
    to be fully specified in this document. A capability exchange is specified so
    that it can be verified that a mixer and a participant can handle the multi-party
    coded real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method. The capability is indicated
    by use of an SDP media attribute "rtt-mixer". The document updates RFC 4103 "RTP
    Payload for Text Conversation". A specification of how a mixer can format text
    for the case when the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.</p>
