abstract:
- content: "<p>The ForCES Forwarding Element Model [Model] defines a model and schema
    for representing Logical Functional Block (LFB) classes and their operational
    and capability attributes. The operational attributes of LFB instances within
    a Forwarding Element (FE) are manipulated by the ForCES protocol [ForCES] to configure
    the operation of the FE. The model assumes that any particular LFB attribute is
    owned and accessed exclusively by a single LFB instance. While this is a simple
    and clean restriction, we observe that it imposes some complications when defining
    LFBs. This memo addresses these complications and proposes that the restriction
    be re-examined.</p>"
