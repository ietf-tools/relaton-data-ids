abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP specification defines a Decision Process for installation of
    routes into the Loc-RIB. This process takes into account an extensive series of
    path attributes, which can be manipulated to indicate preference for specific
    paths. It is cumbersome (if at all possible) for the end user to define policies
    that will select, after partial comparison, a path based on subjective local (domain
    and/or node) criteria. This document defines a new Extended Community, called
    the Cost Community, which may be used in tie breaking during the best path selection
    process. The end result is a local custom decision process.</p>"
