abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for controlling two specific types
    of Ethernet switching via Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).
    This document supports the types of switching required to implied by the Ethernet
    services that have been defined in the context of the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)
    and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) G.8011. Specifically, switching
    in support of Ethernet private line service and Ethernet virtual private line
    service. Support for MEF and ITU defined parameters are also covered. Some of
    the extensions defined in this document are generic in nature and not specific
    to Ethernet.Contents</p>"
