abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft outlines the pluggable module attributes within a host device.
    It includes representations of optical pluggable module capabilities, configuration,
    states, and telemetry data. These attributes draws from existing IETF standards
    and incorporates input from other industry forums and standards, such as ITU-T,
    OpenConfig, OIF and ONF TAPI, to ensure uniform structuring and consistent naming
    conventions. Note that the IETF terminology shall be given precedence wherever
    possible. In case there is a duplication of an attribute, this draft may describe
    how the attribute is named in the related document. Only if no attribute exists
    in IETF RFCs or IETF WG drafts, new attributes shall be introduced if they are
    needed. This draft provides a gap analysis with respect to existing IETF work
    in the following areas: * It provides an analysis of optical attributes provided
    by other organizations and identifying modeling gaps in current IETF drafts. *
    It identifies modeling needs addressing the specific aspect of pluggability of
    transceiver modules. The authors recognize the fact that that not all pluggable
    modules are coherent, not all coherent pluggable modules are DWDM capable and
    not all DWDM capable interfaces are implemented as pluggable modules. This analysis
    identifies gaps to manage the lifecycle of an optical pluggable module, from operator
    approval and viability assessment, to deployment, monitoring and phase-out. The
    lifecycle of an optical pluggable module, from operator approval and viability
    assessment to deployment and monitoring, is also addressed. About This Document
