abstract:
- content: <p>TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of | connections
    and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder (server) state during the
    initial handshake. The Initiator (client) has sole responsibility for ensuring
    required delays between connections. The cookie exchange may carry data, limited
    to inhibit amplification and reflection denial of service attacks. This document
    provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API) to support "basic" and
    "advanced" TCPCT applications. TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API
    have enjoyed a high degree of portability. Copyright Notice Copyright (c) 2011
