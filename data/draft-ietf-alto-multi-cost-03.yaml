abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO (Application Layer-Traffic Optimization) Protocol ([RFC7285])
    defines several services that return various metrics describing the costs between
    network endpoints. An ALTO Server may offer a variety of cost metrics, based on
    latency,bandwidth, hop count, jitter, or whatever else the ALTO Server deems useful.
    For example, when downloading a file that is mirrored on several sites, a user
    application may consider more than one metric, perhaps trading bandwidth for latency
    to determine the most efficient mirror site. While the base ALTO Protocol allows
    a client to use more than one cost metric, to do so, the client must request each
    metric separately. This document defines a new service that allows a client to
    retrieve several cost metrics with one request, which is considerably more efficient.
    In addition, this document extends the ALTO constraint tests to allow a user to
    specify an arbitrary logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.</p>"
