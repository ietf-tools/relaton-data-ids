abstract:
- content: "<p>Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout the
    last few millennia. Its most striking feature is the difficulty that disparate
    parties encounter when they attempt to precisely define it. In order to discuss
    privacy in a meaningful way, a tightly defined context is necessary. The specific
    context of privacy used within this document is that of personal data in Internet
    protocols. Personal data is any information relating to a data subject, where
    a data subject is an identified natural person or a natural person who can be
    identified, directly or indirectly. A lot of work within the IETF involves defining
    protocols that can potentially transport (either explicitly or implicitly) personal
    data. This document aims to establish a consistent lexicon around privacy for
    IETF contributors to use when discussing privacy considerations within their work.
