abstract:
- content: "<p>In current NSIS signaling, there are two main functions depending on
    Flow ID, i.e. signaling message routing, data packet classification. Specifically,
    the same information carried by the MRI is also used to derive the packet classification
    at NSLP layer. This arrangement assumes that identical information is required
    by the two functions at two different layers, and thus has limitations. With the
    introduction of NSIS applications in more complicated scenarios, such assumption
    can no longer hold. Therefore, keeping the dependency between the two functions
    hinders the development of NSIS. Efforts have been made in different NSLP layer
    applications to extend the relationship, e.g. QoS NSLP. This draft studied the
    possibility of disjoining the information for the two functions. Problems faced
    by the current system and different remedy options are discussed. With these details,
    it is intended to help the reader to evaluate the feasibility of redefining the
    packet classification information signaling in NSIS.</p>"
