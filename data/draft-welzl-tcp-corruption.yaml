abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies options that enable TCP to detect corruption in
    the presence of link layers which hand over known-corrupt data to upper layers.
    The receiver notifies the sender of an erroneous segment that would otherwise
    be lost and assumed to be a sign of congestion. The sender uses this ACK to drive
    its RTO calculation, retransmit the segment and react to congestion earlier if
    ECE=1. In addition, this feedback could be used to realize a more appropriate
    rate change in response to such lost segments.</p>"
