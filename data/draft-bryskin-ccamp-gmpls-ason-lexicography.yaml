abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed
    by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in
    a variety of physical technologies and across several architectural models. The
    ITU-T has specified an architecture for the management of Automatically Switched
    Optical Networks (ASON). This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation
    of GMPLS terminology within the context of the ASON architecture. It is important
    to note that GMPLS is applicable in a far wider set of contexts than just ASON.
    Thus the definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive or complete
    interpretations of the GMPLS concepts. The intention of this document is simply
    to allow the GMPLS terms to be applied within the ASON context.</p>"
