abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes mechanisms for address selection in hosts within
    a multihomed site. The goal of these mechanisms is to allow hosts within the multihomed
    site to establish new communications after an outage. The presented mechanisms
    are not by themselves a complete multihoming solution but rather a component of
    such solution.</p>"
