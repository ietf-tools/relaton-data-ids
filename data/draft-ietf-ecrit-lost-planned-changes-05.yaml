abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the Location to Service Translation
    (LoST) protocol (RFC5222) that allows planned changes to the data to be handled
    smoothly. This extension is only useful with the validation function of LoST.
    It is beneficial for LoST validation clients to be aware of planned changes, as
    records that previously were valid may become invalid at a known future date,
    and new locations may become valid after the date. This extension adds an element
    to the &lt;findService&gt; request: a date that allows the LoST client to request
    that the server perform validation as of the date specified. It adds an optional
    Time-To-Live element to the response, which informs clients of the current expected
    lifetime of a validation. It also adds a separate interface to the LoST server
    that allows a client to poll for planned changes. Additionally, this document
    provides a conventional XML schema for LoST, as a backwards compatible alternative
    to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222.</p>"
