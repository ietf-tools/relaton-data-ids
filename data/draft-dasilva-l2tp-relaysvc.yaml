abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
    (L2TP), facilitates the tunneling of PPP packets across an intervening packet-switched
    network. And yet a third protocol, PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) describes how to
    build PPP sessions and to encapsulate PPP packets over Ethernet. L2TP Active Discovery
    Relay for PPPoE describes a method to relay Active Discovery and Service Selection
    functionality from PPPoE over the reliable control channel within L2TP. Two new
    L2TP control message types and associated PPPoE-specific Attribute Value Pairs
    (AVPs) for L2TP are defined. This relay mechanism provides enhanced integration
    of a specific feature in the PPPoE tunneling protocol with L2TP. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
