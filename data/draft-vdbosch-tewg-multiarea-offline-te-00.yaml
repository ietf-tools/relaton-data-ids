abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach to engineer a hierarchical network
    by means of offline traffic engineering. This approach can be used as a stand-alone
    solution, as was recently described as an example of a best current practice,
    or it may be combined with online traffic engineering. The offline approach presented
    here uses global information about network topology and traffic matrix to optimize
    explicit routes in the network. The optimization is based on the definition of
    global network performance parameters.</p>"
