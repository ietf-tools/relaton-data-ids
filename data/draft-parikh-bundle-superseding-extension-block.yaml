abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an optional Bundle Protocol block called the
    Superseding Bundle Extension Block (SBEB) for use with the Bundle Protocol in
    the context of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Architecture. Applications use this
    block to call for the removal of previously sent bundles that are rendered obsolete
    by more recent bundles. Upon receiving a bundle with an SBEB, a node will search
    its bundle store (and outbound queues) for bundles that are obsoleted by other
    related bundles according to their source and destination EID, and the SBEB cookie
    (if present), and may delete some or all of them. Discarding obsolete bundles
    helps conserve storage space and prevents expending resources in further forwarding
    bundles that are no longer relevant. The bundle protocol already uses expiration
    times to remove bundles that are no longer useful to applications. The SBEB is
    a way for applications to mark bundles that a node may delete prior to their expiration
    times.</p>"
