abstract:
- content: <p>Although the Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions has been
    implemented, cache poisoning is still a big issue. "ID Guessing and Query Prediction"
    type cache poisoning is detectable on a full resolver. TCP transport has strong
    resistance to cache poisoning attacks. This document proposes an improvement of
    full resolvers about the detection and the measure against forged response cache
    poisoning attacks.</p>
