    Nov.07 [RFC4379] describes procedures for ping and tracerouting for LSPs with
    PSC (packet switch capable) transit switching capability. An important implication
    of using transparent (non-PSC) nodes in GMPLS network is that LSP Ping solution
    described in [RFC4379] are not applicable to LSP with non-PSC switching capability.
    Another important difference between PSC and non-PSC switching technologies is
    the data and control plan separation in the latter case. An implication of the
    separation of data and control planes in GMPLS networks is that LSP traceroute
    procedures described in [RFC4379] are not directly applicable to GMPLS networks
    with separation of data and control planes. The scope of this draft is cases where
    data plane does not provide the OAM functions addressed by this draft. This document
    is assumed that OAM mechanisms provided by the underlying data plan technology
    MUST be used, whenever possible. E.g., G.709 addresses the problem of trace routing
    in DWDM network. However, G.709 OAM mechanisms are only applicable to OEO (Optical-Electrical-Optical)
    capable node. This document fills in such gaps; in particular it addresses GMPLS
    OAM functionality in optical networks with wavelength routers, ROADMs nodes, etc.
    with no OEO conversion capability. For this purpose, the draft relies on control
    plan mechanism to provide required OAM functions. Specifically the proposed solutions
    are based on Link Management Protocol (LMP) [RFC4204] and RSVP-TE [RFC3209], [RFC3473]
    and do not require any extension to the data plan. Conventions used in this document
    In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in RFC-2119.</p>
