abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method to accomplish performance monitoring
    measurements on live IP flows, including packet loss, one-way delay and jitter.
    The proposed method is applicable to both unicast and multicast traffic, but only
    IP multicast streams are considered in this document. The method can be implemented
    using tools and features already available on IP routers and does not require
    any protocol extension. For this reason, it does not raise any interoperability
    issue. However, the method could be further improved by means of some extension
    to existing protocols, but this aspect is left for further study and it is out
    of the scope of the document.</p>"
