abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the DNS Security Extensions (commonly called
    "DNSSEC") that are specified in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035, as well as a handful
    of others. One purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in one place so that the
    reader can understand the many aspects of DNSSEC. This document does not update
    any of those RFCs. A second purpose is to state that using DNSSEC for origin authentication
    of DNS data is the best current practice. A third purpose is to provide a single
    reference for other documents that want to refer to DNSSEC. This document obsoletes
    RFC 9364. This document is being tracked at (https://github.com/paulehoffman/
    rfc9364bis).</p>
