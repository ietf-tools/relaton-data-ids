abstract:
- content: "<p>In wireless networks, there is a need to discover what types of networks
    are around a particular node. This need arises both when a node connects initially
    to a network and when a node needs to perform handover. Characteristics such as
    type of wireless technology, service provider, bandwidth availability, etc. may
    all be of interest in making a network connection or handover decision. In addition,
    a mobile node may require a mapping between the Layer 2 access point identifier
    and IP link information such as the Mobile IPv4 foreign agent address, or IPv6
    access router address and subnet prefixes, so that the node can configure itself
    for the new IP link prior to moving. This document describes the Neighborhood
    information Elements Discovery (NED) protocol, for representing information elements
    that contain neighborhood information. The packet format presented in this document
    is independent of transport so that multiple mobility protocols can make use of
    it.</p>"
