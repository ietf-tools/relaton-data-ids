abstract:
- content: "<p>There exists a class of applications which cannot accept Path MTU discovery
    [RFC-1981]. This is recommended to be turned on by default for IPv6 [IPV6-SPEC-V2,
    4.5, 5]. This document describes an extension to the BSD API [RFC-2133] to inform
    the kernel when it should be fragmenting at the network MTU rather than trying
    to discover the path MTU. Path MTU discovery works well when there is a stream
    of data. However for distributed servers sending small answers larger than the
    network MTU to many clients the lack of fragmentation in intermediate nodes is
    anathema. RFC-1981 Section 5.6 recommends that a system utility be provided to:
    - Specify that Path MTU Discovery not be done on a given path. - Change the PMTU
    value associated with a given path. This documents specifies how to do the same
    at the application level to a individual socket.</p>"
