abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been recognized that the success of the MPLS depends on the
    ability to better support the multiservice traffic integration with some levels
    of service guarantees, which are not feasible to implement with the current destination
    prefix only based packet forwarding paradigms. The efficient support for these
    services throughout the network is expected to be possible using label based forwarding
    paradigm in the network. Through the use of either RSVP based or LDP/CR-LDP based
    signaling, MPLS can also provide certain QoS guarantees using the LSPs. The goal
    of this document is to define a framework for service differentiation in MPLS
    networks. We discuss a set of services that have been identified so far for IP,
    and describe the traffic management mechanisms in various network elements that
    are needed for enabling the implementation of these more advanced services in
    MPLS networks.</p>"
