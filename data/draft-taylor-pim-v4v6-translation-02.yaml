abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the procedures required for correct operation
    of a multicast router in a mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environment, where some or all
    of the multicast group and unicast source addresses can be translated between
    IPv4 and IPv6, and where incoming multicast data may need to be forwarded into
    both IPv4 and IPv6 distribution trees. The router is assumed to support Protocol
    Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM, RFC 4601) in an environment consisting
    of a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 local hosts and PIM peers. The work is easily generalized
    to other versions of PIM.</p>"
