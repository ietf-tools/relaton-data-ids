abstract:
- content: "<p>At the 51st IETF meeting in London, there was much disagreement in
    the MIDCOM working group about the need for topology information in the MIDCOM
    requirements. It was decided that there should be a 'contest of champions' in
    which interested parties write drafts describing their solution to the problem.
    This document presents a proposal for the inclusion of minimal topological information
    in the MIDCOM protocol by the use of abstract realms.</p>"
