abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations associated
    with pervasive surveillance. Some of the reported attacks involved compromising
    the smart card supply chain, such as attacking SIM card manufacturers and operators
    in an effort to compromise shared secrets stored on these cards. Since the publication
    of those reports, manufacturing and provisioning processes have gained much scrutiny
    and have improved. However, the danger of resourceful attackers for these systems
    is still a concern. Always assuming breach such as key compromise and minimizing
    the impact of breach are essential zero-trust principles. This specification is
    an optional extension to the EAP-AKA' authentication method which was defined
    in [RFC9048]. The extension, when negotiated, provides Forward Secrecy for the
    session key generated as a part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'. This prevents
    an attacker who has gained access to the long-term pre- shared secret in a SIM
    card from being able to decrypt any past communications. In addition, if the attacker
    stays merely a passive eavesdropper, the extension prevents attacks against future
    sessions. This forces attackers to use active attacks instead.</p>"
