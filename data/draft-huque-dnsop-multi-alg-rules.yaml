abstract:
- content: "<p>This document restates the requirements on DNSSEC signing and validation
    and makes small adjustments in order to allow for more flexible handling of configurations
    that advertise multiple Secure Entry Points (SEP) with different signing algorithms
    via their DS record or trust anchor set. The adjusted rules allow both for multi-
    signer operation and for the transfer of signed DNS zones between providers, where
    the providers support disjoint DNSSEC algorithm sets. In addition, the proposal
    enables pre-publication of a trust anchor in preparation for an algorithm rollover,
    such as of the root zone. This document updates RFCs 4035, 6840, and 8624.</p>"
