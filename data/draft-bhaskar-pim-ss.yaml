abstract:
- content: "<p>Source-Specific PIM (PIM-SS) is a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that only
    builds source specific shortest path trees. These trees are built directly on
    receiving group membership reports that request a given source. PIM-SS precludes
    the building of shared trees, effectively par- titioning the different source
    trees from one another. For this reason it is specifically suited for existing
    multicast applications for which there is expected and intended to be exactly
    one source. Source-Specific PIM can co-exist with PIM-SM. It uses a subset of
    PIM-SM messages and lends itself to incremental deployment.</p>"
