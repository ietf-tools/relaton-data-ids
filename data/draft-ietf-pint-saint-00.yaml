abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft has arisen out of work concentrating on the interconnection
    of IP and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) undertaken within the PINT
    working group. Efforts within this group have, to date, concentrated on the initiation
    of PSTN services from the Internet. This Internet Draft aims to describe a possible
    architecture for the implementation of services initiated from the PSTN such as,
    but not limited to, Internet Call Waiting (ICW). It also identifies the possibility
    of using this class of service, in conjunction with the PINT work already undertaken,
    in order to provide a third flavour of service. This Internet Draft deliberately
    does not to define the protocols for these kinds of services, although descriptions
    contained within it do use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) terminology. The
    purpose of this Internet Draft is to ascertain the level of interest in pursuing
    this area of work. It is submitted with the goal of forming the basis of an Informational
    RFC and thereby further work on the standardisation of the provision of these
    kinds of services.</p>"
