abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a set of use cases and requirements for an
    extension to Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) called Verifiable STI
    PERsona (VESPER). VESPER fundamentally enhances STIR by establishing an authoritative
    and cryptographically verifiable Right-to-Use (RTU) relationship between telephone
    numbers and their assigned entities, business organizations or individuals, through
    digital signatures that bind an entity to a set of asserted claims, delegate certificates
    that govern the assertion of those claims to a responsible party, and Authority
    Tokens that prove the validitation of those claims by authoritative parties. This
    cryptographic binding ensures explicit non-repudiation, removing ambiguity around
    who is accountable for calls or messages originating from specific telephone numbers,
    significantly deterring spoofing and fraud.</p>"
