- content: "<p>This document discusses how inter-domain routing using Shared Risk
    Group (SRG) may be used for computing diverse paths, and also discusses the extensions
    that we propose for routing (and eventually signaling) protocols. The concepts
    proposed in this document are useful to provide the requested intelligent control
    plane for multi- layered networks.</p>"
