abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation
    (SCHC) framework, which provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional
    fragmentation mechanism. SCHC has been designed with Low-Power Wide Area Networks
    (LPWANs) in mind. SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored
    both in the LPWAN device and in the network infrastructure side. This document
    defines a generic header compression mechanism and its application to compress
    IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies an optional fragmentation and reassembly
    mechanism. It can be used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN technologies.
    Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when
    such compression was not possible, still exceed the Layer 2 maximum payload size.
    The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are independent of the
    specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. This document defines generic
    functionalities and offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism
    choices. This document standardizes the exchange over the LPWAN between two SCHC
    entities. Settings and choices specific to a technology or a product are expected
    to be grouped into profiles, which are specified in other documents. Data models
    for the context and profiles are out of scope.</p>"
