abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [3] was used to announce information
    for all available multicast sessions to the prospective receiver in an experimental
    network. It is usefull and easy to use, but difficult to control the SAP message
    transmission in a wide area network. This document describes the several major
    limitations SAP has and the requirement of multicast session announcement in the
    global Internet.</p>"
