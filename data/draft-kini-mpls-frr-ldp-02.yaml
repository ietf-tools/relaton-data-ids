abstract:
- content: "<p>LDP is widely deployed in MPLS networks to signal LSPs. Since LDP establishes
    LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is gated by IGP's re-convergence.
    Mechanisms such as IPFRR and RSVP-TE based FRR have been used to provide faster
    re-route for LDP LSPs. However these techniques have significant complexity and/or
    may not have full coverage. In this document we describe a method to perform fast
    re-route of LDP LSPs. The goal is to have recovery characteristics similar to
    the methods in [RSVP-TE-FRR] without depending on additional protocols but at
    the same time provide full coverage.</p>"
