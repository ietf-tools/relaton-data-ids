abstract:
- content: "<p>In some networked applications, such as peer-to-peer file sharing,
    the same resource (e.g., a file or a server process) is available at several potential
    resource providers. Resource consumers typically try to select providers so that
    application performance is improved, establishing an overlay topology of direct
    logical links in the process. However, lack of reliable information about the
    underlying network can lead to poor choices and suboptimal application performance.
    In addition, resulting application traffic is largely oblivious to technical,
    economical, and political constraints at the network level, causing problems for
    network operators. This document describes a protocol that facilitates the exchange
    of information between an overlay and the underlying network. Such information
    can be used at each layer to make decisions that are not detrimental to the other
    layer or, ideally, are beneficial to both.</p>"
