abstract:
- content: <p>The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit MAC address space in such
    a way that half of it was reserved for local use. Recently, the IEEE has been
    working on a new specification (IEEE 802c) which defines a new "optional Structured
    Local Address Plan" (SLAP) that specifies different assignment approaches in four
    specified regions of the local MAC address space. The IEEE is working on mechanisms
    to allocate addresses in the one of these quadrants (IEEE 802.1CQ). There is work
    also in the IETF working on specifying new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation
    to handle the local MAC address assignments. In this document, we complement this
    IETF work by defining a mechanism to allow choosing the SLAP quadrant to use in
    the allocation of the MAC address to the requesting terminal/client. This document
    proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6
    relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant to the server, so that the server
    allocates correspondingly the MAC address to the given client or relay.</p>
