abstract:
- content: "<p>These years, wireless technologies, including the application of 6LoWPAN
    protocol, are more and more been applied in industrial environment to improve
    productivity and safety of the plants. In spite of the fact that [RFC4944] has
    introduced the methods of transmitting IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks,
    industrial automation field, either process automation or factory automation,
    has its special characteristics and requirements. If 6LoWPAN is been used in industrial
    environment, some change SHOULD be made in the adaption layer. This document defines
    a Scheduling Header, to make the adaption layer meet the requirements of industrial
    scheduling for transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Additionally,
    this document also provides an application example of Scheduling Header.</p>"
