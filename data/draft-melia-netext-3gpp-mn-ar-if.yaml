abstract:
- content: "<p>This ID documents the interface between the Mobile Node and the Mobility
    Access Gateway in the context of 3GPP Evolved Packet Core networks. The main goal
    is to support the Netext working group in the discussions on the MN to AR interface
    showing how RFC 5213 has been deployed by other SDOs. This document has been inspired
    by considerations expressed in [I-D.gundavelli-netext-extensions-motivation].</p>"
