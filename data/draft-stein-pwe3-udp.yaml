abstract:
- content: <p>The PWE3 charter permits three PSN types, namely "IP (both versions),
    L2TP, or MPLS". The majority of drafts submitted to the working group have focused
    on MPLS PSNs, and lesser attention has been given to L2TPv3. Only the TDMoIP drafts
    have explicitly specified UDP/IP as PSN, and only they stipulate the use of UDP
    port numbers as PW labels. This draft discusses PWs based on UDP/IP, concentrating
    on three issues, namely 1) the advisability of using UDP port numbers as PW labels,
    2) which UDP port number to use, and 3) what label distribution protocol should
    be employed.</p>
