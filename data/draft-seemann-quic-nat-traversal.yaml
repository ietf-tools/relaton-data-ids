abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC is well-suited to various NAT traversal techniques. As it operates
    over UDP, and because the QUIC header was designed to be demultipexed from other
    protocols, STUN can be used on the same UDP socket, enabling ICE to be used with
    QUIC. Furthermore, QUICâ€™s path validation mechanism can be used to test the viability
    of an address candidate pair while at the same time creating the NAT bindings
    required for a direction connection, after which QUIC connection migration can
    be used to migrate the connection to a direct path.</p>"
