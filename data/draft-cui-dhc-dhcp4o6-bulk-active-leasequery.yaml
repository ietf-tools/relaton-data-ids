abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have the requirement
    for IPv4 configuration. DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] provides a mechanism for
    obtaining IPv4 configuration information dynamically in IPv6 networks. DHCPv4/DHCPv6
    Bulk Leasequery and Active Leasequery allow a client to get DHCP address binding
    information data in bulk transfer or in real-time via TCP. This document describes
    an extension of DHCPv6 Bulk and Active Leasequery that provides a mechanism to
    get DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 lease information.</p>"
