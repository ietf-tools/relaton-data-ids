abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange (HIP
    DEX), a variant of the Host Identity Protocol Version 2 (HIPv2). The HIP DEX protocol
    design aims at reducing the overhead of the employed cryptographic primitives
    by omitting public-key signatures and hash functions. The HIP DEX protocol is
    primarily designed for computation or memory- constrained sensor/actuator devices.
    Like HIPv2, it is expected to be used together with a suitable security protocol
    such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) for the protection of upper layer
    protocol data. Unlike HIPv2, HIP DEX does not support Perfect Forward Secrecy
    (PFS), and MUST only be used on devices where PFS is prohibitively expensive.
    In addition, HIP DEX can also be used as a keying mechanism for security primitives
    at the MAC layer, e.g., for IEEE 802.15.4 networks.</p>"
