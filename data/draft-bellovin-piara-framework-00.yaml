abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to sustain continuous growth of the Internet is affected
    both by the ability of the Internet routing system to scale, and by the availability
    of IP addresses that are unique within the Internet. We argue that scalable routing
    and efficient address space utilization should not be treated as two separate
    problems, but as two inter-related facets of a single problem - how to scale the
    Internet. Unfortunately, scalable routing and efficient address space utilization
    do not come for free: they sometimes require renumbering of existing hosts to
    new addresses or otherwise undersirable address allocations. We propose to use
    financial incentives rather than just the existing methods of persuasion and coercion
    to motivate IP address assignment that is efficient both with respect to its suitability
    for aggregation (via hierarchical routing), and with respect to the address space
    utilization. We argue that where tradeoffs must be made between conflicting goals,
    use of financial incentives will permit local decisions that take into account
    local differences, thus leading to better choices than could be made by any centralized
    administrative body.</p>"
