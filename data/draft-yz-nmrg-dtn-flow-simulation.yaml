abstract:
- content: "<p>Some important application scenarios of digital twin network, such
    as network new technology experiment, network configuration verification, network
    performance optimization, etc., all require the virtual traffic in the twin network
    to accurately simulate the real traffic in the physical network.The real traffic
    in the physical network is called the physical traffic, and the virtual traffic
    in the twin network is called the twin traffic. In order to realize the high-fidelity
    simulation of the physical traffic by the twin traffic, this paper proposes that
    the twin traffic and the physical traffic should satisfy three consistent characteristics,
    and an implementation method of twin flow is introduced.</p>"
