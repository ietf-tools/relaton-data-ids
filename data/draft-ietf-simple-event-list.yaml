    (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing to a homogeneous list
    of resources. Instead of sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the
    subscriber can subscribe to an entire list and then receive notifications when
    the state of any of the resources in the list changes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
