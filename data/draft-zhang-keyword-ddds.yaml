abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the use of the Domain Name System(DNS) for storage
    of Keyword to URI mapping. More specifically, how DNS can be used for identifying
    URIs associated with one Keyword. The method used to discover the mapping is the
    Dynamic Delegation Discovery System, which can be found in a series of documents
    specified in RFC 3401. It is very important to note that it is impossible to read
    and understand this document without reading the documents discussed in RFC 3401.</p>"
