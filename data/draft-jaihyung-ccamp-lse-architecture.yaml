abstract:
- content: "<p>A solution for GMPLS implementation over Ethernet based on label encoding
    method using 48bits of Ethernet address is proposed. Ethernet switches supporting
    this approach control L2-LSP using source &amp; destination MAC addresses. The
    format of GMPLS label encoding on Ethernet header is described. GMPLS bridge model
    and three implementation models over bridged core network are presented. The purpose
    of this draft is not to define new bridge architecture but to help understanding
    some aspects of this approach, and identify requirements for potential extension
    to current GMPLS protocols and bridge.</p>"
