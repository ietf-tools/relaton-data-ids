abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing and addressing are inexorably tied, and the scalability of
    the routing system is wholly dependent on the abstraction and allocation of the
    address space. The addressing architecture for the Internet was set forth in [RFC1518],
    [RFC4632], and [RFC4291]. These describe how address aggregation can be performed
    at the ISP and local level. Address allocation and assignment procedures by the
    Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have created large address blocks. This creates
    an opportunity for further aggregation above the ISP level without any change
    to existing allocations. This document discusses issues regarding address aggregation
    above the ISP level, for continents or regions, thereby providing additional address
    space aggregation and efficiency in the routing system. Small changes to address
    allocation policies can help to ensure futher aggregations and improvements in
    routing efficiency. Some of these concepts were discussed as part of the Routing
    and Addressing meetings [RFC1380] and extended further here. This document is
    not advocating geographical assignment below the continental level. That has been
    thoroughly discussed previously.</p>"
