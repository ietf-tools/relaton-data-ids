abstract:
- content: <p>At first glance the acronym "OAM" seems to be well known and well understood.
    Looking at it a bit more closely reveals a set of recurring problems that are
    revisited time and again. This document has one primary and a secondary goal.
    The primary goal is to find an understanding of OAM that is feasible for the MPLS
    Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)effort. The secondary goal is to make this understanding
    applicable in a wider scope</p>
