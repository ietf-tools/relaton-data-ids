abstract:
- content: "<p>The Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) is series of hardware
    and software innovations that enhance Armâ€™s support for Confidential Computing
    for large, compute-intensive workloads. Devices that implement CCA can produce
    attestation tokens as described in this memo, which are the basis for trustworthiness
    assessment of the Confidential Compute environment. This document specifies the
    CCA attestation token structure and semantics. The CCA attestation token is a
    profile of the Entity Attestation Token (EAT). This specification describes what
    claims are used in an attestation token generated by CCA compliant systems, how
    these claims get serialized to the wire, and how they are cryptographically protected.
    This informational document is published as an independent submission to improve
    interoperability with Arm's architecture. It is not a standard nor a product of
    the IETF.</p>"
