abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives a historical perspective about the design and deployment
    of multicast routing protocols. The document describes the technical challenges
    discovered from building these protocols. Even though multicast has enjoyed success
    of deployment in special use-cases, we discuss what were, and are, the obstacles
    for mass deployment across the Internet. Individuals who are working on new multicast
    related protocols will benefit by knowing why we aren't using certain older protocols
    today.</p>"
