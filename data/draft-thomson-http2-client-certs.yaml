abstract:
- content: "<p>Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require additional
    authentication to interact with. HTTP/1.1 servers rely on TLS renegotiation that
    is triggered by a request to a protected resource. HTTP/2 made this pattern impossible
    by forbidding the use of TLS renegotiation. While TLS 1.3 provides an alternate
    mechanism to obtain client certificates, this mechanism does not map well to usage
    in TLS 1.2. This document describes a how client authentication might be requested
    by a server as a result of receiving a request to a protected resource.</p>"
