abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the core behavior for Warp, a live media transport
    protocol over QUIC. Media is split into objects based on the underlying media
    encoding and transmitted independently over QUIC streams. QUIC streams are prioritized
    based on the delivery order, allowing less important objects to be starved or
    dropped during congestion.</p>"
