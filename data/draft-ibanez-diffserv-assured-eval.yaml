abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a simulation analysis of Assured Service, an end-to-end
    service based on the differentiated services enhancements for IP. Assured Service
    has been the subject of much discussion in the past year in the IETF, but solid
    information on its applicability to the entire Internet has been lacking. This
    report is aimed at providing a first step in this direction. Assured Service requires
    an active queue management algorithm with preferential packet drop. The RIO algorithm
    (an extension of the RED algorithm) has been the primary method suggested and
    is the one evaluated here. Our results show that Assured Service does not provide
    clearly defined and consistent rate guarantees; the advantage gained by connections
    using Assured Service is not a quantifiable one. Further work would be required
    to determine an appropriate use of the Assured Service. A pdf version of this
    document is available and recommended for the figures it contains.</p>"
