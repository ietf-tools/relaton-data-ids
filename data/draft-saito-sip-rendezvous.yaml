abstract:
- content: <p>Home servers are becoming more common and people expect to still access
    them even when they are outside their home. However, there are several requirements
    to realize remote access to the home such as name resolution, NAT/Firewall traversal,
    and authentication/ authorization. This document describes what technologies can
    be used to solve these issues and analyzes the utility of SIP as a rendezvous
    mechanism for this use case.Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
