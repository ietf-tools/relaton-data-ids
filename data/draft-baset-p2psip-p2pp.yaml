abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Peer-to-Peer Protocol (P2PP), an application-layer
    binary protocol, for creating and maintaining an overlay of participant nodes.
    The overlay can be created using various structured and unstructured peer-to-peer
    protocols such as Bamboo, Chord, Pastry, Kademlia, Gnutella, and Gia. P2PP uses
    a secure transport, supports an application API, has mechanisms for NAT and firewall
    traversal, exchanging node capabilities, and diagnostic information. P2PP is designed
    to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be used
    for other applications as well.</p>"
