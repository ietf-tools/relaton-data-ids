abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes secure network management in Segment Routing
    version six (SRv6) network. It proposes a framework empowered with Intent-Based
    Networking (IBN). The Intent-based Network Management (IBNM) in this document
    deals with a closed-loop network control, network policy translation, and network
    management audit. To support these three features, it specifies an architectural
    framework with system components and interfaces. Also, this framework can support
    the use cases in SRv6 network.</p>"
