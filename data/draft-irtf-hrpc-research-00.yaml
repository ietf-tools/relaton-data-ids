abstract:
- content: "<p>The evergrowing interconnectedness of Internet and society increases
    the impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals. Because of this, the design
    and development of the architecture of the Internet also has a growing impact
    on society. This has led to an broad recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR]
    [ICESCR] have a role in the development and management of the Internet [HRC2012]
    [UNGA2013] [NETmundial]. It has also been argued that the Internet should be strengthened
    as a human rights enabling environment [Brown]. This document provides a proposal
    for a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human rights and Internet protocols,
    an overview of the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
    a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and technical
    concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights considerations, similar
    to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973]. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes. This document is a product of the Internet Research Task
    Force (IRTF). The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-related research and
    development activities. This documents aims to be a consensus document of the
    Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group of the Internet Research Task
    Force (IRTF). Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org // https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/hrpc</p>"
