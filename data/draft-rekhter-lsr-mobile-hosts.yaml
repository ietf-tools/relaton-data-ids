abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an approach to transparent mobile internetworking,
    meaning that unchanged hosts can move among networks in a fashion transparent
    to protocols above IP, while at the same time providing steady state optimal routing
    between either a pair of moving hosts or between a moving host and a stationary
    host. The approach rests upon the existence of a limited set of entities, called
    Base Access Stations (BAS) and Mobile Routers (MR) that coordinate forwarding
    among mobile hosts (MH).</p>"
