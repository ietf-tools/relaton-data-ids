- content: "<p>Hiding security vulnerabilities in algorithms, software, and/or hardware
    decreases the likelihood they will be repaired and increases the likelihood that
    they can and will be exploited by evil-doers. Discouraging or outlawing discussion
    of weaknesses and vulnerabilities is extremely dangerous and deleterious to the
    security of computer systems, the network, and its citizens.</p>"
