abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed
    from layered service networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency
    to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers through
    a process called inter-layer traffic engineering. PCE is a candidate solution
    for such requirements.</p>"
