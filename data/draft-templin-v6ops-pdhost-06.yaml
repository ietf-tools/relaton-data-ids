abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then
    use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document
    considers both this traditional case, and the case when the "requesting router"
    is actually a simple host which receives a delegated prefix that it can use for
    its own internal multi- addressing purposes. This latter method can be employed
    in a wide variety of use cases to allow ample address availability without impacting
    link performance.</p>
