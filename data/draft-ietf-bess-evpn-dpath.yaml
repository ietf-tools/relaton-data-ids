abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Domain PATH (D-PATH) attribute is defined for Inter-Subnet
    Forwarding (ISF) BGP Sub-Address Families that advertise IP prefixes. When used
    along with EVPN IP Prefix routes or IP-VPN routes, it identifies the domain(s)
    through which the routes have passed and that information can be used by the receiver
    BGP speakers to detect routing loops or influence the BGP best path selection.
    This document extends the use of D-PATH so that it can also be used along with
    other EVPN route types.</p>"
