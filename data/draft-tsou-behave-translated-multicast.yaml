abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition scenarios,
    where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one IP version, but the
    host and Network B support a different IP version. Suppose that the host wishes
    to access a multicast group which is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document
    specifies a stateful translation mechanism whereby the host can obtain its desired
    access using the native multicast capabilities of Network A.</p>"
