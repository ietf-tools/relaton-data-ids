abstract:
- content: "<p>In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have
    provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated several types
    of route leaks. In this document, we first examine which of those route-leak types
    are detected and mitigated by the existing origin validation (OV) [RFC 6811] and
    BGPSEC path validation [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol]. Where the current OV and
    BGPSEC protocols don't offer a solution, this document suggests an enhancement
    that would extend the route-leak detection and mitigation capability of BGPSEC.
    The solution can be implemented in BGP without necessarily tying it to BGPSEC.
    Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC is one way of implementing it in a secure
    way. We do not claim to have provided a solution for all possible types of route
    leaks, but the solution covers several, especially considering some significant
    route-leak attacks or occurrences that have been observed in recent years. The
    document also includes a stopgap method for detection and mitigation of route
    leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation) is not yet deployed but only
    origin validation is deployed.</p>"
