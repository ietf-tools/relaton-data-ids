abstract:
- content: "<p>The motivation for this memo stems from a need not to inundate the
    mailboxes of recipients with attachments, when all they need is a notification
    with the details of the attachment and the list of recipients that the attachment
    was sent to. Also, the recipients of the attachment would in their email copy
    get the details of list of notified recipients. A use case would be where Joe
    sends an email with an attachment to Bill, and Bill in turn adds some comments
    to the body of the message, and has to send it to Bob and Joe with the attachment,
    In this case, Joe ends up having two emails with the same attachment. This memo
    provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the [RFC 2822] ('Internet
    Message Format') specification can convey extra information. It specifies a new
    set of 'Attachment-Notification' headers, optional and valid for any [RFC 2822]
    entity ('message' or 'body part'). This document is intended as an extension to
    [RFC 2822]. As such, the reader is assumed to be familiar with [RFC 2822] and
    [RFC 1521]. The information presented herein supplements but does not replace
    that found in those documents.</p>"
