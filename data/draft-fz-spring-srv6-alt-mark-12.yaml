abstract:
- content: "<p>The Alternate Marking Method is a passive performance measurement method
    based on marking consecutive batches of packets, which can be used to measure
    packet loss, latency, and jitter of live traffic. This method requires a packet
    marking method so that packet flows can be distinguished and identified. A mechanism
    to carry suitable packet marking in the Hop-by-Hop Header and the Destination
    Options Header of an IPv6 packet is described in RFC 9343 and is also applicable
    to Segment Routing for IPv6 (SRv6). This document describes an alternative experimental
    approach that uses a new TLV in the Segment Routing Header (SRH) of an SRv6 packet.
    This approach has been implemented and has potential scaling and simplification
    benefits over the technique described in RFC 9343. The experiment is to determine
    whether those benefits are significant and attractive to the community: if they
    are, the work may be brought back for IETF consideration. This protocol extension
    has been developed outside the IETF as an alternative to the IETFâ€™s standards
    track specification RFC 9343 and it does not have IETF consensus. It is published
    here to guide experimental implementation, ensure interoperability among implementations
    to better determine the value of this approach.</p>"
