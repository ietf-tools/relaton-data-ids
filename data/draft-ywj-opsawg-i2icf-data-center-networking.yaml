abstract:
- content: "<p>In-network computing has gained a lot of attention and been widely
    investigated as a research area in the past few years, due to the exposure of
    data plane programmability to application developers and network operators. After
    several years of trials and research, some of in-network computing capabilities,
    or to say In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) have been proved to be effective
    and very beneficial for networked systems and applications, like machine learning
    and data analysis, and these capabilities have been gradually commercialized.
    However, there still lacks a general framework and standardized interfaces to
    register, configure, manage and monitor these ICFs. This document focuses on the
    applicability of ICFs in a limited domain in [RFC8799], e.g., data center networks,
    and describes a framework for orchastrating, managing, and monitoring these ICFs.</p>"
