abstract:
- content: "<p>When using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
    (LSP) on a ring topology, it is needed to minimize the labels for protection purpose
    and minimize the configuration effort. Though MPLS Fast Re-Route [MPLS-FRR] can
    achieve automatic LSP service protection, it is not optimized as many labels are
    used to create lots of detour LSPs. This document describes a MPLS ring mechanism
    and some extensions on signaling protocol to facilitate the establishment of Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) using Label Distribution Protocol [LDP] or RSVP-TE protocol
    [RSVP-TE] to achieve automated link and node protection.</p>"
