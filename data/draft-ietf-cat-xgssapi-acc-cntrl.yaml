abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS- API),
    as defined in RFC-1508, provides security services to callers in a generic fashion,
    supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing
    source-level portability of applications to different environments. It defines
    GSS-API services and primitives at a level independent of underlying mechanism
    and programming language environment. The GSSAPI allows a caller application to
    authenticate a principal identity associated with a peer application, to delegate
    rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity
    on a per-message basis. The primitives of the GSS-API do not currently allow support
    of security attributes other than a single identity and do not allow fine control
    of delegation. The additional primitives described in this document provide support
    for: * the exchange of a variety of security attributes, and the construction
    of authorization functions using these attributes, including delegated ones, (attribute
    handling support functions), * fine control over delegation by allowing specification
    of the delegation method, the acceptor(s) of a security context, their type and
    the restrictions that may apply (acceptor control and support functions).</p>"
