- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism by which the set of addresses bound
    to an application-level Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) connection
    [RFC4340] can change over that connection's lifetime. The essential abstraction
    is the Generalized Connection, which combines multiple distinct transport-level
    DCCP connections into a single application-level entity.</p>"
