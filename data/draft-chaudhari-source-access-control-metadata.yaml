abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides an alternative to the MI.SourceMetadata
    objects defined in RFC8006, providing greatly extended capabilities with regards
    to defining multiple sources, load balancing, and failover rules across those
    sources, as well as a mechanism for a content delivery network (CDN) to monitor
    source health and pull unhealthy sources out of rotation. Additionally, new methods
    are defined for authentication access to an upstream source/origin.</p>"
