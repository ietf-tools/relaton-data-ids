abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to Multipath TCP (MPTCP) that
    is meant to assess whether a path used to establish a given subflow is MPTCP-friendly,
    i.e., intermediate nodes involved in that path do not alter nor strip MPTCP options,
    which would prevent the establishment of MPTCP communications along that path.
    A new flag bit, called Probe Flag (P-flag) is defined for this purpose. This document
    updates RFC6824.</p>"
