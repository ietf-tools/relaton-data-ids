abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a series of extensions for OSPF[1] and MOSPF[2]
    that can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) routing in conjunction with
    a resource reservation protocol such as RSVP[4] or other mechanisms that can notify
    routing of the QoS needs of a data flow. Advertisements indicating the resources
    available and the resources used are advertised to the OSPF routing domain and
    paths are computed based on topology information, link resource information, and
    the resource requirements of a particular data flow.</p>"
