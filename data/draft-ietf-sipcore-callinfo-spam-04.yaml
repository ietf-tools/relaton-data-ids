abstract:
- content: "<p>Called parties often wish to decide whether to accept, reject or redirect
    calls based on the likely nature of the call. For example, they may want to reject
    unwanted telemarketing or fraudulent calls, but accept emergency alerts from numbers
    not in their address book. This document describes SIP Call-Info parameters and
    a feature tag that allow originating, intermediate and terminating SIP entities
    to label calls as to their type, confidence and references to additional information.</p>"
