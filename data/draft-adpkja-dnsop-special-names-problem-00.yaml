abstract:
- content: "<p>The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the Domain
    Name System (DNS). However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally different
    from the DNS, but which have syntactically- similar namespaces. When an end-user
    triggers resolution of a name on a system which supports multiple, different protocols
    for name resolution, it is desirable that the protocol to be used is unambiguous,
    and that requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently addressed using
    another. [RFC6761] introduced a framework by which, under certain circumstances,
    a particular domain name could be acknowledged as being special. This framework
    has been used to make top-level domain reservations, that is, particular top-level
    domains that should not be used within the DNS to accommodate parallel use of
    non-DNS name resolution protocols by end-users and avoid the possibility of namespace
    collisions. Various challenges have become apparent with this application of the
    guidance provided in [RFC6761]. This document aims to document those challenges
    in the form of a problem statement, to facilitate further discussion of potential
    solutions.</p>"
