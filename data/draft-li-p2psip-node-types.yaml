abstract:
- content: '<p>This document is an attempt to classify different types of node in
    peer-to-peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP). Four possible types of nodes
    in P2PSIP are discussed based on two characters: whether it offers overlay-routing
    services and whether it offers storage functions. The behaviors of each type of
    nodes and their possible necessities are analyzed. This document is dedicated
    to be a reference for clarifying some controversial terms in P2PSIP working group,
    such as "client", "low-function peer", etc.</p>'
