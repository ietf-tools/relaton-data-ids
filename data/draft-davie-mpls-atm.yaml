abstract:
- content: "<p>A Multi Protocol Label Switching architecture is described in [1].
    Label Switching enables the use of ATM Switches as Label Switching Routers. The
    ATM Switches run network layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.),
    and their data forwarding is based on the results of these routing algorithms.
    No ATM-specific routing or addressing is needed. This document describes how the
    label switching architecture is applied to ATM switches.</p>"
