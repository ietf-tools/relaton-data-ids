abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flow Specification (Flowspec) provides a mechanism to distribute
    traffic flow specifications and the forwarding actions to be performed to the
    specific traffic flows. A set of Flowspec components are defined to specify the
    matching criteria that can be applied to the packet, and a set of BGP extended
    communities are defined to encode the actions a routing system can take on a packet
    which matches the flow specification. An IETF Network Slice enables connectivity
    between a set of Service Demarcation Points (SDPs) with specific Service Level
    Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay
    network. To meet the connectivity and performance requirement of specific network
    slice services, network slice service traffic needs to be mapped to an Network
    Resource Partition (NRP). The edge nodes of the NRP needs to identify the traffic
    flows which belong to a network slice and steer the matched traffic to the corresponding
    NRP or a specific path within the corresponding NRP. BGP Flowspec can be used
    to distribute the matching criteria and the forwarding actions to be preformed
    on specific network slice services. The existing Flowspec components can be used
    for the matching of specific network slice services flows at the edge of an NRP.
    While new traffic action needs to be defined for the steering of network slice
    service flows into an NRP. This document defines the extensions to BGP Flowspec
    for IETF network slice traffic steering (NS-TS).</p>"
