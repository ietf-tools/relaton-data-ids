abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routing protocol,
    called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). It is designed for a hierarchical
    IP network and leverages the hierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting.
    It is originally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some of its
    functions could be applied to commercial networks as well.</p>"
