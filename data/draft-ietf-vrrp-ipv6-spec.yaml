abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for
    IPv6. It is version three (3) of the protocol. It is based on the original version
    of VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC2338. VRRP specifies an election
    protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of
    the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated
    with a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards packets sent to these
    IP addresses. The election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding
    responsibility should the Master become unavailable. The advantage gained from
    using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switch over to back up routers than can be obtained
    with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [ND] mechanisms.</p>"
