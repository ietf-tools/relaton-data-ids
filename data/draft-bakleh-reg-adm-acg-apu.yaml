abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides guidelines for zone administrators(including
    but not limited to registry operators and registrars), and information for all
    domain names holders, on the administration of those domain names which contain
    characters drawn from Arabic Characters Group of Languages. Other language groups
    are encouraged to develop their own guidelines as needed, based on these guidelines
    if that is helpful. The document gives basic guidelines for IDN registrars (as
    it is the case for IETF Document that talks about Japanese, Chinese and Korean
    domain name registration "RFC 3490"). The document provides also information for
    owners of IDN that contains Arabic characters on name reservation process. The
    document does not cover Arabic gTLD or ccTLD problems. Comments on this document
    can be sent to the authors at arabic-idn-admin@aietf.org.</p>
