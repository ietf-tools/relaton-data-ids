abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing HTTP authentication mechanisms are probeable in the sense
    that it is possible for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an origin serves
    resources that require authentication. It is possible for an origin to hide the
    fact that it requires authentication by not generating Unauthorized status codes,
    however that only works with non-cryptographic authentication schemes: cryptographic
    schemes (such as signatures or message authentication codes) require a fresh nonce
    to be signed, and there is no existing way for the origin to share such a nonce
    without exposing the fact that it serves resources that require authentication.
    This document proposes a new non-probeable cryptographic authentication scheme.</p>"
