abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE architecture is well-defined and may be used to compute the
    optimal path for LSPS across domains in MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks. The Hierarchical
    Path Computation Element (H-PCE) [RFC6805] was developed to provide an optimal
    path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The procedure and mechanism
    for populating the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) with domain topology and
    link information used in H-PCE-based path computations is open to interpretation.
    This informational document describes how topology dissemination mechanisms may
    be used to provide TE information between Parent and Child PCEs (within the H-PCE
    context). In particular, it describes how BGP-LS might be used to provide inter-
    domain connectivity. This document is not intended to define new extensions, it
    demonstrates how existing procedures and mechanisms may be used.</p>"
