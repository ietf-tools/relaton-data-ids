abstract:
- content: "<p>With LCAS and VCAT, the transport layer is capable of not only providing
    right-sized data pipes, but also elastic pipes. Fluid transport pipes spur services
    like frame-relay transport (CIR, EIR) and intelligent COS-aware protection. The
    popular protocol used to convey control information in SONET networks is GMPLS.
    There are two aspects of control mechanisms for a connection: call-control and
    connection-control. Call-control is used to establish a signaling association
    between two end-points, whereas connection-control is used to setup and modify
    the attributes (e.g., bandwidth) of an transport connection. This draft deals
    with signaling requirements for connection-control of elastic pipes.</p>"
