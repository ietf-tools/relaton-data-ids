abstract:
- content: <p>The current Email infrastructure has the property that any host sending
    mail to the mail system can identify itself as any user name it wants. Furthermore,
    the current Email framework neither authenticates the sender nor traces the source
    of the mail, so even find a spam, the method is just to reject the mail or insert
    the mail source into "blacklist", and both of these methods can!_t deracinate
    the generation of spam. This document design a Email source address authentication
    based on true IPv6 address access to identify and authenticate the mail source
    address, to trace the mail sender effectively, and to deracinate the generation
    of spam.</p>
