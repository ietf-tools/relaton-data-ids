abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7001] describes a header field called Authentication-Results for
    use with electronic mail messages to indicate the results of message authentication
    efforts. Any receiver-side software, such as mail filters or Mail User Agents
    (MUAs), can use this header field to relay that information in a convenient and
    meaningful way to users, or make sorting and filtering decisions. One portion
    of the definition in that document limits the types of authentication properties
    about a message to a small, fixed set. This document updates the specification
    to allow new property types to be declared and used.</p>"
