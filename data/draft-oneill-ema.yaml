abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft outlines a system for domain-based routing and addressing
    support in handling edge mobility such as encountered in cellular systems and
    Internet roaming. The system includes novel features for IP session, address and
    localised host redirect route management which promise significant scaling benefits
    compared to other micro-mobility solutions. In addition, the system is closely
    integrated with the Mobile IP architecture for both signalling and data forwarding,
    so that a rich set of capabilities and Internet Services are possible, and incremental
    deployment of EMA is possible within and between AS's. The draft also suggests
    a specific protocol based on TORA for the implementation of such an architecture.
    It advocates the creation of a specific IETF working group to address an overall
    architecture for edge mobility routing, specific extensions to existing routing
    protocols to accomplish that architecture, and extensions to existing Internet
    technologies such as Mobile IP to support this architecture.</p>"
