abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire of
    differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the traffic
    steering service under limited network resources and maximize their benefits at
    the same time. The traditional method for traffic steering depends on static configuration
    which is time consuming and error-prone. As development of SDN, the controller
    is introduced for traffic steering with the global view of network topology and
    route information. This document describes typical use cases for traffic steering
    services and proposes the traffic steering solution based on BGP controller.</p>"
