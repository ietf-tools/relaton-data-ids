abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a method to perceive and process the running status
    of computing resources by introducing a logical Middle Ware facility, aiming to
    avoid directly reflecting continuous and dynamic computing resource status in
    the network domain, match service requirements and instance conditions, and ultimately
    achieve computing aware traffic engineering and be applicable to various possible
    scheduling strategies.</p>"
