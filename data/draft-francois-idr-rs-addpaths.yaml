abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP speakers at Internet Exchange Points typically exchange routes
    with a large number of peers. To reduce the burden of maintaining many sessions,
    IXPs implement and administrate BGP route servers. Route servers announce to their
    clients the paths of multiple peers by using a single eBGP session. Route servers,
    however, are restricted to propagating a single path per NLRI per eBGP session.
    This constraint affects the diversity of paths received by clients. To overcome
    this limitation, we propose the extension of ADD-PATH to eBGP peers. ADD-PATH
    allows a BGP speaker to send multiple paths for the same NLRI, typically through
    different nexthops, over a single session with a peer. By supporting ADD-PATH,
    a route server hence allows a client to potentially select among all the available
    paths for that NLRI, instead of the one arbitrarily chosen by the Route Server.</p>"
