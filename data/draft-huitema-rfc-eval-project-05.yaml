abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the author's effort to understand the delays
    involved in publishing an idea in the IETF, from the first individual draft to
    the publication of the RFC. We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in
    2018, looking for history and delays. We also use two randomly chosen sets of
    RFC published in 2008 and 1998 for comparing delays seen in 2018 to those observed
    10 or 20 years ago. The average RFC in the 2018 sample was produced in 3 years
    and 4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working group,
    3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC production.
    The main variation in RFC production delays comes from the AUTH-48 phase. We also
    measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and
    compare citation counts with what we know about deployment. We show that citation
    counts indicate academic interest, but correlate only loosely with deployment
    or usage of the specifications. Counting web references could complement that.
    The RFCs selected for this survey were chosen at random and represent a small
    sample of all RFCs produced, and only approximately 10% of the RFCs produced in
    each of 1998, 2008, and 2018. It is possible that different samples would produce
    different results. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn from the observations made
    in this document represent the author's opinions and do not have consensus of
    the IETF.</p>"
