abstract:
- content: <p>The [6rd] mechanism permit IPv6 "rapid deployment" across IPv4 infrastructures
    of Internet Service Providers, but only in cases where customer-premise equipments
    can be upgraded to support it. 6rd+ extends this IPv6 rapid deployment capability
    to hosts behind customer-premise equipments that cannot be upgraded (provided
    these hosts can be upgraded themselves to support 6rd+). Like [6rd], 6rd+ provides
    native IPv6 addresses, so that quality of service can be guaranteed by Internet
    Service Providers; it operates statelessly, which ensures simplicity and scalability;
    and it transmits encapsulated IPv6 packets along optimized paths, which contributes
    to efficiency and acceptability.</p>
