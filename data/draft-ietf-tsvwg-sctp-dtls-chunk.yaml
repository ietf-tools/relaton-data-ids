abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for adding Cryptographic protection
    to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The SCTP DTLS chunk defined
    in this document is intended to enable communications privacy for applications
    that use SCTP as their transport protocol and allows applications to communicate
    in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message
    forgery. Applications using SCTP DTLS chunk can use all transport features provided
    by SCTP and its extensions but with some limitations.</p>"
