abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that the identities to
    be used to authenticate are configured on the client device. Achieving this requires
    software on that device (either built into the operating system or a standalone
    utility) that will interact with the user, and manage the user's identities and
    credential-to-service mappings. Anyone designing that software will face the same
    set of challenges. This document aims to document these challenges with the aim
    of producing well-thought out UIs with some degree of consistency.</p>"
