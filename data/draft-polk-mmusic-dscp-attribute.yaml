abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model currently
    has no mechanism for dynamic configuration of the Differentiated Services Codepoints
    (DSCP) for the media streams endpoints establish. This document creates such a
    mechanism within SDP, as granular as at the media stream level where more than
    one stream can be in an offer/answer exchange, to set a particular DSCP for the
    desired Per Hop Behavior (PHB) of a media stream. This same mechanism can change
    a DSCP of an existing stream based on dynamic network conditions.</p>"
