abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and
    potential new networking technologies as components to provide an Enhanced Virtual
    Private Networks (VPN+) service. The purpose is to enable VPNs to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with
    5G services. Typically, VPN+ can be used to form the underpinning of network slicing,
    but will also be of use in its own right.</p>"
