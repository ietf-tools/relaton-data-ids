abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a schema, object classes and attributes, for
    Printers and Print Services, for use with directories that support Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510). This document is based on the Printer attributes
    listed in Appendix E of Internet Printing Protocol/1.1 (RFC 2911). Additional
    Printer attributes are based on definitions in the Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805),
    IEEE-ISTO PWG Command Set for IEEE 1284 Device ID (PWG 5107.2), IEEE-ISTO PWG
    IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (PWG 5100.13), and IEEE-ISTO PWG IPP Everywhere
    (PWG 5100.14). This document is an individual submission to the IETF by the Internet
    Printing Protocol Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group, as part
    of their PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14) project for secure mobile printing with
    vendor-neutral Client software. This document obsoletes RFC 3712.</p>"
