abstract:
- content: "<p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) is a cryptographically
    verifiable extension of the LEI standard, designed to automate trust in organizational
    identity. Governed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the
    vLEI system uses Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs), Self-Addressing Identifiers
    (SAIDs), and Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) to issue and verify credentials
    for legal entities and their authorized representatives. It enables secure, machine-readable
    identity assertions across financial, regulatory, and supply chain ecosystems,
    supporting role-based delegation and interoperability with decentralized trust
    frameworks. This specification defines vLEI for verifiable gateway operator identities
    and cryptographically links the gateway operator identity to the gateway identity.
    Thus SATP core lock assertions are cryptographically linked to gateway operator
    identities.</p>"
