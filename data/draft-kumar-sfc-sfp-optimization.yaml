abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables services to be delivered by
    selective traffic steering through an ordered set of service functions. Once classified
    into an SFC, the traffic for a given flow is steered through all the service functions
    of the SFC for the life of the traffic flow even though this is often not necessary.
    Steering traffic to service functions only while required and not otherwise, leads
    to optimal SFCs with improved latencies, reduced resource consumption and better
    user experience. This document describes the rationale, techniques and necessary
    protocol extensions to achieve such optimization.</p>"
