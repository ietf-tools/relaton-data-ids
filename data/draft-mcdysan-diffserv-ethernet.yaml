abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the deliver of IETF Differentiated Services
    over MANs or WANs built from interconnected IEEE 802.3 MAC Bridges (switches).
    It describes the overlay model which uses Ethernet over MPLS to provide Diffserv
    support, and the mapping model which maps Diffserv PHBs to Ethernet user priorities
    and uses the inherent capabilities of relevant IEEE 802 technologies and, in particular,
    [802.1D-1998] queuing features and [802.1Q-1998] VLAN tags, to support Diffserv.</p>"
