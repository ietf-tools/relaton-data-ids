abstract:
- content: "<p>Steering traffic for computing-related services considering computing
    resources and circumstances is discussed in CATS WG. Correspondingly, publishing
    services and updating computing conditions turns out to be a significant issue.
    It SHOULD be realized that multiple same common metrics are required from both
    network and service instances in order to evaluate overall performance and further
    achieve and fulfill appropriate traffic steering and scheduling. Therefore, an
    implementation for distributed CATS with generic metrics delivery and distribution
    based on BGP is proposed and discussed in this draft.</p>"
