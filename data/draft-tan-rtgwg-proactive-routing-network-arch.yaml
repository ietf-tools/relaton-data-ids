abstract:
- content: "<p>Proactive Routing Network (PRN), which runs on conventional network,
    is user and service experience oriented; and provides a set of E2E Pipes for the
    two End Systems of communication named Requester and Source. The E2E Pipe have
    deterministic path learned from the trace of the Request sent by Requester, and
    is QOS guaranteed by resource reservation. Addressing issue is solved by recording
    the labeled interfaces or Local Pipes taken along with the Request to the Source.
    Each Pipe is protocol oblivious, application aware, elastic and visible for users
    and operators. PRN is not a new network, rather, it is a service attached to the
    conventional network. Therefore it does not affect the operation business of the
    conventional networks, so it is very conducive to the deployment and smooth evolution.
    PRN is valuable for users who want deterministic network service, and is helpful
    for operators to simplify the service management and easy for fault location and
    billing, and is helpful for vendors to solve the addressing issue which is one
    of the biggest challenges of increasing device throughput at a reasonable cost.</p>"
