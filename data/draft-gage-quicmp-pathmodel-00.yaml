abstract:
- content: "<p>The path model used in the current MPQUIC draft binds a connection
    identifier to a path. In fact, the sequence number of a connection identifier
    is used as an implicit path identifier. This has a number of consequences that
    may cause MPQUIC to diverge from the principles of RFC9000. One of these consequences,
    for example, is to associate each connection with a different application data
    packet number space rather than maintaining a single application data packet number
    space across all connections as defined in RFC9000. This document proposes a different
    path model for Multipath QUIC using explicit path identifiers, enabling a multipath
    management framework that retains the principles and operations of RFC9000.</p>"
