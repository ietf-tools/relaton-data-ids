abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes to extend the Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
    Quality of Service (QoS) model to support energy-efficient networking. As a first
    draft, it discusses how such extensions could be done, bringing first examples
    of energy-efficiency metrics that could be applied to mark traffic, and providing
    routing applicability examples by interpreting existing or experimental DSCP codepoints
    to represent not only traditional QoS parameters (e.g., latency, jitter), but
    also application-level energy sensitivity. By incorporating energy metrics into
    traffic classification, network devices and orchestrators can make routing and
    resource allocation decisions that optimize both service performance and energy
    consumption.</p>"
