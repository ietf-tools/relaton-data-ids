abstract:
- content: "<p>Several recent IETF privacy protocols require clients to acquire bootstrap
    information for a service in a way that guarantees both authenticity and consistency,
    e.g., encrypting to the same key as many other users. This specification defines
    a procedure for transferring arbitrary HTTP resources in a manner that provides
    these guarantees. The procedure relies on access to a semi-trusted HTTP proxy,
    under the same security assumptions as an Oblivious HTTP Relay.</p>"
