abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the Open Password Automation Recipe (OPAR)
    Protocol, a suggested format for providing instructions to password managers programmatically
    that defines the valid construction of a password. With password managers becoming
    integrated into browsers, websites should be able to describe the elements of
    an acceptable password programmatically so password management plugins can read
    and automatically generate the best option. Without this, manual intervention
    by the user is required when the password is too long, contains invalid characters,
    or does not meet complexity requirements.</p>"
