abstract:
- content: "<p>Since IDN Standards [RFC3490-3492] were published, some of gTLDs and
    ccTLDs began IDN registration and resolution service. Furthermore, many major
    Web browsers became IDN aware. IDNs seem to be popularized soon. Meanwhile, IDN
    introduces huge number of characters which can represent domain name, so it increases
    human misreading of domain name with similar looking characters. This issue was
    discussed deeply during IDN standardization and service development, and as a
    result, JET Guideline [RFC3743] and ICANN IDN Guideline [ICANN-IDN] was published.
    Even if TLD registries comply such guidelines, bad-faith guys may use IDNs to
    deceive human eyes with similar looking characters. To protect users from such
    deceiver, implementation guideline for how to handle IDNs at the User Interface
    level is important. This document is intended to be such guideline for application
    implementers.</p>"
