abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP uses a numbering space of 64 bits, to replace the 32 bit space
    used in the current IP. This document specifies an administrative allocation plan
    wherein the numbering space is efficiently divided into continents, clusters and
    countries. Space is reserved for end-point identifier, metropolitan and provider
    assignment schemes to exist in parallel. Special consideration is given to the
    interaction of these schemes with the inverse function of the domain name service.</p>"
