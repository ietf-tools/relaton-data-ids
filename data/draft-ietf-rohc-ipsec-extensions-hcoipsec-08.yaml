abstract:
- content: "<p>Integrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC) with IPsec (ROHCoIPsec)
    offers the combined benefits of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization.
    However, in order to integrate ROHC with IPsec, extensions to the Security Policy
    Database (SPD) and Security Association Database (SAD) are required. This document
    describes the IPsec extensions required to support ROHCoIPsec. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
