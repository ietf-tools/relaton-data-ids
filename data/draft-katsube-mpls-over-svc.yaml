abstract:
- content: "<p>Enabling interconnection of ATM Label Switching Routers (ATM-LSRs)
    over standard ATM switch networks is desirable in order to introduce MPLS technology
    into emerging ATM-LAN/WAN platform. This draft describes how ATM-LSRs may interoperate
    with other ATM-LSRs over ATM UNI SVC services. The two aspects of the problem
    that we address are ATM address (of target ATM-LSR) resolution and SVC to label
    binding.</p>"
