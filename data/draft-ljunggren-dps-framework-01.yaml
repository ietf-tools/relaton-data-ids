abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework to assist writers of DNSSEC Signing
    Policy and Practice Statements such as Regulatory Authorities and Registry Managers
    on both the TLD and secondary level, who is operating a DNS zone with Security
    Extensions (DNSSEC) implemented. In particular, the framework provides a comprehensive
    list of topics that potentially (at the writer's discretion) needs to be covered
    in a DNSSEC Signing Policy definition and Practice Statement.</p>"
