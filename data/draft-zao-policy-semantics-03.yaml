abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft discusses three possible forms of interaction among
    IPsec Policies referred to as Policy Resolution, Policy Correlation and Policy
    Reconciliation. It also proposes two operators, Policy Composition (*) and Policy
    Difference (-), to deduce the results of policy interactions. The definitions
    of these operators establish an algebraic semantics of IPsec Policies based on
    partially ordered set theory. This formal semantics can be used to ensure consistency
    of IPsec Policy processing.</p>"
