abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for advancing
    a routing protocol from Draft Standard to full Standard have been satisfied by
    Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4). This report satisfies the requirement
    for 'the second report', as described in Section 6.0 of RFC 1264. In order to
    fulfill the requirement, this report augments RFC 1773 and describes additional
    knowledge and understanding gained in the time between when the protocol was made
    a Draft Standard and when it was submitted for Standard.</p>"
