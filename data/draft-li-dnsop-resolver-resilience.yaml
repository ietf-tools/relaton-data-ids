abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an attack vector, exemplified by the "DNSBomb"
    attack, that leverages the emergent behavior of several widely- implemented DNS
    resolver mechanisms. By combining query timeouts, query aggregation, and response
    timing, an attacker can turn a set of resolvers into powerful amplifiers for a
    Pulsing Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack. This attack is difficult to detect due
    to its low average traffic rate but can be highly effective at overwhelming a
    target's resources. This document provides operational guidance and a set of best
    practices for DNS resolver implementers and operators to mitigate this threat.
    The goal is to harden the DNS ecosystem by reducing the potential for resolvers
    to be used in such a coordinated fashion, thereby improving the operational resilience
    of the DNS.</p>
