abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides heuristic procedures that translate managed
    object specifications from ISO/CCITT Guidelines for Definition of Managed Object
    (GDMO) templates to Internet MIB macros. Currently, some market segments demand
    SNMP for customer network management, while others require the ISO/CCITT Common
    Management Information Protocol (CMIP). The approach defined in this document
    accommodates both, protecting investment already made in management information
    specifications and minimizing cost to implement a second protocol where the market
    requires. This translation is designed to: lose as little functionality as possible
    in translation; minimize need for human involvement during translation; minimize
    the cost of dual protocol and proxy-based implementations; and support generic
    network models which span many computer platforms and network elements. This document
    is intended to encourage standardization of such an approach and promote consistent
    usage of MIB definitions, independent of protocol.</p>"
