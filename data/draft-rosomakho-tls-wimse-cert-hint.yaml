abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a TLS extension that allows clients to indicate
    one or more workload identifier scopes in the ClientHello message. Each scope
    consists of a URI scheme and trust domain component, representing the administrative
    domain and identifier namespace in which the client operates. These identifier
    scopes serve as hints to enable the server to determine whether client authentication
    is required and which policies or trust anchors should apply. This mechanism improves
    efficiency in mutual TLS deployments while minimising the exposure of sensitive
    identifier information. To protect confidentiality, this extension can be used
    in conjunction with Encrypted Client Hello (ECH).</p>"
