abstract:
- content: <p>The term "measured component" refers to an object within the attester's
    target environment whose state can be inspected and digested. A digest is typically
    computed through a cryptographic hash function. Examples of measured components
    include firmware stored in flash memory, software loaded into memory at start
    time, data stored in a file system, or values in a CPU register. This document
    defines a "measured component" format that can be used with the EAT Measurements
    claim.</p>
