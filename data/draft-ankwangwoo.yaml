abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides information on the transition of IPV4 to IPV6. This
    information explains the IPV6's address packet definition. The method used is
    an efficient way to control all electric goods in a network with one IP address
    (telephone number). This type of packet definition will reduce hop count which
    dramatically improves speed, reliability, connections, and overall performance.</p>"
