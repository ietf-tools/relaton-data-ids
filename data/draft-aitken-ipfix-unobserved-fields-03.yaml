abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPFIX protocol is designed to export information about observations,
    and lacks a method for reporting that observations are unavailable. This document
    discusses several methods for reporting when fields are unavailable, reviews the
    advantages and disadvantage of each, and recommends methods which should be used.</p>"
