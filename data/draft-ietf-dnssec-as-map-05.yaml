abstract:
- content: "<p>One requirement of secure routing is that independent routing entities,
    such as those identified by Internet Autonomous System Numbers, be able to authenticate
    messages to each other. Additions have developed to the Domain Name System to
    enable it to be used for authenticated public key distribution [RFC 2065]. This
    draft maps all Autonomous System numbers into DNS Domain Names so that the DNS
    security can be used to distribute their public keys. [Changes from previous version
    are to accommodate AS numbers larger than 16 bits and to delegate on decimal boundaries
    rather than binary boundaries.]</p>"
