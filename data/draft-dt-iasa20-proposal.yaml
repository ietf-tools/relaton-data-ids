abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established
    in 2005. In the intervening years, the needs of the IETF have evolved in ways
    that require changes to its administrative structure. The IETF Chair started an
    effort in November of 2016 to begin the process of changing the IETF administrative
    structure, starting with a set of virtual workshops to get input from the IETF
    community, and then encompassing a series of BOF sessions at IETF meetings to
    define the problem, develop requirements, explore potential options for changes,
    and a Design Team - the authors of this document - that would make recommendations.
    The purpose of this document is to collect all of the various materials that have
    lead up to the Design Team recommendation that IETF be a Disregarded Limited Liability
    Company (LLC) of the Internet Society.</p>"
