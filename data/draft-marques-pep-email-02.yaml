abstract:
- content: "<p>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon
    already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and designed to
    allow for easy implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption: this
    ranging from key distribution to mechanisms of subject encryption. The goal of
    pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to make email encryption usable
    by a wider range of Internet users, to achieve wide application of confidentiality
    and privacy practices in the real world. This document defines basic operations
    of pEp's approach towards email and two PGP/MIME formats (pEp Email Format 1 and
    2) to provide certain security guarantees. The proposed operations and formats
    are targeted to Opportunistic Security scenarios and are already implemented in
    several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
