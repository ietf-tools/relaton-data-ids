abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. This document recommends that this is
    no longer alone sufficient to cater for the security and privacy issues seen on
    the Internet today. For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against
    endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align
    with the interests of users. While such protection is difficult, there are some
    measures that can be taken. It is important to consider the role of data passed
    to various parties - including the primary protocol participants - and balance
    the information given to them considering their roles and possible compromise
    of the information.</p>"
