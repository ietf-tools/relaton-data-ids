abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has different signature verification
    behaviour based on whether signed attributes are present or not. This results
    in a potential existential forgery vulnerability in CMS and protocols which use
    CMS. This document describes the vulnerability and lists a number of potential
    mitigations for LAMPS working group discussion.</p>"
