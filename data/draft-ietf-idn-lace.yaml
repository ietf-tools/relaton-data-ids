abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transformation method for representing non-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely compatible with
    the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding
    (ACE) for internationalized host names, as described in the comparison document
    from the IETF IDN Working Group. This method is based on the observation that
    many internationalized host name parts will have a few substrings from a small
    number of rows of the ISO 10646 repertoire. Run-length encoding for these types
    of host names will be fairly compact, and is fairly easy to describe.</p>"
