abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes starting a work within the IETF to apply the
    Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane to Ethernet Label
    Switching and to make extensions to the GMPLS control plane protocols as necessary
    for this application. This will be done based on the protocols developed by the
    MPLS and CCAMP working groups in the IETF. Ethernet Label Switching will use the
    data plane encodings as specified by the IEEE 802 standards. This document intends
    to gather the information necessary to have a "GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching"
    BoF in Vancouver.</p>
