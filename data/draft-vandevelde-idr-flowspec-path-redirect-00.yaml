abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications but the
    primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic filtering
    actions for DDoS mitigation. The flow-spec standard RFC5575 [2] defines a redirect-to-VRF
    action for policy-based forwarding but this mechanism is not always sufficient,
    particular if the redirected traffic needs to be steered into an engineered path.
    This document defines a new redirect-to-Path-id (32-bit or 128-bit) flow-spec
    action to provide advanced redirection capabilities. When activated, the flowspec
    signalled Path-id is used to identify the next-hop redirect information within
    a localized to the router Path- id redirect table. The Path-id redirect table
    is a table providing a list of Path-id's and router local redirect information.
    This allows a Flowspec signalled redirect towards a next-hop IP address, next-hop
    local interface or next-hop (traffic engineered) tunnel interface.</p>"
