abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines data that should be included in a provisioning
    interface for a Registry. The provisioning interface may be used in (near) real
    time, or periodically, from a service provider's service provisioning system to
    establish and administer telephone number (TN) and associated routing information
    in the Registry after necessary validations. Based on 1) effective date/time specified
    for the data and 2) validation of the TN assignee, these data will be used to
    define selective routing views for various recipient service providers which would
    be reflected in ENUM-SIP address servers. In addition, the concept of multiple
    TNs sharing a common routing pattern simplifies the definition and administration
    of routing data. D. Guyton Expires 01/07/09 [page 1] Registry Provisioning Interface
