abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a problem statement on collaborative mitigation
    of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks have become increasingly
    prevalent and sophisticated, causing significant disruptions in network services.
    The evolving trends of DDoS attacks, including their types, intensities, and attack
    methods, pose formidable challenges to existing defense systems. This problem
    statement examines the current defense landscape, highlighting the distributed
    deployment of defense systems across various network positions and the imbalances
    in defense capabilities. Collaboration is crucial for effective DDoS attack mitigation,
    considering the global nature of attacks and the need to protect critical network
    links. The existing collaborative framework, DOTS, shows promise but requires
    addressing these challenges to enhance its efficacy. The existing collaborative
    framework DOTS demonstrates potential, but there are still numerous challenges
    in its practical application. This document aims to address these key issues that
    impact the implementation of collaborative technologies.</p>"
