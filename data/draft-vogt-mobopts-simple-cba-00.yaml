abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility and multi-homing protocols enable multi-addressed nodes to
    redirect ongoing communication sessions from one IP address to another. Most of
    these protocols verify a multi-addressed node's reachability at a claimed new
    IP address in order to prevent redirection-based flooding attacks. In view of
    reduced protocol latencies, such verification is preferably performed concurrently,
    i.e., while packets are already being sent to the new IP address. This document
    defines Credit-Based Authorization, a technique that facilitates concurrent reachability
    verification without compromise of security.</p>"
