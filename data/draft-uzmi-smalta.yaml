abstract:
- content: <p>Concerns about the growth of the global routing table has led to proposals
    for short-term FIB-reduction and long-term RIB-reduction solutions. The simplest
    type of FIB-reduction solution is "FIB aggregation", whereby individual routers
    locally reduce the FIB size without any changes to external operation. The draft
    [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation] describes and analyzes several FIB aggregation schemes.
    This current draft describes and analyzes another point in the design space, called
    SMALTA. Compared to the approaches in [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation], SMALTA provides
    better aggregation and does not introduce non-routable entries in the FIB, but
    is also more complex.</p>
