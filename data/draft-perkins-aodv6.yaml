abstract:
- content: "<p>The Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been
    proposed for use with IPv4 as a network-layer protocol linking together mobile
    nodes in an ad hoc network. It offers quick adaptation to dynamic link conditions,
    low processing and memory overhead, low network utilization, and determines unicast
    routes between sources and destinations. It uses destination sequence numbers
    to ensure loop freedom at all times. In this specification, we detail the necessary
    modifications to the messages given in the IPv4 specification so that AODV will
    be able to work for nodes using IPv6 addresses.</p>"
