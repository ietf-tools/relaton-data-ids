abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new namespace, the Host Identity namespace, and
    a new protocol layer, the Host Identity Protocol, between the internetworking
    and transport layers. Herein are presented the basics of the current namespaces,
    their strengths and weaknesses, and how a new namespace will add completeness
    to them. The roles of this new namespace in the protocols are defined. This document
    obsoletes RFC 4423 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly
    that of crypto agility. It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations
    of RFC 5201.</p>"
