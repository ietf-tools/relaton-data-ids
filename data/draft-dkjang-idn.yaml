abstract:
- content: "<p>This description addresses the method for using internationalized (multilingual)
    domain names under the current DNS. Further, the method for converting a internationalized
    domain name expressed in a native language, into a traditional US-ASCII domain
    name compatible in current DNS, is addressed. This method especially uses 'sequence
    of 36 characters' to convert all characters in IDN into US-ASCII. Finally, the
    way to use this method with lc2LDs are presented.</p>"
