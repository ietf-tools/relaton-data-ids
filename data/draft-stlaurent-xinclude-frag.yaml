abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an xinclude1() scheme for use in XPointer-
    based fragment identifiers. This scheme, like other XPointer Framework [12] schemes,
    is designed primarily for use with the XML Media Types defined in RFC 3023 [5],
    to identify locations within a given XML representation of a resource. The xinclude()
    scheme notifies an XPointer processor whether the creator of the XPointer intended
    for XInclude 1.0 [9] processing to take place.</p>"
