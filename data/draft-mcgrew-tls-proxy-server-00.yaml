abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is commonly used to protect HTTP and
    other protocols. HTTP is often proxied, for instance, to allow an application-layer
    firewall to inspect the HTTP traffic between the client and the server. A TLS
    session cannot protect traffic between the client and server when an HTTP proxy
    is present. Separate TLS sessions can be run between the client and the proxy,
    on one side, and the proxy and the server on the other side. This provides the
    needed security, as long as the client, server, and proxy device use appropriate
    and consistent security policies. However, this last part is problematic; how
    can a proxy know if a client trusts a server? At present, TLS provides no mechanism
    to coordinate policies. This note defines a TLS extension that allows a TLS proxy
    to provide a TLS client with all of information about the TLS server that the
    client needs to make a well-informed access control decision.</p>"
