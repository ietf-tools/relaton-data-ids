abstract:
- content: "<p>NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range
    of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a storage networking
    fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. For Ethernet-based networks,
    RDMA or TCP technology can be used to transport NVMe, but the network management
    mechanism is simple, and fault detection is weak. This document defines the architecture
    of the Ethernet-based NVMe control optimization technology, including service
    processes between hosts, storage devices and network switches, and fast fault-aware
    switchover.</p>"
