abstract:
- content: "<p>A new flexible grid of DWDM has been developed within the ITU-T Study
    Group 15 to allow a more efficient spectrum allocation. In such environment a
    data plane connection is switched based on the allocated variable width optical
    spectrum frequency slot. This new switching capability is referred to as Spectrum
    Switched Optical Networks (SSON). This draft describes the framework for the application
    of a GMPLS control plane to a SSON.</p>"
