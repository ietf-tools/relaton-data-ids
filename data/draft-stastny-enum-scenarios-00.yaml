abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes scenarios for ENUM and ENUM-like Systems, both
    for ENUM used by End Users and also for ENUM-like Systems used by operators for
    network-specific or infrastructure purposes. It also gives some examples of ENUM
    Usage and proposes a new URI scheme to be used with ENUM. This may allow a way
    forward for the definition of ENUM Services and also for the definition of the
    required URIs and their parameters. This document therefore deals with information
    stored in the ENUM and the look-up process and the usage of the information retived
    in this look up process. It does not deal with the administrative process related
    to the population of the relevant zones.</p>"
