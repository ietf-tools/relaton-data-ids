abstract:
- content: "<p>The NSIS Work group will develop the requirements, architecture and
    protocols for the next IETF steps on signaling. Two approaches for a signaling
    model have been discussed: path-coupled and path-decoupled (previously denoted
    as on-path and off-path). This draft provides a conceptual comparison between
    path-coupled and path-decoupled signaling together with reasons for why an NSIS
    protocol should be designed to support both cases. The collection of data objects
    to be carried by the protocol should basically be the same in both cases and will
    evolve over time as new usages for NSIS protocol are identified. The differences
    between the two flavors of this NSIS protocol are then explained.</p>"
