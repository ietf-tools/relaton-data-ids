abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO method defines a means for
    transporting mid-dialog application layer data between user agents. Its initial
    use was to support the transport of ISUP mid-call messages which could not be
    mapped to any other SIP request method. However, since its initial usage for that
    purpose, INFO has seen widespread abuse as a means for introducing non-standard
    and non-interoperable extensions to SIP. For this reason, we now believe INFO
    should be considered harmful, and therefore, deprecated in its current form.</p>"
