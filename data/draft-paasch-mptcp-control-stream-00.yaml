abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP's extensive use of TCP options to exchange control information
    consumes a significant part of the TCP option space. Extending MPTCP to add more
    control information into the session becomes cumbersome as the TCP option space
    is limited to 40 bytes. This draft introduces a control stream that allows to
    send control information as part of the subflow's payload. The control stream
    is mapped into a separate sequence number space and uses a TLV-format for maximum
    extensibility. It is left to future documents to specify how the TLV-format might
    be used to exchange control information. As the control stream is sent as part
    of the subflow's payload, it is not subject to the 40 bytes limitation of the
    TCP option space.</p>"
