abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient
    against packet losses. Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time
    Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus
    allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term. This is the
    sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific
    mechanisms). This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP)
    that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the
    senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based
    repair mechanisms to be implemented. This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains
    the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.
