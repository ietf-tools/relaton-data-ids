abstract:
- content: '<p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the
    the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically tunneled
    to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term "localized routing" refers
    to a method by which packets are routed directly by the MAG without involving
    the LMA. In order to establish a localized routing session between two Mobile
    Access Gateways in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, two tasks must be accomplished:
    1. The usage of local routing must be authorized for both MAGs and 2. The address
    of the MAG to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is attached must be discovered
    This document specifies how to accomplish these tasks using the Diameter protocol</p>'
