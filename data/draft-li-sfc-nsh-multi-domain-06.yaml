abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism to achieve multi-domain service
    forwarding for NSH. The proposed mechanism adopts a horizontal deployment structure,
    which divides a multi-domain SFC into several segmental SFCs in the control plane
    and each domain creates its own SFP independently in data plane. A label is proposed
    to identify different cross-domain flows at the classifier by extending the metadata
    of the NSH encapsulation.</p>"
