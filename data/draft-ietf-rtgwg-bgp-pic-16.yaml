abstract:
- content: "<p>In a network comprising thousands of BGP peers exchanging millions
    of routes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop. Given the large
    scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after failure in a time period
    that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. In this document we proposed
    an architecture by which traffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in a timeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The objective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding data structures in a hierarchical
    manner and sharing forwarding elements among the maximum possible number of routes.
    The proposed technique achieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring
    incremental deployment, complete automation, and zero management and provisioning
    effort. It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of BGP Prefix Independent
    Convergence (BGP-PIC) are hinged on the existence of more than one path whether
    as ECMP or primary-backup.</p>"
