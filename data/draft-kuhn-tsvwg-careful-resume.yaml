abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies careful convergence of Congestion Control (CC),
    providing a cautious method that enables fast startup for a wide range of connections
    or reconnections. The method reuses a set of computed CC parameters that are based
    on the previously observed path characteristics between the same pair of transport
    endpoints, such as the bottleneck bandwidth, available capacity, or the RTT. These
    parameters are stored, allowing them to be later used to modify the CC behavior
    of a subsequent connection. The document also discusses assumptions and defines
    requirements around how a sender utilizes these parameters to provide opportunities
    for a connection to more quickly get up to speed (i.e. utilize the available capacity).
    It discusses how these changes impact the capacity at a shared network bottleneck
    and the safe response that is needed after any indication that the new rate is
    inappropriate. The method is expected to be appropriate to IETF transports.</p>"
