abstract:
- content: "<p>Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [HC98] has several modes
    with different number of message passes. For those who want to save their bandwidth,
    three-pass Aggressive Mode is a good choice since it has minimal number of message
    passes in Phase 1. The public-key primitive method in Aggressive Mode provides
    significant security advantages over the other alternatives and should be the
    method of choice in many implementations. In this method, however, the responder
    must pay computational cost as expensive as modular exponentiation BEFORE identifying
    the initiator. This feature can be abused by malicious initiators for a Denial-of-Service
    (DoS) attack. The purpose of this document is to solve this problem in digital-signature
    method by using falling- together (FT) mechanism [MI98], [MI99] in conjunction
    with stateless-connection technique [AN97] and an appropriate use of Cookies [KS99].</p>"
