abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies and categorizes the components of routing,
    switching, forwarding, and addressing that may be used in routing architectures.
    The intention is to support the development of a new routing architecture for
    the Internet. The addressing architecture, address allocation and assignment principles,
    and possibilities for renumbering are important aspects when designing a routing
    architecture. How routing information is learned and methods for distributing
    it are other issues discussed in this document. A number of methods for data traffic
    forwarding are also described and evaluated</p>"
