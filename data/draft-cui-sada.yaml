abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the SAVNET-based Anti-DDoS Architecture (SADA),
    which can efficiently detect, mitigate, and traceback Denial- of-Service (DDoS)
    attacks that spoof source addresses. The SADA consists of a distributed DDoS detection
    mechanism based on honeynets, a multi-stage DDoS mitigation mechanism, and a suspect-
    based DDoS traceback mechanism. By adopting the Source Address Validation (SAV)
    technique of SAVNET and introducing the data plane and the control plane, the
    SADA makes minor changes to the SAVNET while providing major benefits.</p>"
