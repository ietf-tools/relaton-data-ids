abstract:
- content: "<p>The Conferencing Framework described in RFC 4353 defines the semantics
    necessary for conducting conference calls with the session initiation protocol.
    It also introduces a mixer entity responsible for combining all media streams
    and delivering them to the participants of the call. This document presents the
    lack of a standardized way for such mixers to deliver information about the audio
    activity (sound level) of participants in a conference call. The document describes
    the problem and discusses a few possible ways of transporting such information.</p>"
