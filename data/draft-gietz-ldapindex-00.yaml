abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the overall concept of a distributed indexing
    system based on the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) [1], as it will be implemented
    in the EC co-funded DESIRE II project and afterwards maintained as a service by
    the European academia. Although the system is designed for multi-purpose usage,
    the main focus of this document lies on its application as a LDAPv3 [2] Directory
    white pages index, although the system is designed to be applicable to other indexing
    problems as well.</p>"
