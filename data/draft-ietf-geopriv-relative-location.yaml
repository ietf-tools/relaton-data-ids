abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the Presence Information Data
    Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) (RFC 4119) for the expression of location information
    that is defined relative to a reference point. The reference point may be expressed
    as a geodetic or civic location, and the relative offset may be one of several
    shapes. An alternative binary representation is described. Optionally, a reference
    to a secondary document (such as a map image) can be included, along with the
    relationship of the map coordinate system to the reference/offset coordinate system,
    to allow display of the map with the reference point and the relative offset.</p>"
