abstract:
- content: <p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used in telephony,
    video conferencing, and telepresence applications. Such applications are often
    run on best-effort UDP/IP networks. If congestion control is not implemented in
    the applications, then network congestion will deteriorate the user's multimedia
    experience. This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm; rather,
    it defines a minimal set of "circuit-breakers". Circuit-breakers are conditions
    under which an RTP flow is expected to stop transmiting media to protect the network
    from excessive congestion. It is expected that all RTP applications running on
    best-effort networks will be able to run without triggering these circuit breakers
    in normal operation. Any future RTP congestion control specification is expected
    to operate within the envelope defined by these circuit breakers.</p>
