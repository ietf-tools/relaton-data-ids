abstract:
- content: "<p>Increase in the usage of different access networks, the role of Radius
    server is increased to provide access across different access networks and access
    technologies. AAA server provides access to user terminals in different security
    mechanisms in access networks. Due to the robust architecture of radius server,
    the functionalities of server can be extended to provide different services other
    than the authentication and access to the user terminal. In this draft we are
    proposing to extend the functionalities of the radius server for the mobility
    management of the user in the access networks. In this process the Radius server
    performs the mobility context management of the user when its roaming or during
    handover from the visiting network and the home network. In this draft we are
    proposing to accommodate Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) using these extensions. In this
    proposed architecture we have defined new attributes and packet format when a
    Radius server communicates with the MPA/HA of the PMIP architecture as well as
    with another Radius server for context management.</p>"
