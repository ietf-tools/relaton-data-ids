abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an email induced Denial of Service threat from
    SPF script used to evaluate the association of a source domain- name with the
    sending-system. The SPF script attempts to establish the domain-name association
    through the construction of an extensive IP address list of all sending-systems.
    Expectations of an association have become problematic, as message handling might
    be negatively affected without an apparent domain-name relationship discovered
    between the sending-system and either the message envelope or the message itself.</p>"
