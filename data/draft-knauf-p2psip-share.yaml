abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a RELOAD Usage for managing shared write access
    to RELOAD Resources. Shared Resources in RELOAD (ShaRe) form a basic primitive
    for enabling various coordination and notification schemes among distributed peers.
    Access in ShaRe is controlled by a hierarchical trust delegation scheme maintained
    within an access list. A new USER-CHAIN-ACL access policy allows authorized peers
    to write a Shared Resource without owning its corresponding certificate. This
    specification also adds mechanisms to store Resources with a variable name which
    is useful whenever peer-independent rendezvous processes are required.</p>"
