abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the information contained in a database of
    long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different security protocols. The database
    design supports both manual and automated key management. In many instances, the
    security protocols do not directly use the long-lived key, but rather a key derivation
    function is used to derive a short-lived key from a long-lived key.</p>"
