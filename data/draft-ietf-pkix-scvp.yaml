abstract:
- content: "<p>The Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) allows a client
    to delegate certification path construction and certification path validation
    to a server. The path construction or validation (e.g., making sure that none
    of the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according to a validation
    policy, which contains one or more trust anchors. It allows simplification of
    client implementations and use of a set of predefined validation policies. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
