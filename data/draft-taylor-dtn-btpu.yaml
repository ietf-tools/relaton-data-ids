abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for the unidirectional transfer of
    large binary objects, typically Bundle Protocol version 7 bundles, between two
    nodes connected by a unidirectional, unreliable, frame- based link-layer protocol,
    without requiring IP services. The protocol does not require a return path for
    acknowledgements, but instead supports data repetition as a mechanism to protect
    against data loss. It fully supports the disaggregation of flows of bundles of
    different priority, preventing head-of-line blocking impacting performance. The
    binary wire format of the protocol is designed to enable performant implementation
    in hardware or software, with the aim of enabling protocol implementations to
    run at the line-rate of the underlying link-layer protocol.</p>"
