abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes
    and semantics to express alternate capabilities and offers. The attribute "cgroup”
    is defined to express alternate simultaneous sets of capabilities. The “ALTS”
    semantics are defined to express specific alternate simultaneous offers. Existing
    methods like the MIME multipart/alternative subtype and the use of multiple session
    descriptions in SDP are also discussed.</p>
