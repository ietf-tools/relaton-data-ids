abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a first step towards the design of a NSIS Transport Layer
    Protocol (NTLP). It lists protocol requirements, protocol design principles, and
    functional issues on the protocol level coming out of the NSIS requirements document[NSIS-REQ],
    the NSIS framework document [NSIS-FW], and several analysis documents. This list
    might be very near to implementation or solution already. The draft has been motivated
    by recommendations to list protocol requirements instead of higher level NSIS
    requirements as done in the NSIS requirements draft [NSIS-REQ].</p>"
