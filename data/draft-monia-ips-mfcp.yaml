abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mFCP, a UDP-based [UDP] implementation of the
    iFCP Fibre Channel Protocol [iFCP] over metro- and local-scale IP networks. These
    networks are provisioned to have latency, reliability, and performance levels
    comparable to that of a Fibre Channel network. Storage devices use the Fibre Channel
    SCSI mapping in [FCP] for data transport and error recovery. mFCP leverages these
    existing mechanisms to facilitate high-performance interconnection of Fibre Channel-
    based storage devices over suitably provisioned IP networks. As in the case of
    iFCP, fibre channel frames may be transported natively over such a network without
    Fibre Channel switching and routing elements.</p>"
