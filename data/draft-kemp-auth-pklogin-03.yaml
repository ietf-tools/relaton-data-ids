abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Public Key Login (PKL) protocol, a challenge-
    response authentication mechanism using digital signatures. It provides start-of-session
    authentication for firewall proxies, dial-up Network Access Servers, remote email
    servers, and interactive protocols such as Telnet and FTP. It provides functionality
    similar to One Time Passwords and handheld authentication tokens, and it supports
    both one-way and mutual authentication. PKL uses the authentication exchanges
    specified in ISO/IEC 9798-3 and NIST FIPS Pub 196. The PKL protocol provides strong
    authentication at the beginning of a session, but does not by itself provide communication
    channel integrity or confidentiality. PKL should be used in conjunction with a
    channel integrity mechanism, for example to provide authentication of individual
    users over (host-keyed) Virtual Private Network connections. This Internet Draft
    is intended to be the last version of the PKL specification prior to publication
    as an Informational RFC. Comments are requested no later than the expiration date
    of this draft.</p>"
