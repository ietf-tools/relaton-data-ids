abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a solution to the IPv4 address shortage problem.
    The solution is to be implemented within the IPv4 framework, rather than inside
    a "next generation" IP protocol. By organizing local networks as an "intranet
    hierarchy" attached to the Internet, nodes inside the hierarchy can be uniquely
    addressed with path descriptions. Two IPv4 options, Source-Side Path-info and
    Destination-Side Path-info, are added into the IPv4 protocol, so that up to 2
    path descriptions can be carried in the IPv4 header. Further, a currently unused
    flag bit in the IPv4 header is used to extend the logical IPv4 header, so that
    options can also be carried "out-band". Core routers in the Internet will ignore
    the unrecognized new options and the extension, and thus need not be replaced
    or updated.</p>
