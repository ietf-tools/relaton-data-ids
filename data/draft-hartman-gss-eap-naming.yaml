abstract:
- content: "<p>The naming extensions to the Generic Security Services Application
    Programming interface provide a mechanism for applications to discover authorization
    and personalization information associated with GSS-API names. The Extensible
    Authentication Protocol GSS-API mechanism allows an Authentication/Authorization/Accounting
    peer to provide authorization attributes along side an authentication response.
    It also provides mechanisms to process Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
    messages provided in the AAA response. This document describes the necessary information
    to use the naming extensions API to access that information.</p>"
