abstract:
- content: <p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) systems will be used in core networks
    where system downtime must be kept to an absolute minimum. Many MPLS Label Switching
    Routers (LSRs) may, therefore, exploit Fault Tolerant (FT) hardware or software
    to provide high availability of the core networks. The details of how FT is achieved
    for the various components of an FT LSR, including Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP), the switching hardware and TCP, are implementation specific. This document
    identifies issues in the LDP specification in RFC 3036, "LDP Specification", that
    make it difficult to implement an FT LSR using the current LDP protocols, and
    defines enhancements to the LDP specification to ease such FT LSR implementations.
    The issues and extensions described here are equally applicable to RFC 3212, "Constraint-Based
    LSP Setup Using LDP" (CR-LDP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
