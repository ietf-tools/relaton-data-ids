abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for managing aggregated traffic
    over a composite link. A composite link consists of a group of non- homogenous
    links that have the same forward adjacency and can be considered as a single TE
    link or an IP link used for MPLS. The document primarily focuses on MPLS data
    plane and control plane traffic over a composite link and composite link advertisement
    within IGP. MPLS traffic can be set up by either RSVP-TE or LDP signaling. Applicability
    is described for a single pair of MPLS-capable nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable
    nodes, or a set of layer networks connecting MPLS-capable nodes.</p>"
