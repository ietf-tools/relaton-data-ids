abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect
    the quality of service of inelastic flows. It does this by marking packets when
    traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical
    link rate. This document specifies an extension to the two-state PCN baseline
    encoding that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IP header without
    using more than one Diffserv codepoint. It presupposes a standards action has
    removed the limit of two encoding states in current tunnelling mechanisms.</p>"
