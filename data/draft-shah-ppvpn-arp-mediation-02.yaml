abstract:
- content: "<p>The VPWS service [L2VPN Framework] provides point-to-point connections
    between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices. It does so by binding two Attachment
    Circuits (each connecting a CE device with a Provider Edge, PE, device) to a Pseudowire
    (connecting the two PEs). In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of the same
    technology (e.g., both ethernet, both ATM), and the Pseudowire must carry the
    frames of that technology. However, if it is known that the frames' payload consists
    solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection
    in which the Pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.
    This requires the PEs to perform a function known as 'ARP Mediation'. This document
    specifies the ARP Mediation function, and specifies draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt
    the encapsulation used to carry the IP datagrams on the Pseudowires when ARP mediation
    is used.</p>"
