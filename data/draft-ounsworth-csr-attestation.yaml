abstract:
- content: "<p>Utilizing information from a device or hardware security module about
    its posture can help to improve security of the overall system. Information about
    the manufacturer of the hardware, the version of the firmware running on this
    hardware and potentially about the layers of software above the firmware, the
    presence of hardware security functionality to protect keys and many more properties
    can be made available to remote parties in a cryptographically secured way. This
    functionality is accomplished with attestation technology. This document describes
    extensions to encode evidence produced by an attester for inclusion in PKCS10
    certificate signing requests. More specifically, two new ASN.1 Attribute definitions,
    and an ASN.1 CLASS definition to convey attestation information to a Registration
    Authority or to a Certification Authority are described.</p>"
