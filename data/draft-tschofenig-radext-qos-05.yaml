abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the RADIUS protocol that performs
    authentication, authorization, and accounting for Quality- of-Service reservations.
    The described extensions allow network elements to authenticate the initiator
    of a reservation request (if desired), to ensure that the reservation is authorized,
    and to account for established QoS resources. Flexibility is provided by offering
    support for different authorization models and by decoupling specific QoS attributes
    carried in the QoS signaling protocol from the AAA protocol. This document is
    the RADIUS complement to the DIAMETER QoS application.</p>"
