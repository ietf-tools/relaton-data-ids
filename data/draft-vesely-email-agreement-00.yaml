abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a way to standardize an agreement between a recipient
    and a sender, acknowledged by the recipient's MTA. The subject of the agreement
    expresses the willingness of the recipient to receive an identified, authenticated
    mail stream. After an MTA acknowledges the agreement, it will unconditionally
    accept complying messages, even if the recipient is not mentioned in any destination
    address field.</p>"
