abstract:
- content: "<p>Deals with DMARC acceptance failures disrupting legitimate and valid
    message distribution affecting millions while attempting to exclude From header
    field domains not aligned with email acceptance methods in a manner incompatible
    with normal email conventions. DMARC does not accommodate recent message structure
    underscoring the erroneous premise of a store-and-forward transport enforcing
    non-negotiable message structure. Active exploitation of DMARC dependency on flawed
    acceptance practices are further aggravated when its feedback is sent to malefactors.
    Risks prevented by careful accommodation of legitimate and valid messages also
    better ensures economic, social, and civic benefits derived from an open exchange
    of email.</p>"
