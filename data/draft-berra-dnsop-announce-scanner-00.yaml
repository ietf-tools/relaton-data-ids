abstract:
- content: "<p>In DNS operations, automated scanners are commonly employed by the
    operator of a parent zone to detect the presence of specific records, such as
    CDS or CSYNC, in child zones, indicating a desire for delegation updates. However,
    the presence and periodicity of these scanners are typically implicit and undocumented,
    leading to inefficiencies and uncertainties. ￼ This document proposes an extension
    to the semantics of the DSYNC resource record, as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify],
    allowing parent zones to explicitly signal the presence and scanning interval
    of such automated scanners. This enhancement aims to improve transparency and
    coordination between child and parent zones. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-announce-scanner
    (https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-announce-scanner). The most recent
    working version of the document, open issues, etc, should all be available there.
    The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>"
