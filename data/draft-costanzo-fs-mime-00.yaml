abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a new top level type for MIME and its subtypes and
    mappings to file types. The intent of this draft is to both define a new comprehensive
    top level type and define a method and usage for one of the to be defined subtypes.
    This new subtype in itself is a media type. The purpose of which provides a mechanism
    to move a structured set of files system object structures (directories and/or
    files) as a MIME attachment from one environment to another while preserving common
    elements.</p>"
