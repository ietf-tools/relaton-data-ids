abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a proposal for extending the OSPF intra-domain
    routing protocol [1] to support an additional level of hierarchy for traffic engineering
    purposes. The additional level of hierarchy allows the construction of much larger
    networks. With some modification, it should be possible to apply these principles
    to the IS-IS routing protocol as well.</p>"
