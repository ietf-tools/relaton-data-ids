abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to provide Internet connectivity with mobile
    ad-hoc networks. It describes how to obtain a globally routable address and internet
    gateway operation. Once a manet node obtains a global address from an internet
    gateway, it may exchange data with nodes on the Internet. This Internet access
    method is not dependent on a particular manet protocol. Further, use of global
    connectivity with Mobile IPv6 is specified.</p>"
