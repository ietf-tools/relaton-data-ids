abstract:
- content: <p>The issue concerns auditing financial records from several sources over
    time. To validate proper legal money usage and flow is a difficult task. Each
    financial institution has non-common reporting methods. Seek to create a common
    export record to merge transactions and easily sort by date , time , and institution.
    The first goal is to create a traceability file of transactions. The second goal
    is to create a "simple" standard record for "anyone" to sift and sort records.</p>
