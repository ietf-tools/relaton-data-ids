abstract:
- content: "<p>The ROLL Working Group was recently chartered by the IETF to define
    routing characteristics for low power embedded devices. ROLL would like to serve
    the Industrial, Commercial, Home and Urban markets. Pursuant to this effort, this
    document defines the functional and cost requirements for installing integrated
    facility management systems in commercial facilities. The routing requirements
    for commercial building applications are presented in this document. Commercial
    buildings have been fitted with pneumatic and subsequently electronic communication
    pathways connecting Martocci Expires January 14, 2009 [page 1] Internet-Draft
    draft-martocci-roll-commercial-routing-reqs July 2008 sensors to their controllers
    for over one hundred years. Recent economic and technical advances in wireless
    communication allows facilities to increasingly utilize a wireless solution in
    lieu of a wired solution; thereby reducing installation costs yet maintaining
    highly reliant communication. Wireless solutions will be adapted from their existing
    wired counterparts in many of the building applications including, but not limited
    to HVAC, lighting, security, fire, and elevator products. These devices will be
    developed to reduce installation costs; while increasing installation and retrofit
    flexibility. Sensing devices may be battery or mains powered. Actuators and area
    controllers will be mains powered. To meet the cost target, these devices must
    have a total installed cost below that of the traditional wired alternative; yet
    maintain reliability on par with wired devices. The total installed cost includes
    the infrastructure, product, installation, commissioning, labor and operational
    costs of the device over its 30 year lifespan. Except for special circumstances
    such as flexible installation (e.g. airports) or cosmetics (e.g. museums, there
    is nothing compelling about installing wireless solutions inside a building unless
    it can be accomplished below the cost of a wired installation. This document will
    define the requirements necessary for wireless technology to displace wired infrastructure
    and meet this objective.</p>"
