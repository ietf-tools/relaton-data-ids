abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic
    Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous
    Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with
    each responsible for computing a segment of the path. To preserve confidentiality
    of topology with each AS, the PCE supports a mechanism to hide the contents of
    a segment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS), by encoding the
    contents as a Path Key Subobject (PKS). This document describes the addition of
    this information to Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling by inclusion
    in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) and Record Route Object (RRO).</p>"
