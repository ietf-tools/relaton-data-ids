abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Virtual Circuit Connection Verification (VCCV)
    procedures for use with psuedowire connections. VCCV supports connection verification
    applications for pseudowire VCs regardless of the underlying MPLS or IP tunnel
    technology. VCCV makes use of IP based protocols such as Ping and MPLS-Ping to
    perform operations and maintenance functions. A network operator may use the VCCV
    procedures to test the network's forwarding plane liveliness.</p>"
