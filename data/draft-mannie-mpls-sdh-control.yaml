abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an attempt to specify how MPLS could be used to control
    the establishment of SDH paths. It identifies the elements that could be switched
    in SDH, proposes a way to build labels for SDH 'intelligent' switching and discusses
    several problems. Annexes A and B are intended to specify how to support this
    specification using CR-LDP and TE-RSVP.</p>"
