abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a technique that can provide both entity authentication
    and message authentication based on certificate. This protocol combines three
    existing options, authentication option as specified in delay authentication mechanism
    in [RFC3118] and the user authentication protocol option defined in [RFC2485].
    The goal of this specification is to define methods based certificate to protect
    the integrity of DHCP message and stop the gaps of the existing delay authentication
    mechanism. In order to meet these goals, we use the asymmetrical cryptography
    protection and some options about authentication that have been defined in other
    specifications.</p>"
