abstract:
- content: "<p>Developing technology to allow for truly internationalized Internet
    identifiers is proving a hard nut to crack within the framework of the existing
    DNS. At the same time, the DNS continues to do an excellent job at serving its
    original mandate for providing efficient mappings between machine-readable labels
    and network resources. What is not clear is whether the existing DNS can be transformed
    into a service that can handle the more human oriented identification services
    it is now being asked to provide. This document embraces, extends and complements
    a proposal by John Klensin to address the requirements for a directory layer above
    the existing DNS that can better solve these problems. The discussion concludes
    by proposing a strawman called the Service Lookup System (SLS).</p>"
