abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Error Reporting is a lightweight error reporting mechanism that
    provides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS resource
    records that fail to resolve or validate, that a Domain Owner or DNS Hosting organization
    can use to improve domain hosting. The reports are based on Extended DNS Errors
    [RFC8914]. When a domain name fails to resolve or validate due to a misconfiguration
    or an attack, the operator of the authoritative server may be unaware of this.
    To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document describes a method for a validating
    recursive resolver to automatically signal an error to an agent specified by the
    authoritative server. DNS Error Reporting uses the DNS to report errors.</p>"
