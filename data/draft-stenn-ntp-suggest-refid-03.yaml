abstract:
- content: <p>NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest
    being RFC 5905 [RFC5905]. A core component of the protocol and the algorithms
    is the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify the source of time used
    for synchronization. Traditionally, when the source of time was another system
    the REFID was the IPv4 address of that other system. The core purpose of the REFID
    is to prevent a one-degree timing loop, where if A has several timing sources
    that include B, if B decides to get its time from A we don't want A then deciding
    to get its time from B. The REFID is considered to be "public data" and is a vital
    core-component of the base NTP packet. If a system's REFID is the IPv4 address
    of its system peer, an attacker can try to use that information to send spoofed
    time packets to either or both the target or the target's server, attempting to
    cause a disruption in time service. This proposal is a backward- compatible way
    for a time source to tell its peers or clients "If you use me as your system peer,
    use this nonce as your REFID." This nonce SHOULD be untraceable to the original
    system, and if it is used as the REFID this type of attack is prevented.</p>
