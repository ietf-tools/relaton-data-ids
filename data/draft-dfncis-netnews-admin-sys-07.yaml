abstract:
- content: "<p>The Netnews Administration System (NAS) is a framework to simplify
    the administration and usage of network news (also known as Netnews) on the Internet.
    Data for the administration of newsgroups and hierarchies are kept in a distributed
    hierarchical database and are available through a client-server protocol. The
    database is accessible by news servers, news administrators, and news readers.
    News servers can update their configuration automatically; administrators are
    able to get the data manually. News reader programs are able to get certain information
    from an NAS server, automatically or at a user's discretion, which provides detailed
    information about groups and hierarchies to the user. NAS is usable in coexistence
    with the current, established process of control messages; an unwanted interference
    is impossible. Furthermore, NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure
    of Usenet in a hierarchical database. NAS can be used without modification of
    existing news relay, news server, or news reader software; however, some tasks
    will be better accomplished with NAS-compliant software. This memo defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
