abstract:
- content: '<p>The currently existing iCalendar standard (RFC 2445) provides only
    a simple text field ("LOCATION" property) for specifying the location where an
    event (or "TODO" item) will occur. While this may be adequate for human readers,
    it is difficult for automated systems to make use of. With the recent advent of
    tools and services (event aggregators, for example) which would benefit greatly
    from structured location data, the need to specify detailed venue information
    has become apparent. This document describes a proposed method for addressing
    this need. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org
    and/or the authors. Note: This document depends on RFC2445bis, currently in draft
    status, and should not proceed without RFC2445bis.</p>'
