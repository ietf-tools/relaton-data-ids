abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) package
    for the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). This package includes new Local
    Connection Options, ATM-specific events and signals, and ATM connection parameters.
    Also included is a description of codec and profile negotiation. It extends the
    MGCP that is currently being deployed in a number of products. Implementers should
    be aware of developments in the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU SG16, which
    are currently working on a potential successor to this protocol. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
