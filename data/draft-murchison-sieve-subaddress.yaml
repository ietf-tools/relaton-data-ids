abstract:
- content: <p>On email systems that allow for "subaddressing" or "detailed addressing"
    (e.g., "ken+sieve@example.org"), it is sometimes desirable to make comparisons
    against these sub-parts of addresses. This document defines an extension to the
    Sieve mail filtering language that allows users to compare against the user and
    detail parts of an address. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
