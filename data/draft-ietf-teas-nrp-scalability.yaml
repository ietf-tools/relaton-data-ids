abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Network Slice aims to offer connectivity services to a network
    slice customer with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level
    Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay network. A Network Resource Partition
    (NRP) is a set of network resources that are allocated from the underlay network
    to carry a specific set of network slice service traffic and meet specific SLOs
    and SLEs. As the demand for IETF Network Slice increases, scalability would become
    an important factor for the deployment of IETF Network Slices. Although the scalability
    of IETF Network Slices can be improved by mapping a group of IETF Network Slices
    to one NRP, that design may not be suitable or possible for all deployments, thus
    there are concerns about the scalability of NRPs. This document discusses some
    scalability considerations about NRPs in the network control and data plane. It
    also investigates a set of optimization mechanisms.</p>"
