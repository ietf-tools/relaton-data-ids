abstract:
- content: "<p>The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use of
    Authenticated-Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms. At the time of the
    original design there was discussion about the relative location of the authenticated
    attributes and the encrypted content in the ASN.1 structure. With the benefits
    of implementation experience I revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate
    the decision made.</p>"
