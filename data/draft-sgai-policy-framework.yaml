    information in a vendor-independent, interoperable, scalable manner. The goal
    of this document is to provide a framework that meets these needs. This framework
    has been developed specifically for QoS traffic management. A secondary goal of
    this document is to show that this general framework can be extended to other
    application domains, such as security.</p>"
