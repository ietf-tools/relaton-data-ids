abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives information to support admission
    control and flow termination in order to protect the quality of service (QoS)
    of inelastic flows. [I-D.taylor-cl-edge- behaviour] describes one boundary node
    behaviours for three-state measurement-based load control, known informally as
    CL [I-D.briscoe- tsvwg-cl-phb]. In [I-D.taylor-cl-edge-behaviour], flow termination
    is required if excess-traffic-marked packets were observed and the end of one
    measurement period MUST be the beginning of the next one, independently of current
    flow conditions. According to this termination, PCN-flows in some ingress-egress
    (IE) pairs may be terminated during measurement period of other IE pairs unless
    round- trip times (RTT) of all the IE pairs are the same. We illustrate that this
    can lead to over-termination. Our simulation confirms that accuracy of termination
    is improved when no PCN-flows in some IE pairs are terminated during measurement
    period of other IE pairs.</p>"
