- content: "<p>Conveying metadata about network conditions and metadata about individual
    packets can improve the user experience especially on wireless networks which
    suffer bandwidth and delay variability. This document describes how clients and
    servers can cooperate with network elements so their QUIC and DTLS streams can
    be augmented with information about network conditions and packet importance.</p>"
