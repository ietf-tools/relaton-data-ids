abstract:
- content: "<p>Motivated by the need to support multiple in-network services and functions
    in an MPLS network (a.k.a. MPLS Network Actions (MNA)), this document describes
    a generic and extensible method to encapsulate MNA instructions as well as possible
    ancillary data in an MPLS packet. All the post-stack MNAs are encapsulated in
    a structure called Post-stack MNA Header (PAH). A PAH is composed of a common
    header plus a chain of extension headers; each extension header is a container
    for an MNA. The encapsulation method allows chaining multiple post-stack extension
    headers and provides the means to enable fast access to them as well as the original
    upper layer headers. This document confines to the solution of PAH encoding and
    leaves the specification of PAH indicator to the overall MNA solution. We show
    how PAH can be used to support several new MNAs as a generic post-stack mechanism.</p>"
