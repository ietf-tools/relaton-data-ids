abstract:
- content: '<p>When a standard IPv4 node (mobile node: MN) changes its wireless network
    attachment point (performs a handover), it gets new IP layer configuration information
    (e.g., its new IP address and the addresses of new routers) from a DHCP server
    and changes its IP layer configuration. During such a handover process, it cannot
    send or receive IP packets to/from its corresponding node (CN), so a service disruption
    is caused. In this document, we introduce new DHCPv4 extensions and an option
    (Fast Handover Option) for fast handovers. This protocol is ported from "DHCPv6
    options for Fast Handovers" [6]. It enables DHCP servers to send new configuration
    information to MNs before a handover to be used after the handover, so MNs can
    have shorter handover processing times. It is noted that DHCP servers and MNs
    implementing this protocol can achieve fast handovers with standard IPv4 routers
    without any other micro-mobility management protocols.</p>'
