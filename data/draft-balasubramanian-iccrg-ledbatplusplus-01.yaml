abstract:
- content: "<p>This experimental memo describes LEDBAT++, a set of enhancements to
    the LEDBAT (Low Extra Delay Background Transport) congestion control algorithm
    for background traffic. The LEDBAT congestion control algorithm has several shortcomings
    that prevent it from working effectively in practice. LEDBAT++ extends LEDBAT
    by adding a set of improvements, including reduced congestion window gain, modified
    slow-start, multiplicative decrease and periodic slowdowns. This set of improvement
    mitigates the known issues with the LEDBAT algorithm, such as latency drift, latecomer
    advantage and inter-LEDBAT fairness. LEDBAT++ has been implemented as a TCP congestion
    control algorithm in the Windows operating system. LEDBAT++ has been deployed
    in production at scale on a variety of networks and been experimentally verified
    to achieve the original stated goals of LEDBAT.</p>"
