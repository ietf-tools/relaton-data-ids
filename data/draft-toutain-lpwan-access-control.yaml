abstract:
- content: "<p>The framework for SCHC defines an abstract view of the rules, formalized
    with through a YANG Data Model. In its original description rules are static and
    share by 2 entities. The use of YANG authorizes rules to be uploaded or modified
    in a SCHC instance and leads to some possible attacks, if the changes are not
    controlled. This document summarizes some possible attacks and define augmentation
    to the existing Data Mode, to restrict the changes in the rule.</p>"
