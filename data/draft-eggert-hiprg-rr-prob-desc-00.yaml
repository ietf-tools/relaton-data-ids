abstract:
- content: "<p>This document investigates the design space for resolution and rendezvous
    mechanisms for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP.) It identifies and describes specific
    issues that HIP resolution and rendezvous mechanisms should address. These issues
    include dependencies on the DNS, lack of support for direct communication based
    on host identities, lack of a reverse lookup mechanism for host identities, and
    DNS and node rendezvous. This document does not propose specific resolution and
    rendezvous mechanisms. Different alternative solutions will be described and discussed
    in companion documents. These documents should analyze if and to what degree the
    specific proposals they present address the issues identified here.</p>"
