abstract:
- content: "<p>With the convergence of computing, storage and network, especially
    the maturity of data center technology, it becomes a trend that ISP would like
    to deploy the computing and storage resources in the network, so that the optimized
    resource utilization as well as the value-added service can be provided. The data
    centers deployed in the network can provide the runtime environment and resource
    to optimize ICP services with various edge service proxies, such as CDN servers
    and distributed Trackers. Meanwhile, based on data centers ISP can provide all
    kinds of value-added services in the IP based network. CNO (Core Network Overlay)is
    an ISP-controlled overlay network constructed on top of the core network which
    is proposed as a solution to large-scale data distribution in the Internet. It
    can provide the transfer service for data distribution and switching in the core
    network for the ICP and its edge service proxies. Because the CNO nodes are trustworthy
    (controlled by ISP), stable and have a simple economic model (without any participation
    of end users and ICPs), various overlay based data distribution methods are easier
    to be applied and standardized with CNO. This draft presents the definition of
    the conceptions and terms about CNO.</p>"
