abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are typically
    managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as rationale and means
    of monitoring and management of MANET routers running the Optimized Link State
    Routing protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) and its constituent MANET Neighborhood Discovery
    Protocol (NHDP). Apart from pre-deployment management for setting up IP addresses
    and security related credentials, OLSRv2 only needs routers to agree one single
    configuration parameter (called "C"). Other parameters for tweaking network performance
    may be determined during operation of the network, and need not be the same in
    all routers. This, using MIB modules and related management protocols such as
    SNMP (or possibly other, less "chatty", protocols). In addition, for debugging
    purposes, monitoring data and performance related counters, as well as notifications
    ("traps") can be sent to the Network Management System (NMS) via standardized
    management protocols.</p>
