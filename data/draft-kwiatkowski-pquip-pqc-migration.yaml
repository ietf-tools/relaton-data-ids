abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on migration to post-quantum cryptography
    (PQC) in internet protocols. It outlines the challenges and considerations that
    protocol designers and implementers should take into account when transitioning
    from traditional cryptographic algorithms to PQC algorithms, which are designed
    to be secure against quantum computer attacks. It is intended for cryptographic
    protocol designers within the IETF community, as well as technology developers
    and implementers responsible for deploying PQC standards.</p>"
