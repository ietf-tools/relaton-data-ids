abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an protocol used to negotiate media between
    browsers or other compatible devices. This protocol provides the state machinery
    needed to implement the offer/answer model (RFC 3264), and defines the semantics
    and necessary attributes of messages that must be exchanged. The protocol uses
    an abstract transport in that it does not actually define how these messages are
    exchanged. Rather, such exchanges are handled through web-based transports like
    HTTP or WebSockets. The protocol focuses solely on media negotiation and does
    not handle call control, call processing, or other functions.</p>"
