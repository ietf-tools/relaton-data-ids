- content: "<p>Label Switching Routers are able to handle several distinct types of
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) depending on the triggers for establishing or releasing
    LSPs or the granularity of the flow that are dedicated to each of the LSPs. This
    memo first analyzes characteristics of individual types of LSPs, and discusses
    possible interoperation scenario between them.</p>"
