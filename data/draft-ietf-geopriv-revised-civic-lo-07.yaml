abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic
    location. This format is designed for use with Presence Information Data Format
    Location Object (PIDF-LO) documents and replaces the civic location format in
    RFC 4119. The format is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but
    adds several new elements based on the civic types defined for Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP), and adds a hierarchy to address complex road identity schemes.
    The format also includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the
    types of elements where appropriate. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
