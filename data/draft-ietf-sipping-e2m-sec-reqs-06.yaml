abstract:
- content: <p>A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) does not always
    trust all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or
    headers contained in its message. The UA might want to protect the message bodies
    and/or headers from intermediaries, except those that provide services based on
    its content. This situation requires a mechanism called "end-to-middle security"
    to secure the information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does
    not interfere with end-to-end security. This document defines a set of requirements
    for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
