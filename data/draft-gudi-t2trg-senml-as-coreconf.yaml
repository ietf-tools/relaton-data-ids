abstract:
- content: "<p>SenML is one of the data formats used by the Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    devices to send simple sensor readings and device parameters over the network.
    However, a lack of a YANG model for SenML means it cannot be used by the applications
    which already use YANG for data modeling and validation. Furthermore, some of
    the encoding formats and tools available for YANG models, cannot be used by the
    devices sending data in SenML format. This document provides one of the ways to
    model SenML data in YANG. Additionally, SenML data is encoded into CORECONF format
    using this YANG model to concisely represent the data.</p>"
