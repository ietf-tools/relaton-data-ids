abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routing protocol,
    called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). It is designed for a hierarchical
    IP network and leverages the hierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting.
    It is originally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some of its
    functions could be applied to commercial networks as well. Besides the basic support
    for multicast in static environments, HLIM supports host mobility (movements of
    IP multicast hosts) and network mobility (movements of IP multicast routers with/without
    hosts). Since HLIM is designed for harsh environments, reliability and survivability
    functions are also built into HLIM.</p>"
