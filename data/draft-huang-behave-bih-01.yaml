abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Host" (BIH), a host based protocol
    translation mechanism that allows a subset of applications supporting only one
    IP address family to communicate with peers that are reachable or supporting only
    the other address family. This specification addresses scenarios where a host
    is provided dual stack or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack network
    case, single address family applications in the host sometime will communicate
    directly with other hosts using the different address family. In the case of IPv6
    only network or IPv6 only destination, IPv4 originated communications have to
    be translated into IPv6. The BIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk to
    IPv4 peers and hence hides the IPv6 from those applications. Acknowledgement of
    previous work This document is an update to and directly derivative from Kazuaki
    TSHUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI, and Yoshifumi ATARASHI [RFC2767] and from Seungyun
    Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's [RFC3338],
    which similarly provides a dual stack host means to communicate with other IPv6
    host using existing IPv4 appliations. This document combines and updates both
    [RFC2767] and [RFC3338]. The changes in this document reflect five components
    1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections 2. IPv4 address pool use private address
    instead of the unassigned IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.1 - 0.0.0.255) 3. Extending ENR
    and address mapper to operate differently 4. Adding an alternative way to implement
    the ENR 5. Going for standards track instead of experimental/ informational</p>
