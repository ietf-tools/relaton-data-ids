abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application/BatchBeep content-type, like the Multipart/Related
    content-type, provides a mechanism for representing objects that consist of multiple
    components. An Application/BatchBeep entity contains the wire representation of
    the client-to-server part of a BEEP (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol) session,
    which consists of sequence of frames. Each frame contains a message or a part
    of a message. Each message (other than channel 0 messages) represents a component
    of the compound object, just as a body part of a Multipart/Related entity represents
    a component.</p>"
