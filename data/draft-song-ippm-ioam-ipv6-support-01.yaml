abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been proposed to encapsulate IOAM tracing option data fields
    in IPv6 HbH options header. However, due to size of the trace data and the extension
    header location in the IPv6 packets, the proposal creates practical challenges
    for implementation, especially when other extension headers, such as routing header,
    also exist and require in-network processing. We propose several alternative approaches
    to address this challenge, including separating the IOAM trace data to a different
    extension header, using the postcard-based telemetry (e.g., IOAM DEX) instead,
    and applying the segment IOAM trace export scheme, based on the network scenario
    and application requirements. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach and
    hope to foster standard convergence and industry adoption.</p>"
