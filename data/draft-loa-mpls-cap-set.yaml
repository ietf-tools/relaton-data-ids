abstract:
- content: "<p>Several protocols might be used for Label Distribution in an MPLS network,
    e.g. Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), including the part of LDP described in
    Constraint-Based LSP Setup using LDP, the BGP-4 and RSVP. The functionality defined
    in those protocols are to some extent overlapping, but also complementary. This
    document specifies a number of MPLS Capability sets that can be used to define
    what is needed from an MPLS implementation in order to interwork with other implementations.
    The number of Capability sets might change in the future.</p>"
