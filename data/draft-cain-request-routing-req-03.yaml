abstract:
- content: "<p>Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of Content Distribution
    Networks (CDNs) that direct client requests to an available copy of content based
    on one or more metrics. To enable the interconnection of CDNs [MODEL][ARCH], it
    is necessary for their request-routing systems to interconnect and exchange information
    such that client requests can be routed between CDNs. This is called request-routing
    internetworking. This document specifies the requirements for request-routing
    internetworking.</p>"
