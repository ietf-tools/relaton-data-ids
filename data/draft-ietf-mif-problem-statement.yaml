abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes issues encountered by a node attached to multiple
    provisioning domains. This node receives configuration information from each of
    its provisioning domains, where some configuration objects are global to the node
    and others are local to the interface. Issues such as selecting the wrong interface
    to send traffic happen when conflicting node-scoped configuration objects are
    received and inappropriately used. Moreover, other issues are the result of simultaneous
    attachment to multiple networks, such as domain selection or addressing and naming
    space overlaps, regardless of the provisioning mechanism. While multiple provisioning
    domains are typically seen on nodes with multiple interfaces, this document also
    discusses situations involving single-interface nodes. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
