abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification extends IPv6 Neighbor Discovery with features that
    are useful for mobile nodes. These features provide information for the purposes
    of detecting the loss of Router Advertisements, determining the global address
    of the router, or for discovering which routers are also Mobile IPv6 home agents.
    These extensions are required for Mobile IPv6 operation, but they are also useful
    for any type of nomadic or mobile nodes. This document revises a part of RFC 3775
    which originally defined these extensions.</p>"
