abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) enables address space holders
    to issue Route Origin Authorization (ROA) objects to authorize one or more Autonomous
    Systems (ASes) to originate BGP routes for specific IP address prefixes. Individual
    BGP speakers can utilize Validated ROA Payloads (VRPs) to validate the legitimacy
    of BGP announcements. This document highlights potential validation errors, and
    recommends extension of VRPs from reasonable aggregation to enhance Route Origin
    Validation (ROV) and prevent validation errors that may occur due to traffic engineering
    or route aggregation policies.</p>"
