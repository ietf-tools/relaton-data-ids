abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to create forwarding state for a FEC received from a downstream
    LSR, LDP requires the presence of a matching entry in the routing table. This
    document describes a mechanism that allows the creation of LDP signaled LSPs for
    prefixes which are not present in the routing table. This draft is applicable
    to address prefix FECs and host FECs associated with either IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes.</p>"
