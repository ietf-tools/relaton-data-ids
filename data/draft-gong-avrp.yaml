abstract:
- content: "<p>The Anchor-based Voronoi Routing Protocol in this draft is an efficient
    distributed routing protocol for wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks. The
    design objective of the protocol is to reduce the overall updating overhead caused
    by the movement of mobile sinks and simultaneously build efficient data delivery
    structure. The basic idea behind AVRP is to combine the ideas of Voronoi scoping
    and dynamic anchor node selection. The designed protocol is simple, efficient,
    and easy to implement in dynamic wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks.</p>"
