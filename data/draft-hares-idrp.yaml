- content: "<p>This memo specifies the adaptation of the ISO Inter-Domain Routing
    Protocol that enables it to be used as an Inter-Autonomous System routing protocol
    in the TCP/IP Internet. IDRP with this adaptation will be called 'IDRP for IP'
    in this document. Dual IDRP, that is, a single instance of IDRP that can simultaneously
    support Inter-Domain/Inter-Autonomous System routing in the TCP/IP and OSI Internets
    is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
