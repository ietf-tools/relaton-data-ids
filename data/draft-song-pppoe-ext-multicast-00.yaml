abstract:
- content: "<p>In the year following the publication of the PPPoE protocol much operational
    experience and customer feedback was gathered. One problem that access providers
    usually mention is that when PPPoE Server needs to send IP multicast packets or
    broadcast packets to PPPoE Clients in a same Ethernet, it has to send these packets
    to each PPPoE Client over each PPPoE link. Because the PPPoE Clients are all in
    a Ethernet, this multiplication of packets affects performance and wastes the
    net's resource.</p>"
