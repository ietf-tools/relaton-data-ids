abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for mapping IP flows to ATM switches.
    No signaling is necessary to setup a path through ATM switches. Switch controllers
    run a IP routing protocol and execute IP forwarding. The Ipsofacto component is
    responsible for mapping a IP flow to a switched path. The focus of this document
    is primarily on switching IP multicast. Mechanisms for switching unicast flows
    are also described.</p>"
