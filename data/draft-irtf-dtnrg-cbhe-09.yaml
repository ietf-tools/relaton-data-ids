abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a convention by which Delay-Tolerant Networking
    (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) "convergence-layer" adapters may represent endpoint
    identifiers in a compressed form within the primary blocks of bundles, provided
    those endpoint identifiers conform to the structure prescribed by this convention.
    Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) compression is a convergence-layer adaptation.
    It is opaque to bundle processing. Therefore, it has no impact on the interoperability
    of different Bundle Protocol implementations, but instead affects only the interoperability
    of different convergence-layer adaptation implementations. This document is a
    product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed
    by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
