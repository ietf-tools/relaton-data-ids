abstract:
- content: "<p>The Adhoc Multicast Routing Protocol (AMRoute) allows for robust IP
    Multicast in mobile adhoc networks by exploiting user-multicast trees and dynamic
    cores. It creates a bidirectional shared-tree for data distribution using only
    the group senders and receivers as tree nodes. Unicast tunnels are used as the
    tree links to connect neighbors on the 'user-multicast tree.' Thus, AMRoute does
    not need to be supported by network nodes that are not interested/capable of multicast,
    and cost is incurred only by group senders and receivers. AMRoute makes certain
    nodes 'core nodes' to initiate the signaling component of AMRoute, such as detection
    of group members and tree setup. Core nodes differ significantly from those in
    CBT and PIM-SM, since they are not a central point for data distribution and can
    move dynamically among member nodes. Since AMRoute is not dependent on any specific
    unicast routing protocol, it can operate seamlessly over separate domains with
    different unicast protocols.</p>"
