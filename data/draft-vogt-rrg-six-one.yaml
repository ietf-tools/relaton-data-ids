abstract:
- content: "<p>There is heightened concern about the growth of the global routing
    table and the increased frequency of routing table updates. Both is due to the
    use of provider-independent addressing space in edge networks, which accommodates
    operators' desire to move traffic quickly and easily from one provider to another.
    The main recent proposals attempt to solve this problem by hiding provider- independent
    addressing space through a level of indirection. Unfortunately, indirection requires
    a non-trivial distribution of address translation information across the Internet.
    This is either slow, or costly in terms of signaling overhead, or both. Security
    and transitionability are further issues. This document proposes an alternative
    solution, which is based on a single, provider-dependent addressing space and
    hence avoids the problems of indirection. The solution meets the objectives of
    edge network operators while limiting the size of the routing table and its update
    frequency.</p>"
