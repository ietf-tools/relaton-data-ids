abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes
    to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for one-to-many reliable data
    transport using IP multicast. One of the key properties of FEC codes in this context
    is the ability to use the same packets containing FEC data to simultaneously repair
    different packet loss patterns at multiple receivers. Different classes of FEC
    codes and some of their basic properties are described and terminology relevant
    to implementing FEC in a reliable multicast protocol is introduced. Examples are
    provided of possible abstract formats for packets carrying FEC. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
