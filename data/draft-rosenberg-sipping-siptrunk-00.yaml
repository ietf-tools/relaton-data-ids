abstract:
- content: <p>The term "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunk" has become almost
    commonplace amongst vendors and SIP providers. Even though the notion of a 'trunk'
    has a well defined meaning in circuit switched systems, it has never been defined
    for SIP. This document provides a formal definition for a SIP trunk, discusses
    its scope and applications, and establishes best practices for identification
    and security of SIP trunks.</p>
