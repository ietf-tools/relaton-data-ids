abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme of 'Domain Name Auto-Registration
    for Plugged-in IPv6 Nodes' mechanism that makes it possible to register both regular
    and inverse domain name information of plugged- in IPv6 nodes to DNS servers automatically.
    Since IPv6 addresses are too long to remember and EUI64-based addresses are too
    complicated to remember, there are strong requirements to use logical names that
    are easy to remember instead of IPv6 addresses to specify IPv6 nodes and to register
    domain name information of plugged-in IPv6 nodes automatically. In order to meet
    the requirements, a mechanism is proposed as one of the IPv6 auto-configuration
    (plug and play) functions. After the Address Autoconfiguration [ADDR-AUTO] has
    been executed, it works as a succeeding plug and play mechanism. This document
    clarifies problems that we meet when we apply the Dynamic Updates in the DNS [DYN-DNS]
    to automatic domain name information registration mechanisms. This document proposes
    the Domain Name Auto-Registration mechanism as a solution to these problems.</p>"
