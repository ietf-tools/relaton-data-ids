abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a high-level application-oriented interface to
    the Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) Architecture. The abstract interface
    models the RTFM architecture while hiding many of the details not relevant to
    an application programmer who want to integrate IP traffic measurements into an
    application. Particularly the interaction between manager, reader, and meter is
    hidden by the interface, and rule sets used for traffic measurement specification
    are replaced by simpler data structures. Furthermore, the RTFM interface supports
    complex actions like modifying a traffic measurement specification while it is
    already being applied. The interface is defined in an abstract way. It can be
    implemented by an application programming interface as well as by a network protocol.</p>"
