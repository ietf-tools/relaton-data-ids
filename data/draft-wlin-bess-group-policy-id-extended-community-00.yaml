abstract:
- content: "<p>Group Based Policy can be used to achieve micro or macro segmentation
    of the user traffic. For Group Based Policy, a Group Policy ID, as known as Group
    Policy Tag, is used to represent a logical group that shares the same policy and
    access privilege. This specification defines a new BGP extended community that
    can be used to propagate Group Policy ID through a route advertisement in the
    control plane. This is to facilitate policy enforcement at the ingress node when
    the optimization of network bandwidth is desired.</p>"
