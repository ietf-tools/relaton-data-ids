abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet and the ICT industry is consuming a sizable portion of the
    electricity available in the world today, and the fraction has been growing significantly
    over time. Data shows that the power draw of internet is relatively constant over
    the day and week, even though the “load” and delivered services vary greatly over
    this time span. This seems to suggest that there is room for optimizations. This
    document provides some definitions, some proposed principles for a solution, and
    then paints a picture of what a solution based on existing standards and some
    current internet drafts might look like. The first step of an optimization loop
    is to measure. This document proposes a mechanism to collect energy related telemetry
    data from the extremely diverse set of devices found in networks today, without
    necessarily updating the network elements. Once the collection is done, it’s also
    very relevant to be able to control the devices, and turn them into low power
    modes when the service demand is lower.</p>"
