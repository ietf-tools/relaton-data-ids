abstract:
- content: <p>The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that are
    robust, easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy to compute. The IPPM
    WG has defined a large number of richly parameterized metrics because network
    measurement has many purposes. Often, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise
    set of metrics describing a network's current state to an end user. It is for
    this purpose that the present set of metrics is defined, and the document is principally
    concerned with "short-term" reporting considerations (a few seconds or minutes
    as opposed to days, months or years.)</p>
