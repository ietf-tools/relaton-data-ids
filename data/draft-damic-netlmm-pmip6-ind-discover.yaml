abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol that enabes
    mobility management for an IP host as it moves across different points of attachment
    within the mobility domain. An IP host whose mobility is being managed by the
    network is unaware of the access networks capability to do mobility management
    on its behalf using Proxy Mobile IPv6. This draft proposes mechanisms by which
    the host is informed of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support, as well as how to actively
    discover such capability in the network that host attaches to. The ability of
    the host to discover or be aware of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support in the access network
    enables better decision making in terms of the network selection and attach procedure
    as well as the choice of mobility management.</p>"
