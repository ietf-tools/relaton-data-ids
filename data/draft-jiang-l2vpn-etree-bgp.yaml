- content: "<p>This document describes the extension to BGP signaling for the E-Tree
    support in BGP VPLS when the dual-VLAN model is used as in [Vpls- etree]. The
    BGP VPLS messages and their procedures remain almost the same as in [RFC4761],
    only a new extended community for E-Tree is proposed.</p>"
