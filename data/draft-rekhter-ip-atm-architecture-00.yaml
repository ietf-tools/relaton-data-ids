abstract:
- content: "<p>The original IP architecture assumes that each Data Link subnetwork
    is labeled with a single IP network number. As indicated in RFC1620, this assumption
    may be violated for large data networks, including ATM-based networks. The architecture
    works even when this assumption is violated, but it imposes constraints on communication
    among hosts and routers through an ATM-based network, which in turn may preclude
    full utilization of ATM capabilities. This document describes extensions to the
    IP architecture that relaxes these constraints, thus enabling the full utilization
    of the services provided by ATM.</p>"
