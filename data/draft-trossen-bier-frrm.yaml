abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a semantic for multicast that is based on
    initiating forward requests, resulting in dynamic return multicast to the set
    of initiating clients. The key dynamic nature here is represented in the return
    multicast being possibly different for every transmission. We introduce this semantic
    more formally, present exemplifying use cases and then focus on realizing this
    semantic using BIER technology. Although this document formally introduces the
    FRRM semantic as a new communication semantic, it does not intend to show the
    realization of it through any other means besides BIER. This is left for separate
    documents, if desired.</p>"
