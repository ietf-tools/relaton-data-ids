abstract:
- content: "<p>Gernerative AI applications depend on large scale parallel computing
    clusters for model training and inference. Existing implementations of collective
    communication in parallel computing is built on top of RDMA, the most adoptable
    AI transport protocol. However, One-to- Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many collective
    operations all depend on point-to-point transport semantics of RDMA, which inevitably
    introduces more bandwidth occupancy and transmission overhead. Emerging approaches
    for collective communication optimization focus on network-assisted collective
    acceleration and can work compatibly with RDMA. This document analyzes different
    technical schemes for network-assisted collective acceleration based on RDMA,
    and presents the gap between these work and current IETF standards, notably iWARP.
    Requirements for designing new standards are proposed accordingly.</p>"
