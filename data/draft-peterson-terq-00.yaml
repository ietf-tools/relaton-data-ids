abstract:
- content: "<p>As telephone services migrate to the Internet, Internet applications
    require access to diverse information about telephone numbers. ENUM, for example,
    applied the DNS to the problem of finding URIs for telephone services on the Internet.
    The intrinsic limitations in the query/response semantics of the DNS, however,
    have often been strained by the requirements for accessing information about telephone
    numbers. This document therefore proposes a protocol- independent framework and
    data model for querying and responding to requests concerning telephone numbers
    and call routing that allows a richer expression of both questions and answers.</p>"
