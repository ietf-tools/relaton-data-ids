abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element as a
    tool to help MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels and Segment Routing paths placement. This
    also include the ability to compute inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing path
    following a distributed or hierarchical approach. In complement to the original
    stateless mode, a stateful mode has been added. In particular, the new PCInitiate
    message allows a PCE to directly ask a PCC to setup an MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnel
    or a Segment Routing path. However, once computed, the inter-domain LSPs or Segment
    Routing path are hard to setup in the underlying network. Especially, in operational
    network, RSVP-TE signaling is not enable between AS border routers. But, such
    RSVP-TE signaling is mandatory to setup contiguous LSP tunnels or to stitch or
    nest independent LSP tunnels to form the end-to-end inter-domain paths. This document
    proposes to combine a Backward Recursive or Hierarchical method with PCInitiate
    message to setup independent paths per domain, and combine these different paths
    together in order to operated them as end-to-end inter-domain paths without the
    need of signaling session between AS border routers. A new Stitching Label is
    defined and new LSP-TYPE code points are considered for that purpose.</p>"
