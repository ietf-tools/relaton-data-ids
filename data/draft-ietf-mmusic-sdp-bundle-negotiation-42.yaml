abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the SDP
    Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple)
    for sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m="
    sections). Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, and the media
    is referred to as bundled media. The "m=" sections that use the BUNDLE transport
    form a BUNDLE group. To assist endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this
    specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to
    request that specific media is only used if bundled. The specification also updates
    RFC 3264, to allow assigning a zero port value to a "m= section without meaning
    that the media described by the "m=" section is disabled or rejected. When RTP-based
    media is used, there are multiple ways to correlate bundled RTP packets with the
    appropriate "m=" section. This specification defines a new Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP) source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension that
    provides an additional way to do this correlation by using them to carry a value
    that associates the RTP/RTCP packets with a specific "m=" section.</p>
