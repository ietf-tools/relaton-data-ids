abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines several mechanisms which can be used by a client
    such as a Mail User Agent or Mail Submission Agent, to query an SMTP server which
    is configured to accept incoming mail for a mail domain, to obtain information
    associated with an email address based in that domain. Among other purposes, these
    mechanisms are intended to facilitate discovery of senders' and/or recipients'
    public keys for use in automatic verification of whole-message digital signatures
    and automatic whole-message encryption of email sent to recipients.</p>"
