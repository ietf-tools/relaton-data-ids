abstract:
- content: "<p>A protocol specification must balance two often conflicting goals:
    to produce as general a protocol as possible, and to produce a simple protocol.
    The Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP) is a general protocol
    for creating and managing cryptographic groups on a network. This document describes
    the GSAKMP-Light (GL) profile, a way to shorten the number of messages exchanged
    during secure group establishment. The GSAKMP protocol assumed that group members
    joining a secure group had no information about the specific security mechanisms
    used by the group (for example, the key length, encryption protocol, etc). GSAKMP-Light
    provides a profile for the case where group members have been previously notified
    of these security mechanisms, used for joining a group, during the group announcement
    or invitation. This simplification removes 2 messages from the group establishment
    portion of the GSAKMP protocol, eliminates the need for initiating a unicast security
    association, and removes the need for many of the optional fields of individual
    messages. The profile does not sacrifice any of the security properties of the
    full protocol. To facilitate the transmission of security mechanism settings during
    session invitation or announcement, this document also describes a useful default
    set of security algorithms and configurations, Security Suite 1. Full specification
    of this suite allows an entire set of algorithms and settings to be described
    to prospective group members in a concise manner. Future security suites can be
    defined as needed.</p>"
