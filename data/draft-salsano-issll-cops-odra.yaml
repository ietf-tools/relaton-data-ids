abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new client type for the COPS protocol to
    support dynamic DiffServ admission control. The Policy Decision Point (PDP) acts
    as a 'Bandwidth Broker' for the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) which is requesting
    resources. The use of the defined mechanism is suited for (but it is not limited
    to) the Integrated Services operation over Diffserv networks.</p>"
