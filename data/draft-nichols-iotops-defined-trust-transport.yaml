abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a broadcast-oriented, many-to-many Defined-
    trust Transport (DeftT) framework that makes it simple to express and enforce
    application and deployment specific integrity, authentication, access control
    and behavior constraints directly in the protocol stack. DeftT's communication
    model is one of synchronized collections of secured information rather than one-to-
    one optionally secured connections. DeftT is part of a Defined-trust Communications
    approach with a specific example implementation available. Combined with IPv6
    multicast and modern hardware-based methods for securing keys and code, it provides
    an easy to use foundation for secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains
    (RFC8799), in particular for Operational Technology (OT) networks.</p>"
