- content: "<p>An analysis is performed on the advantages and disadvantages for provision
    of Location Information (LI) by-reference in the GEOPRIV architecture. The concept
    of a Location URI, that is, a URI that references LI, is introduced. A number
    of usage patterns for Location URIs are discussed, particularly with regard to
    addressing mobility. Security concerns that are introduced by Location URIs are
    also considered.</p>"
