abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism for establishing a switched path with
    guaranteed Quality of Service for RSVP [1] flows in a MultiProtocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) environment. It proposes an extension to the RSVP protocol that allows
    the establishment of a sequence of label switched hops along the hop-by-hop routed
    path by enabling adjacent nodes to exchange MPLS labels [11]. The labels may correspond
    to information that identifies a layer 2 virtual connection; for example, the
    VPI/VCI value in the case of an ATM-based infrastructure.</p>"
