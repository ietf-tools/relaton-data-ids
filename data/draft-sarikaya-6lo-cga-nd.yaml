abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a lightweight and secure version of 6LoWPAN Neighbor
    Discovery for application in low-power and lossy networks. Cryptographically Generated
    Address and digital signatures are calculated using Elliptic Curve Cryptography,
    so that the cryptographic operations are suitable for low power devices. An optimal
    version of this protocol is also specified which supports faster CGA calculation
    and multi-hop operation. A node computes a Cryptographically Generated Address
    to be used as a Unique Interface ID, and associate all its Registered Addresses
    with that Unique Interface ID in place of the EUI-64 that is used in RFC 6775
    to uniquely identify the interface of the Registered Address. Once an address
    is registered with a cryptographic unique ID, only the owner of that ID can modify
    the state in the 6LR and 6LBR regarding the Registered Address.</p>"
