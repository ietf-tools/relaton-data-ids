abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7653 allows for actively transferring the real-time binding information
    data of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) via TCP, which satisfies
    the need of continuous update of an external requestor with Leasequery data. QUIC
    could provide useful, reliable and secure semantics for transferring active leasequery
    of DHCPv6, which enabling much better efficiency and performance by reducing connect
    time. This document describes how to use the QUIC transport protocol to deliver
    DHCPv6 Active Leasequery messages, named DHCP6oQUIC.</p>"
