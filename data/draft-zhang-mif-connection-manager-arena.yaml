abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a "Connection Manager" model implemented in the
    platform Arena, a mobile OS based on Linux. The introduction of Connection Manager
    brings two major benefits in Arena. First, it logically decouples the underlining
    connection approach with the connection management. Second, it plays a central
    role which executes the policy of OS, especially for multiple interfaces.</p>
