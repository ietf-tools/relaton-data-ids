abstract:
- content: "<p>Current resource reservation architectures for multimedia networks
    don't scale well for a large number of flows. We propose a new architecture that
    aggregates flows on each link in the network. Therefore, the network has no knowledge
    of individual flows, and resource management functions traditionally implemented
    in the network (such as flow acceptance control) are delegated to hosts.</p>"
