abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion
    issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of the original
    IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for Easy IPv4), discusses the
    IPv4 public address pool expansion and the Internet system architecture enhancement
    aspects. It was originated by a study called ExIP (Extended IPv4) analyzing the
    use of the first available octet (eight bits) in the reserved private network
    pools (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16) to achieve a moderate address space expansion
    factor of 256 by each, while maintaining their familiar operation characteristics.
    Along the way, a parallel yet similar effort, called EnIP (Enhanced IPv4), was
    discovered. EnIP fully utilizes the same private network pools to increase the
    address space by a factor of 17.1M with end-to-end connectivity. EzIP is a superset
    that proposes one unified format for not only encompassing the considerations
    of both, but also identifying additional capabilities and flexibilities. For example,
    EzIP may expand an IPv4 address at least by a factor of 256 to as high as 256M
    without affecting the existing IPv4 public address assignments, while still keeping
    intact the current private networks for the 256M case if desired. The EzIP is
    in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only both categories
    of connectivity, but also their interoperability. The traditional Internet traffic
    and the IoT operations may coexist simultaneously without perturbing their existing
    setups, while offering end-users the freedom to choose one or the other. If the
    IPv4 public pool were reorganized, the assignable pool could be multiplied by
    512M or even up to 2B times with end-to-end connectivity. EzIP may be deployed
    as a firmware enhancement to the Internet edge routers or private network gateways
    wherever needed, or simply installed as an inline adjunct module between the two,
    enabling a seamless introduction. The 256M case establishes a spherical layer
    of routers providing a complete interconnection between the Internet and end-users.
    This configuration enables the entire current Internet and private networks characteristics
    to remain intact. These proposed interim facilities would afford IPv6 more time
    to orderly reach the maturity and the availability levels required for delivering
    a long-term general service.</p>"
