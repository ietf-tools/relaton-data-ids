abstract:
- content: "<p>Some recent use cases seem to have a need for carrying IDs within packets.
    Two examples are _I-D.draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id_ and _I-D.draft-li-6man-topology-id_.
    While they might perfectly make sense on their own, each document requires IANA
    to allocate a new code point for a new option, which could quickly exhaust the
    allocation space if similar designs are proposed in the future. As an example,
    one might need an 8-bit ID, while another one might need a 24-bit, 32-bit, or
    64-bit ID. Or, even worse, one might need a 32-bit ID in a specific context, while
    someone else might also need a 32-bit ID in another context. Therefore, allocating
    a new code point for each similar option is probably not the way to go.</p>"
