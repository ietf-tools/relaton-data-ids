abstract:
- content: "<p>(Editorial note: to be updated as the text in the main body of the
    document is finalised) This document is intended to inform the community about
    the impact of the deployment of the proposed Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) standard
    that encrypts Server Name Indication (SNI) and other data. Data encapsulated by
    ECH (ie data included in the encrypted ClientHelloInner) is of legitimate interest
    to on-path security actors including those providing inline malware detection,
    parental controls, content filtering to prevent access to malware and other risky
    traffic, mandatory security controls etc. The document includes observations on
    current use cases for SNI data in a variety of contexts. It highlights how the
    use of that data is important to the operators of both public and private networks
    and shows how the loss of access to SNI data will cause difficulties in the provision
    of a range of services to end-users, including the potential weakening of cybersecurity
    defences. Some mitigations are identified that may be useful for inclusion by
    those considering the adoption of support for ECH in their software.</p>"
