abstract:
- content: "<p>Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing
    additional information existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses, or
    by adding fields to the packets. The intent is to facilitate enhanced routing
    decisions based on these additional semantics to provide differentiated paths
    for different packet flows distinct from simple shortest path first routing. The
    process is known as Semantic Routing. This document provides a brief introduction
    to Semantic Routing.</p>"
