abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider tunnel
    for MVPN/GTM [RFC6514] [RFC7716] or EVPN BUM [RFC7432]. It is possible that not
    all routers in the provider network support BIER and there are various methods
    to handle BIER incapable transit routers. However the MVPN/EVPN PEs are assumed
    to be BIER capable - they are BFIRs/BFERs. This document specifies a method to
    allow BIER incapable routers to act as MVPN/EVPN PEs with BIER as the transport,
    by having the upstream BFR (connected directly or indirectly via a tunnel) of
    a PE remove the BIER header and send the payload to the PE.</p>"
