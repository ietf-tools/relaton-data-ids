abstract:
- content: "<p>The MITRE Corporation released a open source Instant Messaging system
    in March of 2000 called Simple Instant Messaging and Presence Service. This document
    describes an update to the protocol used by that system. In this version of the
    protocol, messages can be digitally signed. While the system does not meet many
    of the requirements of the IMPP working group, it is provided as background information
    on existing Instant Messaging implementations.</p>"
