abstract:
- content: "<p>In the public key infrastructures (PKIs), root certifcation authority
    (CA) certificate rekeying is crucial to guarantee business continuity. Two approaches
    are given in [RFC4210] for entities which are belonging to different generations
    to verify each other's certificate chain. However, these approaches rely on the
    assumption that the old entities can be updated. In this draft, we propose a one-way
    link certificate based solution such that old entities are transparent to root
    CA certificate rekeying. Namely, during the overlapping lifetime of two root CA
    certificates, without any update in old entities, old and new entities can verify
    each other's certificate chain smoothly. Furthermore, the proposed solution works
    in both traditional PKIs, and post-quantum (PQ) PKIs, where the cerficate can
    be pure PQ ones or hybrid ones.</p>"
