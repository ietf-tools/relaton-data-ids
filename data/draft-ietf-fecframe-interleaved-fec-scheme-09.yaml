abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new RTP payload format for the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source
    media encapsulated in RTP. The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code,
    where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and
    sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source symbols.
    The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet
    losses at a cost of reasonable complexity. The new payload format defined in this
    document should only be used (with some exceptions) as a part of the Digital Video
    Broadcasting-IPTV (DVB- IPTV) Application-layer FEC specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
