abstract:
- content: "<p>Many of the post quantum cryptographic algorithms have large public
    keys. In the interest of reducing bandwidth of transitting X.509 certificates,
    this document defines new public key and algorithms for referencing external public
    key data by hash, and location, for example URL. This mechanism is designed to
    mimic the behaviour of an Authority Information Access extension.</p>"
