abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a new agent collaboration protocol, named the Internet
    of Agents Protocol (IoA Protocol), to support distributed, heterogeneous agent
    collaboration in intelligent systems. The IoA Protocol enables dynamic team formation,
    adaptive task coordination, and structured communication among agents with diverse
    architectures, tools, and knowledge sources. Through a layered architecture and
    extensible message format, it supports decentralized deployment across devices
    and can interoperate with existing frameworks. The protocol is particularly suited
    to emerging 6G application scenarios such as intelligent transportation, smart
    healthcare, and large-scale humanâ€“AI teaming.</p>"
