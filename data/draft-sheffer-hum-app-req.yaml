abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF has been having virtual meetings for a long time. Until recently
    these have been interim meetings, and following the all- virtual IETF-107 we expect
    to see more and more WG meetings take the virtual route. A common practice at
    the IETF is to use room "humming" to gauge working group consensus, though the
    final consensus is determined by the working group chairs and typically requires
    a mailing list poll as well. We do not have a technique equivalent to the hum
    for virtual meetings, and arguably this reduces the effectiveness of these meetings.
    This document defines the requirements from a web application whose goal is to
    most faithfully replicate the "feel" of hums, through the use of a traditional
    web user interface.</p>
