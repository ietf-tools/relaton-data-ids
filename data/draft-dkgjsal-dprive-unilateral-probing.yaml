abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft sets out steps that DNS servers (recursive resolvers and
    authoritative servers) can take unilaterally (without any coordination with other
    peers) to defend DNS query privacy against a passive network monitor. The steps
    in this draft can be defeated by an active attacker, but should be simpler and
    less risky to deploy than more powerful defenses. The draft also introduces (but
    does not try to specify) the semantics of signalling that would permit defense
    against an active attacker. The goal of this draft is to simplify and speed deployment
    of opportunistic encrypted transport in the recursive-to-authoritative hop of
    the DNS ecosystem. With wider easy deployment of the underlying transport on an
    opportunistic basis, we hope to facilitate the future specification of stronger
    cryptographic protections against more powerful attacks.</p>"
