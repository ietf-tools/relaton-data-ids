abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2132 defines the DHCP for IPv4 options 1 to 127 as the DHCP public
    option space which is managed by IANA as documented in RFC 2939. As this public
    option space has few unassigned options at this time, it is prudent to define
    a mechanism to extend this option space before it is too late. This Internet-Draft
    proposes several means to extend this option space.</p>"
