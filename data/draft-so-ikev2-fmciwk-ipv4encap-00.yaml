abstract:
- content: "<p>IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many standardized
    network solutions to provide the secure transport between network elements over
    third party's infrastructure. For example, the emerging Fixed Mobile Convergence
    (FMC) network solution that involves Femtocell deployment requires the mobile
    operator's Femtocell AP to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to support mutual authentication
    and remote IP address configuration as well as other auto configuration support
    over the broadband fixed network (BBF) of which the mobile and fixed networks
    may be operated by two different operators. Most of today broadband fixed networks
    are still relying on the IPv4 private addressing plan to support its attached
    devices including the mobile operator's Femtocell AP. Hence, the private IPv4
    addressing and Network Address and Port Translation (NA(P)T) support mostly likely
    stays for many years to come. In FMC interworking scenario, there is a need for
    the mobile network to pass on it mobile subscribers' policies to the broadband
    fixed network (BBF) to maintain the service level agreement (SLA) and to support
    remote network management. In addition, a broadband fixed network (BBF) may partnership
    with more than one mobile operator. Therefore it is important for the BBF and
    the mobile network to be able to overcome the limitation of the private IPv4 addressing
    and to be able to identify the user's subscription as well as to determine the
    location of the Femtocell AP that serves its mobile user over the BBF network.
    This document presents the problems for the IPSec tunneling support with private
    IPv4 addressing for FMC interworking and proposes a simple extension to the IKEv2
    to resolve the issues.</p>"
