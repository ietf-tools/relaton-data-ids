abstract:
- content: "<p>GPE-VPN is an architecture for programmable SD-WAN solutions that leverages
    the Generic Protocol Encapsulation (GPE) overlay. GPE-VPN uses an extended LISP-based
    map-assisted control plane to dynamically lookup forwarding policies on demand.
    A northbound programmable mapping system is used to store and retrieve mappings
    and forwarding policies. The GPE-VPN data plane is secured with IPsec based encryption.
    Overlay tunnels, as well as cryptographic parameters, are provisioned on demand.</p>"
