abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Virtual Router (VR) model of Provider Provisioned VPNs multiple
    VRs may be connected using tunnels over an existing IP network, such as IPSec
    or MPLS based tunnels. In the VR model these tunnels often run routing protocols
    such as RIP or OSPF in order to distribute route reachability information. This
    memo presents methods for assigning a meaningful metric to these tunnel links
    that can be used by such routing protocols.</p>"
