abstract:
- content: <p>A BoF, identified as RFC++ and focused on possible changes to the identification
    of a broad range of documents and sources with the term "RFC", has been scheduled
    for IETF 102 and extensively discussed on an associated mailing list. At least
    based on the BoF proposal, the BoF was expected to accept a particular problem
    description as both adequate and sufficiently important to justify changes and
    then to consider one particular proposal. Mailing list discussions have indicated
    that neither the problem statement nor the proposal are without controversy. An
    Internet Draft has been posted that describes that particular proposal in more
    detail. Without significant analysis of the problem statement, this draft mentions
    that proposal as a possible member of a family of similar proposals and then outlines
    some other families of proposals for the convenience of BoF participants and the
    community more generally.</p>
