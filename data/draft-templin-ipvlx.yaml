abstract:
- content: '<p>The IETF has embraced IPv6 as the next-generation Internet protocol,
    but global IPv4 deployment continues in private addressing domains behind Network
    Address Translators (NATs). This document envisions a long-term IPv6/IPv4 coexistence,
    with IPv6 addresses serving as identifiers (and sometimes also locators) and IPv4
    addresses serving as locators (and sometimes also identifiers). This document
    proposes an architectural framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence called: "IPvLX (IP
    with virtual Link Extension)".</p>'
