abstract:
- content: "<p>In SFC-enabled domain, failures can occur at Service Function(SF).
    If the failed node is on the path where a packet is delivered, packet cannot be
    sent to destination and such situation should be avoided. Currently, there are
    many ways to provide redundancy of SFs, such as VRRP. However, legacy redundancy
    method may not be used in SFC as Service Function Forwarders(SFFs) do not use
    IP or MAC address in their FIBs. In SFC, traffic is steered based on Service Function
    Path ID and Service Index. Therefore controller, which is responsible for a control
    plane function in SFC, can manage path of SFC. In this document, we illustrate
    failover method specifically for SFC which uses SFC encapsulation. We describe
    bypass mechanism to avoid failures in SFs and redirect traffic to backup SFs.
    For bypass mechanism, we propose SF classification of 1)mandatory SFs that function
    indispensible for packet delivery, such as NAT and 2)optional SFs that a packet
    can be delivered without them, such as Firewall and IDS.</p>"
