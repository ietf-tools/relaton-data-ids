abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes EAP-MAKE protocol, an authentication protocol based
    on EAP which emphasizes on simplicity and scalability. Authentication is provided
    through a mechanism derived from the Diffie-Hellman scheme, and it is possible
    to derive and check a common symmetric key for the purpose of privacy. Scalability
    is provided by the underlying support of legacy PKI systems.</p>"
