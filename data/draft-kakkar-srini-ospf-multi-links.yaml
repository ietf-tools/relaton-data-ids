abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a link state IGP routing protocol, but it does not utilizes
    multiple links between adjacent routers efficiently. This Memo tries to utilize
    multiple links between adjacent routers to make initial adjacency establishment
    &amp; flooding more optimized, such that these procedures become faster and consumes
    lesser bandwidth.</p>"
