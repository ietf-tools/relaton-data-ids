abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new functionality for negotiating the security
    mechanisms used between a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agent and its
    next-hop SIP entity. This new functionality supplements the existing methods of
    choosing security mechanisms between SIP entities. Note that this internet-draft
    is simply a clean RFC 3329 in I-D format, and doesn't yet contain any changes
    compared to the original.</p>"
