abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks supporting IPv6 the Internet Control Message Protocol version
    6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of functions, and a correspondingly
    large number of message types and options. A number of security risks are associated
    with uncontrolled forwarding of ICMPv6 messages. On the other hand, compared with
    IPv4 and the corresponding protocol ICMP, ICMPv6 is essential to the functioning
    of IPv6 rather than a useful auxiliary. This document provides some recommendations
    for ICMPv6 firewall filter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6
    messages that are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop messages
    which are potential security risks.</p>"
