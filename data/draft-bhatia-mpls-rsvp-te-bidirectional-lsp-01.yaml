abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several applications that require symmetric Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) path between two points. This cannot be achieved with regular
    MPLS as the LSPs are unidirectional. If symmetry is required, a separate LSP in
    each direction is required for bidirectional traffic flow. Generalized MPLS on
    the other hand, has provisions for setting up a bidirectional LSP. This document
    uses the extensions introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regular MPLS for establishing
    bidirectional LSPs. Additionally, it also describes how bi-directional symmetrical
    Fast Reroute using both one- to-one and facility backup can be achieved.</p>"
