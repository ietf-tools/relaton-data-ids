abstract:
- content: "<p>Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertise
    multiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides a number of potential
    benefits, including reduced routing churn, faster convergence and better loadsharing.
    This document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Paths so that network
    operators have the tools needed to address their specific applications and to
    manage the scalability impact of Add- Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may
    learn many paths for a prefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers.
    This document analyses different algorithms for making this selection and provides
    recommendations based on the target application.</p>"
