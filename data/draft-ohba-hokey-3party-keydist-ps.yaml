abstract:
- content: <p>The HOKEY WG is developing solutions for optimizations as well as security
    key hierarchy specifications for handovers. The key derivation specifications
    all draw from a trust relationship that is created as a result of a "2-party"
    EAP authentication between a peer and a backend server, while distributing the
    resulting keys to third parties other than the peer and the backend server. This
    document describes problem statement and requirements on a three-party key distribution
    protocol for handover keyings.</p>
