abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has maintained a three-stage standards track for some time,
    with basic mechanics set out in RFC 2026 [RFC2026]. The mechanics as described,
    however, are not currently used in practice and advancement along the standards
    track is both unusual and more difficult than many IETF participants find reasonable.
    This document proposes an update to those mechanics, in the interest of improving
    the overall functioning of the IETF. It is compatible with, but does not require,
    a move to a two-stage standards track.</p>"
