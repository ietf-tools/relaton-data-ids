abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKE2) can operate either
    over unreliable (UDP) transport or over reliable (TCP) transport. If TCP is used,
    then IPsec tunnels created by IKEv2 also use TCP. This document specifies how
    to decouple IKEv2 and IPsec transports, so that IKEv2 can operate over TCP, while
    IPsec tunnels use unreliable transport. This feature allows IKEv2 to effectively
    exchange large blobs of data (e.g. when post-quantum algorithms are employed)
    while avoiding performance problems which arise when TCP is used for IPsec.</p>"
