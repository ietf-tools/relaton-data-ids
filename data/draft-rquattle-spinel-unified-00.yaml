abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Spinel protocol, which facilitates the
    control and management of IPv6 network interfaces on devices where general purpose
    application processors offload network functions at their interfaces to network
    co-processors (NCP) connected by simple communication links like serial data channels.
    While initially developed to support Thread(R), Spinel's layered design allows
    it to be easily adapted to other similar network technologies. This document also
    describes various Spinel specializations, including support for the Thread(R)
    low-power mesh network technology.</p>"
