abstract:
- content: "<p>When BGP is used to distribute a particular route, it can also be used
    to distribute an MPLS label which is mapped to that route. In some cases, for
    example, when L3VPN is used to access and connect to virtual networks in data
    centers, there may be 16 millions of VPN instances on a router. In order to map
    MPLS labels to VPN instances, big labels are required. This document specifies
    the method to carry and distribute such big labels by piggybacking the big label
    mapping information for an IP route in the BGP Update message that is used to
    distribute the route itself.</p>"
