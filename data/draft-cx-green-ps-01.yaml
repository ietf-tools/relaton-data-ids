abstract:
- content: <p>Reducing technology's carbon footprint is one of the big challenges
    of our age. Networks are an enabler of applications that reduce this footprint,
    but also contribute to this footprint substantially themselves. The biggest opportunities
    to reduce the energy footprint may not be networking specific, for instance general
    power efficiency gains in hardware or hosting of equipment in more cooling-efficient
    buildings. Yet methods to make networking technology itself "greener" also need
    to be explored. This document outlines a corresponding set of opportunities, along
    with associated research challenges, for reducing this footprint and reducing
    network energy demand.</p>
