abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a possible process to address the structural
    problems identified in the IETF Problem Statement as requested in Version 02 of
    the IETF Problem Resolution draft. The process proposes that the IESG delegate
    responsibility for coordinating, moderating and synthesising proposals for solutions
    to parts of the structural problems to a Synthsis and Action Panel (SAP) selected
    through a variant of the nomcom selection process. The SAP should, if possible,
    deliver an integrated set of proposals for changes derived from community input,
    both unsolicited and, if necessary, solicited. The SAP would act as a moderator
    between authors of alternative propoasals in attempting to achieve a proposal
    on which the community could agree. The agreed plan be would be delivered to the
    IESG for final approval and action.</p>"
