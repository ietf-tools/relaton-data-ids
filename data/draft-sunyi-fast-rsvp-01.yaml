abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP [1] is designed as a signaling protocol that provides end-to-end
    QoS guarantee for real-time services in the fixed hardwired network. However,
    when used in the mobile environment, the protocol doesn't work well due to the
    mobility of the endpoints. Immediately after a handover occurs, because of the
    lack of resource reservation in the handoff target subnet, QoS of the session
    degrades notably. Another problem is that when route optimization is implemented,the
    protocol will be invalidated due to certain features of the route optimization
    mechanism. This document proposes extensions to RSVP. The extensions enable RSVP
    to operate in the mobile IPv6 network while providing advanced resource reservation
    before handover and resource reservation on the optimized route after handover.
    With these features, QoS of the sessions can be guaranteed and the utilization
    of network resources can be enhanced resulting in the improvement of overall network
    performance.</p>"
