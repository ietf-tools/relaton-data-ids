abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for delivering authenticated telephone
    call identity information using the VESPER framework in environments where SIP
    signaling is unavailable or unsuitable. By supporting an out-of-band (OOB) transport
    model, this approach enables entities to publish and retrieve signed PASSporT
    assertions independent of end-to-end delivery within SIP-based VoIP networks.
    These PASSporTs are signed with delegate certificates that were authorized for
    issuance by corresponding authority tokens, which represent the trust and validation
    of telephone number control and related claim information. Transparency features
    ensure that these authorizations are publicly auditable and cryptographically
    provable, supporting a higher standard of trust. This document also introduces
    support for Connected Identity to the STIR OOB model, enabling the called party
    to respond with a signed PASSporT asserting its identity, thereby binding the
    identities of both parties to the transaction and enhancing end-to-end accountability.
    The OOB mechanism serves as an alternative delivery path for PASSporTs in cases
    where end-to-end in-band SIP delivery is not possible, enabling verifiers to confirm
    the association between the originating telephone number and the identity asserting
    authority as part of the broader VESPER trust framework.</p>"
