abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provide a mobile
    node(MN) which requires no additional modification to MN with IP mobility. Fast
    Handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FHPMIPv6), specified in[RFC5949], proposed two
    modes of fast handover, both of them use single interface to transmate packets
    during handover, which requires it to buffer packets in MAGs when interface performs
    handover. Buffer packets in MAGs result in additional overhead, and increase packets
    transmission delay. Unlike FHPMIPv6, this document proposed a seamless handover
    scheme for multi-access mobile node with IP mobility when one of MN's network
    interface performs handover from one MAG to another. This scheme uses some other
    interface of the multi-access mobile node to help process packets while handovering.</p>"
