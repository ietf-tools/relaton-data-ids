abstract:
- content: "<p>Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in the last
    ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6 transition issues
    become more critical and complicated. Host-based transition mechanisms are not
    able to meet the requirements while most end users are not sufficiently expert
    to configure or maintain these transition mechanisms. Carrier Grade NAT with integrated
    transition mechanisms can simplify the operation of end users during the IPv4/IPv6
    migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental Carrier-Grade
    NAT (CGN) solution for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for
    IPv6-enabled end hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 end hosts while remaining
    most of legacy IPv4 ISP networks unchanged. It is suitable for the initial stage
    of IPv4/IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, it also supports and encourages transition
    towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks.</p>"
