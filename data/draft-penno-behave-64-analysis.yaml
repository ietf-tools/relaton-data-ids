abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to specific problems, NAT-PT was deprecated by the IETF as a mechanism
    to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation. Since then, new efforts have been undertaken
    within IETF to standardize alternative mechanisms to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.
    This document evaluates how the new translation mechanisms avoid the problems
    that caused the IETF to deprecate NAT-PT.</p>"
