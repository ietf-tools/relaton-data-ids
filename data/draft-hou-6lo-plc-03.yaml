abstract:
- content: "<p>Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines
    for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support Advanced
    Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially the smart meters for electricity. The
    inherent advantage of existing electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion
    of PLC deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices raises
    the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications. As part of this technology,
    Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) is focused on the low- bandwidth and low-power scenarios
    that includes current standards such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.2 and IEEE 1901.2a.
    This document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained PLC
    networks.</p>"
