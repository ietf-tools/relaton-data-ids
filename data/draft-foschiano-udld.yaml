abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Cisco Systems protocol that can be used to
    detect and disable unidirectional Ethernet fiber or copper links caused, for instance,
    by mis-wiring of fiber strands, interface malfunctions, media converters' faults,
    etc. It operates at Layer 2 in conjunction with IEEE 802.3's existing Layer 1
    fault detection mechanisms. This document explains the protocol objectives and
    applications, illustrates the specific premises the protocol was based upon, and
    describes the protocol architecture and related deployment issues to serve as
    a possible base for future standardization. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
