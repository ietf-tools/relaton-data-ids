abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies an experimental extension to MLDv2 that enables
    the protocol to operate over unidirectional links. Protection against Denial of
    service attacks is provided by a simple cookie mechanism. This extension is intended
    for mobile hosts which use a unidirectional link technology to receive multicast
    data and need to frequently change their unidirectional point of attachment to
    the network.</p>"
