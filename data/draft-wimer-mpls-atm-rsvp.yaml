abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Architecture [MPLS-ARCH] discusses a way in which ATM switches
    may be used as Label Switching Routers. The ATM switches run network layer routing
    algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and their data forwarding is based on
    the results of these routing algorithms. Additional ATM-specific routing and addressing
    is optional but not required. ATM switches used in this way are known as ATM-LSRs.</p>"
