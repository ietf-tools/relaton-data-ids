abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses SNMP security protocols insofar as it presents
    a threat analysis and enumeration of goals. However, its main purpose is to discuss
    two SNMP security algorithms. First, under the rubric ``Understanding SNMP Security,''
    it describes the design of the algorithms with an emphasis on how their various
    mechanisms collectively realize the design goals and constraints; second, under
    the rubric ``Using SNMP Security,'' it also describes how SNMP security services
    are best exploited to realize effective, secure network management in a variety
    of configurations and environments.</p>"
