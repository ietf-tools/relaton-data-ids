abstract:
- content: "<p>Future networks that support advanced services, such as those enabled
    by 5G mobile networks, envisions a set of overlay networks each with different
    performance and scaling properties. These overlays are known as network slices
    and are realized over a common underlay network. In order to support network slicing,
    as well as to offer enhanced VPN services in general, it is necessary to define
    a mechanism by which specific resources (links and/or nodes) of an underlay network
    can be used by a specific network slice, VPN, or set of VPNs. This document sets
    out such a mechanism for use in Segment Routing networks.</p>"
