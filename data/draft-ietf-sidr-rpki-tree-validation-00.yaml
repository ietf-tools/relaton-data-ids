abstract:
- content: "<p>This document currently describes the approach to validate the content
    of the RPKI certificate tree, as used by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator. This approach
    is independent of a particular object retrieval mechanism. This allows it to be
    used with repositories available over the rsync protocol, the RPKI Repository
    Delta Protocol, and repositories that use a mix of both. This algorithm does not
    rely on content of repository directories, but uses the Authority Key Identifier
    (AKI) field of a manifest and a certificate revocation list (CRL) objects to discover
    manifest and CRL objects issued by a particular Certificate Authority (CA). It
    further uses the hashes of manifest entries to discover other objects issued by
    the CA. If the working group finds that algorithm outlined here is useful for
    other implementations, we may either update future revisions of this document
    to be less specific to the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator implementation, or we may use
    this document as a starting point of a generic validation document and keep this
    as a detailed description of the actual RIPE NCC RPKI Validator implementation.</p>"
