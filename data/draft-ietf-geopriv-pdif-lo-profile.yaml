abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification
    provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information. There
    are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained
    in how it is represented. In these circumstances, the range of options that need
    to be implemented are reduced. There is growing interest in being able to use
    location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications. To allow
    successful interoperability between applications, location information needs to
    be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in RFC 4119
    (PIDF-LO). This document makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent,
    and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO. It further recommends a subset of Geography
    Markup Language (GML) 3.1.1 that is mandatory to implement by applications involved
    in location-based routing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
