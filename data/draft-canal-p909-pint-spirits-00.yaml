abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to provide input to the IETF SPIRITS Working
    Group(SPIRITS WG) and to the IETF PINT Working Group (PINT WG) from the viewpoint
    of European network operators that are involved in EURESCOM P909 Project 'Enabling
    Technologies for IN Evolution and IN-Internet Integration'. The input is based
    on current results that were achieved in the project. As the project title says
    P909 project deals with IN-Internet integration issues. The project has defined
    an architecture for IN-Internet inte gration and it has selected and described
    some IN-Internet services which can be interesting from the business perspective
    and challenging from the technical perspective. Some of these services are 'officially'
    chartered in IETF: ICW in SPIRITS, Click-to-Dial (Request to Call) as well as
    proposed Conference Service in PINT. However, there are additional IN-Internet
    convergence services that P909 studies and that are included in this document
    only as examples.</p>"
