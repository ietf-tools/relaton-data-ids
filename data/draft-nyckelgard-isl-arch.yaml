abstract:
- content: "<p>As more and more wireless devices interact with IP networks, location
    becomes an important parameter in providing and accessing services. This draft
    strives to provide an architecture to answer the following questions: 1) How can
    a terminal obtain its coordinates? 2) Where should a terminal store or register
    its coordinates? 3) How can a called party obtain the calling party's coordinates?
    4) How can a terminal 'advertise' its location information</p>"
