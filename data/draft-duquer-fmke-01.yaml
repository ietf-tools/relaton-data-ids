abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new group key management protocol called FMKE
    (Flat Multicast Key Exchange), derived from the Group Domain of Interpretation
    (GDOI) [RFC3547]. Like the GDOI, its objective is to Manage securely group Security
    Associations (SA), i.e. establish and update SAs in Group members. These security
    associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys,
    or data shared by group members. This protocol is based on a centralized management,
    achieved by the GCKS (Group Controller and Key Server). It is destined to be used
    by Data Security protocols such as the IPSEC ESP protocol. The FMKE protocol is
    destined to provide an optimized solution for very large groups with direct connections
    such as in satellite systems, or wireless systems such as WIFI. It can be considered
    as a GDOI use case adapted for satellite networks.</p>"
