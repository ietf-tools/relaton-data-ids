abstract:
- content: "<p>The current RSVP-TE specification, 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for
    LSP Tunnels' (RFC 3209) and GMPLS extensions to RSVP-TE, 'Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) Extensions' (RFC 3473) allow abstract nodes and resources to be explicitly
    included in a path setup, but not to be explicitly excluded. In some systems where
    precise explicit paths are not computed at the head end it may be useful to specify
    and signal abstract nodes and resources that are to be explicitly excluded from
    routes. These exclusions may apply to the whole of a path, or to parts of a path
    between two abstract nodes specified in an explicit route. Shared Risk Link Groups
    (SRLGs) allow the definition of resources or groups of resources that share the
    same risk of failure. The knowledge of SRLGs may be used to compute diverse paths
    that can be used for protection. In systems where it is useful to signal exclusions,
    it may be useful to signal SRLGs to indicate groups of resources that should be
    excluded on the whole of a path or between two abstract nodes specified in an
    explicit path. This document specifies ways to communicate route exclusions during
    path setup using RSVP-TE.</p>"
