abstract:
- content: "<p>In order for the local mobility anchor to receive and forward uplink
    traffic for a mobile node, Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol mandates the LMA to
    have an active BCE with a registered proxy CoA that is the other end of the tunnel
    between the LMA and MAG. In some systems and during active inter-MAG handoff with
    traffic that is sensitive to delay and packet loss, the LMA is required to forward
    uplink traffic for the mobile node from the target MAG without completely switching
    the tunnel from the source MAG. This document specifies a mechanism which allows
    the target MAG to perform transient registration for a new proxy CoA and the LMA
    to create a transient BCE for the same mobile node for a specified period of time
    while maintaining the original mobile node's BCE which reference the old pCoA
    at the source MAG.</p>"
