abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the KeyState EDNS(0) option code, to enable
    the exchange of SIG(0) key state information between DNS entities via the DNS
    protocol. The KeyState option allows DNS clients and servers to include key state
    data in both queries and responses, facilitating mutual awareness of SIG(0) key
    status between child and parent zones. This mechanism addresses the challenges
    of maintaining synchronization of SIG(0) keys used for securing DNS UPDATE messages,
    thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of DNS operations that require
    coordinated key management. This document proposes such a mechanism. TO BE REMOVED:
    This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-opt-transaction-state
    (https://github.com/johanix/draft-berra-dnsop-transaction-state-00). The most
    recent working version of the document, open issues, etc, should all be available
    there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>"
