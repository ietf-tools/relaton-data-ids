abstract:
- content: "<p>Current IEEE 802.1 LANs use spanning tree protocols that have a number
    of challenges. These protocols need to strictly avoid loops, even temporary ones,
    during route propagation, because of the lack of header loop detection support.
    Routing tends not to take full advantage of alternate paths, or even non-overlapping
    pairwise paths (in the case of spanning trees). This document addresses these
    concerns and suggests applying modern network-layer routing protocols at the link
    layer. This document assumes that solutions would not address issues of scalability
    beyond that of existing IEEE 802.1 bridged links, but that a solution would be
    backward compatible with 802.1, including hubs, bridges, and their existing plug-and-play
    capabilities. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
