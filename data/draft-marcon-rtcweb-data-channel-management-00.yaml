abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers. For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the
    concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP. How to transport application
    messages on these data channels seems straightforward (i.e. they can be carried
    as SCTP user messages), however it is yet to be decided how to establish and manage
    these data channels. This document specifies a method for this, which relies first
    on a lightweight and scalable out-of-band negotiation of data channel configurations
    (within the SDP offer/ answer exchange) and second on the signaling of the configuration
    in use in the SCTP user message itself. Once these configurations are negotiated,
    further creations of data channels can occur purely in- band by simply sending
    user messages, which avoids to define a new in-band data channel protocol.</p>"
