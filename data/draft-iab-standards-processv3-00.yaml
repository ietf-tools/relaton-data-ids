abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a revision of RFC 1602, which defines the official
    procedures for creating and documenting Internet Standards. Changes from RFC 1602
    are marked by change bars ( | ) in the right margin. This revision (revision 3.1)
    includes changes made primarily in response to a preliminary legal review of the
    written procedures of the Internet standards process by Internet Society counsel.
    The conclusions of the legal review may be summarized briefly as follows: 'Based
    on the principles found in the case law and enforcement agency pronouncements,
    a good standard setting program should have at a minimum the following characteristics:
    (1) openness in participation; (2) careful and thorough record keeping throughout
    the various stages of setting the standard; (3) timely and adequate notice of
    both the initiation and development of a standard; (4) careful consideration of,
    and response to, all the views and objections of interested persons; and (5) a
    meaningful appeals process.'</p>"
