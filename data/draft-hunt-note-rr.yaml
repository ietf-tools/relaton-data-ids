abstract:
- content: <p>While the DNS zone master file format has always allowed comments, there
    is no existing mechanism to preserve comments once the zone has been loaded into
    memory or converted to a binary representation. This note proposes a new RR type
    "NOTE", to be allocated from the Covert-RR type range proposed in [I-D.krecicki-dns-covert],
    so that confidential comments can be stored alongside zone data, and included
    in zone transfers when Covert semantics are supported by the secondary.</p>
