abstract:
- content: "<p>LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion
    on referral. The integration between such a client and an Index Mesh, as defined
    by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends on referrals and therefore needs
    to be handled in a special way. This document defines one possible way of doing
    this. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
