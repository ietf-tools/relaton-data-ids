abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless
    network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other
    standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the
    wireless medium, in particular intermittently lossy connectivity. This document
    defines a network control loop that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum
    and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties, typically reliability
    and latency. The loop involves OAM, PCE, and PREOF extensions, and a new Controller
    plane Function called the Path Selection Engine, that dynamically selects the
    DetNet path for the next packets to route around local failures.</p>"
