abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a straightforward address autoconfiguration
    mechanism for RPL over low power and lossy networks (LLN). A solution is proposed
    to add the capability of reusable address allocation. In this solution, nodes
    are assigned with unique IPv6 addresses according to their positions in the network.
    The amount of routing entries kept at each node is reduced. Also, this document
    introduces a dynamic adjustment strategy for adapting to uneven distribution of
    node density.</p>"
