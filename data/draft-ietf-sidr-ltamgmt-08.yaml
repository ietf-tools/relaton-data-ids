abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) to
    manage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI). It is common in RP software (not just in the RPKI) to allow an RP to import
    TA material in the form of self-signed certificates. However, this approach to
    incorporating TAs is potentially dangerous. (These self-signed certificates rarely
    incorporate any extensions that impose constraints on the scope of the imported
    public keys, and the RP is not able to impose such constraints.) The facility
    described in this document allows an RP to impose constraints on such TAs. Because
    this mechanism is designed to operate in the RPKI context, the most important
    constraints are the Internet Number Resources (INRs) expressed via RFC 3779 extensions.
    These extentions bind address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS) numbers to
    entities. The primary motivation for the facility described in this document is
    to enable an RP to ensure that INR information that it has acquired via some trusted
    channel is not overridden by the information acquired from the RPKI repository
    system or by the putative TAs that the RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism
    allows an RP to specify a set of overriding bindings between public key identifiers
    and INR data. These bindings take precedence over any conflicting bindings acquired
    by the putative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the RPKI repository system.
    This mechanism is designed for local use by an RP, but any entity that is accorded
    administrative control over a set of RPs may use this mechanism to convey its
    view of the RPKI to RPs within its jurisdiction. The means by which this latter
    use case is effected is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
