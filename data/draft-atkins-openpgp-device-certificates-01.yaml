abstract:
- content: "<p>The OpenPGP Message Formats defined in RFC 4880 specify packet formats
    and methods for combining those packets to form messages and certificates. However
    RFC 4880 made an architectural decision that keys are owned by users and must
    be self-certified. New use cases have emerged where that is not the case. There
    is a desire to have certificates that are not tied to a user (e.g. device certificates)
    and may only have encryption keys so may not even be self certifiable. This draft
    specifies extensions to (and updates) RFC 4880 that loosen the definitions of
    certificates in order to enable userless certificates without self-certifications.</p>"
