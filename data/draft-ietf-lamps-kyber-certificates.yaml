abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding format
    for the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's Post Quantum
    Cryptography Key Encapsulation Mechanism algorithms. The algorithms covered are
    Kyber TBD1. The encoding for public key and private key is also provided. [EDNOTE:
    This draft is not expected to be finalized before the NIST PQC Project has standardized
    PQ algorithms. After NIST has standardized its first algorithms, this document
    will replace TBD, with the appropriate algorithms and parameters before proceeding
    to ratification. The algorithm Kyber TBD1 has been added as an example in this
    draft, to provide a more detailed illustration of the content - it by no means
    indicates its inclusion in the final version. This specification will use object
    identifiers for the new algorithms that are assigned by NIST, and will use placeholders
    until these are released.]</p>"
