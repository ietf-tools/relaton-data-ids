abstract:
- content: "<p>The emergence of transparent optical switches, together with a movement
    towards more dynamic, multi-vendor networks, has introduced a need for information
    sharing between optical line systems and client devices. The information that
    needs to be shared includes link status and link properties. We call this interface
    the Optical Link Interface (OLI). In this document, we provide high-level requirements
    for the OLI.</p>"
