abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) that addresses
    the needs of an Integrated Communications Network (ICN) for remote and automatic
    service turn-up and for the simplification of monitoring and fault management
    across multiple network elements within the Loop Access environment and within
    the Customer Premises Environment (CPE) environment. OPS extends the standard
    Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB) by
    defining voice/data integration and flow-through provisioning capabilities for
    the various devices within the ICN, such as Integrated Access Devices (IADs).
    OPS enables Carriers or Service Providers to control their Integrated Access Services
    (IAS) from the network management system in the Network Operation Center (NOC).
    Flow-through provisioning allows administrators to send provisioning commands
    to multiple network elements across the ICN. The provisioning commands are used
    to define or modify a customer's services and to turn those services on and off.
    Similarly, customer-initiated service requests as well as performance and fault
    management information for existing services can flow back to the carrier or service
    provider.</p>"
