abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper Builds upon existing works and 'Works in Progress' that
    provides the foundation bases for the expansion of the 'CIDR' Architecture, and
    the Definition for CIDR and the Network Descriptor'. However, this work should
    only be considered an extension, hence, the Obsolescence of RFC's 1517, 1518,
    and 1519, because the Hardware and Software specifications has been implemented,
    and this work only extends the foundation they jointly established.</p>"
