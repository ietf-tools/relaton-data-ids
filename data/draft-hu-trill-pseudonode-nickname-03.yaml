abstract:
- content: "<p>At the edg of TRILL campus, some RBridges provide end-station services
    to their attached end stations; these RBridges are called edge RBridges. To avoid
    potential frame duplication or loops in TRILL campus, only one edge RBridge is
    permitted to provide such services in a VLAN at all times to its attached end
    stations even they are also attached to other edge RBridges. However, in some
    application scenarios, for example in Link Aggregation Group (LAG), more than
    one edge RBridge is required to provide such services to an end station even in
    a VLAN to improve resiliency and maximize the available network bandwidth, which
    causes the flip-flopping of the egress RBridge nickname for such an end station
    in remote RBridges' forwarding tables. In this document, the concept of Virtual
    RBridge, along with its pseudo-nickname, is introduced to address the above problem.</p>"
