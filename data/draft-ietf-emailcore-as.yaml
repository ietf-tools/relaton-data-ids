abstract:
- content: '<p>Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is
    still in very active use. While the basic protocols and formats for mail transport
    and message formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and thinking in
    more recent years have supplemented those core protocols with additional features
    and suggestions for their use. This Applicability Statement describes the relationship
    among many of those protocols and provides guidance and makes recommendations
    for the use of features of the core protocols. Open Issues * #40 - Recommended
    SMTP Extensions (https://github.com/ietf-wg- emailcore/emailcore/issues/40): Is
    the new proposed text regarding DSNs in Section 2.4 satisfactory? * #78 - Advice
    against using URL %-encoding on non-ASCII email addresses (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/
    issues/78): Is the new proposed text in Section 4.2 satisfactory? * #79 - Add
    Internationalization Considerations Section (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/79):
    Are the references in Section 2.4 sufficient? * #84 - Handling of Trace Header
    Fields by MUAs (https://github.com/ ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/84): Is
    the proposed new text in Section 3.3 satisfactory? * #85 - What mail agents should
    do/not do with Received header fields (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/85):
    Is the proposed new text in Section 3.2.2 satisfactory? * #92 - CNAME handling
    in "5.1. Locating the Target Host" (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/92):
    Per IETF 120, Klensin to propose text. * #93 - "7.3. VRFY, EXPN, and Security"
    should point to SMTP AUTH RFC (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/93):
    Per IETF 120, Alexey to propose text or close issue. * #94 - Use of Quoted Strings
    (https://github.com/ietf-wg- emailcore/emailcore/issues/94): John Levine suggests
    we not bother with text regarding quoted strings in email address local-parts.
    Is the proposed new text in Section 3.1 satisfactory? Do we want another/better
    Received header example?</p>'
