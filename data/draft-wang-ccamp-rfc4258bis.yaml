abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocols
    has been defined to control different switching technologies as well as different
    applications. These include support for requesting Time Division Multiplexing
    (TDM) connections including Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital
    Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). Along with the development
    of technology, some new routing requirements which are addressed in G.7715.1 emerge.
    This document concentrates on the new routing requirements addressed in G.7715.1
    and placed on the GMPLS suite of protocols in order to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined
    by the ITU-T.</p>"
