abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes
    that enables SDP to provide a minimal and backwards compatible capability declaration
    mechanism. Such capability declarations can be used as input to a subsequent session
    negotiation, which is done by means outside the scope of this document. This provides
    a simple and limited solution to the general capability negotiation problem being
    addressed by the next generation of SDP, also known as SDPng. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
