abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber security
    information sharing. Using this approach, a CSIRT or other stakeholder may share
    and exchange representations of cyber security incidents, indicators, and other
    related information as Web- addressable resources. The transport protocol binding
    is specified as HTTP(S) with a MIME media type of Atom+XML. An appropriate set
    of link relation types specific to cyber security information sharing is defined.
    The resource representations leverage the existing IODEF [RFC5070] and RID [RFC6545]
    specifications as appropriate. Coexistence with deployments that conform to existing
    specifications including RID [RFC6545] and Transport of Real-time Inter-network
    Defense (RID) Messages over HTTP/TLS [RFC6546] is supported via appropriate use
    of HTTP status codes.</p>"
