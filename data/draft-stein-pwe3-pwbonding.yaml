abstract:
- content: <p>There are times when pseudowires must be transported over physical links
    with limited bandwidth. We shall use the term "bonding" (also variously known
    as inverse multiplexing, link aggregation, trunking, teaming, etc.) to mean an
    efficient mechanism for separating the PW traffic over several links. Unlike load
    balancing and equal cost multipath, bonding makes no assumption that the PW traffic
    can be decomposed into distinguishable flows, and thus bonding requires delay
    compensation and packet reordering. Furthermore, PW bonding can optionally track
    bandwidth constraints in order to minimize packet loss.</p>
