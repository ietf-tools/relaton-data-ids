abstract:
- content: "<p>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 networks securely is
    available, whether the operator is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or an enterprise
    internal network. However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges. RFC 4942
    describes security issues in the protocol, but network managers also need a more
    practical, operations-minded document to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages
    of certain choices. This document analyzes the operational security issues associated
    with several types of networks and proposes technical and procedural mitigation
    techniques. This document is only applicable to managed networks, such as enterprise
    networks, service provider networks, or managed residential networks.</p>"
