abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, there are demands arising for IPv4 address allocation under
    IPv6 environment, especially in IPv6 transition scenarios. This document describes
    the mechanism to survive DHCPv4 over IPv6 network. DHCPv4 messages are transported
    in IPv6 packets when traversing the IPv6 network. DHCPv4 protocol behavior is
    extended to support this IPv6 transport. And for the relay case, a new suboption
    of the Relay Agent Information Option is defined to carry the remote IPv6 address
    of the clients.</p>"
