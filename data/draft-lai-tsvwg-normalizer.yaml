abstract:
- content: "<p>In DiffServ, preferential dropping of packets in AF PHB groups has
    long been considered beneficial, typically for video flows with discardable packets.
    Unfortunately, the ecosystem of bandwidth contention at congestion is very likely
    to discourage those video endpoints from generating packets with lower precedence
    markings, i.e. they would lose more packets if doing so. Thus, to offer an incentive
    for more collaborative and mutually beneficial behaviors of video endpoints in
    AF PHB groups, we propose a Normalization Marker (NM) for traffic conditioning
    at network edges. Deployment of NM will encourage the video endpoints to generate
    finer layers of intra- flow precedence (IFP) with discardable packets in more
    balanced distributions.</p>"
