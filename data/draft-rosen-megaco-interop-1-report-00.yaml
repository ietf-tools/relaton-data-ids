abstract:
- content: "<p>An interoperability test of the Megaco (RFC2885/6) protocol was held
    on August 28-31 in Durham, NH. An excellent turnout of many different independently
    developed implementations were present, and a great many of the tests were quite
    successful, including media flow in many cases, and several cases of testing a
    Media Gateway controller from one organization with two Media Gateways from different
    organizations. The primary purpose of the event was to assess the ability of independent
    development teams to create interoperable devices from the recent Proposed Standard
    RFCs 2885 [1] and 2886 [2]. While several discrepancies were found that resulted
    from differing interpretations of the documents, the level of compatibility exhibited
    at this first test was excellent. A secondary purpose of the event was to begin
    the process of moving the RFCs to draft standard status, which requires documentation
    of at least two implementations of each protocol element/feature. While this first
    event only used a subset of the protocol, quite a few of the elements and features
    were demonstrated by all implementations. This I-D describes the event and summarized
    the results.</p>"
