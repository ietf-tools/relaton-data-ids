abstract:
- content: <p>Some SIP architectures use "application servers", B2BUAs that are inserted
    between two user agents during a conversation, to provide additional processing.
    Since B2BUAs do not follow the rules for SIP proxies, they do not by default interoperate
    with SIP call control operations. Augmenting application servers with suitable
    behaviors for handling SIP call control operations mitigates these problems, and
    in many cases, allows standard user agents to use SIP call control features without
    modification.</p>
