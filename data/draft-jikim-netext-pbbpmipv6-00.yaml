abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an enhanced handover scheme of the Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 (PMIPv6) with partial bicasting in wireless networks. In the proposed PMIPv6
    handover scheme, when a mobile node (MN) moves into a new network and thus its
    Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) performs the binding update to the Local Mobility
    Anchor (LMA), the LMA begins the 'partial' bicasting of data packets will be buffered
    at the new MAG as well as the previous MAG. Then, the data packets will be buffered
    at the new MAG during handover and then forwarded to MN after the handover operations
    are completed. The proposed scheme can reduce handover delays and packet losses,
    and can also use the network resource of wireless links more effectively.</p>"
