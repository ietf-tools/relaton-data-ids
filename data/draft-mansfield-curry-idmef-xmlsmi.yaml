abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF)
    is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest
    to intrusion detection and response systems, and to the management systems which
    may need to interact with them. The goals and requirements of the IDMEF are described
    in [3]. Two implementations of the IDMEF data format have been proposed: one using
    the Structure of Management Information (SMI) to describe an SNMP MIB, and the
    other using a Document Type Definition (DTD) to describe XML documents. Both representations
    appear to have their good and bad traits, and deciding between them is difficult.
    To arrive at an informed decision, the working group tasked the authors to identify
    and analyze the pros and cons of both approaches, and present the results in the
    form of an Internet-Draft.</p>"
