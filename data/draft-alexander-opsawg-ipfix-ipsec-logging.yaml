abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is an industry standard protocol
    suite that provides secure services for traffic between IP peers in the network.
    The purpose of IPSec is to provide key tenets of security that include authentication,
    integrity protection, access control and data confidentiality. The objectivities
    of IPSec are met using a collection of intertwined components namely, the security
    protocols, session and key management protocols and algorithms for authentication
    and encryption. An end-to-end IPSec operation is typically multi-step involving
    various technologies. There are many events in IPSec process that are of interest,
    such as - identities and connection status of security peers, traffic or applications
    being protected, access control and encryption policies being enforced. While
    many of these are functionally discrete, they have an impact on end-to-end IPSec
    operations. While network elements involved in IPSec process do provide system
    logs, command line interfaces and management objects that reflect the various
    states of operations, these are however dissevered, inconsistent and not easily
    favorable for analyzing, monitoring, auditing of end-to-end behavior This document
    proposes an approach for common representation and standardization of various
    IPSec operational data and events using industry standard IPFIX information model.
    The IPFIX approach helps to store and manage data in a consistent format, also
    provides opportunity for a collector to correlate various IPSec events which in
    turn can be exploited to obtain enriched end-to-end monitoring, reporting and
    troubleshooting capabilities and provide various security analytics on IPSec flows
    such as - host identification, application detection, track user policy violations,
    protocol failures and so on.</p>"
