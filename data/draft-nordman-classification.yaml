abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification addresses how to communicate a basic sense of the
    type of each device present on the network. This is particularly important as
    the range of devices with connectivity greatly expands, and as indirect interests
    in device characteristics increase, such as energy consumption. Many applications
    will benefit from a single standard enumeration of basic device types. This draft
    does not address detailed device characteristics or subtypes. The draft also discusses
    related identify information. It is an initial discussion document to generate
    feedback and improvement.</p>"
