abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications that
    do not have resource requirements that are readily quantifiable per the standard
    Intserv token-bucket model (qualitative applications). We introduce the 'qualitative'
    service-type. This service-type can be used in conjunction with RSVP signaling
    to manage the allocation of network resources to traffic originating from qualitative
    applications. This mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable to networks that
    combine differentiated service (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling
    [intdiff].</p>"
