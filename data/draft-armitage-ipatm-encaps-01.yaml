abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt ('Support for Multicast
    over UNI 3.1 based ATM Networks') describes a mechanism for handling IP multicast
    over ATM. In doing so it notes two different mechanisms for actually achieving
    the multicasting of packet traffic at the ATM level. These are meshes of point
    to multipoint VCs, or ATM level multicast servers. If a multicast server is in
    use a host or router may receive a transmitted packet back on the same interface
    it was originally sent on. It is necessary for IP hosts and routers to be able
    to distinguish and discard these packets which are reflected back. This memo describes
    the issue in greater detail, and suggests a range of new encapsulation options.</p>"
