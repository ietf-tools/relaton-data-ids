abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo tries to identify the problems and issues in the use of IPv6
    anycast [Hinden, 1998] defined as of today. The goals of the draft are (1) to
    understand the currently-defined IPv6 anycast better, (2) to provide guidelines
    for people trying to deploy anycast services, and (3) to suggest updates to IPv6
    anycast protocol specification. The document was made possible by input from ipngwg
    DNS discovery design team.</p>"
