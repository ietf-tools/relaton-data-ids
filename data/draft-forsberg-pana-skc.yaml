abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes an extension to the PANA protocol that
    enables usage of a AAA Proxy acting as a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for multiple
    local PANA Authentication Agents. The AAA Proxy acts as the contact point towards
    the AAA home server (single SA) and a AAA server and KDC towards the PAAs. This
    document assumes that the local network has multiple PAAs. To avoid signalling
    between PAAs and the KDC, a Session Key Context is also defined which permits
    to the KDC to proactively provide a set of keys to a PAA. Session Keys can then
    be fetched using CXTP.</p>"
