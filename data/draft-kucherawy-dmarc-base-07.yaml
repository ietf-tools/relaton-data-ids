abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)
    is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating organization can express domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, and
    a mail receiving organization can use those policies and preferences to improve
    mail handling. Originators of Internet Mail need to be able to associate reliable
    and authenticated domain identifiers with messages, communicate policies about
    messages that use those identifiers, and report about mail using those identifiers.
    These abilities have several benefits: Receivers can provide feedback to domain
    owners about the use of their domains, which can provide valuable insight about
    the management of internal operations and the presence of external domain name
    abuse. DMARC does not produce or encourage elevated delivery privilege of authenticated
    email. DMARC is a mechanism for policy distribution that enables increasingly
    strict handling of messages that fail authentication checks, ranging from no action,
    through altered delivery, up to message rejection.</p>"
