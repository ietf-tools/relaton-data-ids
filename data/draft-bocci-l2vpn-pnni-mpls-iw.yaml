abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes a method for control plane interworking
    for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) pseudo wires, where Provider Edge nodes (PEs)
    on both sides of an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN) connect edge ATM networks
    using the Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) or the ATM Inter-Network Interface
    (AINI). In this method, ATM signalling and routing messages are tunnelled over
    the PSN using dedicated pseudo wires, enabling ATM pseudo wires carrying user
    traffic to be established and release dynamically by ATM. The method does not
    require changes to existing IETF defined protocols in order to support all features
    of PNNI and AINI.</p>"
