abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Resolving service Discovery Protocol (DRDP) enables to discover
    resolving services available and eventually upgrade to an encrypted resolving
    service. DRDP requires a resolving domain or a pointer to a list of resolving
    domains. Currently ISP or CPEs do not advertise resolving domain or pointers to
    resolving domains which does not make possible for a DNS client to discover potential
    resolving services - such as encrypted DNS for example - made available by the
    ISP. Instead, ISPs or CPE advertise via DHCP the IP address of the host with a
    IA Address Option [RFC3315] and the IP addresses of the resolver provided by the
    ISP with Recursive Name Server option [RFC3646]. This document describes a procedure
    for a DNS client to derive resolving domains from the legacy configuration of
    the host. This is expected to ease the deployment of encrypted DNS from ISP as
    it will enable OS, applications to discover resolving service put in place by
    the ISP even though the CPE has not been upgraded.</p>"
