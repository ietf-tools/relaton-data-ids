abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the data plane of the path-aware, inter- domain
    network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
    networks). One of the basic characteristics of SCION is that it gives path control
    to endpoints. The SCION control plane is responsible for discovering these paths
    and making them available as path segments to the endpoints. The responsibility
    of the *SCION data plane* is to combine the path segments into end-to-end paths,
    and forward data between endpoints according to the specified path. The SCION
    data plane fundamentally differs from today's IP-based data plane in that it is
    _path-aware_: In SCION, interdomain forwarding directives are embedded in the
    packet header. This document first provides a detailed specification of the SCION
    data packet format as well as the structure of the SCION header. SCION also supports
    extension headers - these are described, too. The document then shows the life
    cycle of a SCION packet while traversing the SCION Internet. This is followed
    by a specification of the SCION path authorization mechanisms and the packet processing
    at routers. SCION also includes its own protocol to communicate failures to endpoints,
    the SCION Control Message Protocol (SCMP). This protocol will be described in
    a separate document, which will follow later.</p>"
