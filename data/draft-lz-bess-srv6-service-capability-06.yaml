abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC9252] specifies that implementations MUST provide a mechanism to
    control advertisement of SRv6-based BGP service routes on a per neighbor and per
    service basis. This document provides analysis on the problems that may be encountered
    if the SRv6-based service routes are received by the MPLS-only PEs. Some currently
    used SRv6-based service routes advertisement controlling methods by configuration
    or network planning are also described. And this document proposes an automatic
    advertisement controlling method for SRv6-based service routes by defining a new
    Capability Code for SRv6-based BGP service capability.</p>"
