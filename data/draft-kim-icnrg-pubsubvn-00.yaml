abstract:
- content: "<p>As autonomous vehicle is becoming a major research in automotive engineering,
    the importance of vehicular network is also increasing. Content-oriented vehicular
    network requires new communication architecture that is different from the existing
    IP-based architecture. ICN is one of the best alternatives for vehicular network
    to serve as communication infrastructure. ICN only supports pull-based communication.
    Therefore, an efficient communication method is needed for disseminating safety
    information for vehicles, and the publish/subscribe(pub/sub) system can be a good
    alternative. This document proposes a pub/sub service architecture and procedures
    for disseminating safety information between vehicles and infrastructure.</p>"
