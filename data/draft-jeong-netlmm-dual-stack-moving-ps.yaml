abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the handover problem of dual stack mobile nodes
    when the mobile nodes roam over IPv4 and IPv6 NETLMM domains. Current NETLMM architecture
    supports IPv6 only. However, as the NETLMM architecture being more widely used,
    it will be likely to introduce the NETLMM architecture to IPv4 networks. In this
    environment, a dual stack mobile node may move to both IPv6 and IPv4 NETLMM domains.</p>"
