abstract:
- content: <p>For many years, the IETF has maintained, via the IANA, registries of
    protocol and parameter names and numbers. The primary purpose of these registries
    is to ensure that different methods and options are properly identified and distinguished.
    Registration of such names or numbers generally does not necessarily imply approval
    of the technology in the corresponding protocol. Instead, registration represents
    the desire to keep choices distinctly identified, separated, and public to avoid
    conflicts in use. In recent years, various changes in the nature of the instructions
    given to the IANA, increased perceptions of scarcity in the number spaces associated
    with some of the parameters, and other issues have led to a shift in emphasis
    from "registration to keep identifiers unique" toward evaluations of the quality
    of proposals for and preferences among protocols. This document argues that shift
    is undesirable. It articulates and clarifies the principles that the reasons for
    evaluation of registration requests is to ensure a minimum quality of definition,
    that any assertions of scarcity to restrict registrations must be accompanied
    by a plan for evaluating and, if appropriate, eliminating the scarcity problem,
    and that, if a "no scarcity" plan is not possible, to establish criteria for making
    decisions that are as specific and objective as possible. This document is intended
    to update the general considerations of RFC 2434, the specific allocation rules
    of RFC 2780, and the evaluation criteria associated with other documents that
    condition an IANA registration on Expert Review with IESG oversight or on IESG
    or IETF action.</p>
