abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet, standardized as IEEE802.3, is a family of frame-based networking
    technologies for local area networks. It's the most widespread wired LAN technology.
    This document proposes a variation of the original frame's structure to perform
    a frame's classification and a switching optimization (fundamental steps for QoS
    mechanism).</p>"
