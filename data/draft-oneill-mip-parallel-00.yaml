abstract:
- content: "<p>Nested MIP [NestMIP] provides a means to support both localization
    and aggregation of MIP signalling. It achieves this by providing two distinct
    layers of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access layer that provides local
    mobility management and local access services, and a remote access layer that
    provides remote access back to a home subnet. Nested MIP and an associated proposal,
    Concatenated MIP [ConcatMIP] are necessary because existing MIP signalling is
    HA/HoA specific and therefore not easily amenable to aggregation for supporting
    multiple MIP sessions per MN. This document describes an alternative proposal
    for introducing aggregation that has significantly lower functionality but that
    is a smaller change from existing MIP standards and implementations. It is described
    here for completeness as part of the overall problem space. The solution uses
    a single HA/HoA specific MIP Registration as a master signal within which is carried
    an extension that defines an include/exclude list of the other HA/HoA pairs that
    should/should not be handed off. This extension can be carried in inter-FA hand-off
    signals and in regional registrations, and is also used within Nested/Concat MIP.</p>"
