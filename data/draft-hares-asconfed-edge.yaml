abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism for Autonomous Systems within an
    AS Confederation to survive the disconnection to other AS within the AS confederation
    without dropping peers. When all links to the other AS in the Confederation break,
    this mechanism allows the AS to revert to local AS to continue communication with
    E-BGP peers. This mechanism has two parts: Capability signaling between the two
    parties at connection start to save two AS (internal and AS Confederation AS)
    and a mechanism to signal the switch between AS Confederation AS and internal
    AS.</p>"
