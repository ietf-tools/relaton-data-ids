abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol security mechanisms, such as IP Security (IPsec)
    [IPSEC], provides various security services for IP traffic. However, the benefits
    offered by IPsec may come at the cost of increased overhead. This document identifies
    a methodology for integrating header compression (HC) over IPsec (HCoIPsec). HCoIPsec
    proposes to reduce the amount of packet overhead associated with the transmission
    of traffic over tunnel mode security associations.</p>"
