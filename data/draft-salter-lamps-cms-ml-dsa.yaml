abstract:
- content: "<p>The Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), as defined
    in FIPS 204, is a post-quantum digital signature scheme that aims to be secure
    against an adversary in posession of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer
    (CRQC). This document specifies the conventions for using the ML-DSA signature
    algorithm with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). In addition, the algorithm
    identifier and public key syntax are provided.</p>"
