abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extension to PCEP to configure LSP parameters.
    Some of LSP parameters are needed to configure S-BFD for candidate paths. An SR
    policy is identified by &lt;headend, color, endpoint&gt; tuple. An SR policy can
    contain one or more candidate paths where each candidate path is identified in
    PCEP by its uniquely assigned PLSP-ID. The mechanism proposed in this document
    is applicable to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes of SR.</p>"
