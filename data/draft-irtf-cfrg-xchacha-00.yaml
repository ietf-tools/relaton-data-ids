abstract:
- content: "<p>The eXtended-nonce ChaCha cipher construction (XChaCha) allows for
    ChaCha-based ciphersuites to accept a 192-bit nonce with similar guarantees to
    the original construction, except with a much lower probability of nonce misuse
    occurring. This enables XChaCha constructions to be stateless, while retaining
    the same security assumptions as ChaCha. This document defines XChaCha20, which
    uses HChaCha20 to convert the key and part of the nonce into a subkey, which is
    in turn used with the remainder of the nonce with ChaCha20 to generate a pseudorandom
    keystream (e.g. for message encryption). This document also defines AEAD_XChaCha20_Poly1305,
    a variant of [RFC7539] that utilizes the XChaCha20 construction in place of ChaCha20.</p>"
