abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexible Algorithm is a mechanism that allows Link state routing protocols
    (viz. OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-defined (and
    hence, flexible) constraints and metrics. The computation is performed by routers
    participating in the specific network in a distributed manner using a Flexible
    Algorithm definition. This definition provisioned on one or more routers and propagated
    (viz. OSPF and IS- IS flooding) through the network. IP Flex-algo enables these
    constraint based paths to be built in a network which is purely IP and does not
    support MPLS or SRv6 forwarding plane. BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection
    of various topology information from the network. This draft defines extensions
    to BGP- LS address-family to advertise bandwidth, delay and metric related constraints
    in Flexible algorithm definition. It also defines BGP-LS extensions required to
    advertise IP flexible algorithm related extensions in BGP-LS.</p>"
