abstract:
- content: <p>The use of large-scale IP address sharing technologies (commonly known
    as "Carrier-Grade NAT" and "A+P") presents a challenge for law enforcement agencies
    due to the fact that incoming source port information is not routinely logged
    by Internet-facing servers. The absence of this information means that it is becoming
    increasingly difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify suspects in criminal
    activity online. This document considers the reasons why source port information
    is not routinely logged by Internet-facing servers and makes recommendations to
    help improve the situation. A deployment maturity model has been developed and
    a study of the support for logging incoming source port information in common
    server software is also presented.</p>
