abstract:
- content: "<p>IDNA has been a world-wide success since it was introduced over five
    years ago. However, it has some notable deficiencies, including being tied to
    an old version of the Unicode standard and needless restrictions that prevented
    some languages from being used. This document describes IDNA version 2, which
    rectifies those problems while making the fewest changes necessary to the original
    protocol.</p>"
