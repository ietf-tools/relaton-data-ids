abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.
    The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975 and RFC4976
    in the following ways: it uses COMEDIA for TCP connection establishment, and it
    allows the usage of SDP in a more conventional way for conveying endpoint address
    information. Because of this, the model also allows for the usage of generic mainstream
    mechanisms for NAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.</p>"
