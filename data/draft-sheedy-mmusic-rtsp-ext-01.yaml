abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes enhancements to the RTSP protocol for broadcast
    quality non-IP based video- on-demand applications. Additional transports for
    non-IP delivery of media streams are proposed, along with control extensions to
    reduce latency. These proposals are based on nCUBE Corporation's and Oracle Corporation's
    experience with their existing media servers.</p>"
