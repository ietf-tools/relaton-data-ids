abstract:
- content: "<p>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    has one-way delays 4-24 minutes) and intermittent communications, mainly because
    of orbital dynamics. The IP protocol stack used on the Internet is based on the
    assumptions of shorter delays and mostly uninterrupted communications. This document
    describes the key characteristics, use cases, and requirements for deep space
    networking, intended to help when profiling IP protocols in such environment.</p>"
