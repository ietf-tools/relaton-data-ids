abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network Discovery Protocol (NETDIS), a
    protocol that provides a way to broadcast information about the network service
    accessible through the access network where the information is broadcasted. This
    allows several service providers to share the same access network. The public
    WLAN access network is particularly targeted by this protocol. As a result a mobile
    terminal listening NETDIS announcements discovers the list of Service providers
    (Virtual WLAN operator) supported by the WLAN it is currently attached.</p>"
