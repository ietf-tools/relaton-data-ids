abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents Service Provider requirements for support of
    Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv)-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS- TE). Its
    objective is to provide guidance for the definition, selection and specification
    of a technical solution addressing these requirements. Specification for this
    solution itself is outside the scope of this document. A problem statement is
    first provided. Then, the document describes example applications scenarios identified
    by Service Providers where existing MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms fall short
    and Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering can address the needs. The detailed requirements
    that need to be addressed by the technical solution are also reviewed. Finally,
    the document identifies the evaluation criteria that should be considered for
    selection and definition of the technical solution. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
