abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a method called Most Sharable Wavelength per
    Segment (MSWS) to support shared-mesh restoration for wavelength switched optical
    networks (WSON). The proposed method can perform efficient wavelength sharing
    in a distributed fashion. It uses the signaling extensions for WSON which is previously
    proposed in the document "Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical
    Networks" (draft-bernstein-ccamp-wson-signaling-01) and no other protocol extensions
    of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) routing and signaling are
    needed.</p>
