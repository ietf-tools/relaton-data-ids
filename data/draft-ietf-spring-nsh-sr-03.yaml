abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two application scenarios where Network Service
    Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) can be deployed together to support Service
    Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while maintaining separation of
    the service and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.
    In both scenarios, SR is responsible for steering packets between SFFs along a
    given Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH is responsible for maintaining the
    integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance context, and any associated metadata.
    These application scenarios demonstrate that NSH and SR can work jointly and complement
    each other leaving the network operator with the flexibility to use whichever
    transport technology makes sense in specific areas of their network infrastructure,
    and still maintain an end-to-end service plane using NSH.</p>"
