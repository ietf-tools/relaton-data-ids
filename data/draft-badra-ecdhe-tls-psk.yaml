abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 and specifies a set of
    ciphersuites that use an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated
    with a pre-shared key. These ciphersuites provide Perfect Forward Secrecy. It
    also specifies one authentication-only ciphersuites (with no encryption). This
    ciphersuite is useful when authentication and integrity protection is desired,
    but confidentiality is not needed or not permitted.</p>"
