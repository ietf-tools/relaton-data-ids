abstract:
- content: "<p>When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress Label Switching
    Router (LSRs) can receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been
    installed on all downstream nodes. According to the RSVP-TE specification, the
    ingress LSR can forward traffic through a Label Switched Path (LSP) as soon as
    it receives a RESV message. However, if the ingress LSR forwards traffic through
    the LSP before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes, traffic
    can be lost. This document describes LSP Self-ping. When an ingress LSR receives
    an RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures to ensure that forwarding
    state has been installed on all downstream nodes. LSP Self-ping is a new protocol.
    It is not an extension of LSP Ping. Although LSP Ping and LSP Self-ping are named
    similarly, each is designed for a unique purpose. Each protocol listens on its
    own UDP port and executes its own procedures. LSP Self-ping is an extremely lightweight
    mechanism. It does not consume control-plane resources on transit or egress LSRs.</p>"
