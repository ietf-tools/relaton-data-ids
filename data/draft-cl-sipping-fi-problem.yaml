abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet applications have been enhanced with many features. A feature
    may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, having a self-contained
    role. However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired
    behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction- FI for short. This
    document provides a description of the FI problem in Internet, the main problems
    to be solved in the FI resolution, and compares some solutions for FI identification
    and resolution explored that have been discussed in the literature.</p>"
