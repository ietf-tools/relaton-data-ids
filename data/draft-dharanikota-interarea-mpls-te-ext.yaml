abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose the extensions required to the routing protocols,
    signaling protocols, and the MIB to support the idea of inter-area LSPs. A companion
    document [INTER_AREA_REQ] provides the architectural requirements for such a concept.
    This document also provides the signaling extensions to support the crankback
    as defined in the architecture document [INTER_AREA_REQ].</p>"
