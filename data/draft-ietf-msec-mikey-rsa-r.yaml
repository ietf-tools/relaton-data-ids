abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multimedia Internet Keying (MIKEY) specification describes several
    modes of key distribution solution that address multimedia scenarios (e.g., SIP
    calls and Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) sessions) using pre-shared keys,
    public keys, and optionally a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In the public-key mode,
    the Initiator encrypts a random key with the Responder's public key and sends
    it to the Responder. In many communication scenarios, the Initiator may not know
    the Responder's public key, or in some cases the Responder's ID (e.g., call forwarding)
    in advance. We propose a new MIKEY mode that works well in such scenarios. This
    mode also enhances the group key management support in MIKEY; it supports member-initiated
    group key download (in contrast to group manager pushing the group keys to all
    members). This document updates RFC 3830 with the RSA-R mode. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
