abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an extension of Traversal Using Relays around
    NAT (TURN), a relay protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal. This
    extension allows a TURN client to request TCP allocations, and defines new requests
    and indications for the TURN server to open and accept TCP connections with the
    client\\'s peers. TURN and this extension both purposefully restrict the ways
    in which the relayed address can be used. In particular, it prevents users from
    running general-purpose servers from ports obtained from the TURN server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
