abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an experimental mechanism by which IPv6 link-local
    addresses and associated system names may be distributed among interconnected
    hosts, for use by users and applications. It provides an overview of the problem,
    a proposed solution (including suggested protocol details), and lists various
    related issues. This work is introduced to the IPng Working Group initially, although
    it might also have implications or concerns relevant to individuals working on
    directory services and other areas.</p>"
