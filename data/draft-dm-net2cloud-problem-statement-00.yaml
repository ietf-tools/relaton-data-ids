abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes common approaches deployed by enterprises for
    interconnection of workloads &amp; applications hosted in Cloud DCs with on-premises
    DCs &amp; branch offices. This document also describes some of the (network) problems
    that many enterprises face when they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data
    split among hybrid data centers, especially for those enterprises with multiple
    sites that are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g. MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN) and leased
    lines. Current operational problems in the field are examined to determine whether
    there is a need for enhancements to existing protocols or whether a new protocol
    is necessary to solve them.</p>"
