abstract:
- content: <p>The concept of "make-before-break (MBB)" while rerouting MPLS RSVP-TE
    tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209]. In the procedure that is outlined, the behavior
    of downstream label assignment for the new LSP (new tunnel instance) is not well
    defined. As a general practice, a different label is assigned by each downstream
    router and advertised to the upstream router in the RESV message for the new LSP;
    this results in a separate end-to-end data-plane path for the new LSP (with the
    exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP with explicit label on the last hop). This practice
    allows independent end to end LSP path data-plane verification for each tunnel
    instance. The consequence of this practice is that the label entry gets added/deleted
    in the LFIB at every non-ingress router along the LSP path during MBB. Also, the
    ingress router would need to update all the applications using this LSP when switching
    to the new tunnel instance, as the new tunnel instance uses different outgoing
    label. This in turn may also cause other elements of the network which are dependent
    on the LSP to do the update. Such network churn can be avoided/minimized if the
    same label can be re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither the routing
    functionalities nor the data path verification of each instance. In addition,
    whenever label is reused, the setup time for the new tunnel instance would be
    faster because there is no need for the transit routers along the path of the
    new LSP to wait for the new LFIB entry to be added. This document proposes a set
    of procedures to facilitate label reuse when there is a total or partial path
    overlap between the two tunnel instances during MBB.</p>
