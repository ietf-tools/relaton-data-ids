abstract:
- content: "<p>This document alters the specification defined in RFC 2535. Based on
    implementation experience, the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the DNS header is
    not useful. This document redefines the AD bit such that it is only set if all
    answers or records proving that no answers exist in the response has been cryptographically
    verified or otherwise meets the server's local security policy.</p>"
