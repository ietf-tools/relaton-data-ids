abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have in the past
    enjoyed a high degree of portability and we would like the same portability with
    IPv6 applications. But changes are required to the sockets API to support IPv6
    and this memo describes these changes. These include a new socket address structure
    to carry IPv6 addresses, new address conversion functions, and some new socket
    options. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
