abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trusted Platform Module, for the past decade, has shown potential
    to improve computer security. However, there is growing concerns that the Trusted
    Platform Module, and its related technologies might be challenging for Forensic
    Investigators to acquire and analyze certain digital evidence. For example, if
    the key evidence is encrypted, and cryptographically bound to a set of platform
    characteristics, then those characteristics must exist on the platform (that is
    being used to decrypt the evidence) before the evidence can be decrypted. As a
    result, it is believed that if a suspect cryptographically bound the evidence
    to the platform characteristics, and those characteristics in some way got changed,
    then it might not be possible to decrypt the potential evidence. For this reason,
    we explored how Trusted Platform Module and its related technologies might support
    digital forensic analysis within a trusted enterprise network.</p>"
