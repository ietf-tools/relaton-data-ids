abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines chaining arguments that can be applied to any
    LDAP operation for distributed/chained server to server operations. This approach
    to distribution for LDAP systems, enables a consistent transition of the LDAP
    single server environments, to the full functionality of X.500 distributed directory
    systems. This proposal is supported by two other proposals previously submitted
    as &lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt; and &lt;draft-lloyd-list-read-00.txt&gt;.
    These proposals require that LDAP V3 is evolved to LDAP V4. LDAP V4 will enable
    LDAP clients and servers that access and interwork with X.500 systems, to more
    readily use (and integrate with) the full distribution and replication services
    offered by X.500. In addition this approach will provide better compatability
    with the higher functionality afforded to X.500 DAP clients. (Although the commonly
    known information restrictions of LDAP string encoding may still apply). The Chaining
    controls proposed in this draft will be carried with the original LDAP access
    client controls as defined in &lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt; in the standard
    LDAP V4 operations (Search, List, etc) when it is used for server - server communication.
    ie. chaining.</p>"
