abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the gateway architecture for the interoperability
    between 6LoWPAN and external IPv6 networks. The gateway does the compression and
    decompression of IPv6 packets and performs the mapping between 16 bit short addresses
    and the IPv6 addresses for both the external IPv6 networks and 6LowPAN, respectively.</p>"
