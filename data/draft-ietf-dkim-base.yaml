abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication
    framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to
    permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transfer
    Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs). The ultimate goal of this framework
    is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus protecting
    message signer identity and the integrity of the messages they convey while retaining
    the functionality of Internet email as it is known today. Protection of email
    identity may assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing". [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
