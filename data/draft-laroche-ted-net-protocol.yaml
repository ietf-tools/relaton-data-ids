abstract:
- content: "<p>The Ted.Net protocol improves messaging systems while being fully compatible
    with all of them. Ted.Net improvements bring to messaging systems' end users :
    - large file transfers capabilities, - pretty good level of privacy, - integrity
    control of the transfered data, - time stamped proofs of the acceptance of data
    by the recipient. With the secure and stable services of Ted.Net, users can rely
    on private or public messaging systems, SMTP, X400, or editors' ones, to put on
    Electronic Data Interchanges (EDI).</p>"
