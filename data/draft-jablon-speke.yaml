abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPEKE, B-SPEKE, and SRP-4, three methods for
    password-based key agreement and authentication. In the same class of techniques
    as SRP-3 [RFC 2945], these methods provide a zero- knowledge proof of a password
    and authenticate session keys over an unprotected channel, with minimal dependency
    on infrastructure and proper user behavior. These methods are compatible with
    IEEE 1363 and ANSI X9 standards, and are closely aligned with RFC 2945 from an
    application perspective. They use different techniques than earlier patented alternatives,
    and provide an expanded set of choices for convenient and secure personal authentication
    over the Internet.</p>"
