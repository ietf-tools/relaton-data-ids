abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic
    from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are no
    longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile, and
    expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters based on the registration
    status of the address space. This document explains why any remaining packet and
    BGP prefix filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border routers
    and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across the
    public Internet. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
