- content: "<p>This note discusses a proposed embedding for uncompressed video and
    audio within an RTP stream. Whilst this is not a finished document, and although
    it was not written with wider distribution in mind, I think it may be useful as
    a 'straw man' proposal to provoke further discussion of the use of RTP for professional
    media.</p>"
