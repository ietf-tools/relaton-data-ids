abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility
    management for mobile nodes (MN) in a local small area. When the numbers of MNs
    which attaching to the same MAG is very large, how to manage those MNs is very
    urgent. Some MNs are active and have to update the location information frequently;
    other ones are in idle state so how to localize them is a little harder. This
    document proposes a scheme to localize the idle MN in the PMIPv6 network. When
    the MN is moving in the MD, the network can quickly obtain its location information
    to achieve the state synchronization and reduce the data forwarding delay.</p>"
