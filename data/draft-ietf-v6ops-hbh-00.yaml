abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options Header
    (HBH) in today's routers in the aspects of standards specification, common implementations,
    and default operations. This document outlines the reasons why the Hop-by-Hop
    Options Header is rarely utilized in current networks. In addition, this document
    describes how the HBH could be used as a powerful mechanism allowing deployment
    and operations of new services requiring a more optimized way to leverage network
    resources of an infrastructure. The Hop-by- Hop Options Header is taken into consideration
    by several network operators as a valuable container for carrying the information
    facilitating the introduction of new services. The purpose of this draft is to
    document the reasons why the HBH is rarely used within networks and to define
    a proper list of requirements aiming to allow a better leverage of the HBH capability.</p>"
