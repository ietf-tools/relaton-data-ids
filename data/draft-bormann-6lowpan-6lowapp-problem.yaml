abstract:
- content: "<p>The 6LoWPAN and ROLL WGs are laying the groundwork to make the Wireless
    Embedded Internet a reality, but what application protocols will we use? Request-response
    protocols like HTTP are a poor fit to a communication model with battery-operated,
    mostly sleeping nodes. In addition, the usual data formats (both headers and body)
    are perceived to be too chatty for the 50-60 byte payloads possible in LoWPANs
    and to require too much code for the 8-bit and 16-bit processors dominating the
    Internet of Things. Still, it would be a mistake to start a new silo of application
    protocols that do not benefit from existing application area Internet experience.
    This document provides a problem statement for possible work on of application
    protocols in 6LoWPAN networks or, more generally, in low- power, lossy networks,
    as well as some considerations for required related work.</p>"
