abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
    if a long network path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance
    targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths. The
    subpath at a time tests are designed to exclude all known conditions which might
    prevent the full end-to-end path from meeting the user's target application performance.
    This approach makes it possible to to determine the IP performance requirements
    needed to support the desired end-to-end TCP performance. The IP metrics are based
    on traffic patterns that mimic TCP or other transport protocol but are precomputed
    independently of the actual behavior of the transport protocol over the subpath
    under test. This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all of the
    difficulties encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics, which fundamentally
    depend on congestion control equilibrium behavior. A natural consequence of this
    methodology is verifiable network measurement: measurements from any given vantage
    point can be verified by repeating them from other vantage points. Formatted:
