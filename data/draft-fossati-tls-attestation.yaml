abstract:
- content: "<p>The TLS handshake protocol allows authentication of one or both peers
    using static, long-term credentials. In some cases, it is also desirable to ensure
    that the peer runtime environment is in a secure state. Such an assurance can
    be achieved using attestation which is a process by which an entity produces evidence
    about itself that another party can use to appraise whether that entity is found
    in a secure state. This document describes a series of protocol extensions to
    the TLS 1.3 handshake that enables the binding of the TLS authentication key to
    a remote attestation session. This enables an entity capable of producing attestation
    evidence, such as a confidential workload running in a Trusted Execution Environment
    (TEE), or an IoT device that is trying to authenticate itself to a network access
    point, to present a more comprehensive set of security metrics to its peer. These
    extensions have been designed to allow the peers to use any attestation technology,
    in any remote attestation topology, and mutually.</p>"
