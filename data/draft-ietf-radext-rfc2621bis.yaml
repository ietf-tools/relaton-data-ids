abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a set of extensions that instrument RADIUS accounting
    server functions. These extensions represent a portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
    Using these extensions, IP-based management stations can manage RADIUS accounting
    servers. This memo obsoletes RFC 2621 by deprecating the MIB table containing
    IPv4-only address formats and defining a new table to add support for version-neutral
    IP address formats. The remaining MIB objects from RFC 2621 are carried forward
    into this document. This memo also adds UNITS and REFERENCE clauses to selected
    objects. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
