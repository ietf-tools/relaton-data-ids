abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
    communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to TCP [RFC0793].
    With the widespread deployment of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized
    code has been added to NAT for TCP that allows multiple hosts to reside behind
    a NAT and yet use only a single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts
    (behind a NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection. This additional
    code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port Translation or NAPT.
    To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet been added to most NATs so that
    only pure NAT is available. The end result of this is that only one SCTP capable
    host can be behind a NAT. This document describes an SCTP specific chunks and
    procedures to help NAT's provide similar features of NAPT in the single point
    and multi-point traversal scenario.</p>"
