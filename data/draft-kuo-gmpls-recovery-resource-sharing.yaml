abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protection and restoration (P&amp;R) techniques are proposed to
    protect LSP in GMPLS networks. Provisioning better P&amp;R capability requires
    that more recovery resources be allocated on protection LSP, which may lead to
    resource waste in GMPLS networks. This draft presents a scheme of recovery resource
    sharing with traffic balancing for GMPLS LSP P&amp;R. Its focus is on the discussions
    of working and protection LSPs selection and shared resource allocation and release.</p>"
