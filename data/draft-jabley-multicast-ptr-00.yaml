abstract:
- content: <p>The mapping of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to names using the Domain Name
    System (DNS) is colloquially known as "Reverse Mapping". Reverse Mapping support
    for registered multicast address assignments in IPv4 is currently incomplete and
    ad-hoc; in IPv6 there is no support at all. This document describes procedures
    to be followed that will result in more systematic and predictable support for
    Reverse Mapping for IPv4 multicast address assignments, and introduces analogous
    support for IPv6.</p>
