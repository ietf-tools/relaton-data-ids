abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the addition of new email headers designed specifically
    to identify emails that are sent as part of phishing detection training programs.
    These headers would allow recipients to verify the authenticity of training emails
    using DNS queries to confirm that the sending domains are authorized to send these
    types of emails.</p>"
