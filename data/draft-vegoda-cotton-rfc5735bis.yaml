abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the global and other specialized IPv4 address
    blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
    It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to operators and users through
    the Regional Internet Registries, nor does it address IPv4 address space assigned
    directly by IANA prior to the creation of the Regional Internet Registries. It
    also does not address allocations or assignments of IPv6 addresses or autonomous
    system numbers. This document obsoletes RFC 5735 and updates RFC 6441. The substantive
    change between this document and RFC 5735 is that it includes 100.64.0.0/10, which
    was assigned in RFC 6598.</p>"
