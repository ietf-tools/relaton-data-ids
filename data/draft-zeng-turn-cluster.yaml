abstract:
- content: "<p>The TURN protocol is designed to solve the connectivity problem of
    Peer-to-Peer Communication when NAT devices exist, by allowing each peer to establish
    a data channel on TURN servers. Since there are some specific requirements in
    the use of TURN, such as RTP/RTCP connection pairs must be sent to the same TURN
    server, it is not easy to scale a single TURN server into a TURN cluster. In addition,
    a TURN service cluster also needs to consider how to achieve good load balancing
    and how to protect internal information security. Based on these demands, this
    specification provides several standard means to implement a functional and secure
    TURN cluster, and this specification also provides an overview and rationale of
    the cluster architecture.</p>"
