abstract:
- content: "<p>The CAPWAP Working Group (WG) is currently looking into defining a
    protocol that would enable interoperability in an IEEE 802.11 based wireless local
    area network (WLAN) comprised of Wireless Termination Points (WTP) and Access
    Controllers (AC) belonging to different vendors. This document presents a self-review
    of Simple Light Access Point Protocol (SLAPP), one of the candidate protocol proposals
    submitted to the CAPWAP WG for consideration as a CAPWAP protocol. The WG has
    requested that the authors of all candidate proposals to provide a document which
    evaluates how their submission meets the objectives, taxonomy, and problem statement.</p>"
