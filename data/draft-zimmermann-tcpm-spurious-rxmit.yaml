abstract:
- content: "<p>The Spurious Retransmission Detection (SRD) algorithm allows a TCP
    sender to always detect if it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily. It requires
    that both the TCP Echo option defined in [I-D.zimmermann-tcpm-echo-option], and
    the SACK option [RFC2018] be enabled for a connection. The SRD algorithm makes
    use of the fact that the TCP Echo option, used in conjunction with the SACK feedback,
    can be used to completely eliminate the retransmission ambiguity in TCP. Based
    on the reflected data contained in the first acceptable ACK that arrives during
    loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily. The
    SRD mechanism further enables improvements in loss recovery. This includes a TCP
    enhancement to detect and quickly resend lost retransmissions.</p>"
