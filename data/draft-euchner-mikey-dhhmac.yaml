abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a key management protocol variant for the multimedia
    Internet keying (MIKEY). In particular, the classic Diffie-Hellman key agreement
    protocol is used for key establishment in conjunction with a keyed hash (HMAC-SHA1)
    for achieving mutual authentication and message integrity of the key management
    messages exchanged. This MIKEY variant is called the HMAC-authenticated Diffie-Hellmann.
    It addresses the real-time aspects of multimedia key management in MIKEY.</p>"
