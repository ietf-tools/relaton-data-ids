abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a file transfer protocol to facilitate electronic
    data interchange between trading partners. The protocol, denoted the ODETTE File
    Transfer Protocol, supports both direct communication between installations and
    indirect communication via a third party clearing centre. It was developed by
    the Organisation for Data Exchange by Tele Transmission in Europe to facilitate
    communication within the European motor industry and is presented here to allow
    for wider use within the Internet community.</p>"
