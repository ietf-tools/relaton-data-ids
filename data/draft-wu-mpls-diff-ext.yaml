abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes updates to the current MPLS LDP and MPLS RSVP
    messages for LSP establishment in order to support Differentiated Services (Diff-Serv)
    over ATM LSRs and Frame Relay LSRs. In brief, we propose that: - a set of PHBs
    that requires no misordering of packets in a microflow (even if the microflow
    contains packets for more than one PHB) be defined as a PHB forwarding class (PFC);
    - packets that belong to the same PFC and the same forwarding equivalence class
    (FEC) should be transported over the same ATM LSP or FR LSP; - for a given FEC,
    a separate ATM LSP or FR LSP should be established for each PFC, so that multiple
    ATM or FR LSPs are established in parallel for support of Diff-Serv; - among the
    set of PHBs transported over the same ATM LSP or FR LSP, the different PHBs' drop
    precedences be mapped into, and enforced via, the layer 2 specific selective discard
    mechanism (CLP bit with ATM, DE bit with FR).</p>"
