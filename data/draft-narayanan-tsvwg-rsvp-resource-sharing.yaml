- content: '<p>The RSVP ASSOCIATION object allows to create association across RSVP
    path states or across Resv states. Two association types are currently defined:
    recovery and resource sharing. This document defines a new association type called
    "Resource Sharing Remote Identification". It can be used by the sender to convey
    to the receiver the information that can then be used by the receiver to identify
    a downstream initiated resource sharing association.</p>'
