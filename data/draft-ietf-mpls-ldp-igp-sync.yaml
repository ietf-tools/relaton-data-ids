abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, there is dependency on the edge-to-edge Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) setup by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), e.g., networks
    that are used for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) applications. For such applications, it is not possible to rely on Internet
    Protocol (IP) forwarding if the MPLS LSP is not operating appropriately. Blackholing
    of labeled traffic can occur in situations where the Interior Gateway Protocol
    (IGP) is operational on a link on which LDP is not. While the link could still
    be used for IP forwarding, it is not useful for MPLS forwarding, for example,
    MPLS VPN applications or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route-free cores. This
    document describes a mechanism to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without
    introducing any protocol changes. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
