abstract:
- content: <p>The QQP protocol specifies a method for transmitting multiple webservice
    requests and responses between two Hosts. QQP plays the role of transport protocol
    for the QRPC webservice protocol, similar to how XML-RPC and SOAP often use HTTP
    over TCP as transport protocol. QQP is called the "Quick Queues Protocol" because
    it is faster than transmitting XML data via HTTP over TCP for several reasons.
    QQP is also designed to handle Internet Protocol multihoming, hiding IP address
    changes from application layer software without need for introducing an additional
    protocol layer for that purpose.</p>
