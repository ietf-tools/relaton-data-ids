abstract:
- content: "<p>This docuent specifies how IP-capable Serial Bus devices may allocate
    IEEE 1394 channel nuber(s) for use in the multicast transmission of IP datagras.
    It defines the necessary methods, data structures and codes for that purpose.
    See also the ost recent revision of draft-ietf-ip1394-ipv4 for a specification
    of the transport of IPv4 datagras over IEEE 1394. CAUTION: This is a WORKING DOCUMENT
    of the IETF IP/1394 group; soe parts reflect rough consensus achieved at the 41st
    IETF eeting in Los Angeles, other parts reflect the editor's distillation of coments
    on the reflector since then and still other parts are new contributions to the
    evolution of MCAP. Until subsequent revisions of this docuent are posted that
    ore clearly identify agreed areas, the reader should consider this a work in progress
    very uch subject to revision. This docuent is not yet adopted by the IP/1394 working
    group.</p>"
