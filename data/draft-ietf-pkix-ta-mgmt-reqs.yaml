abstract:
- content: "<p>A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public key
    and associated data. The public key is used to verify digital signatures, and
    the associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the
    trust anchor is authoritative. A relying party uses trust anchors to determine
    if a digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital signature using the
    trust anchor's public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated
    data for the trust anchor. This document describes some of the problems associated
    with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism and defines requirements
    for data formats and push-based protocols designed to address these problems.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
