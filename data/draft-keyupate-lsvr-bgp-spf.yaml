abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on simplified
    layer 3 routing. Furthermore, requirements for operational simplicity have lead
    many of these MSDCs to converge on BGP as their single routing protocol for both
    their fabric routing and their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing. This document
    describes a solution which leverages BGP Link-State distribution and the Shortest
    Path First algorithm similar to Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF.</p>"
