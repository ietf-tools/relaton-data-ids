abstract:
- content: "<p>Obtaining and maintaining PKI certificates for devices in a local domain
    network is difficult for both technical and human factors reasons. This document
    describes an alternative approach to securely identify and authenticate servers
    in the local domain using a HTTPS- based trust anchor system, called a Referee.
    The Referee allows bootstrapping a network of devices by trusting only the Referee
    trust anchor in the local domain.</p>"
