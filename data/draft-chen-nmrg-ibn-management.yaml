abstract:
- content: "<p>Full life cycle network management will be a key feature of the future
    communication networks. Meanwhile, the complexity of the network management should
    be reduced and the network expects to be managed in a fully automated manner with
    humans out of the loop. In this document, we propose an use case of intent based
    network management to achieve more flexible, convenient, and efficient network
    management. In this use case, we propose an architecture and attempt to illustrate
    the five levels of achieving full autonomous network management.</p>"
