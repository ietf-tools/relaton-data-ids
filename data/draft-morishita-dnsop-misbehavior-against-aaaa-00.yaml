abstract:
- content: "<p>There is some known misbehavior of DNS authoritative servers when they
    are queried for AAAA resource records. Such behavior can block IPv4 communication
    which should actually be available, cause a significant delay in name resolution,
    or even make a denial of service attack. This memo describes details of the known
    cases and discusses the effect.</p>"
