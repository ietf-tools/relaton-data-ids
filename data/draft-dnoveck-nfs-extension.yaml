abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys the processes by which the NFS protocols have
    been extended in the past, including all of the NFS major and minor versions.
    It also looks forward to methods of protocol extension that might be used by NFS
    in the future. A particular focus is on how the minor versioning model of NFSv4
    has worked and what is being done to enhance version management within NFSv4.
    The work already done in the new NFSv4 version management document is summarized,
    and there is a discussion of further issues the working group will need to address
    in moving that work forward.</p>"
