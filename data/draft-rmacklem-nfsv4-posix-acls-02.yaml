abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the addition of four new attributes that are
    used by servers to support POSIX ACLs. The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL component
    of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e draft 17 [IEEE] document
    for which sponsorship was withdrawn in January 1998. Although the draft POSIX
    standard that describes these ACLs was never ratified, several POSIX-based operating
    systems, such as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include support for them. The NFS
    Version 4 (NFSv4) ACLs described in [RFC8881] henceforth referred to as NFSv4
    ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between the ACLs of these two
    models have not been completely successful. In order to adequately support POSIX
    ACLs, this document proposes four new attributes that may optionally be used by
    an NFS Version 4, minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) server to support ACLs that conform
    to the aforementioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.</p>"
