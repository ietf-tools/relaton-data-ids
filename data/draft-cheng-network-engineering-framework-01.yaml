abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines an early draft of a Network Engineering (NE)
    framework. It defines the Network Engineering function and discusses the differences
    between Traffic Engineering (TE) and Network Engineering. It identifies network
    architecture and major functional capabilities for Network Engineering. Network
    Engineering provides a new set of capabilities that is utilized in conjunction
    with Traffic Engineering to optimize the network efficiency, operation, and utilization.</p>"
