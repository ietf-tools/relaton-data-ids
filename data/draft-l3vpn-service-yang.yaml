abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver
    a Layer 3 Provider Provisioned VPN service. The document is limited to the BGP
    PE-based VPNs as described in [RFC4110] and [RFC4364]. This model is intended
    to be instantiated at management system to deliver the overall service. This model
    is not a configuration model to be used directly on network elements. This model
    provides an abstracted view of the Layer 3 IPVPN service configuration components.
    It will be up to a management system to take this as an input and use specific
    configurations models to configure the different network elements to deliver the
    service. How configuration of network elements is done is out of scope of the
    document.</p>"
