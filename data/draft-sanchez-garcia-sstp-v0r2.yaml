abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SSTP, a protocol architecture that provides
    the support of SCCP and TCAP user applications over an IP network. The purpose
    of SSTP is to provide a standard tunneling protocol to convey SCCP messages over
    an IP based network. The core part of the SSTP architecture is the specification
    of the SSTP (Simple SCCP Tunneling Protocol) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation
    between the SCCP layer already defined in [3] and [4], and the IP family protocols
    IP, UDP, TCP and ICMP. TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages. TCP is used
    for SCCP class 1, 2 or 3. SSTP provides similar primitives and parameters to SCCP
    than MTP, and provides seamless connection between nodes implementing SSTP and
    classical SS7 nodes by means of a SSTP gateway. The design of SSTP is oriented
    to fulfill the requirements of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.</p>"
