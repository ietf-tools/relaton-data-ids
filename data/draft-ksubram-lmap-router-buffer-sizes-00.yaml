abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft identifies the set of data that needs to be collected, and
    analyzed to quantify router buffer sizes used in routers in the Wide Area Network
    (WAN). The scope of this draft is limited to WAN links that have link latencies
    of 40 to 150 milliseconds. Reducing router buffer sizes has many advantages, the
    most important being cost. However, there is not much data available today to
    effectively calculate this. This draft details use cases for the study, and lists
    data that needs to be taken into consideration to be able to quantify the size
    of router buffers. The details of the individual measurement metrics are beyond
    the scope of this document. Neither does the draft identify methods to gather
    the data. What it identifies is a need to be able to collect, and report this
    empirical data in a readable fashion thus providing the ability to study and compare
    data in a more standardized method.</p>"
