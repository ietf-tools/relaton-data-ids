abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and packet
    formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279]. BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets
    based on a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition of the BitString
    of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].
    BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection of various topology informations
    from the network, and the topology informations are used by the PCE to calculate
    the path and then propagate them onto the BFRs(instead of having each node to
    calculate on its own) and that can be for both inter-as and intra-as situations.
    This document specifies extensions to the BGP Link-state address- family in order
    to advertise BIER-TE informations.</p>"
