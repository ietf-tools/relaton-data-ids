abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography will
    come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives. For example;
    when will RSA and ECC fall? Are Lattice schemes as strong as we believe? The cryptographic
    community is calling for hybrid schemes that combine classic and post-quantum
    crypto in ways that remain strong so long as at least one of the algorithms used
    remains strong. This document defines the problem statement for digital signatures
    in PKIX-like protocols, and gives an overview of the general families of solutions.</p>"
