abstract:
- content: "<p>This document focuses on the QoS problem in NBVPN, analyses the QoS
    requirement for NBVPN, the insufficiency of QoS guarantee in the current NBVPN
    schemes in the related IETF work group, and proposes a QoS-guaranteed NBVPN reference
    model with centralized resource controller, in this model, some new concepts are
    introduced, such as VPN Logical Bearer Network(VPN-LBN), VPN Centralized resource
    controller(VPN-CRC); and mechanism of guaranteeing the VPN QoS is explained in
    details, including address space, isolation between VPNs, VPN route distribution,
    forwarding, interface requirement signaling requirement, hybrid QoS-VPN, intra-domain
    VPN, inter-domain VPN.</p>"
