abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a lightweight mechanism that allows explicit
    HTTP proxies to inform clients when their proxy configuration, such as a Proxy
    Auto-Configuration (PAC) file or Provisioning Domain (PvD) proxy configuration,
    is outdated. Clients signal to the proxy the configuration URL and the timestamp
    of when it was last fetched. In response, the proxy may indicate that a newer
    version of the configuration is available. This enables clients to refresh their
    configuration without relying on frequent polling or short expiration intervals.
    The mechanism is designed to be compatible with existing proxy deployment models
    and supports both PAC-based and PvD-based configurations.</p>"
