abstract:
- content: "<p>For existing MPLS LSP tunnel services, it is hard for LSP tunnels to
    be booked in advance. In addition, once an LSP tunnel is set up, it is assumed
    to consume a certain amount of resources such as link bandwidth forever. Temporal
    LSP tunnel services (TTS) provides an easy way for us to book temporal LSP tunnels
    in advance. More importantly, a temporal LSP is an LSP with one or more time intervals
    and it is assumed to consume the resources and carry traffic only in these time
    intervals. This document specifies extensions to PCEP for computing a path for
    a temporal LSP, initiating and maintaining a temporal LSP with a sequence of time
    intervals, during each of which the LSP carries traffic.</p>"
