abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that
    arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where the sending
    rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window. It updates
    TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or rate-limited
    interval. This method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited
    traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if congestion
    is experienced. It also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV, an IETF
    experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that CWV sought
    to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used solution. This
    document therefore proposes an update to the status of RFC 2861 by recommending
    it is moved from Experimental to Historic status, and that it is replaced by the
    current specification.</p>"
