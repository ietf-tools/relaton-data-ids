abstract:
- content: "<p>The principle intention of this specification is to facilitate the
    deployment of a completely internationalized domain name syntax and service which
    new protocols, applications and host systems can use, but without disrupting the
    existing infrastructure. Towards that end, this document describes a series of
    elective encapsulation services and protocol extensions which cumulatively allow
    internationalized domain names to be stored and transmitted in the existing DNS
    message and within application data streams, according to the compliance level
    of the participating systems.</p>"
