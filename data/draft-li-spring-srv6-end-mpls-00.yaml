abstract:
- content: "<p>As the development of cloud computing, increasing services have been
    migrated from enterprise sites to clouds, so the connection between sites and
    clouds are critical for enterprises. SRv6 provides a sourcing routing mechanism
    to connect the enterprise sites and clouds by programming the end-to-end path
    at the ingress node. In this scenario, the SRv6 packets may traverse multiple
    network domains and some of them may not be SRv6-capable. In order to support
    SRv6 end-to-end path programming, this document defines the mechanism of SRv6
    traversing MPLS networks, which supports encoding MPLS tunnel information in the
    SRH.</p>"
