abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transformation method for representing non-ASCII
    characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely compatible with
    the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding
    (ACE) for internationalized host names, as described in the comparison document
    from the IETF IDN Working Group. This method is based exclusively on long-established
    mechanisms for denoting the positions of characters in tables, but included variations
    for compressing that information, also based on long-established mechanisms.</p>"
