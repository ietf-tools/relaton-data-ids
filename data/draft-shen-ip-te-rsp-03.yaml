abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to establish traffic engineering
    IP tunnels. Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) is used as a signaling protocol
    described in Generalized Multi-Protocol Lable Swithing (GMPLS) RSVP Traffic Engineering
    technology, but no MPLS forwarding capability is assumed on the switched path.
    IP routing is used to switch IP traffic trunks. A simple GMPLS RSVP Traffic Engineering
    extension is needed to setup the IP Route Switched Paths (RSPs).</p>"
