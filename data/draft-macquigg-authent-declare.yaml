abstract:
- content: "<p>A key item that must be standardized to allow interoperation of different
    email authentication methods is the ID declaration. Current authentication methods
    assume that one or another of the existing fields in a mail transfer can be used
    as the Identity to be verified. Since there is no way to tell which field, if
    any, the sender is prepared to authenticate, extra DNS queries must be made, in
    the worst-case, testing all possibilities just to find no authentication is offered
    at all. This draft proposes a neutral syntax that can be used by all methods.</p>"
