abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes technical concerns that should be considered in
    the design of standardized RDMA and DDP protocols/mechanisms for use with Internet
    transport protocols. This draft was written to provide input to the proposed new
    Remote Direct Data Placement (rddp) WG, and is not intended for publication as
    an RFC. This is an updated and resubmitted version of draft-ietf-rddp-rdma- concerns-00.txt
    to make it available for current discussions of mandatory-to-implement security
    in the RDDP WG. Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 5 are of particular relevance to that discussion.</p>"
