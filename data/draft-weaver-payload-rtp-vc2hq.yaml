abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the High Quality (HQ)
    profile of SMPTE Standard ST 2042-1 known as VC-2. This document describes the
    transport of HQ Profile VC-2 in RTP packets and has applications for low-complexity,
    high-bandwidth streaming of both lossless and lossy compressed video. The HQ profile
    of VC-2 is intended for low latency video compression (with latency potentially
    on the order of lines of video) at high data rates (with compression ratios on
    the order of 2:1 or 4:1).</p>"
