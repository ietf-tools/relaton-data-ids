abstract:
- content: <p>The Sieve scripting language allows users to control handling and disposal
    of their incoming e-mail. By default, an e-mail message that is processed by a
    Sieve script is saved in the owner's "inbox". Actions such as "fileinto" and "redirect"
    cancel this default behavior. This document defines a new keyword parameter, ":copy",
    to be used with the Sieve "fileinto" and "redirect" actions. Adding ":copy" to
    an action suppresses cancellation of the default "inbox" save. It allows users
    to add commands to an existing script without changing the meaning of the rest
    of the script. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
