abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is proposed for providing key information for use between
    a mobile node and correspondent node, to be used for the purpose of authenticating
    Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates. The key distribution is secure except against man-in-the-middle
    attacks, when the attacker resides along the routing path between the correspondent
    node and the mobile node's home agent. The key can be used for authenticating
    subsequent Binding Updates from the same mobile node, substantially reducing the
    number of key establishment cycles needed for maintaining efficient communication
    paths between the mobile node and correspondent node.</p>"
