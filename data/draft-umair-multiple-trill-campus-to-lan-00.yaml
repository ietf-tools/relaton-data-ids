abstract:
- content: <p>TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can
    have multiple end stations and RBridges attached. Where multiple RBridges are
    attached to a link, native traffic to and from end stations on that link is handled
    by a subset of those RBridges called "Appointed Forwarders", with the intent that
    native traffic in each VLAN (Virtual LAN) be handled by at most one RBridge. But
    when two trill campuses are connected through a LAN network, AF selection for
    each campus should be selected differently. This type of scenario occurs when
    two different TRILL Campuses are connected to single LAN and want access to common
    set of VLAN's. The following paper is an attempt to handle such scenario.</p>
