abstract:
- content: "<p>The base Mobile IP allows a host to transparently send datagrams to
    mobile nodes as it would to any other nodes. Datagrams addressed to the mobile
    are always routed via the Home Agent in the home network. However, as the mobile
    node moves away from its home network, it may no longer be topologically close
    to its home agent. Route optimization [MIP-OPTIM] has been proposed to allow a
    host to send packets to the mobile as a mobile node (MN) moves, without having
    to route the packets via the home agent each time. The mobile provides its current
    address to a host (or correspondent node, CN) that it is communicating with as
    it moves. The host updates the cache of the mobile location with this new address
    and tunnels datagrams (addressed to the mobile) to the current address of the
    mobile. However not all correspondent nodes are capable of tunneling IP datagrams
    as required by the route optimization mechanisms described in [MIP-OPTIM]. More
    importantly, disclosing the current location (or COA) of the mobile node to correspondent
    nodes is not always desirable, nor is the overhead of encapsulating datagram to
    the MN ideal.</p>"
