abstract:
- content: "<p>Current routing mechanism is based on the shortest path, which only
    take the link status and the path accessibility into consideration, without the
    security and trustworthiness of links and forwarding nodes. As security has become
    an important factor to the user. This paper proposes to add security factor in
    the routing process. With the frequent occurrence of security incidents, services
    security is an essential demand for the users. As there are many security devices
    in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure routing mechanism. The purpose
    of secure routing is to converge security and routing to ensure the secure data
    transmission. The scope is transmission process security, while end-to-end security
    and application layer security are out of scope.</p>"
