abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. This IANA
    Charset MIB is now an IANA registry. In particular, a single textual convention
    'IANACharset' is defined that may be used to specify charset labels in MIB objects.
    'IANACharset' was extracted from Printer MIB v2 (RFC 3805). 'IANACharset' was
    originally defined (and mis-named) as 'CodedCharSet' in Printer MIB v1 (RFC 1759).
    A tool has been written in C, that may be used by IANA to regenerate this IANA
    Charset MIB, when future charsets are registered in accordance with the IANA Charset
    Registration Procedures (RFC 2978). This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
