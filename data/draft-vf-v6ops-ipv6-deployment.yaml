abstract:
- content: "<p>Looking globally, IPv6 is growing faster than IPv4 and this means that
    the collective wisdom of the networking industry has selected IPv6 for the future.
    This document provides an overview of IPv6 transition deployment status and a
    view on how the transition to IPv6 is progressing among network operators and
    enterprises that are introducing IPv6 or have already adopted an IPv6-only solution.
    It also aims to analyze the transition challenges and therefore encourage actions
    and more investigations on some areas that are still under discussion. The overall
    IPv6 incentives are also examined.</p>"
