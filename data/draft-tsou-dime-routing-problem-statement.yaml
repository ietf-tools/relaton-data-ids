- content: "<p>This document describes use cases that suggest a requirement to be
    able to add constraints to the existing Diameter routing mechanisms so that subsequent
    messages in a session pass through specific proxies that were on the initial path
    that set up the session. Routing between these proxies may use the present Diameter
    rules.</p>"
