abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on periodic multicast Router Advertisement
    messages to update timer values and to distribute new information (such as new
    prefixes) to hosts. On some links the use of periodic multicast messages to all
    host becomes expensive, and in some cases it results in hosts waking up frequently.
    Many implementations of RFC 4861 also use multicast for solicited Router Advertisement
    messages, even though that behavior is optional. This specification provides an
    optional mechanism for hosts and routers where instead of periodic multicast Router
    Advertisements the hosts are instructed (by the routers) to use unicast Router
    Solicitations to request refreshed Router Advertisements. This mechanism is enabled
    by configuring the router to include a new option in the Router Advertisement
    in order to allow the network administrator to choose host behavior based on whether
    periodic multicast are more efficient on their link or not. The routers can also
    tell whether the hosts are capable of the new behavior through a new flag in the
    Router Solicitations.</p>"
