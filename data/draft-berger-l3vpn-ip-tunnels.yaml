abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a routing architecture that is most applicable
    to Customer Edge (CE)-based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). In this architecture,
    customer devices use BGP to exchange VPN routes with one another. The BGP UPDATES
    include a new attribute that identifies the endpoint of a tunnel that can be used
    to reach a particular VPN prefix. The encapsulation strategy described in this
    memo is more flexible than that described in RFC 4364. In this architecture, the
    edge router can encapsulate the original datagram twice, as in RFC 4364. In this
    case, the inner header provides VPN context and the outer header identifies the
    tunnel between edge routers. Alternatively, the edge router can encapsulate the
    original datagram only once, with the tunnel providing both VPN context and identifying
    a tunnel to the remote edge router.Contents</p>"
