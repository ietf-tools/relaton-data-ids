abstract:
- content: "<p>LCONVERT defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for
    optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at allowing adaptation and transcoding
    of attachments as needed by the client. Conversion (adaptation, transcoding) may
    be requested by the client and performed by the server on a best effort basis
    or decided by the server based on its knowledge of the client capabilities, user
    or administrator preferences or its settings.</p>"
