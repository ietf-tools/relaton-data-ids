abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts
    of hosts in the data center. These issues include the prevalent use of IP Multicast
    within the Data Center. Its important to understand how IP Multicast is being
    deployed in the Data Center to be able to understand the surrounding issues with
    doing so. This document provides a quick survey of uses of multicast in the data
    center and should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related to large
    amounts of multicast in the data center.</p>"
