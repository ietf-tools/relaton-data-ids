abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, satellites are becoming major vectors of the information diffusion
    on the Internet. Their use can prove to be fully useful for the cache pre-filling
    because they allow big volumes of data to be transferred at high speed (up to
    45 Mb/s) and to be distributed simultaneously on several reception dishes. When
    having this pre- filling information on the cache, users can benefit from better
    access time to the stored pages. In this context, the satellite allows the quality
    of service for the end user to be improved by optimizing satellite links and by
    transferring large volumes of data directly only when the traffic on the network
    is low.</p>"
