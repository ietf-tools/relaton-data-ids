abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an
    interface on a network device. Routing protocols have been developed based on
    the assumption that a destination address has this semantic. Many proposals have
    been made to add semantics to IPv6 addresses. These proposals may set the meaning
    of an address within the scope of a limited domain, or suggest an address semantic
    that is meaningful at specific points in the network (such as the source and destination),
    but which can continue to be used without special interpretation at transit points.
    Such proposals include providing semantics specific to mobile networks, multicast
    traffic, different device types, different underlying connectivity, hierarchical
    connectivity, geographic location, application or network function usage, or connectivity
    requirements. Some new IP address semantics may have implications for how network
    routing is performed. Some proposals might not be supported by existing routing
    protocols and so would require changes. Other proposals might enable advanced
    routing features or offer benefits in scaling and management of routing systems.
    This document presents a brief survey of technologies related to IP address semantic
    proposals and describes the challenges to the existing routing system that they
    present. It then summarises the opportunities for research into new or modified
    routing protocols to make use of new address semantics. This document is presented
    as research to clarify and understand the issues without directly proposing technical
    solutions that are ready for productisation or deployment.</p>"
