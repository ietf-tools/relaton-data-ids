abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for SIP proxies to communicate a
    spam score to downstream SIP proxies and to SIP user agents. This information
    can then be used as input to other decision making engines, for example, to provide
    alternate call routing or call handling.</p>"
