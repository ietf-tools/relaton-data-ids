abstract:
- content: "<p>The simple mode for Internet fax described in [1] relies on transmission
    of documents using a minimum feature set to achieve interoperability between sender
    and receiver. Proposals for extended Internet fax [2,3] aim to provide for transmission
    of enhanced documents (e.g. higher resolutions, colour) by employing mechanisms
    to identify recipient capabilities to the sender, in the same fashion as traditional
    Group 3 fax [4]. This memo describes some of the scenarios for capability exchange
    in Internet fax, taking account of the particular nature and goals of the application
    [5], with a view to informing the debate over what mechanisms should be used for
    this purpose.</p>"
