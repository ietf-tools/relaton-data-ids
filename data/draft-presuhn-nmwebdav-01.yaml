abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo examines the potential of using WWW Distributed Authoring
    and Versioning (WebDAV) technologies to address the problems of network configuration
    management. It reviews requirements and issues that have been identified in IETF
    network configuration management and operator requirements discussions, matching
    these requirements and issues with various WebDAV facilities. It concludes by
    identifying areas for further exploration. Comments are welcomed, both from the
    Operations and Management Area in general, and from participants in the webdav
    and deltav working groups in particular. Please send comments to the author at
    randy_presuhn@bmc.com.</p>"
