abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3046 allows only the first Relay Agent to append Relay Agent Information
    option. In some networks, Layer 2 Relay Agents and Layer 3 Relay Agents are deployed
    but only Layer 2 Relay Agent appends the Relay Agent Information option. This
    document describes two pretty common network scenarios that uses Layer 2 and Layer
    3 Relay Agents and their unique requirements where either DHCP server or Relay
    Agent need more information to handle DHCP messages.</p>"
