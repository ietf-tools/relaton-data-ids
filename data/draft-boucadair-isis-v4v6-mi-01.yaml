abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) in IS-IS
    [RFC1195]). These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-isis-mi] are meant to instantiate
    distinct IS-IS instances to convey routing information which is restricted to
    IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]. The ultimate goal
    of running separate instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes is to isolate the IPv6
    routing table from the IPv4 routing table, and to avoid any overload due to the
    population of the table by IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes. This isolation is motivated
    also from an operational perspective to allow the enforcement of specific routing
    policies for each topology.</p>"
