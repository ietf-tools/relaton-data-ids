abstract:
- content: "<p>In describing content internetworking as a technology targeted for
    use in production networks, it is useful to provide examples of the sequence of
    events that may occur when two content networks decide to interconnect. The scenarios
    presented here seek to provide some concrete examples of what content internetworking
    is, and also to provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking proposals.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
