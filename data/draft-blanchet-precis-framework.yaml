abstract:
- content: <p>Application protocols that make use of Unicode code points in protocol
    strings need to prepare such strings in order to perform comparison operations
    (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization). In general, this problem
    has been labeled the "preparation and comparison of internationalized strings"
    or "PRECIS". This document defines a framework that enables application protocols
    to prepare various classes of strings in a way that depends on the properties
    of Unicode code points. Because this framework does not depend on large tables
    of Unicode code points as in stringprep (RFC 3454), it is more agile with regard
    to changes in the underlying Unicode database and thus provides improved flexibility
    to application protocols. A specification that uses this framework either can
    directly use the base string classes defined in this document or can subclass
    the base string classes as needed. This framework uses an approach similar to
    that of the revised internationalized domain names in applications (IDNA) technology
    (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the high-level
    design goals described in RFC 4690, albeit for application technologies other
    than the Domain Name System (DNS). This document obsoletes RFC 3454.</p>
