abstract:
- content: "<p>The privacy requirement of anonymity is much harder to achieve than
    security goals like confidentiality or authentication, since network routing has
    to take place between well known spots of the network. There are solutions providing
    anonymity on the Internet implemented on the application level, but there's also
    a possibility to achieve local anonymity on Ethernet networks without the introduction
    of new anonymous protocols by following a protocol anonymizing approach described
    in this document. Protocol anonymization is a simple network operation mode, which
    can provide local client anonymity on Ethernet networks under certain circumstances
    by eliminating the host identification capabilities of widely used local network
    protocols.</p>"
