abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of a transition
    from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such that the data in the root zone
    is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures to allow validation. The underlying reason
    for signing the root zone is to be able to provide a more secure DNS hierarchy,
    where it is possible to distinguish false answers from correct answers. For the
    special case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme is proposed. This scheme
    is mostly aimed at securing the root zone itself for technical and operational
    reasons, and to give operational experience of DNSSEC.</p>"
