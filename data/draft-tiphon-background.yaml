abstract:
- content: "<p>The background and objectives of the new ETSI project Tiphon architecture
    are described in this draft. The architecture is shown to be capable of use by
    a number of different signalling systems and session control protocols, including
    SIP and H.323. The opportunity exists for the IETF to help with the technology
    mappings for SIP to ensure inter-operation with other technologies through the
    TIPHON architecture.</p>"
