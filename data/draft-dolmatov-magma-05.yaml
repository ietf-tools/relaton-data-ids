abstract:
- content: <p>In addition to a new cipher with block length of n=128 bits (referred
    to as "Kyznyechik" and described in RFC 7801) Russian Federal standard GOST R
    34.12-2015 includes an updated version of the block cipher with block length of
    n=64 bits and key length k=256 bits, which is also referred to as "Magma". The
    algorithm is an updated version of an older block cipher with block length of
    n=64 bits described in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830). This document is intended to
    be a source of information about the updated version of the 64-bit cipher. It
    may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet applications by providing
    information for developers and users of GOST 64-bit cipher with the revised version
    of the cipher for encryption and decryption.</p>
