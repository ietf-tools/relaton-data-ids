abstract:
- content: "<p>According to RFC 3046, there is only one DHCP Option 82 allowed in
    a certain DHCP message. This document describes several cases that need more than
    one Relay Agent to add link information. Proposed method is to have different
    Relay Agents add multiple DHCP Option 82.</p>"
