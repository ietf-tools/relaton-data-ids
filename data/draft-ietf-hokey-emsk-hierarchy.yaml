abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) defined the Extended Master
    Session Key (EMSK) generation, but reserved it for unspecified future uses. This
    memo reserves the EMSK for the sole purpose of deriving root keys. Root keys are
    master keys that can be used for multiple purposes, identified by usage definitions.
    This document also specifies a mechanism for avoiding conflicts between root keys
    by deriving them in a manner that guarantees cryptographic separation. Finally,
    this document also defines one such root key usage: Domain-Specific Root Keys
    are root keys made available to and used within specific key management domains.
