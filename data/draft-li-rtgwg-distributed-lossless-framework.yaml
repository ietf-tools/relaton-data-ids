abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rapid development of large language models, it puts forward
    higher requirements for the networking scale of data centers. Distributed model
    training has been proposed to shorten the training time and relieve the resource
    demand in a single data center.This document proposes a framework to address the
    challenge of efficient lossless interconnection and reliable data transmission
    between multiple data centers, which can connect multiple data centers to form
    a larger cluster through network connection. The document further conducts in-depth
    research on the key technologies and application scenarios of this distributed
    AIDC network.</p>"
