abstract:
- content: "<p>The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, defines
    a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles)
    for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed packet streams. However,
    no profile was defined for compression of IP only, which has been identified as
    a flaw in RFC 3095. This document addresses that problem and defines a ROHC compression
    profile for IP, similar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified
    to exclude UDP.</p>"
