abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes two types of multicast transport over IEEE 802.16
    networks. One is deirect mapping for IPv6 CS and the other is indirect mapping
    for both IPv6 over Ethernet CS and IPv6 over VLAN CS. An IPv6 multicast address
    transmits directly to a CID of IEEE 802.16 frame in direct mapping scheme. In
    indirect mapping, an IPv6 multicast address uses [RFC2464] and then transmits
    to a CID of IEEE 802.16 frame.</p>"
