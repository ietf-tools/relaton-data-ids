abstract:
- content: "<p>The main purpose of this document is to propose new Conference Call
    Service for the PINT WG. This document contains a description of a Conference
    Call Service for PINT (CCSP), provides a non-exhaustive list of PINT requests
    (PINT Conference Building Blocks) to support them, and describes the needed extensions
    to the current PINT architecture. Current PINT services, such as Request to Call,
    use the Internet only to deliver service requests from an IP host to the PSTN
    to be executed there. However, limiting the PINT Conference service to just delivering
    the request to allocate the conference bridge to the PSTN, would hardly justify
    the practicality of the service. The PINT Conference Service described in this
    document allows for the following functionality: o manual or automated negotiation
    of conference parameters, such as date, agenda, etc., before the PSTN resources
    are committed; o requesting the PSTN to allocate the conference bridge; o requesting
    the PSTN to start the conference automatically by calling each participant at
    the specified time; A proposal for new PINT building blocks with applications
    to Conference Calling o monitoring real-time conference events by keeping track
    of the current speaker as well as of participants leaving or joining the conference
    bridge. Unlike the current PINT services, which require exactly one request per
    service, the proposed Conference Call Service with the above functionality, needs
    to be mapped into a number of PINT requests. In this paper we propose a non-exhaustive
    list of PINT requests to support the basic CCSP functionality. We also discuss
    the extensions to the current PINT architecture that are needed to support the
    CCSP. If the service proposal is approved by the PINT WG, the protocol issues
    such as profiling SIP, SDP, etc. will be addressed in the forthcoming documents.
    This document is intended for the PSTN-Internet Interworking (PINT) worki</p>"
