abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. Segment routing (SR) leverages
    the source routing and tunneling paradigms. The Stateful PCEP extensions allow
    stateful control of Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (TE) Paths. Furthermore,
    PCEP can be used for computing SR TE paths in the network. This document defines
    PCEP extensions for optimizing the arrangement of segment lists to solve the problem
    of the penultimate segment node being unable to perform PSP behavior when the
    egress node has both End SID and service SID, and improve the forwarding efficiency
    of data packets.</p>"
