abstract:
- content: "<p>Diameter has received wide acceptance in large scale networking based
    on applications like Network Access Server and Credit Control. Different Standards
    Development Organizations consider Diameter as base protocol for extended applications,
    e.g. to push or pull information between a Diameter client and server without
    alignment of application states and identification schemes with the Session-ID
    concept as utilized by the Diameter protocol. The use of Diameter bulk signaling
    to enable transmission of multi-user context with a single or few messages for
    application state recovery after failure represents a further use case, which
    requires investigation on its impact to the Diameter base specification. This
    document analyzes various use cases for Diameter bulk signaling and assesses practices
    to enable operation of such use cases from extended or new applications.</p>"
