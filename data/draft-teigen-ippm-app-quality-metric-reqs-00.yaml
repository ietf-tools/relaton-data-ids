abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the features and attributes a network quality
    framework must have to be useful for different stakeholders. The stakeholders
    included are developers of Applications, End-Users, and Network Operators and
    Vendors. At a high level, End-Users need an understandable network metric. Application
    developers need a network metric that allows them to evaluate how well their application
    is likely to perform given the measured network performance. Network Operators
    and Vendors need a metric that facilitates troubleshooting and optimization of
    their networks. Existing network quality metrics and frameworks typically address
    the needs of one or two of these stakeholders, but we have yet to find one that
    bridges the needs of all three.</p>"
