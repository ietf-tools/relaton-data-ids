abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation by recursive DNS resolvers
    has been deployed at scale. However, domain signing tools and processes are not
    yet as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration
    tools and processes. This sometimes results in DNSSEC-validation failures, for
    which operators of validating resolvers are often blamed. This is similar to other,
    non-DNSSEC-related authoritative DNS errors, for which individual recursive DNS
    operators are sometimes incorrectly blamed. This document makes clear that responsibility
    for any and all authoritative DNS failures rests squarely with authoritative domain
    name operators, who are the only party that can properly maintain their domain
    names and rectify associated authoritative DNS errors.</p>"
