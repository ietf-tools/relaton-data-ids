abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the requirements of the MPLS transport profile [RFC 5654] is
    to provide linear protection for transport paths, which include both LSPs and
    PWs. The functional architecture described in [SurvivFwk] is applicable to both
    LSP and PWs, however [LinearProt] does not explicitly describe mechanisms for
    PW protection in MPLS-TP. This document extends the applicability of the linear
    protection mechanism described in [LinearProt] to MPLS-TP segmented PWs (MS-PWs)
    as defined in [RFC 6073].</p>"
