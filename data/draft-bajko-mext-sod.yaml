abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols require the signaling
    messages between the mobile node and home agent to be secured. However security
    for the user plane/traffic is optional and is a choice left to the mobile node.
    This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling which enables the user
    plane traffic to be secured on a need or on-demand basis. The mobile node or the
    home agent can request at any time security for the user plane traffic. Security
    for user plane traffic can be triggered as a result of policy or, mobility or,
    at the user's choice.</p>"
