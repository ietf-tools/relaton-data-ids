abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a pledge to an owner,
    using an intermediary node between pledge and owner. This intermediary node is
    known as a "constrained-join-proxy". This document extends the work of [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
    by replacing the Circuit- proxy by a stateless constrained join-proxy, that uses
    IP encapsulation.</p>
