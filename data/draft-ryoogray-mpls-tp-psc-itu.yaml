abstract:
- content: '<p>This document introduces alternate ways to perform certain operations
    defined in RFC6378, "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection", and
    also defines additional behaviors. This set of modified and additional behaviors
    together with the protocol defined in RFC6378 meets the ITU-T''s protection switching
    requirements. This document introduces capabilities and modes. A capability is
    an individual behavior. The capabilities of a node are advertised using the method
    given in this document. A mode is a particular combination of capabilities. Two
    modes are defined in this document: Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode and
    Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode. This document describes the behavior
    of the PSC protocol including priority logic and state machine when all the capabilities
    associated with the APS mode are enabled. This document updates RFC6378 in that
    the capability advertisement method defined here is an addition to that document.</p>'
