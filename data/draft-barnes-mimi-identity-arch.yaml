abstract:
- content: "<p>End-to-end (E2E) security is a critical property for modern user communications
    systems. E2E security protects users' communications from tampering or inspection
    by intermediaries that are involved in delivering those communcations from one
    logical endpoint to another. In addition to the much-discussed E2E encryption
    systems, true E2E security requires an identity mechanism that prevents the communications
    provider from impersonating participants in a session, as a way to gain access
    to the session. This document describes a high-level architecture for E2E identity,
    identifying the critical mechanisms that need to be specified.</p>"
