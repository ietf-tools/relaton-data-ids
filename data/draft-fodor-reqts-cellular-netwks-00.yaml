abstract:
- content: "<p>We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP level
    QoS primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wireless systems (beyond
    what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodes may access an IP backbone
    over diverse access networks, the IP level QoS primitives are not only used to
    specify the requested IP level service, but also (through an access specific translation
    function) to help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure the wireless
    bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoS primitives must meet special
    requirements in order to support the spectrum efficient management of the wireless
    resources.</p>"
