abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the requirements for the management of equipment
    used in networks supporting an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). The requirements
    are defined for specification of network management aspects of protocol mechanisms
    and procedures that constitute the building blocks out of which the MPLS Transport
    Profile is constructed. That is, these requirements indicate what management capabilities
    need to be available in MPLS for use in managing the MPLS-TP. This document is
    intended to identify essential network management capabilities, not to specify
    what functions any particular MPLS implementation supports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
