abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents covers issues of spam reporting by the general public.
    The Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) was originally developed for use by large operators.
    However, abuse reporting is also useful for medium and small operators. The need
    to automate abuse reporting originates from the volume of spam, not the size of
    the operators.</p>"
