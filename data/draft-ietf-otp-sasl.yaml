- content: "<p>OTP provides a useful authentication mechanism for situations where
    there is limited client or server trust. Currently, OTP is added to protocols
    in an ad-hoc fashion with heuristic parsing. This specification defines an OTP
    SASL mechanism so it can be easily and formally integrated into many application
    protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
