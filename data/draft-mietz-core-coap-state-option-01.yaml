abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices which
    are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such as temperature
    on a precise scale. These sensor values are made available by a resource on the
    CoAP endpoint. However, for many applications it is not necessary to have the
    full precision a sensor can provide. It's often even enough to only have some
    high-level states instead of raw values. This document presents a new option for
    CoAP to dynamically create new resources for a sensor which provides user-defined
    high-level states instead of raw sensor values.</p>"
