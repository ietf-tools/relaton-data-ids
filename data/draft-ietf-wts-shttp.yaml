abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a syntax for securing messages sent using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for the World Wide Web. Secure
    HTTP (S-HTTP) provides independently applicable security services for transaction
    confidentiality, authenticity/integrity and non-repudiability of origin. The protocol
    emphasizes maximum flexibility in choice of key management mechanisms, security
    policies and cryptographic algorithms by supporting option negotiation between
    parties for each transaction.</p>"
