abstract:
- content: "<p>Generic requirements for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    have been described in [6]. This draft lists ATM specific requirements and provides
    encapsulation formats and semantics for connecting ATM edge networks through a
    core packet network using IP, L2TP or MPLS. This basic application of ATM interworking
    will allow ATM service providers to take advantage of new technologies in the
    core in order to provide ATM multi-services.</p>"
