abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain-of-trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This
    document specifies two different ways for validating resolvers to signal to a
    server which keys are referenced in their chain-of-trust. The data from such signaling
    allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC-signed
    zone. This document describes two independent methods for validating resolvers
    to publish their referenced keys: an EDNS option and a differnt DNS query. The
    reason there are two methods instead of one is some people see significant problems
    with each method. Having two methods is clearly worse than having just one, but
    it is probably better for the Internet than having no way to gain the information
    from the resolvers.</p>"
