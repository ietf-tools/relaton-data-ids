abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet operation has typically required no public mechanism for announcing
    restriction or permission of particular hosts to operate clients or servers for
    particular services on behalf of particular domains. What is missing is an open,
    interoperable means by which a trusted agency can announce authorization for a
    host to operate a service. The current specification supports this capability
    for sending SMTP clients. Specifically, is a sending SMTP client permitted to
    act as a client MTA? Has a separate authority given it permission to perform this
    service? Client SMTP Authorization (CSA) specifies a DNS-based record that states
    whether an associated host has permission to operate as a client MTA.</p>"
