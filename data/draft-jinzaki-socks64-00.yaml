abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an IPv4-IPv6 intercommunication method based on
    the SOCKS5 protocol. The method is called SOCKS64, and was first announced in
    the 40th IETF meeting at Washington DC in December 1997 as one of three translators
    being developed in the WIDE Project. SOCKS64 is a gateway system that accepts
    SOCKS5 connections from IPv4 hosts and relays it to IPv4/IPv6 hosts using proper
    protocols. We have designed and implemented a prototype SOCKS64 system and have
    been testing the prototype in many environments. Also we are distributing the
    prototype as a KAME distribution package. This article describes the SOCKS64;
    its principle, implementation, experimental results and comparison to other IPv4-IPv6
    intercommunication methods.</p>"
