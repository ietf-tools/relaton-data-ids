- content: "<p>In any presence application, it is frequently necessary for the user
    to configure a number of pieces of information. Users will need to manipulate
    their presentity list, adding and removing presentities, and manipulate their
    authorization lists, which specify the set of users that can subscribe to their
    presence. In this document, we provide a framework and requirements for such data
    manipulations.</p>"
