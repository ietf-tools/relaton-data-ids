abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G (TN-AWARE- MOBILITY)
    specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems' Slice and Service Types
    (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths to ensure the desired QoS for
    the services.The focus of (TN- AWARE-MOBILITY) is limited to the 3GPP domain and
    doesn't cover the network for user plane traffic between the UPFs and the services
    hosted in data centers. This document describes the mechanisms to achieve the
    same QoS for the mobility traffic from the 3GPP domain to the service destinations
    over the IP Data Networks. Extending the QoS guarantee for the SSTs to the data
    centers where the services are hosted becomes necessary to maintain the end-to-end
    QoS for data plane traffic between UEs and their corresponding service destinations.</p>"
