abstract:
- content: <p>NAT (Network Address Translator) Traversal may require TURN (Traversal
    Using Relays around NAT) functionality in certain cases that are not unlikely
    to occur. There is little incentive to deploy TURN servers, except by those who
    need them -- who may not be in a position to deploy a new protocol on an Internet-connected
    node, in particular not one with deployment requirements as high as those of TURN.
    "STUN/TURN using PHP in Despair" is a highly deployable protocol for obtaining
    TURN-like functionality, while also providing the most important function of STUN.</p>
