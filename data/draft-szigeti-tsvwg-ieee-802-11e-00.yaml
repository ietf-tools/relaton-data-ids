abstract:
- content: "<p>As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to wireless
    endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned between wired and
    wireless networks; however, this is not always the case by default. This is due
    to the fact that two independent standards bodies provide QoS guidance on wired
    and wireless networks: specifically, the IETF offers design recommendations for
    wired IP networks, while a separate and autonomous standards-body, the IEEE, administers
    the standards for wireless 802.11e networks. The purpose of this document is to
    propose a set Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11e User Priority
    (UP) mappings to reconcile the design recommendations offered by these two standards
    bodies, and, as such, to optimize wired-and-wireless interconnect QoS.</p>"
