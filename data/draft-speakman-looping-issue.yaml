abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the routing loop and packet looping issues
    in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) running proactive routing protocols using hop
    count metric. Mechanisms of loop formation are identified and how the problem
    of loop formation is exacerbated by the use of Link Layer Notification is described.
    The effect of the looping packets on the network are shown by comparing against
    the case where the looping packets are detected and discarded, showing the need
    for routing loops or looping packets to be dealt with in MANETs.</p>"
