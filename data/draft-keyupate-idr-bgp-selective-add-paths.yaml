abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-ietf-idr-add-paths] defines a BGP extension that allows the
    advertisement of multiple paths for the same address prefix without the new paths
    implicitly replacing any previous ones. The essence of the extension is that each
    path is identified by a path identifier in addition to the address prefix. This
    draft augments functionality defined in [draft-ietf-idr-add-paths] to facilitate
    advertisement of multiple paths for a subset of prefixes in a given address family.
    Prefixes are selected through specification of a well-known BGP extended community.</p>"
