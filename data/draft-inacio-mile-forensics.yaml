abstract:
- content: "<p>This extension to IODEF (RFC 5070) is designed to aid in the sharing
    and dissemination of digital forensics information. The goal is to allow a tool
    independent format to share information between organizations focused on digital
    forensics: drive images, file carving, metadata, and related hashes. As with IODEF
    and its extensions, it is defined using XML.</p>"
