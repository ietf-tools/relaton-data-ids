    information of various object combinations based on the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP) with proper frequency. The purpose of this document is to propose
    two algorithms to retrieve MIB information for a large (up to exponential) number
    of managed objects using SNMP in Next Generation Internet (NGI).</p>"
