abstract:
- content: "<p>To date, a number of authentication protocols have been proposed for
    Mobile-IP. Among these incompatible protocols, it is not clear until now which
    one will be the preferred one for global deployment of Mobile-IP. Based on the
    policy of allowing various protocols to co-exist, this draft specifies an authentication
    framework that allows Mobile-IP entities to negotiate for a protocol to be employed.
    The framework also outlines the utilization of message extension for carrying
    all information required by the authentication protocol being used. Based on the
    proposed framework, this draft then proposes a 'Minimal Public Key Based Authentication'
    which addresses the need for scalable but lightweight authentication protocol.
    The proposed protocol secures the registration process, and requires a number
    of message rounds that is fully compatible with the base Mobile-IP.</p>"
