- content: "<p>This document defines the federation concept and proposes a peering
    and routing architecture for SIP-based applications. Federations can be used to
    establish selective peerings e.g. in the Voice over IP and Instant Messaging space.
    Service providers may announce federation membership as domain attributes. This
    document contains the policy- type definition for federations within the Domain
    Policy DDDS Application.</p>"
