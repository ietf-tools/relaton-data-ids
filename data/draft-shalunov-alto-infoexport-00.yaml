abstract:
- content: '<p>The ALTO Information Export Service is a simple way to convey ISP routing
    policy preferences to applications. Applications that could use this service are
    those that have a choice in connection endpoints. Examples of such applications
    are peer-to-peer and content delivery networks. Applications already have access
    to great amount of underlying topology information. For example, views of the
    Internet routing table are easily available at looking glass servers and entirely
    practical to download to every client. What is missing is the routing policy information
    -- what does the local ISP actually prefer? This document describes a very simple
    mechanism that would allow to export such information to applications. While such
    service would primarily be provided by the network, i.e., the local ISP, third
    parties could also operate this service.1. Requirements notation The key words
    "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in [RFC2119].2. Overview Each network region can choose to support the
    ALTO service. (A network region in this context is an Autonomous System, an ISP,
    or perhaps a smaller region -- the details depend on the mechanism of discovery.)
    The service works as follows: 1. The ISP prepares the ALTO information. This maps
    some IP prefixes or AS numbers into priority values. Higher priority values indicate
    higher desirability of the prefix. There is a default treatment for IP numbers
    that are in none of the prefixes or AS numbers. 2. The ISP serializes the information
    into a sequence of octets (Section 4). 3. The application, running on a given
    host, discovers the resource and fetches the serialized ALTO information (Section
    3). 4. The application makes use of the information by preferring IP numbers with
    higher priority (Section 5). The part of the ISP MAY be implemented, to give a
    few examples that do not preclude other implementation options, by running a script
    connecting to existing equipment, fetching routing information, and then generating
    and uploading the requisite file; by running a database-backed application that
    is obtains routing information from existing equipment and generates the requisite
    file dynamically; by modifying the software or hardware of existing equipment
    to support these functions; or by using new equipment for the purpose of operating
    this network service.3. Discovery Discovery per se is out of scope for this document
    and will be handled separately. The necessary property of discovery is that a
    client, starting from nothing on today''s Internet that does not yet universally
    support global-scope multicast and may include NATs, can find a URL that describes
    the location of the local ALTO service, as configured by the ISP. Subsequent sections
    assume that this URL is found. So that maximum number of clients can use the ALTO
    service, the URL schema SHOULD be "http" or "https".</p>'
