abstract:
- content: <p>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
    a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used by anyone
    on the Internet to route a request to that specific UA instance. A URI which routes
    to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU). An Internet-Draft
    is progressing toward standardization that specifies procedures for proxies and
    UAs by which proxies can construct and delver GRUUs to UAs that request them.
    This document summarizes for UA implementors how to obtain "public" GRUUs and
    gives guidance on effectively using public GRUUs.</p>
