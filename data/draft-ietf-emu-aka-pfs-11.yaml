abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations associated
    with pervasive surveillance. Some of the reported attacks involved compromising
    the smart card supply chain, such as attacking Universal Subscriber Identity Module
    (USIM) card manufacturers and operators in an effort to compromise long-term keys
    stored on these cards. Since the publication of those reports, manufacturing and
    provisioning processes have received much scrutiny and have improved. However,
    resourceful attackers are always a cause for concern. Always assuming a breach,
    such as long-term key compromise, and minimizing the impact of breach are essential
    zero trust principles. This document updates RFC 9048, the improved Extensible
    Authentication Protocol Method for 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication and Key
    Agreement (EAP-AKA'), with an optional extension providing ephemeral key exchange.
    Similarly, this document also updates the earlier version of the EAP-AKA' specification
    in RFC 5448. The extension EAP-AKA' Forward Secrecy (EAP-AKA' FS), when negotiated,
    provides forward secrecy for the session keys generated as a part of the authentication
    run in EAP-AKA'. This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the long-term
    key from obtaining session keys established in the past, assuming these have been
    properly deleted. In addition, EAP-AKA' FS mitigates passive attacks (e.g., large
    scale pervasive monitoring) against future sessions. This forces attackers to
    use active attacks instead.</p>"
