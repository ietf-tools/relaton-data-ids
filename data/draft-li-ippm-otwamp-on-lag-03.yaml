abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to One-way Active Measurement Protocol
    (OWAMP), and Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) to implement performance
    measurement on every member link of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG). Knowing the
    measured metrics of each member link of a LAG enables operators to enforce the
    performance based traffic steering policy across the member links.</p>"
