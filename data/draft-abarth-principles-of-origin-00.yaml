- content: "<p>The security model of the web platform has evolved over time to meet
    the needs of new applications and to correct earlier mistakes. Although web security
    has evolved largely organically, the security model has converged towards a handful
    of key concepts. This document presents those concepts and provides advice to
    designers of new pieces of the web platform.</p>"
