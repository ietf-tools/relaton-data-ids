abstract:
- content: "<p>One aspect of network mobility support is the assignment of a prefix
    or prefixes to a mobile router for use on the links in the mobile network. This
    document specifies how DHCPv6 prefix delegation can be used for this configuration
    task. The mobile router plays the role of requesting router, while the home agent
    assumes the role of delegating router. When the mobile router is outside its home
    network, the mobile router also assumes the role of DHCPv6 relay agent, co-located
    with the requesting router function. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
