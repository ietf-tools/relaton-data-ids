abstract:
- content: "<p>The SAV rules of existing source address validation (SAV) mechanisms,
    are derived from other core data structures, e.g., FIB-based uRPF, which are not
    dedicatedly designed for source filtering. Therefore there are some limitations
    related to deployable scenarios and traffic handling policies. To overcome these
    limitations, this document introduces the general SAV capabilities from data plane
    perspective. How to implement the capabilities and how to generate SAV rules are
    not in the scope of this document.</p>"
