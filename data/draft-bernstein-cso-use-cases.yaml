abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes traffic use-cases of cross-stratum optimization.
    Examples of current application traffic that can require individual or aggregate
    bandwidth significant enough to consider joint application and network stratum
    cooperation/optimization are given and basic optimization problems are outlined.
    For each of these generic use cases we also consider enhanced availability and
    or recovery scenarios and discuss the control interfaces useful to promote cross
    stratum optimization.</p>"
