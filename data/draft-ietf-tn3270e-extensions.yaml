abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses issues and implementation problems defined and
    discussed at the TN3270E/TN5250E Interoperability Events. It does not replace
    the current TN3270 Enhancements protocol. It describes functional extensions to
    the TN3270E protocol. The TN3270E function negotiation mechanism is used to allow
    the server and client to determine which, if any, of these functions will be supported
    during a session. This preserves backward compatibility between clients and servers
    that do not support these features. Among the issues to be address by this draft
    are SNA/TN3270E Contention state resolution and SNA Sense Code support.</p>"
