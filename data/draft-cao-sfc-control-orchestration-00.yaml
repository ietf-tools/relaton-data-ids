abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain architecture further enables the modularity
    of network functions; network service functions can be split and chained together
    to compose complicated services. Network automation relies on a specific orchestrator
    to automatically deploy an end2end service or application. If this end2end service
    or application has a specific requirement to chaining several service functions,
    there is a need of an interface from the application to inform the orchestrator.
    This document investigates the problem.</p>"
