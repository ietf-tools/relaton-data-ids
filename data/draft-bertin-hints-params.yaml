abstract:
- content: "<p>Link hints are going to be standardized to enhance interactions between
    link and network layers, allowing a given node to integrate and efficiently manage
    one or even several network interfaces. Parameters conveyed in Link Hints shall
    provide the necessary abstraction level to be mapped on several technologies.
    This document provides a first list of parameters to be transported in Link Hints
    but the way to transport them is out of the scope of this document. Two sets of
    parameters are proposed: the MN set gathers information available at the Mobile
    Node whereas the AR set is relevant for the Access Router side. In each set, parameters
    are grouped into three distinct categories: static parameters are related to the
    hardware implementation of the interface, configuration parameters are manageable
    through interface configuration, status parameters are highly varying as they
    provide the current link environment of the interface.</p>"
