abstract:
- content: <p>The 6LoWPAN and CoAP standards defined for resource-constrained devices
    are fast emerging as the de-facto protocols for enabling the Internet-of-Things
    (IoTs). Security is an important concern in IoTs and the DTLS protocol has been
    chosen as the preferred method for securing CoAP messages. DTLS is a point-to-point
    protocol relying on the IP routing to deliver messages between the client and
    the server. However in some low-power lossy networks (LLNs) with multi-hop, a
    new "joining" device may not be initially IP routable. This prevents DTLS from
    being directly useful as an authentication and confidentiality protocol during
    this stage, requiring other security protocols to be implemented on the device.
    These devices being resource-constrained often cannot accommodate more than one
    security protocol in their code memory. To overcome this problem and reuse DTLS,
    we present a DTLS Relay solution for the non-IP routable "joining" device to establish
    a secure DTLS connection with a DTLS server. Further we present a stateful and
    stateless mode of operation for the DTLS Relay.</p>
