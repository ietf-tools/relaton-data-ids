abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method, TCP-CCC, to combine the congestion
    controls of multiple TCP connections between the same pair of hosts. This can
    have several performance benefits, and it makes it possible to precisely assign
    a share of the congestion window to the connections based on priorities. This
    document also addresses the problem that TCP connections between the same pair
    of hosts may not share the same path. We discuss methods to detect if, or enforce
    that connections traverse a common bottleneck.</p>"
