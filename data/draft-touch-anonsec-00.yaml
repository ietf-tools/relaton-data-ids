abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent attacks on core Internet infrastructure indicate an increased
    vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious resets (RSTs). TCP has always been
    susceptible to such RST spoof attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking
    that the RST sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as
    via the obfuscation of TCP endpoint and port numbers. For pairs of well-known
    endpoints often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP, increases in the path
    bandwidth-delay product of a connection have sufficiently increased the receive
    window space that off-path third parties can guess a viable RST sequence number.
    This document addresses this vulnerability, discussing proposed solutions at the
    transport level and their inherent challenges, as well as existing network level
    solutions and the feasibility of their deployment. Finally, it proposes an extension
    to IPsec configuration called ANONsec that intends to efficiently and scalably
    secure any transport protocol from such off-path third-party spoofing attacks.</p>"
