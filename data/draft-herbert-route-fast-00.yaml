abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to encode routing information in Firewall
    and Service Tickets (FAST). Encoded routing information provides the local routing
    for packets sent in either the forward or return paths of a flow. FAST ticket
    reflection at peer hosts ensures that the routing information is attached to packets
    being sent in the return path. When a packet with a FAST ticket containing routing
    information enters the network in which the ticket was issued, the ticket is parsed
    to extract the routing information and is forwarded per the information. Routing
    in Firewall and Service Tickets has a number of use cases. It can be used as a
    type of source routing, used with identifier-locator protocols to provide a locator
    in the return path, and can be used to specify a backend instance in Layer 4 load
    balancing for processing connections to a virtual IP address.</p>"
