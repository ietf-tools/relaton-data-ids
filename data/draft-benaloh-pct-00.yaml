abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Version 2 of the Private Communication Technology
    (PCT) protocol, a security protocol that provides privacy over the Internet. The
    protocol is intended to prevent eavesdropping on connection-based communications
    in client/server applications, with at least one of the two always being authenticated,
    and each having the option of requiring authentication of the other. PCT is somewhat
    similar to SSL ([1]); however, PCT version 1 corrects or improves on several weaknesses
    of SSL, and version 2 also adds a number of new features. PCT version 2 is fully
    compatible with PCT version 1.</p>"
