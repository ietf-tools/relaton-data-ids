abstract:
- content: "<p>In Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), a mobile node (MN) moving from
    one MAP domain to another can experience both long handover latency and packet
    loss due to the distance between the two MAPs. To solve the problems, this document
    describes two fast handover schemes that support fast macro mobility handover.
    These fast handover schemes can reduce both the handover latency and the pakcet
    loss. The schemes described in this document adopt the fast handover of FMIPv6
    protocol to the edge access routers in MAP domains. The schemes support two fast
    handover modes for macro mobility handover in HMIPv6.</p>"
