abstract:
- content: "<p>An OpenPGP user may want to request their email provider to automatically
    forward some or all of the messages they receive to a third party. Given that
    messages are encrypted, this requires transforming them into ciphertexts decryptable
    by the intended forwarded parties, while maintaining confidentiality and authentication.
    This can be achieved using Proxy transformations on the Curve25519 elliptic curve
    field with minimal changes to the OpenPGP protocol, in particular no change is
    required on the sender side. In this document we implement the forwarding scheme
    described in [FORWARDING].</p>"
