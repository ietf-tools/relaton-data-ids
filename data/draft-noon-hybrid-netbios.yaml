abstract:
- content: "<p>STD-19/RFC-1001/RFC-1002 defines a 'Protocol Standard for a NetBIOS
    Service on a TCP/UDP Transport,' or 'NetBIOS-over-TCP' for short. STD-19 defines
    NetBIOS end-nodes as stations which 'support NetBIOS service interfaces and contain
    applications.' That standard describes three types of end-nodes: Broadcast nodes
    (B nodes), Point-to-point nodes (P nodes), and Mixed mode nodes (M nodes). This
    memo describes a fourth note type, an H node, which is basically a P node which
    can transmit UDP broadcasts when NetBIOS servers cannot be reached.</p>"
