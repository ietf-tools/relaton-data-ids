abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms allowing advertising Segment Routing
    Traffic Engineering (SRTE) policies using BGP. Through the mechanisms described
    in this document, a BGP speaker has the ability to trigger, in a remote BGP node,
    the setup of a SR Encapsulation policy with specific characteristics and an explicit
    path. Steering mechanisms are also defined to enable the application of the policy
    on a per BGP route basis.</p>"
