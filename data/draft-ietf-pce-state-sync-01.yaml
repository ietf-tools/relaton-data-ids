abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computation in
    response to a Path Computation Client (PCC) request. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. A Path Computation Client (PCC) can
    synchronize an LSP state information to a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).
    A PCC can have multiple PCEP sessions towards multiple PCEs. There are some use
    cases, where an inter-PCE stateful communication can bring additional resiliency
    in the design, for instance when some PCC-PCE session fails. This document describes
    the procedures to allow a stateful communication between PCEs for various use-cases
    and also the procedures to prevent computations loops.</p>"
