abstract:
- content: "<p>Security events communicated within Security Event Tokens may support
    a variety of identifiers to identify the subject and/or other principals related
    to the event. This specification formalizes the notion of subject identifiers
    as named sets of well-defined claims describing the subject, a mechanism for representing
    subject identifiers within a [JSON] object such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) [JWT]
    or Security Event Token (SET) [SET], and a registry for defining and allocating
    names for these claim sets.</p>"
