abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) over HTTPS transport
    binding and the corresponding 'ipps' URI scheme, that is used to designate the
    access to the network location of a secure IPP print service or a network resource
    (for example, a print job) managed by such a service. This memo is an individual
    submission to the IETF by the Internet Printing Protocol Working Group of the
    IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group, as part of their PWG IPP Everywhere (PWG 5100.14)
    project for secure mobile printing with vendor-neutral Client software. This memo
    defines an alternate IPP transport binding to that defined in the original IPP
    URL Scheme (RFC 3510), but this memo does not update or obsolete (RFC 3510). This
    memo updates RFC 2910 and RFC 2911.</p>"
