abstract:
- content: <p>Consumers of IP network performance metrics have many different uses
    in mind. This memo provides "long-term" reporting considerations (e.g., hours,
    days, weeks, or months, as opposed to 10 seconds), based on analysis of the points
    of view of two key audiences. It describes how these audience categories affect
    the selection of metric parameters and options when seeking information that serves
    their needs. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>
