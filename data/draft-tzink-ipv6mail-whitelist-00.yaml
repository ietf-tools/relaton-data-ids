abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a plan for how providers of email services can
    manage the problem of email abuse over IPv6. Spammers can send mail from a very
    large range of IPv6 addresses, and this will make current antispam technology
    less effective. This is because email receivers will have to maintain excessively
    large lists of IP blocklists which either consume too many resources, or will
    become stale and therefore ineffective as spammers quickly discard one IP and
    move onto the next one. This document recommends that during the interim transition
    of email from IPv4 to IPv6, email receivers implement a whitelisting option where
    they only allow email from permitted senders over IPv6 and reject mail from everyone
    else sending email over IPv6.</p>"
