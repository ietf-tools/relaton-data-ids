abstract:
- content: "<p>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header is designed to provide
    a mix of optional security services in IPv4 and IPv6. ESP may be applied alone,
    in combination with the IP Authentication Header (AH) [KA97b], or in a nested
    fashion, e.g., through the use of tunnel mode (see below). Security services can
    be provided between a pair of communicating hosts, between a pair of communicating
    security gateways, or between a security gateway and a host. For more details
    on how to use ESP and AH in various network environments, see 'Security Architecture
    for the Internet Protocol' [KA97a].</p>"
