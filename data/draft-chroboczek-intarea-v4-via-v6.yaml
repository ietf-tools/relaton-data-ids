abstract:
- content: '<p>We propose "v4-via-v6" routing, a technique that uses IPv6 next-hop
    addresses for routing IPv4 packets, thus making it possible to route IPv4 packets
    across a network where routers have not been assigned IPv4 addresses. We describe
    the technique, and discuss its operational implications. { Editor note: This document
    was originally published as draft- chroboczek-int-v4-via-v6, and later renamed
    to draft-chroboczek- intarea-v4-via-v6. }</p>'
