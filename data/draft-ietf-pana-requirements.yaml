abstract:
- content: "<p>It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access
    technologies to gain network connectivity. Currently there are access-specific
    mechanisms for providing client information to the network for authentication
    and authorization purposes. In addition to being limited to specific access media
    (e.g., 802.1X for IEEE 802 links), some of these protocols are limited to specific
    network topologies (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links). The goal of this document
    is to identify the requirements for a link-layer agnostic protocol that allows
    a host and a network to authenticate each other for network access. This protocol
    will run between a client's device and an agent in the network where the agent
    might be a client of the AAA infrastructure. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
