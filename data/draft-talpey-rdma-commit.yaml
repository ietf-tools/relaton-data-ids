abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)
    protocols to provide capabilities in support of enhanced remotely-directed data
    placement on memory-addressable devices, including persistent memory. The extensions
    include new operations supporting remote commitment to persistence of remotely-managed
    buffers, which can provide enhanced guarantees and improve performance for low-latency
    storage applications, and to the visibility of such buffers in support of remote
    shared memory semantics. This document updates RFC 5040 (Remote Direct Memory
    Access Protocol (RDMAP)) and updates RFC 7306 (RDMA Protocol Extensions).</p>"
