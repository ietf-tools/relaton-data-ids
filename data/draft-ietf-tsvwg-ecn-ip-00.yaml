abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contributes to the effort to add explicit congestion
    notification (ECN) to IP. In the current effort to standardise ECN for TCP it
    is unavoidably necessary to standardise certain new aspects of IP.However, the
    IP aspects will not and cannot only be specific to TCP. We specify interaction
    with features of IP such as fragmentation, differentiated services, multicast
    forwarding, and a definition of the service offered to higher layer congestion
    control protocols. This document only concerns aspects related to the IP layer,
    but includes any aspects likely to be common to all higher layer protocols. Any
    specification of ECN support in higher layer protocols is expected to appear in
    a separate specification for each such protocol.</p>"
