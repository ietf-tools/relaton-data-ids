abstract:
- content: "<p>Some AI services drive the need to transmit RMDA packets across wide
    area network (WAN) via SRv6 tunnels. RoCEv2 is the most popular open standard
    for achieving RDMA and network offloads over ethernet, with its congestion control
    based on the combination of PFC and ECN. Due to certain limitations of PFC and
    ECN, some drafts have been put forward to realize more faster congestion notification
    (FANTEL). Upon detection of congestion, these drafts proposals directly sending
    congestion notifications to relevant nodes, enabling near real-time congestion
    control. However, in SRv6-based WAN environments, congestion notifications cannot
    be directly delivered from WAN devices to intra-DC devices. This document specifies
    new SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SIDs) and the corresponding processing rules for
    device, supporting the forwarding of congestion notification across domains.</p>"
