abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format of a new Resource Record (RR) for
    the Domain Naming System (DNS), (and reserves a corresponding DNS type mnemonic:
    DRIC and numerical code - to be done) This definition deals with associating a
    reputation measure to a domain, a host name, or a url before domain name resolution.
    It also deals with associating a classification of the result ip# after domain
    name resolution. The data shown in this document is fictitious and does not necessarily
    reflect the real Internet.</p>"
