abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a new DHCP Relay Suboption for passing an arbitrary
    number of bytes defining what will be called the 'Subscriber ID'. This value is
    simply defined as an array of bytes and can be interpreted in any form by the
    DHCP server. Its intended purpose is to give additional information which the
    DHCP server can use in address allocation.</p>"
