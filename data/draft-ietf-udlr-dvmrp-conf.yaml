abstract:
- content: "<p>Routers connected to a UniDirectional Link (UDL) such as a satellite
    network, implement a link layer tunneling mechanism, as defined in the RFC 3077
    [UDLR]. These routers could exchange multicast routing information. This document
    describes how DVMRPv3 works on this network architecture and suggests a different
    configuration of DVMRPv3 on routers connected to the UDL more adapted and optimized
    to this network architecture.</p>"
