abstract:
- content: "<p>To allow interoperability between the existing telephone network and
    Internet Telephony (IT) it is necessary for the signaling performance to be comparable
    to that of the current standards to avoid introducing degradation in the service.
    In this Internet Draft, we highlight the problem of providing high-quality signaling
    across an IP network that is built on a SONET infrastructure. We show that there
    are cases where the current PSTN standards are not satisfiable by a naive mapping
    of the IT signaling directly to the UDP or TCP transport protocols, even neglect-
    ing packet loss in router queues.</p>"
