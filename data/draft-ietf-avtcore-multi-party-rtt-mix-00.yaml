abstract:
- content: <p>Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the
    source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be presented by
    endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the same source. Regional
    regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time text in multi-party calls.
    RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use traditional RTP functions for source identification,
    but the mixer source switching performance is limited when using the default transmission
    with redundancy. An enhancement for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided
    in the present specification, suitable for a centralized conference model that
    enables source identification and efficient source switching. The intended use
    is for real-time text mixers and multi-party-aware participant endpoints. The
    mechanism builds on use of the CSRC list in the RTP packet. A capability exchange
    is specified so that it can be verified that a participant can handle the multi-party
    coded real-time text stream. The capability is indicated by an sdp media attribute
    "rtt-mix". A brief description about how a mixer can format text for the case
    when the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.</p>
