abstract:
- content: <p>The OAuth framework is a widely deployed authorization protocol standard
    that enables applications to obtain limited access to user resources. OAuth clients
    must be registered with the OAuth authorization server, which poses significant
    operational challenges in dynamically scaling environments. The Secure Production
    Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) is a graduated Cloud Native Compute Foundation
    project designed to dynamically attest and verify workload identity. This draft
    describes how workloads with SPIFFE credentials can be used with OAuth to lessen
    the operational burden of client registration through a "register on first use"
    principle.</p>
