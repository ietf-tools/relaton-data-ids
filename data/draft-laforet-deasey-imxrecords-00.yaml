abstract:
- content: "<p>Unwanted Email ('SPAM') is a constantly growing scourge of the Internet.
    SPAM takes full advantage of the open system that was created in the spirit of
    cooperation that represents the original underpinnings of the Internet. Understanding
    that making airtight mail systems without completely destroying old software,
    the authors of this proposal considered the continued operation of these legacy
    systems while tightening up the current standards. This new proposal calls for
    a new DNS resource record type and a new standard of operation for organization
    mail- exchangers. Using this new resource record along with other standard DNS
    resources provides system operators to minimize exploitable inbound SPAM pathways
    into their systems.</p>"
