abstract:
- content: <p>A set of prior RFCs specify procedures for supporting multicast in BGP/MPLS
    IP VPNs. These procedures allow customer multicast data to travel across a service
    provider's backbone network through a set of multicast tunnels. The tunnels are
    advertised in certain BGP multicast auto-discovery routes, by means of a BGP attribute
    known as the "Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel" attribute. Encodings
    have been defined that allow the PMSI Tunnel attribute to identify bidirectional
    (multipoint-to-multipoint) multicast distribution trees. However, the prior RFCs
    do not provide all the necessary procedures for using bidirectional tunnels to
    support multicast VPNs. This document updates RFCs 6513, 6514, and 6625 by specifying
    those procedures. In particular, it specifies the procedures for assigning customer
    multicast flows (unidirectional or bidirectional) to specific bidirectional tunnels
    in the provider backbone, for advertising such assignments, and for determining
    which flows have been assigned to which tunnels.</p>
