abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the term "Public Suffix" as meaning a domain under
    which multiple parties that are unaffiliated with the owner may register subdomains.
    Examples of Public Suffixes include "org", "co.uk" and "k12.wa.us". It also defines
    a fileformat that can be used to distribute information about such Public Suffixes
    to relying parties. As an example, this information is then used to limit which
    domains an Internet service can set cookies for, strengthening the rules already
    defined by the cookie specifications. This specification updates RFC 6265 [RFC6265]
    by defining the term "Public Suffix".</p>
