abstract:
- content: "<p>The provision of emergency calling services (e.g., 911, 112) has been
    a critical component in the regulation of telecommunications networks. The technical
    architectures used by modern Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems mean that if telecommunications
    regulators wish to extend emergency calling requirements to VoIP, it will likely
    be necessary to reconsider the ways in which such requirements are applied, both
    in terms of what specific mandates are imposed and which entities are subject
    to them. This document dicusses the fundamental technical requirements for emergency
    services, how these requirements can be met within the framework of VoIP, and
    how these solutions approaches create possibilities and limitations for regulatory
    involvement.</p>"
