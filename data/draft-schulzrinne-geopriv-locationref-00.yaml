abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile devices sometimes want to give temporary access to their presence
    and location information to third parties that may not have a trust relationship
    with their presence server. Also, in addition to other mechanisms, application-layer
    location configuration protocols are helpful in building location-based systems.
    This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package, locationref,
    that periodically delivers randomized presence URLs to the target, which the target
    can then hand to call recipients and other parties.</p>"
