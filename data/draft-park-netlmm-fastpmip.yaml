abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy mobile ipv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to manage mobility of hosts
    that are not equipped with any mobility management protocol. But PMIPv6 has a
    handover latency because it is based on global mobility management protocols such
    as MIPv6. Handover latency sensitives impact on real-time application. This document
    describes Fast and Local Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FLPMIPv6) to reduce handover latency
    and packet loss ratio. The scheme is based on the fast mobile IP scheme and utilized
    some of messages defined in 802.21 and information coming from link layer.</p>"
