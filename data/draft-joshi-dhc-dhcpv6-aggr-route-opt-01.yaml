abstract:
- content: "<p>The Aggregate Route option provides a mechanism for a requestor to
    retrieve an aggregate route(s) from a DHCPv6 server using the information-request
    message. The aggregate route is a single route representing multiple prefixes
    delegated by a DHCP server using Prefix Delegation, and maybe advertised using
    routing protocols instead of individual routes learnt from DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation.
    This document specifies the data contained in aggregate route option as well as
    the behavior of Requestor and DHCPv6 Server in requesting and processing of this
    option.</p>"
