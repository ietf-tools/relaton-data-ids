abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses problems caused by malicious middleboxes and
    proposes a scheme that can detect them in Service Function Chaining (SFC) by combining
    two mechanisms: direct and indirect. The direct mechanism injects a tool into
    the middleboxes to observe and report the state of each middlebox. In contrast,
    the indirect mechanism creates a probe service chain, which includes trustful
    middleboxes, to investigate the operation of other middleboxes in the network.</p>"
