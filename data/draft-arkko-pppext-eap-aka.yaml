abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    mechanism for authentication and session key distribution that uses the Authentication
    and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism. AKA is used in the 3rd generation mobile networks
    Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and CDMA2000. AKA is based on
    symmetric keys, and typically runs in a Subscriber Identity Module, which is a
    UMTS Subscriber Identity Module, USIM, or a (Removable) User Identity Module,
    (R)UIM, similar to a smart card. EAP-AKA includes optional identity privacy support,
    optional result indications, and an optional fast re-authentication procedure.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
