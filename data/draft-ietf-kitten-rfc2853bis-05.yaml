abstract:
- content: '<p>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
    offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety
    of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings
    for the GSS-API that are specified in "Generic Security Service API Version 2
    : Java Bindings" (RFC 2853). This document obsoletes RFC 2853 by making specific
    and incremental clarifications and corrections to it in response to identification
    of transcription errors and implementation experience. The GSS-API is described
    at a language-independent conceptual level in "Generic Security Service Application
    Program Interface Version 2, Update 1" (RFC 2743). The GSS-API allows a caller
    application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer,
    and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message
    basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are "The Simple Public-Key
    GSS-API Mechanism" (RFC 2025) and "The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service
    Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2" (RFC 4121). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
