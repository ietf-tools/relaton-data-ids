abstract:
- content: "<p>Extended Reality &amp; multi-modality communication, or XRM, is a type
    of advanced service that has been studied and standardized in 3GPP. The service
    features at achieving high data rate, high reliability and low latency. The multiple
    streams of an XRM service use IP sessions to transport media contents with the
    provisioning of advanced QoS settings. The XRM Metadata or PDU Set QoS marking
    is used to differentiate the PDU Set requirements to the 5GS. RTP header extension
    (HE), as defined by 3GPP, can be used to transport XRM Metadata for un-encrypted
    media streams, while the encrypted XRM streams post challenges for UPFs to extract
    the Metadata. This draft proposes to use the IETF UDP Option extension, by defining
    a new SAFE type, to help enhance the carry &amp; transport of encrypted XRM Metadata.</p>"
