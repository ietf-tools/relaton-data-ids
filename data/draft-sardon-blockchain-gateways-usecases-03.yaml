abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past five years there has been a growing interest in using blockchains
    and DLT systems as a means to create a new mechanism to issue, distribute and
    manage virtual assets. However, as DLT systems consisting of peer-to-peer (P2P)
    network of nodes increase in number, there is an increasing need to interconnect
    these networks to permit virtual assets to flow into and out of them. This document
    captures a number of use-cases driving the need for interoperability between DLT
    systems.</p>"
