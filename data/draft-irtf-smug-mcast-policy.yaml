abstract:
- content: "<p>Security is increasingly becoming a concern in applications built on
    multi-party communication. Centrally, protection of the application content from
    non-authorized or malicious parties is the fundamental goal of any security policy
    specification. This draft seeks to illuminate the design space of secure multicast
    communication policy. The security requirements of existing application policies
    are intended to be addressable by these policy dimensions. It is from an understanding
    of policy design space that the mechanisms for policy specification and enforcement
    can be derived.</p>"
