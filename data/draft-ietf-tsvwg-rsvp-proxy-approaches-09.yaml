abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) can be used to make end-to-
    end resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the quality of
    service required by certain flows. RSVP assumes that both the data sender and
    receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling. Yet, there are use cases
    where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender, or both,
    is not RSVP-capable. This document presents RSVP proxy behaviors allowing RSVP
    routers to initiate or terminate RSVP signaling on behalf of a receiver or a sender
    that is not RSVP-capable. This allows resource reservations to be established
    on a critical subset of the end-to-end path. This document reviews conceptual
    approaches for deploying RSVP proxies and discusses how RSVP reservations can
    be synchronized with application requirements, despite the sender, receiver, or
    both not participating in RSVP. This document also points out where extensions
    to RSVP (or to other protocols) may be needed for deployment of a given RSVP proxy
    approach. However, such extensions are outside the scope of this document. Finally,
    practical use cases for RSVP proxy are described. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
