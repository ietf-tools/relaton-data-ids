- content: "<p>Phishing, a broadly-launched social engineering attack in which an
    electronic identity is misrepresented in an attempt to trick individuals into
    revealing credentials, is expanding on the Internet. Corporations, Service Providers,
    consumer agencies, and financial institutions have started to collect and correlate
    phishing attack information to better plan out mitigation activities and to assist
    in prosecution. Early on it became obvious that a common format for the data reported
    or exchanged between this parties was necessary.</p>"
