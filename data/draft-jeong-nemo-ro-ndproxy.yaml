abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6
    mobile network to perform route optimization. The route optimization is possible
    because mobile router relays the prefix of its Care-of address to its mobile nodes
    by playing the role of ND-proxy. Through binding updates associated with the network
    prefix of an access network, the mobile nodes can perform route optimization.
    In addition, this document explains how mobile nodes can optimize its DNS name
    resolution through RA-based DNS discovery. By announcing the address of local
    recursive DNS server, mobile router allows mobile nodes to optimize their DNS
    name resolution.</p>"
