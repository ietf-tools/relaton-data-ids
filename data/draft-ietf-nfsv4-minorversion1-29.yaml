abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor
    version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
    version 0, which is specified in RFC 3530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.
    Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions,
    Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS). NFS version 4 minor version 1
    has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate
    protocol. Thus, this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530. NFS minor
    version 1 is deemed superior to NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality,
    and its use is preferred over version 0. Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be
    used simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
