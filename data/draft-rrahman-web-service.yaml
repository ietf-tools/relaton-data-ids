abstract:
- content: "<p>The Open Pluggable Edge Services architecture (OPES) defines an open
    standards based framework for providing services on intermediaries to operate
    on client requests and server responses. One of the key elements of this framework
    is the notion of callout services. Currently proposed remote callout service implementations
    interact with an OPES intermediary through specially designed callout protocols
    like [11].</p>"
