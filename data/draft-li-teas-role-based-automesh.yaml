abstract:
- content: "<p>A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label
    Switching Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs. Routing
    protocol (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions facilitate discovery of Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership and automate the creation of a full mesh
    of TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group
    that applies to the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs are not necessary and TE
    LSPs setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group. Interior Gateway Protocol
    (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of role-based TE mesh membership
    are defined accordingly.</p>"
