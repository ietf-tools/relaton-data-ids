abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft specifies a comprehensive framework for mapping
    service flow characteristics to network modal resources in multi- modal intelligent
    computing networks. It introduces the use of the ALTO protocol for collecting
    service flow data and leverages an SDN architecture to separate control and data
    planes. The ALTO protocol facilitates the acquisition of diverse network state
    information, including data from several SDN domains and dynamic network environments,
    directly from controllers while keeping the provider's internal details confidential.
    It then transmits the controller's decisions using a proven method. The document
    details methods for characteristic identification, intelligent mapping, and continuous
    optimization, enabling dynamic resource allocation and improved network performance.
    The framework is designed to support scalable, efficient, and secure operations
    in environments with complex network loads and diverse service requirements.</p>"
