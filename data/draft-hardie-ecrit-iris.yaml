abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an XML-based protocol for passing location
    information to a server that returns emergency service contact URIs. It is intended
    to fit within a larger framework of standards. Specifically, it presumes the existence
    of a URI scheme appropriate for signalling that emergency service is required
    and distinguishing among emergency services if appropriate. It also presumes that
    an entity requesting this response will be able to handle the URIs returned as
    input to appropriate handlers.</p>"
