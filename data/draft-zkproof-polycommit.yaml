abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the high-level interface of a polynomial commitment
    scheme (PCS), a cryptographic primitive used in constructing generic zk-SNARKs.
    A PCS allows a prover to commit to a polynomial, and later attest to its correct
    evaluation at a given point. Test vectors and reference implementations for popular
    instantiations are provided in Appendix A.</p>"
