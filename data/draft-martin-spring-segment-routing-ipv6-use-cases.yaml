abstract:
- content: "<p>Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture leverages
    the source routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through a controlled set of
    instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with SPRING header. A
    segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. A segment
    can have a local semantic to the SPRING node or global within the SPRING domain.
    SPRING allows to enforce a flow through any topological path and service chain
    while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SPRING domain.
    The objective of this document is to illustrate some use cases that need to be
    taken into account by the Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture.</p>"
