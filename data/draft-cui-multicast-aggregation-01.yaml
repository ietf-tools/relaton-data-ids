abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we present a novel scheme, called aggregated multicast,
    to reduce multicast states ([FeiGI01] and [FeiNGC01]). The key idea is that multiple
    groups are forced to share one distribution tree, which we call aggregated tree.
    In our scheme, core routers need to keep states only per aggregated tree instead
    of per group. This can significantly reduce the total number of trees in the network
    and thus reduce forwarding states. We investigate the implementation issues of
    aggregated multicast in different network scenarios. We also discuss the effects
    of aggregated multicast on some important issues, such as QoS multicast provisioning,
    mobility support and fault tolerance. The scope of this paper is not to propose
    a detailed protocol, but present the idea of aggregated multicast at high level
    and show its merits.</p>"
