abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a specification of version 5 of Network Block Transfer
    Protocol (NETBLT), that is used for transferring large amount of data. This protocol
    was firstly specified in RFC 969, that has been made obsolete by RFC 998. Nevertheless,
    none of these documents match current Internet Standards and are outdated. This
    document aligns the NETBLT specification with the most current Internet Standards
    and obsoletes RFC 998.</p>"
