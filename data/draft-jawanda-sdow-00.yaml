abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, a concept of main directory agent (MDA) is introduced.
    The main directory agent utilizes conjoined operations of Mobile IP and SLP including
    new proposed extensions. The MDA expedites service &amp; location discovery process
    for mobile hosts and provides local system administrators with control over the
    usage of deployed services. It provides a mechanism for local system administrators
    to enforce local policies for the allocation of local access resources when desired.
    The MDA based service discovery by mobile hosts is particularly effective in the
    case of wireless networks. Wireless links have substantially lower bandwidth,
    suffer from higher error rates and need to support higher mobility of hosts/data
    terminals compared to wired links (e.g. LAN). Thus, to disseminate any information
    to mobile hosts over the wireless links the multicasting or broadcasting paradigm
    should be used sparingly. In view of this, optional extensions to Mobile IP and
    SLP protocol are recommended and discussed in this document. Again, the intent
    is to make the overall service discovery process expeditious and effective for
    mobile hosts.</p>"
