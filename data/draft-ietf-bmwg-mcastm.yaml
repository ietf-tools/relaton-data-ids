abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to describe methodology specific to
    the benchmarking of multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon the tenets
    set forth in RFC 2544, RFC 2432 and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working
    Group (BMWG) efforts. This document seeks to extend these efforts to the multicast
    paradigm. The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking Terminology
    documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The Terminology documents present
    the benchmarks and other related terms. The Methodology documents define the procedures
    required to collect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
