abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
    link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain
    reachability information. This document updates [RFC4861] to allow routers to
    proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned
    to a host. It also updates [RFC4862] and [RFC4429] recommending hosts to send
    unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address. The proposed
    change will minimize the delay and packet loss when a host initiate connections
    to off-link destination from a new IPv6 address.</p>"
