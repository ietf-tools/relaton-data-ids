abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses a standard mechanism for securing information
    in SIP requests and responses, inserted by intermediaries, which may be used by
    other intermediaries or the endpoints as the basis for services. The requirements
    are based on the need for a general middle-to-middle and middle-to-end security
    mechanism applicable to both headers and message bodies. This mechanism is optional,
    however, the use of it enhances the overall security of SIP by ensuring the integrity
    of the information inserted by an intermediary.</p>"
