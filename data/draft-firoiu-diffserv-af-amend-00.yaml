abstract:
- content: "<p>This note was motivated by the ongoing discussion in the Differentiated
    Services Working Group regarding the definition of the Assured Forwarding (AF)
    Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) Group. We consider two issues with the current proposal
    for AF PHB Group in [Heinanen]: the recommendation for AF discard mechanism, and
    the definition of AF classes. We discuss the implications of the definitions and
    recommendations that have raised comments and propose alternative texts.</p>"
