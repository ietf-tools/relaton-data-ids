abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a set of cipher suites for the Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) protocols that use Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone
    (ECQV) certificates to authenticate an Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV)
    exchange. These cipher suites provide forward secrecy. Status of this Memo This
    Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of
    BCP 78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may
    also distribute working documents as Internet- Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft
    documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted
    by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as
