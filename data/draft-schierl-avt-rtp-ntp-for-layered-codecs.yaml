abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP header extension mechanism to be used with
    timestamp-based decoding order recovery of RTP flows containing layered codecs.
    The header extension may be most useful in the presence of clock skew as well
    as for early decoding order recovery. The RTP header extension is based on [RFC5285]
    and extends the RTP header by the lower 56bit part of the NTP timestamp corresponding
    to the RTP timestamp of the same packet as defined in [RFC3550] for the RTCP sender
    reports. This memo further gives guidance on how decoding order is recovered in
    RTP flows using the NTP timestamp information when parts of a layered, multi-view
    or multi- descriptions coding media are transported in different RTP flows.</p>"
