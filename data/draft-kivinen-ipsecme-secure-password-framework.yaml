abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a generic way for Internet Key Exchange version
    2 (IKEv2) to use any of the symmetric secure password authentication methods.
    Multiple methods are already specified in other documents, and this document does
    not add any new one. This document specifies a way to agree on which method is
    to be used in the current connection. This document also provides a common way
    to transmit, between peers, payloads that are specific to secure password authentication
    methods.</p>"
