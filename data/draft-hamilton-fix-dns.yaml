abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal outlines a way in which the Internet community may be
    able to route around the legal and political issues associated with control of
    the Domain Name System. We suggest a new mechanism for the distribution of domain
    name information, based on strong cryptographic authentication. In this new system,
    anyone is free to ''publish'' domain name information, with control over whether
    or not it is accepted left to the local site DNS server administrators.</p>"
