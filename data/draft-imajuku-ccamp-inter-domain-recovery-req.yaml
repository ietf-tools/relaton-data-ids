- content: "<p>The Generalized MPLS(GMPLS) suite of protocols h as been defined the
    protection and restoration mechanisms of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) to realize
    the highly resilient and reliable networks. The objective of this document is
    to extract additional requirements for the signaling mechanisms in order to extend
    the applicability of the protection and restoration mechanisms for inter-domain
    LSPs.</p>"
