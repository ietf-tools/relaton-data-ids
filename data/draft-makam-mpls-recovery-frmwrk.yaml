abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) [1] integrates the label swapping
    forwarding paradigm with network layer routing. To deliver reliable service, MPLS
    requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on different
    paths. This requires that the label switched routers (LSRs) support fault detection,
    fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling [2]
    [3] [4] [5] [6] support the configuration of recovery. With these objectives in
    mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery.</p>"
