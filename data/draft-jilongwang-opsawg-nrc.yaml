abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses and defines a framework for network resources categorization
    that can identify and describe all the network to assist network management. Now
    network resources have not been systematically defined and classified. The objective
    of this draft is to illustrate the applicability of framework for network resources
    categorization through use cases, then discuss the basic methodology and propose
    a not relatively mature framework for continued supplement and improvement.</p>"
