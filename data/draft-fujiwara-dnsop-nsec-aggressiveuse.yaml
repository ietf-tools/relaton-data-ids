abstract:
- content: <p>While DNS highly depends on cache, its cache usage of non-existence
    information has been limited to exact matching. This draft proposes the aggressive
    use of a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to express non-existence of
    a range of names authoritatively. With this proposal, it is expected that shorter
    latency to many of negative responses as well as some level of mitigation of random
    sub-domain attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks). It is also expected
    that non-existent TLD queries to Root DNS servers will decrease.</p>
