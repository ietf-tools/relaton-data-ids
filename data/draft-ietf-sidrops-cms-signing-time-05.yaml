abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), Signed Objects are
    defined as Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content types by way of
    a standard template (RFC 6488). That template includes an optional CMS signing-time
    attribute, representing the purported time at which the object was signed by its
    issuer. At the time when the standard template was defined, rsync was the only
    distribution mechanism for RPKI repositories. Since the publication of the standard
    template, a new, additional protocol for distribution of RPKI repositories has
    been developed: the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP). While RPKI repository
    operators must provide rsync service, RRDP is typically deployed alongside it
    as well, and preferred by default by most Relying Party (RP) implementations.
    However, RP implementations also support fallback to rsync in the event of problems
    with the RRDP service. As deployment experience with RRDP has increased, the usefulness
    of optimizing switchovers by RPs from one mechanism to the other has become apparent.
    This document describes how Publishers and RPs can use the CMS signing-time attribute
    to minimize the burden of switching over from RRDP to rsync. Additionally, this
    document updates RFC 6488 by mandating the presence of the CMS signing-time attribute
    and disallowing the use of the binary-signing-time attribute.</p>"
