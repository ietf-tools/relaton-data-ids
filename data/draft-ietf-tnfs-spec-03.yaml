abstract:
- content: "<p>Additional functionality has been developed for UNIXr systems to address
    the TCSEC requirements for trusted systems. New requirements are driving efforts
    to develop interoperable, networked solutions for trusted UNIX environments. A
    specific approach for addressing TCSEC MLS requirements is identified in the CMW
    requirements document. Developing support for network interoperability among MLS
    classified systems is a primary goal of the trusted UNIX community.</p>"
