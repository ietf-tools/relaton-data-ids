abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent research work has delved deeply into a new type of DNS security
    service, Protective DNS, through various measurement methods, and it has been
    deployed in multiple DNS providers and even in national ISPs. Protective DNS identifies
    whether the domain names requested by customers are in the threat intelligence
    (blocklist) it maintains. For domain names listed in the blocklist, it rewrites
    the resolution results to secure resources to prevent users from accessing malicious
    resources, such as malicious servers (IP addresses), etc. This document summarizes
    the conclusions of these research works and provides specific and practical considerations
    and suggestions for the deployment and operation of Protective DNS. By following
    these considerations, Protective DNS service providers can effectively enhance
    the practicality and security of their services.</p>"
