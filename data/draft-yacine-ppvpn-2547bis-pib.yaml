abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device
    implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN [2547bis] Architecture. The Provisioning Classes
    defined here provide policy control of resources implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN
    Architecture. These Provisioning Classes can be used with other non BGP/MPLS VPN
    Provisioning Classes (defined in other PIBs) to provide for a comprehensive policy
    controlled mapping of service requirements to device resource capability and usage.
    The COPS-PR protocol offers significant advantages when dealing with dynamic configuration
    and when compared to traditional management solutions. Moreover, dynamic VPN resource
    assignment is crucial to cope with the frequent changes requests from customer's
    (e.g., sites joining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The
    PEs should be able to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This capability is
    especially important for dial and wireless VPN services.</p>"
