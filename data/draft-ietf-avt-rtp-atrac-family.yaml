abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RTP payload format for efficient and flexible
    transporting of audio data encoded with the Adaptive TRansform Audio Coding (ATRAC)
    family of codecs. Recent enhancements to the ATRAC family of codecs support high-quality
    audio coding with multiple channels. The RTP payload format as presented in this
    document also includes support for data fragmentation, elementary redundancy measures,
    and a variation on scalable streaming. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
