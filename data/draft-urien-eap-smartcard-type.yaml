abstract:
- content: "<p>The EAP Smart Card Protocol (EAP-SC) defines an EAP Method and Multiplexing
    model for the support of Smart Card based authentication methods. EAP-SC provides
    a uniform framework for interfacing with Smart Cards within the EAP [RFC3748]
    context. EAP- SC provides for encapsulation of other EAP methods (such as [EAP-
    TLS], [EAP-SIM] and [EAP-AKA]). Smart Cards are hardware security devices that
    are widely used in data and voice networks to authenticate users and devices,
    and to enforce security policies on the client platform. EAP-SC enhances the security
    of authentication methods by enabling the use of Smart Cards for the secure provisioning
    and storage of keys and credentials, and the secure execution of security sensitive
    functions. In addition, EAP-SC provides security requirements for the support
    of Smart Card based Authentication Methods that ensure a uniform level of security
    complementary to the underlying authentication method.</p>"
