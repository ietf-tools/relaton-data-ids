abstract:
- content: "<p>In Web PKI, certificate path construction and validation are crucial
    security review processes. At present, there are many Internet browser manufacturers
    around the world. With the change of security practices and the development of
    technology, the certificate validation process in Internet browser industry is
    relatively messy, including various private implementations of manufacturers.
    It is a typical patching improvement method, and the implementation of process
    functions is relatively arbitrary. This document provides a technical guide for
    certification path validation of web server certificates during Internet SSL/TLS
    protocol communication for Web PKI, including the basic path verification process,
    as well as reference procedures, guidance and suggestions for input, initialization,
    and basic certificate processing in the verification process. This document is
    applicable to the development and application of Internet browsers, as well as
    other similar digital certificate authentication systems requiring SSL/TLS security
    protocol secure communication.</p>"
