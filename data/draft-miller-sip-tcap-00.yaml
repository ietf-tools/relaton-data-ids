abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP-TCAP is a mechanism by which an XML representation of TCAP messages
    can be transported in the body of SIP INFO messages. This mechanism can be used
    to allow SIP elements to access features implemented by PSTN equipment without
    having to implement the binary TCAP protocol.</p>"
