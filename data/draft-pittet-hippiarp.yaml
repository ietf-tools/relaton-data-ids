abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to ANSI
    High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) hardware addresses and for emulating
    IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension of HARP (hardware
    addresses). This memo defines a HARP that will interoperate between HIPPI-800
    and HIPPI-6400 (also known as Gigabyte System Network, GSN). This document (when
    combined with RFC 2067 "IP over HIPPI") obsoletes RFC 1374. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
