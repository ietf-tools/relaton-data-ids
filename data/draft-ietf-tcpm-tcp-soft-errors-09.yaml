abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a non-standard, but widely implemented, modification
    to TCP's handling of ICMP soft error messages that rejects pending connection-requests
    when those error messages are received. This behavior reduces the likelihood of
    long delays between connection-establishment attempts that may arise in a number
    of scenarios, including one in which dual-stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by
    default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
