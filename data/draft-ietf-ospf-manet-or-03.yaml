abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to OSPF to support mobile ad hoc
    networks (MANETs). The extensions, called OSPF-OR (OSPF-Overlapping Relay), include
    mechanisms for link-local signaling (LLS), an OSPF-MANET interface, a simple technique
    to reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting incremental state changes,
    and a method for optimized flooding of routing updates. OSPF-OR also provides
    a means to reduce unnecessary adjacencies to support larger MANETs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
