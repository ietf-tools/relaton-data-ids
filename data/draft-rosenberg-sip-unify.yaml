abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP working group has been grappling with a variety of very difficult
    problems lately. These include early media, coupling of resource reservation and
    call signaling, and the so-called Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem
    (HERFP). Additional problems being considered include supporting capability negotiation
    for indicating support any one of one-of-N codecs, upgrading the security on RTP
    streams, and demultiplexing media from a forked INVITE. In this document, we present
    a unified view of all of these problems, and present a unified solution that solves
    all of them in the same way.</p>"
