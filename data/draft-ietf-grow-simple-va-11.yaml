abstract:
- content: "<p>All BGP routers in the Default Free Zone (DFZ) are required to carry
    all the routes in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT). A technique is described
    that allows some BGP routers not to install all of those routes into the Forwarding
    Information Base (FIB). Some routers in an Autonomous System (AS) announce an
    aggregate (the VA prefix) in addition to the routes they already announce. This
    enables other routers not to install the routes covered by the VA prefix into
    the FIB as long as those routes have the same next-hop as the VA prefix. The VA
    prefixes that are announced within an AS are not announced to any other AS. In
    contrast to VA, S-VA reduces operational complexity by proposing local to given
    BGP speaker solution without any dependency on network wide configuration or requires
    presence of any form of intra-domain tunneling.</p>"
