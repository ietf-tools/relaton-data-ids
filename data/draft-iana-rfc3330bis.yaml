abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 3330. It describes the global and other
    specialized IPv4 address blocks that have been assigned by the Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA). It does not address IPv4 address space assigned to operators
    and users through the Regional Internet Registries, nor does it address IPv4 address
    space assigned directly by IANA prior to the creation of the Regional Internet
    Registries. It also does not address allocations or assignments of IPv6 addresses
    or autonomous system numbers. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
