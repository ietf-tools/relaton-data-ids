abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is part of a gladiator contest within the MIDCOM WG to determine
    what network topology information is needed at the Midcom agent. By taking out
    application awareness from Middle Boxes in the networks, and keeping this application
    knowledge in the application devices (the Midcom Agents); sufficient information
    needs to be put in the Midcom Agent to allow them to fulfill their responsibility.</p>"
