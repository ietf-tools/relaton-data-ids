abstract:
- content: "<p>TURN server and the network in which it is hosted due to load could
    adversely impact the traffic relayed through it. During such high load event,
    it is desirable to shed some traffic but TURN server lack requirements about the
    flows to prioritize them. This document defines such a mechanism to communicate
    flow characteristics from the TURN client to its TURN server.</p>"
