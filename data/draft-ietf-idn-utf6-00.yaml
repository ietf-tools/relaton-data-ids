abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a tranformation method for representing Unicode
    character codepoints in host name parts in a fashion that is completely compatible
    with the current Domain Name System. It is proposed as a potential candidate for
    an ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) for supporting the deployment of an internationalized
    Domain Name System. The tranformation method, an extension of the UTF-5 encoding
    proposed by Duerst, provides both for more efficient representation of typical
    Unicode sequences while preserving simplicity and readability. This transformation
    method is deployed as part of the current WALID multilingual domain name system
    implementation, although that status should not necessarily influence the evaluation
    of its merits as a candidate encoding method.</p>"
