abstract:
- content: "<p>A Mobile IPv6 node requires a Home Agent address, a home address, and
    IPsec security associations with its Home Agent before it can start utilizing
    Mobile IPv6 service. RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these are statically
    configured. This document defines how a Mobile IPv6 node can bootstrap this information
    from non-topological information and security credentials pre-configured on the
    Mobile Node. The solution defined in this document solves the split scenario described
    in the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping problem statement in RFC 4640. The split scenario
    refers to the case where the Mobile Node's mobility service is authorized by a
    different service provider than basic network access. The solution described in
    this document is also generically applicable to any bootstrapping case, since
    other scenarios are more specific realizations of the split scenario. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
