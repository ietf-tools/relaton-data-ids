abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases on IP-
    based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (ITS). The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networking.
    First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. Second,
    it analyzes proposed protocols for IP-based vehicular networking and highlights
    the limitations and difficulties found on those protocols. Third, it presents
    a problem exploration for key aspects in IP-based vehicular networking, such as
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy. For
    each key aspect, this document discusses a problem statement to analyze the gap
    between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in IP-based vehicular
    networking.</p>"
