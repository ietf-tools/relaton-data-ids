abstract:
- content: "<p>The Eifel detection algorithm allows a TCP sender to detect a posteriori
    whether it has entered loss recovery unnecessarily. It requires that the TCP Timestamps
    option defined in RFC 1323 be enabled for a connection. The Eifel detection algorithm
    makes use of the fact that the TCP Timestamps option eliminates the retransmission
    ambiguity in TCP. Based on the timestamp of the first acceptable ACK that arrives
    during loss recovery, it decides whether loss recovery was entered unnecessarily.
    The Eifel detection algorithm provides a basis for future TCP enhancements. This
    includes response algorithms to back out of loss recovery by restoring a TCP sender's
    congestion control state. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
