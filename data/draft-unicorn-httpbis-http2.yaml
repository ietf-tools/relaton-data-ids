abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax
    of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The HTTP/2.0 encapsulation enables
    more efficient use of network resources and reduced perception of latency by allowing
    header field compression and multiple concurrent messages on the same connection.
    It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.
    This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete the HTTP/1.1 message
    format or protocol. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged. This version of
    the draft has been marked for implementation. Interoperability testing will occur
    in the HTTP/2.0 interim in Hamburg, DE, starting 2013-08-05.</p>"
