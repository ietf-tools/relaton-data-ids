abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource records
    that cover a smaller range of names than called for by RFC 4034. By generating
    and signing these records on demand, authoritative name servers can effectively
    stop the disclosure of zone contents otherwise made possible by walking the chain
    of NSEC records in a signed zone. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
