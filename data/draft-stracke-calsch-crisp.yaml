- content: "<p>This document sets forth a restricted profile of [CAP], one which supports
    no operations beyond the scheduling functionality of [iTIP]. The motivation is
    to permit use of CAP's real-time iTIP functionality without exposing the calendar
    access functionality (which may require stricter security controls than iTIP).</p>"
