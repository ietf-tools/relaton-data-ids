abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a simple network-based protocol to facilitate
    Path Selection and to improve traffic engineering capabilities in multihomed corporate
    networks. With the protocol, any network device that requires to select a path
    among a list of different paths asks a Traffic Engineering service called IDIPS
    (ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection) to obtain an ordered list of the possible
    paths. The ordering is constructed according to the policies and performances
    requirements of both the host and network provider.</p>"
