abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx, which specifies the real-time
    transport protocol for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec.
    This document contains the information related to the new operating mode of VMR-WB.
    All provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc. that are specified in
    RFC xxxx are applicable to the new operating mode without any exception. No new
    media type registration is included in this document as the new VMR-WB mode, defined
    in this document, will use the same media type specified in RFC xxxx (i.e., audio/VMR-WB).
    Note that the RFC xxxx was developed with sufficient flexibility for future extensions
    and thereby it allows the addition of new operating modes without any impacts
    on the interoperability of terminals supporting different versions of the VMR-WB
    standard.</p>"
