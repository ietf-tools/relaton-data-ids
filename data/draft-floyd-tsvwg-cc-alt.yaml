abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
    to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed or wireless networks).
    Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes. Using these
    new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications
    to both the network and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion
    control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate
    congestion control proposals. The goal of this document is to provide guidance
    for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.</p>"
