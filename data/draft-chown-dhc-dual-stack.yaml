abstract:
- content: "<p>A node may have support for communications using IPv4 and/or IPv6 protocols.
    Such a node may wish to obtain IPv4 and/or IPv6 configuration settings via the
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). The original version of DHCP [1] designed
    for IPv4 has now been complemented by a new DHCPv6 [4] for IPv6. This document
    describes issues identified with dual IP version DHCP interactions.</p>"
