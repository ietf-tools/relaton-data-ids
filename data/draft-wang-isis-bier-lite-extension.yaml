abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is
    an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain"
    without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-flow
    state. BIER also does not require any explicit tree-building protocol for its
    operation. Currently, the data plane of BIER is apt to use BIER-MPLS encapsulation
    to transmit multicast traffic. However, this document tries to propose a solution
    named BIER-Lite about how to extend IS-IS protocol to support BIER forwarding
    in non-MPLS underlay network instead of MPLS underlay network.</p>
