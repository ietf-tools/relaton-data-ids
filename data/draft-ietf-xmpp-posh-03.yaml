abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to deploy proper
    PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains
    hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that
    identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end
    users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting
    in obvious security implications. This document defines two methods that make
    it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP
    application protocols. While these methods developed for use in the Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype,
    they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.</p>"
