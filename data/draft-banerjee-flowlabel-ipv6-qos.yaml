abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests a pragmatic specification for defining the 20-bit
    Flow Label field using a hybrid approach that includes options to provide IntServ
    as well as DiffServ based support for IPv6 Quality of Service. It also compares
    various suggested approaches for defining the 20-bit Flow Label field in IPv6
    Base Header based on RFC 2460 (December 1998) and few other drafts. Addressing
    the IPv6-Multicast- QoS issues also becomes possible as a consequence. This draft
    clearly specifies exactly when and how various options are to be used; and in
    case of the MFC, exactly how a specific action might be taken by the suggested
    implementation. Thus the resultant mechanism is fully implementable and unambiguous
    as even the lower-level details have been worked out as may be required for actual
    implementations. The draft also has a pointer to an experimental QoS scheme called
    MultServ.</p>"
