abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS error reporting is a lightweight reporting mechanism that provides
    the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS resource records that
    fail to resolve or validate. A domain owner or DNS hosting organization can use
    these reports to improve domain hosting. The reports are based on extended DNS
    errors as described in RFC 8914. When a domain name fails to resolve or validate
    due to a misconfiguration or an attack, the operator of the authoritative server
    may be unaware of this. To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document describes
    a method for a validating recursive resolver to automatically signal an error
    to a monitoring agent specified by the authoritative server.</p>"
