abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user reported
    problem and for regression testing if network or user agent software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signalling will take between
    user agents, and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end. This
    draft describes potential solutions to meet requirements for adding an indicator
    to the SIP protocol which can be used to mark signalling as of interest to logging.
    Such marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by
    the network operator and not used in regular user agent signalling. However, such
    marking can be carried end-to-end including the SIP user agents, even if a session
    originates and terminates in different networks.</p>"
