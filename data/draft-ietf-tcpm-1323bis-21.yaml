abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of TCP extensions to improve performance
    over paths with a large bandwidth * delay product and to provide reliable operation
    over very high-speed paths. It defines the TCP Window Scale (WS) option and the
    TCP Timestamps (TS) option and their semantics. The Window Scale option is used
    to support larger receive windows, while the Timestamps option can be used for
    at least two distinct mechanisms, Protection Against Wrapped Sequences (PAWS)
    and Round-Trip Time Measurement (RTTM), that are also described herein. This document
    obsoletes RFC 1323 and describes changes from it.</p>"
