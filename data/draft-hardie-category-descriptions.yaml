abstract:
- content: "<p>Over time, the document series associated with the IETF has grown and
    changed. One such change is the increase in the use of secondary markers to identify
    when documents fit specific categories and, especially, when they are or are not
    the product of specific IETF processes. The author believes that these secondary
    markers have largely failed but that the distinctions they were meant to draw
    remain valuable. A new set of category labels is proposed to re-emphasize these
    distinctions. The formal categories proposed are Internet Note, Candidate Specification,
    Proposed IETF Standard, Confirmed IETF Standard, and External Internet Engineering
    Document. These may be informally understood as ideas which are unbaked, baking,
    baked, eaten, and boiled.</p>"
