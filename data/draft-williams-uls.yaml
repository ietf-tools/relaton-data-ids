abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a proposed protocol for locating and connecting
    users together on an internet. In the last year, there has been an explosion in
    the number of client applications on the Internet that communicate directly with
    another client or clients. These applications include internet 'telephones', video
    phones, whiteboards, and other conferencing applications. Each of these applications
    uses a proprietary or ad-hoc solution for providing a directory of currently connected
    users and performing name to address mapping.</p>"
