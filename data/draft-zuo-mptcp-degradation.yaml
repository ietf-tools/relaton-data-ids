abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals for MPTCP is utilizing multiple paths to perform at
    least as well as the best path in terms of throughput. However, this goal might
    not be arrived at because of the path asymmetry, which is called as the performance-degradation
    problem of MPTCP in this draft. Some existing methods focus on this problem, such
    as penalizing and opportunistic retransmission, which reactively responds to the
    head- of-line blocking for trying their best to send data across all paths. In
    order to efficiently utilize the capabilities of the multiple paths, this draft
    proposes an approach that proactively selects the best path(s) to send data instead
    of always bonding all paths together.</p>"
