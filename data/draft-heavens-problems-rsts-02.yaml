abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo argues that the danger of segments from old TCP connections
    occurs for connections terminated by RST segments, as well as those terminated
    by exchange of FIN segments. In addition, insertion of TIME-WAIT state alone does
    not provide complete protection. The likelihood of data corruption is significant,
    exceeding the probability of corruption after FIN exchange for which TIME-WAIT
    state was designed.</p>"
