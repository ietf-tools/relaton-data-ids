abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP [RFC6824] defines the ADD_ADDR option to allow a host
    to announce its addresses to the remote host. In this document we analyze some
    of the issues with the address advertisement technique defined [RFC6824] and propose
    some modifications to mitigate these problems. We also show that the reverse DNS
    could be an excellent alternative to advertise the stable addresses of a server.</p>"
