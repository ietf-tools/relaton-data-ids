abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth aggregation
    on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced router (MIR). In the proposed scheme,
    the MIR with multiple heterogeneous wireless network interfaces effectively and
    fairly distributes packets over end-to-end multi-path through multiple network
    interfaces. Each network interface is considered to have a distribution counter
    associated with corresponding end-to-end path. This distribution counter varied
    by both weighted capacity and distributed packets is used to determine if a network
    interface has enough credits to distribute incoming packets on corresponding end-to-end
    path. As a useful design parameter, the capacity unit can be shown to make the
    performance of the proposed scheme as good as possible.</p>"
