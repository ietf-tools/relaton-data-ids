abstract:
- content: "<p>A single physical link can have multiple prefixes assigned to it. In
    that environment, end hosts might have multiple IP addresses and be required to
    use them selectively. RFC 3484 defines default source and destination address
    selection rules and is implemented in a variety of OSs. But, it has been too difficult
    to use operationally for several reasons. In some environments where multiple
    prefixes are assigned on a single physical link, the host using the default address
    selection rules will experience some trouble in communication. This document describes
    the possible problems that end hosts could encounter in an environment with multiple
    prefixes. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
