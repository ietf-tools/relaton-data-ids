abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) protocol depends on the
    availability of layer three (3) IPvX connectivity between redundant peers and
    it can interact with the variant of Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (S-BFD) protocol to achieve a much faster failure detection. This document describes
    how to extend the VRRP protocol to support S-BFD as a detection system for Primary
    Router failures. To announce the use of this implementation, a new VRRP packet
    type and a new timer are defined. To facilitate and increase the user experience
    while deploying this implementation, an auto-calculation algorithm for the S-BFD
    Discriminators is also implemented.</p>"
