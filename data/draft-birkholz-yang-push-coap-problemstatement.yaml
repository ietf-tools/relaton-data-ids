abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement, derives an initial gap
    analysis and illustrates a first set of solution approaches in regard to augmenting
    YANG data stores based on the CoAP Management Interface with YANG Push capabilities.
    A binary transfer mechanism for YANG Subscribed Notifications addresses both the
    requirements of constrained-node networks and the need for semantic interoperability
    via self-descriptiveness of the corresponding data in motion.</p>"
