abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP and HTML provide the facility to query the user and return the
    results. This is usually done in the query component of an URL. This mechanisms
    works with full satisfaction for characters of the us- ascii repertoire. Due to
    the lack of an agreed encoding for other characters, the situation is much less
    satisfactory for characters outside the us-ascii repertoire.</p>"
