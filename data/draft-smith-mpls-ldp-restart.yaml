abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a lightweight mechanism that the LDP protocol
    may use to help minimize the impact introduced by transient interruptions to an
    LDP session's TCP connection, with a focus on connection preservation for signaled
    Layer 2 circuits. A new LDP Cork message request/response mechanism is specified.
    New message types are defined for the delivery of graceful restart events. Finally,
    procedures for utilizing this mechanism are detailed.</p>"
