abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP extends the TCP protocol to allow multiple paths to be
    used simultaneously for the same TCP connection. The different paths are typically
    provided using multiple IP addresses for the same end system, each address taken
    from a subnet that is routed differently. In this document we describe a set of
    conventions for how to ensure that outgoing packets are routed in a manner consistent
    with the network topology and constraints on use of that topology such as those
    imposed by ingress filtering on IP address prefixes.</p>"
