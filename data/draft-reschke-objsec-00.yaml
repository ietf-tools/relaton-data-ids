abstract:
- content: "<p>A tremendous growth in different uses of the Internet has led to a
    growing need to protect data sent over public networks, including data sent via
    HTTP. Resorting to the use of end-to-end TLS and https for the majority of traffic
    looks at first like a most feasible response. However, the more sophisticated
    the web architecture becomes as it goes beyond the simple client-server model,
    the more the end-to-end use of TLS shows its downside as it excludes the use of
    beneficial intermediaries like caches or proxies that provide instrumental services.
    The need for greater privacy seems to collide with the equally growing desire
    for better end-to-end performance and user experience. As an example, the use
    of TLS and https often appears to maximise the benefit for the first but not the
    benefit for the combination of both. This document describes this dilemma and
    lays out a number of objectives of what should ideally be achieved, namely catering
    for sufficient security and privacy whilst providing users with the opportunity
    to make use of intermediaries' services where considered beneficial. We then introduce
    a number of characteristics potential solutions could have, with the hope that
    those will steer us towards suitable protocol mechanisms and data formats. End-to-end
    protocols which are aware of intermediaries should enable users and/or content
    providers to exercise fine-grained control over what intermediaries shall be able
    to do and what exposure to data or metadata they shall be permitted to get. The
    document then highlights anticipated benefits to key stakeholders like users,
    content providers and intermediaries. As elements like object security can play
    a useful role, we encourage the analysis of related pieces of work in order to
    discern their applicability, limitations, and coverage of use cases. This will
    allow us to frame an overall architecture and motivate more detailed work on protocols
    and mechanisms in the future.</p>"
