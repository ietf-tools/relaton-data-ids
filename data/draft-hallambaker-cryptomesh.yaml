abstract:
- content: "<p>The Magic Mathematical Mesh 'the Mesh' is a security infrastructure
    for the Internet that puts individual users in control of their security. Through
    large scale redundancy and replication techniques, mesh users have a high level
    of assurance that data stored in the mesh through a mesh gateway node will be
    available at a later date. The mesh does not offer confidentiality guarantees.
    All data in the mesh is assumed to be public. Confidential data stored in the
    mesh must be protected using strong encryption. The mesh provides a medium that
    enables the exchange of private key data but never passes private data of any
    form in plaintext form. The mesh enables use of end-to-end and transport security
    with mutual authentication in a wide range of client server and peer-peer applications.
    These include email, remote access and the Web. Unlike previous attempts to establish
    such infrastructures, the password management application supported by the mesh
    delivers users with an immediate benefit that does not rely on adoption by others.</p>"
