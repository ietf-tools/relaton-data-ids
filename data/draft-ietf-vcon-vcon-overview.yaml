abstract:
- content: "<p>A vCon is the container for data and information relating to a real-
    time, human conversation. It is analogous to a [vCard] which enables the definition,
    interchange and storage of an individual's various points of contact. The data
    contained in a vCon may be derived from any multimedia session, traditional phone
    call, video conference, SMS or MMS message exchange, webchat or email thread.
    The data in the container relating to the conversation may include Call Detail
    Records (CDR), call meta data, participant identity information (e.g. STIR PASSporT),
    the actual conversational data exchanged (e.g. audio, video, text), realtime or
    post conversational analysis and attachments of files exchanged during the conversation.
    A standardized conversation container enables many applications, establishes a
    common method of storage and interchange, and supports identity, privacy and security
    efforts (see [vCon-white-paper])</p>"
