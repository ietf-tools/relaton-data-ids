abstract:
- content: "<p>A recurrent theme in emerging real-time communications use cases, such
    as RTCWEB, has been the need to handle very large numbers of media flows. Unfortunately,
    naive uses of SDP do not handle this case particularly well. This document describes
    a modest set of extensions to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary numbers
    of flows while still retaining a large degree of backward compatibility with existing
    and non-RTCWEB endpoints.</p>"
