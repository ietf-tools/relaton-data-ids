abstract:
- content: "<p>The network in datacenter is required to provide a tenant network,
    which should be virtualized, and be able to provide L2 switching or L3 routing
    capability. A combined L2&amp;L3 solution could provide great scalability for
    both Layer2 and Layer3 switching. In this document, we propose to apply centralized
    server to be the control plane of the combined L2&amp;L3 solution, to provide
    better scalability for the control plane. The combined L2&amp;L3 solution in this
    draft is named Virtualized Integrated Routing&amp;Bridging (shorted as VIRB).</p>"
