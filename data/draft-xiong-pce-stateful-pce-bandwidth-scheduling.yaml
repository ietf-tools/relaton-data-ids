abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) using PCEP. This document proposes a set of extensions
    for the stateful PCE, so as to enable bandwidth scheduling for LSP and adjust
    the bandwidth based on the customers' scheduled bandwidth requirement of a traffic
    service in a centralized network environment. A bandwidth scheduled LSP can be
    adjusted to the new bandwidth at its starting time and adjusted back to the original
    bandwidth at its ending time.</p>"
