abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a
    request to specify that a PIDF be returned in the response if the location was
    valid, but there were some missing elements. For example, an civic location that
    did not include a postal code, but was otherwise a complete, and unambiguous location,
    would receive a complete PIDF in the response that included the postal code.</p>"
