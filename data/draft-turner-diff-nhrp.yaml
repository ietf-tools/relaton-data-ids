abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need, for relatively simple and scaleable methods of providing
    differentiated classes of service for IP traffic over various WAN media, to support
    different types of applications and specific business requirements. The Differentiated
    Services approach to providing quality of service (QoS) in Networks, employs a
    small, well-defined set of building blocks from which a variety of services may
    be built. A small bit-pattern in each packet in the IPv4 ''TOS octet'' or in the
    IPv6 ''Traffic Class octet'' is used to mark a packet to receive a differentiated
    forwarding treatment or per-hop behavior at each network node. IETF Working Groups
    will standardize a common layout for both octets, called the ''DS byte'' superseding
    the IPv4 TOS octet definitions or RFC 1349 [1]. The goal of this contribution
    is to suggest how the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) may be extended and
    deployed in conjunction with the IP ToS octet (DS-Byte) to create both differentiated
    forwarding and differentiated class of service over an NBMA network such as ATM
    or Frame-Relay. In the proposed solution, any SVC created between the same two
    points in an NBMA network will be used bi-directionally by traffic with the same
    class of service. This is achieved by extending the scope of the existing NHRP
    protocol to include QoS information in the extensions part of both the NHRP resolution
    request and resolution reply, and by implementing a NBMA addressing scheme that
    dynamically maps CoS, to subaddresses that are unique within the NBMA network.
    The proposal is compliant with the NHRP specifications, and every effort is made
    by the proposal to build on the work currently underway within the IETF that is
    attempting to standardize on the use of the ToS octet (DS-byte) within the IP
    datagram.</p>"
