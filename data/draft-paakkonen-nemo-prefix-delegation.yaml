abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a dynamic Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) delegation
    extension for Mobile IPv6 protocol to enable MNP delegation for mobile networks.
    A MNP is an IPv6 prefix used in a mobile network. The extension supports dynamic
    delegation, return, refreshing and updating operations related to MNP delegation
    operations between a Mobile Router (MR) of a mobile network and the MR's Home
    Agent (HA). This extension is proposed, because there is a lack for a dynamic
    MNP delegation protocol related to mobile networks, and currently MNPs have to
    be assigned statically to enable mobile networking.</p>"
