abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
    quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. The overall
    rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN domain, and PCN-packets
    are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes
    pass information about these PCN-marks to decision points which then decide whether
    to admit or block new flow requests or to terminate some already-admitted flows
    during serious pre-congestion. This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be
    encoded into the IP header by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
    codepoints within a PCN-domain. This encoding provides for up to three different
    PCN marking states using a single DSCP: not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM)
    and excess-traffic-marked (ETM). Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding.
    This document obsoletes RFC5696.</p>"
