abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies two new resource records for the Domain Name
    System, and how to use them with the Host Identity Protocol. These records allow
    a HIP node to store in the DNS its Host Identity (i.e., its public key), Host
    Identity Tag (i.e., a truncated hash of its public key), and Rendezvous Servers
    (RVS).</p>"
