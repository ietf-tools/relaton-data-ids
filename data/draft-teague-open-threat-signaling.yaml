abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method by which a device or application may
    signal information relating to current threat handling to other devices/applications
    that may reside locally or at the service provider. The initial focus is ddos
    mitigation; however, the method may be extended to communicate any threat type.
    This will allow for a vendor or provider agnostic approach to threat mitigation
    utilising multiple layers of protection as the operator sees fit. The dissemination
    of threat information will occur utilising JSON RPC API over HTTPS communications
    between devices/applications and will be augmented by IPFIX and UDP or SCTP for
    signaling telemetry information relating to attacks and protected object data.
    An open standards based approach to communication between on-premise DDoS mitigation
    devices and service provider based DDoS protection services allows for enterprises
    to have a wider range of options to better secure their environments without the
    limitations of vendor lock-in.</p>"
