abstract:
- content: "<p>Operational experience with DHCPv6 prefix delegation has shown that
    when the DHCPv6 relay function is not co-located with the DHCPv6 server function,
    issues such as timer synchronization between the DHCP functional elements, rejection
    of client's messages by the relay, and other problems have been observed. These
    problems can result in prefix delegation failing or traffic to/from clients addressed
    from the delegated prefix being unrouteable. Although [RFC8415] mentions this
    deployment scenario, it does not provide necessary detail on how the relay element
    should behave when used with PD. This document describes functional requirements
    for a DHCPv6 PD relay when used for relaying prefixes delegated by a separate
    DHCPv6 server.</p>"
