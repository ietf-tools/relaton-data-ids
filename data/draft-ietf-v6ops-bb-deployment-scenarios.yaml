abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a detailed description of IPv6 deployment and
    integration methods and scenarios in today\\'s Service Provider (SP) Broadband
    (BB) networks in coexistence with deployed IPv4 services. Cable/HFC, BB Ethernet,
    xDSL, and WLAN are the main BB technologies that are currently deployed, and discussed
    in this document. The emerging Broadband Power Line Communications (PLC/BPL) access
    technology is also discussed for completeness. In this document we will discuss
    main components of IPv6 BB networks, their differences from IPv4 BB networks,
    and how IPv6 is deployed and integrated in each of these networks using tunneling
    mechanisms and native IPv6. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
