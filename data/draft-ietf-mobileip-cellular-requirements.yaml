- content: "<p>The increasing interest in Mobile IP as a potential macro-mobility
    solution for cellular networks leads to new solutions and extensions to the existing
    protocol. As part of this work, there is a need to gather the requirements on
    Mobile IP from a cellular perspective. This draft lists a set of requirements
    on Mobile IP for use in cellular networks, for instance IMT-2000, and relates
    the requirements to proposed solutions.</p>"
