abstract:
- content: "<p>The second version of the Structure of Management Information (SMIv2)
    introduced the StorageType textual convention in RFC 2579. It is used to describe
    the memory realization of rows in conceptual tables. Several standards-track MIB
    modules make use of this convention. Implementation experience shows that different
    approaches are used to actually write conceptual rows into non-volatile memory.
    This memo addresses this question and provides a MIB module which can be used
    to explicitly commit non-volatile rows into non-volatile memory.</p>"
