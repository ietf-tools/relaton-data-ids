abstract:
- content: "<p>During the next few years, as the IPv4 address space moves toward exhaustion,
    it is likely that the deployment of NAT will accelerate. This draft presents the
    requirements that NAT devices must meet in order to enable use of UDP by peer-to-peer
    applications. The requirement can be summed up by the need to avoid gratuitous
    filtering and too short timers.</p>"
