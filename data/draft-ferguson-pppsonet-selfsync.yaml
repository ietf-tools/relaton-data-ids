abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of a self-synchronous scrambler to minimize the possibility
    that a carefully chosen PPP over SONET/SDH payload can cause a long sequence of
    zero bits to be transmitted is examined. It is pointed out that, while self-synchronous
    scramblers have some attractive properties for the application, the x^43 + 1 scrambler
    used by ATM for the same purpose has some unfortunate interactions with the 16-bit
    CRC Frame Check Sequence which is the PPP default FCS. It is suggested that adding
    a third term to the self-synchronous generator polynomial might improve its behaviour,
    and that inverting the scrambler bit ordering so it is applied to the data in
    the same bit order as the PPP CRC FCS algorithms are defined for may eliminate
    any remaining effect such scramblers have on either PPP FCS.</p>"
