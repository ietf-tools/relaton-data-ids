abstract:
- content: <p>Formally, any DNS resource record may occur under any domain name. However
    some services have defined an operational convention, which applies to DNS leaf
    nodes that are under a DNS branch having one or more reserved node names, each
    beginning with an _underscore. The underscored naming construct defines a semantic
    scope for DNS record types that are associated with the parent domain, above the
    underscored branch. This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and
    defines the "DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry" with IANA. The purpose
    of the Underscore registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the
    same underscore-based name, for different services.</p>
