abstract:
- content: "<p>The Peer-to-Peer Streaming Peer Protocol (PPSPP) is a peer-to-peer
    based transport protocol for content dissemination. It can be used for streaming
    on-demand and live video content, as well as conventional downloading. In PPSPP,
    the clients consuming the content participate in the dissemination by forwarding
    the content to other clients via a mesh-like structure. It is a generic protocol
    which can run directly on top of UDP, TCP, or as a RTP profile. Features of PPSPP
    are short time-till-playback and extensibility. Hence, it can use different mechanisms
    to prevent freeriding, and work with different peer discovery schemes (centralized
    trackers or Distributed Hash Tables). Depending on the underlying transport protocol,
    PPSPP can also use different congestion control algorithms, such as LEDBAT, and
    offer transparent NAT traversal. Finally, PPSPP maintains only a small amount
    of state per peer and detects malicious modification of content. This documents
    describes PPSPP and how it satisfies the requirements for the IETF Peer-to-Peer
    Streaming Protocol (PPSP) Working Group's peer protocol.</p>"
