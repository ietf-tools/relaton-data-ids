abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a set of state machines for Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) peer, EAP stand-alone authenticator (non-pass-through), EAP backend
    authenticator (for use on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
    servers), and EAP full authenticator (for both local and pass-through). This set
    of state machines shows how EAP can be implemented to support deployment in either
    a peer/authenticator or peer/authenticator/AAA Server environment. The peer and
    stand-alone authenticator machines are illustrative of how the EAP protocol defined
    in RFC 3748 may be implemented. The backend and full/pass-through authenticators
    illustrate how EAP/AAA protocol support defined in RFC 3579 may be implemented.
    Where there are differences, RFC 3748 and RFC 3579 are authoritative. The state
    machines are based on the EAP "Switch" model. This model includes events and actions
    for the interaction between the EAP Switch and EAP methods. A brief description
    of the EAP "Switch" model is given in the Introduction section. The state machine
    and associated model are informative only. Implementations may achieve the same
    results using different methods. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
