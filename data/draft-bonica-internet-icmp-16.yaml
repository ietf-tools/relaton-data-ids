abstract:
- content: <p>This document redefines selected ICMP messages to support multi-part
    operation. A multi-part ICMP message carries all of the information that ICMP
    messages carried previously, as well as additional information that applications
    may require. Multi-part messages are supported by an ICMP extension structure.
    The extension structure is situated at the end of the ICMP message. It includes
    an extension header followed by one or more extension objects. Each extension
    object contains an object header and object payload. All object headers share
    a common format. This document further redefines the above mentioned ICMP messages
    by specifying a length attribute. All of the currently defined ICMP messages to
    which an extension structure can be appended include an "original datagram" field.
    The "original datagram" field contains the initial octets of the datagram that
    elicited the ICMP error message. Although the original datagram field is of variable
    length, the ICMP message does not include a field that specifies its length. Therefore,
    in order to facilitate message parsing, this document allocates eight previously
    reserved bits to reflect the length of the "original datagram" field. The proposed
    modifications change the requirements for ICMP compliance. The impact of these
    changes on compliant implementations is discussed, and new requirements for future
    implementations are presented. This memo updates RFC 792 and RFC 4443. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
