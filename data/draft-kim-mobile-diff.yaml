- content: "<p>This document provides a method to be able to support mobility service
    in the Differentiate Service Architecture[1]. For this service we used Mobile
    IP[2] as mobility scheme. So we define new functions and operations and we modify
    the header formats already defined in Mobile IP[2] suggested in IETF support under
    IPv4 and IPv6.</p>"
