abstract:
- content: "<p>There are challenges to request quality of service for an application
    or network flow that is not part of a mobile network's Evolved Packet Core (EPC).
    This document addresses this issue by defining a mechanism to signal the desired
    characteristics of a flow to the Mobile Network from a User Equipment (UE) using
    Port Control Protocol (PCP). The signaled characteristics allow the Mobile Network
    to enforce appropriate policies such as prioritize that flow accordingly and trigger
    dedicated bearer activation or bearer modification procedure.</p>"
