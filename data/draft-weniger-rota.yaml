abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 in route optimization mode reveals mobile node's care-of
    address to the correspondent node and hence cannot provide location privacy. In
    contrast, Mobile IPv6 in bi-directional tunneling mode can provide location privacy,
    but the resulting route may be far from optimal, especially when correspondent
    node is mobile as well. This may be an issue for conversational mobile-to-mobile
    communication scenarios, e.g., using VoIP. The draft discusses the problem of
    providing both location privacy and route optimization with Mobile IPv6 and describes
    a solution in terms of an optional extension to Mobile IPv6. The basic idea is
    that mobile nodes switch the reverse tunnel endpoint in bi-directional tunneling
    mode from their home agent to a so-called tunneling agent in an on-demand manner.
    To ensure location privacy, the tunneling agent selection is done by the home
    agents. The solution does not require the mobile node to change its home address
    and does not rely on visited network support.</p>"
