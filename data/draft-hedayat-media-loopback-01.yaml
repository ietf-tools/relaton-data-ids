abstract:
- content: <p>The wide deployment of VoIP and Video over IP services has introduced
    new challenges in managing and maintaining voice/video quality, reliability, and
    overall performance. In particular, media delivery is an area that needs attention.
    One method of meeting these challenges is monitoring the media delivery performance
    by looping media back to the transmitter. This is typically referred to as "active
    monitoring" of services. Media loopback is especially popular in ensuring the
    quality of transport to the edge of a given VoIP or Video over IP service. Today
    in networks that deliver real-time media, short of running ' ping' and ' traceroute'
    to the edge, service providers are left without the necessary tools to actively
    monitor, manage, and diagnose quality issues with their service. The extension
    defined herein adds new SDP media attributes which enables establishment of media
    sessions where the media is looped back to the transmitter. Such media sessions
    will serve as monitoring and troubleshooting tools by providing the means for
    measurement of more advanced VoIP and Video Over IP performance metrics.</p>
