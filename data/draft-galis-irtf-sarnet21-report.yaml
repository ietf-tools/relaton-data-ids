abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an overview of the "Semantic Addressing and Routing
    for Future Networks" workshop (SARNET-21), which took place on June 10, 2021,
    in Paris, France and online as part of the IEEE International Conference on High-Performance
    Switching and Routing. The main goal of the SARNET-21 workshop was to explore,
    together with the research community, the use cases and network requirements in
    the domain of semantic addressing and routing, and identify potential research
    challenges to be tackled in the future. Note that this document is a report on
    the proceedings of the SARNET-21 workshop compiled by the authors. It captures
    the views and positions of the workshop participants as expressed during the workshop.</p>
