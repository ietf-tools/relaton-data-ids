abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a SIP header extension to allow for a UAC or
    outbound proxy to determine a request path through an initial set of downstream
    SIP proxies, i.e. a loose route mechanism. This is useful in scenarios of distributed
    service execution if for example a UA is located in a visited network and want
    have originating services executed in the user's home network. This solution is
    also applicable in the scenarios required by 3GPP in conjunction with the proposed
    path header.</p>"
