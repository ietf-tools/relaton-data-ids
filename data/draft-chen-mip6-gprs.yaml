abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an analysis of certain inter-working problems
    between IPv6 nodes running Mobile IPv6, at least one of which is connected to
    a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specified General Packet Radio Service/Universal
    Mobile Tele- communications System (GPRS/UMTS) network. The inter-working problems
    are caused by some specific packet filtering operations at the edge of the GPRS/UMTS
    network which are applied to control access to the GPRS/UMTS services and network
    resources. However, we believe that other scenarios may exist in which similar
    packet filtering operations may be applied and that similar problems would arise
    in these more general scenarios. The GPRS Gateway Support Node (GGSN) checks the
    source address or the destination address in the basic IPv6 header of incoming
    or outgoing IP datagrams against a set of packet filtering information established
    during the GPRS/UMTS session set-up. The packet filtering information remains
    stable during the sessions and independent of Mobile IP. When MIPv6 is activated
    by either end of the IPv6 mobile nodes, the packet filtering will fail to perform
    properly and subsequently block the traffic due to the mismatch between the packet
    filters and the current source address or destination address in the basic IPv6
    header of the IP datagrams to and from the IPv6 mobile nodes.</p>"
