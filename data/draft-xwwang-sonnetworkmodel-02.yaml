abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, a swarm intelligence based self-organizing network model
    was introduced to network providers. The problems of the existing network as well
    as the characteristics of the NGI (Next Generation Internet) were described to
    illustrate the motivation of the proposed self-organizing network model. A network
    architecture model based on swarm intelligence was introduced, the used technical
    terms was defined. The network parameters, network behaviors and node stability
    under the proposed model were described. Especially, some important QoS routing
    elements under the proposed model, such as the user QoS routing requirements,
    link satisfaction degree, utility computation, unicast path and multicast tree
    evaluation, mathematical model of QoS route optimization and small-world behaviors,
    were introduced.</p>"
