abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at identifying the requirements which should be
    taken into consideration by a service provider, when considering the deployment
    of an IP VPN service offering. From this perspective, this document does not specify
    any technical means which could be used to deploy an IP VPN service offering,
    unlike the [VPN-FRAME] document. This document tries to express a service provider
    perspective, according to its own experience of IP-based service offerings, and
    to its own perception of the (constantly) evolving needs of the customers of such
    services. To some extent, this document can be viewed as a complementary taxonomy
    effort of the [TAXONOMY] draft.</p>"
