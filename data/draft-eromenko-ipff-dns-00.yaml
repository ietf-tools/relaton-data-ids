abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the changes that need to be made to the Domain
    Name System (DNS) to support hosts running IP version 5 (IPFF). The changes include
    a resource record type to store an IPFF address, a domain to support lookups based
    on an IPFF address, and updated definitions of existing query types that return
    Internet addresses as part of additional section processing. The extensions are
    designed to be compatible with existing applications and, in particular, DNS implementations
    themselves.</p>"
