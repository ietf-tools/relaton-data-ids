abstract:
- content: <p>This document examines problems related to the massive scaling of data
    centers. Our initial scope is relatively narrow. Specifically, we focus on address
    resolution (ARP and ND) within a single L2 broadcast domain, in which all nodes
    are within the same physical data center. From an IP perspective, the entire L2
    network comprises one IP subnet or IPv6 "link". Data centers in which a single
    L2 network spans multiple geographic locations are out-of-scope.</p>
