abstract:
- content: "<p>The period of IPv4/IPv6 transisation will last for a long time. Different
    phases of IPv4/IPv6 transisation have different scenarioes and requirements thus
    need different solutions. In the early stage of IPv4/IPv6 transisation, sicne
    the majority of the Internet resources locate in the IPv4 Internet, the main communication
    type of the IPv4/IPv6 transition is v6 to v4 which is the IPv6 clients iniate
    communication to the IPv4 servers. At the later stage of the IPv4/ IPv6 transisation,
    the servers may locate in the IPv6 network/ Internet, in this scenario, there
    is a need for the legacy IPv4 client to iniate communication to the IPv6 servers.
    This document analyses the problems of v4 to v6 communication and discusses a
    solution called PNAT-Lite.</p>"
