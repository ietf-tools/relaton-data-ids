abstract:
- content: "<p>Group Based Policy can be used to achieve micro or macro segmentation
    of user traffic. For Group Based Policy, a Group Policy ID, also known as Group
    Policy Tag, is used to represent a logical group that shares the same policy and
    access privilege. This document defines a backward compatible extension to Virtual
    eXtensible Local Area Network (VXLAN) that allows a Group Policy ID to be carried
    for the purposes of policy enforcement at the egress Network Virtualization Edge
    (NVE). It also defines a new BGP Extended Community that can be used to propagate
    Group Policy ID through a BGP route advertisement in the control plane. This is
    to facilitate policy enforcement at the ingress NVE when feasible.</p>"
