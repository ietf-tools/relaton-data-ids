abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an application programming interface and a corresponding
    protocol (MGCP) which is used between elements of a decomposed multimedia gateway.
    The decomposed multimedia gateway consists of a Call Agent, which contains the
    call control "intelligence", and a media gateway which contains the media functions,
    e.g., conversion from TDM voice to Voice over IP. Media gateways contain endpoints
    on which the Call Agent can create, modify and delete connections in order to
    establish and control media sessions with other multimedia endpoints. Also, the
    Call Agent can instruct the endpoints to detect certain events and generate signals.
    The endpoints automatically communicate changes in service state to the Call Agent.
    Furthermore, the Call Agent can audit endpoints as well as the connections on
    endpoints. The basic and general MGCP protocol is defined in this document, however
    most media gateways will need to implement one or more MGCP packages, which define
    extensions to the protocol suitable for use with specific types of media gateways.
    Such packages are defined in separate documents. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
