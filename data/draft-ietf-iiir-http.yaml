abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP is a protocol with the lightness and speed necessary for a distributed
    collaborative hypermedia information system. It is a generic stateless object-oriented
    protocol, which may be used for many similar tasks such as name servers, and distributed
    object-oriented systems, by extending the commands, or 'methods', used. A feature
    if HTTP is the negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
    independently of the development of new advanced representations.</p>"
