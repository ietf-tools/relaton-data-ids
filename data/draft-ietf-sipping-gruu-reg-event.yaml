abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3680 defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    for registration state. This package allows a watcher to learn about information
    stored by a SIP registrar, including its registered contact. However, the registered
    contact is frequently unreachable and thus not useful for watchers. The Globally
    Routable User Agent URI (GRUU), defined in RFC 5627, is a URI that is capable
    of reaching a particular contact. However this URI is not included in the document
    format defined in RFC 3680. This specification defines an extension to the registration
    event package to include GRUUs assigned by the registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
