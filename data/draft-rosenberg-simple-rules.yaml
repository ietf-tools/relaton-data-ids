abstract:
- content: "<p>Authorization is a key function in presence systems. Authorization
    policies, also known as authorization rules, specify what presence information
    can be given to which watchers, and when. This specification defines an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) document format for expressing presence authorization rules.
    Such a document can be manipulated by clients using the XML Configuration Access
    Protocol (XCAP), although other techniques are permitted.</p>"
