abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is intended to be a proposal for updating the current 'RIP
    version 2' RFC [1]. This necessity is due to a difference of behaviour between
    the RIP protocol as described in [1] and the RIP protocol as implemented by many
    vendors. If all the vendors apply the same rule, no problem arises. But, on the
    contrary, serious problems of interoperability can occur. With some little changes
    in the text, this draft can be used as the new 'RIP version 2' RFC. People just
    interested in the implementing protocols may simply go to paragraph 8 (Changing
    the current RFC) and skip all the others. The purpose of all the other paragraphs
    is to support the idea of changing the RFC.</p>"
