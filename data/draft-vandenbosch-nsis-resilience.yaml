abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group is chartered to develop
    requirements, architecture and protocols for the next IETF steps in signaling
    Quality-of-Service (QoS). Although the NSIS protocol may eventually be used for
    other applications in addition to QoS, it is expected that these, in much the
    same way as QoS, will depend on predictable and high-availability service delivery.
    This document attempts to identify, list and classify potential resilience issues
    for the NSIS protocol.</p>"
