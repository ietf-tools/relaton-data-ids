abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3978 disallow additional copyright notices in IETF Documents, but
    the running code within the IETF appear to be to ignore that rule and publish
    documents with additional copyright notices. There are arguments for permitting
    additional copyright notices in IETF documents, and some are given in this document.
    This document update the paragraph in RFC 3978 that discusses additional copyrights,
    to relax the requirement.</p>"
