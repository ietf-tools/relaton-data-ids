abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a TCP extension that enhances security for BGP,
    LDP and other TCP-based protocols. It is intended for applications where secure
    administrative access to both the end-points of the TCP connection is normally
    available. TCP peers can use this extension to authenticate messages passed between
    one another. The strategy described herein improves upon current practice, which
    is described in RFC 2385. Using this new strategy, TCP peers can update authentication
    keys during the lifetime of a TCP connection. TCP peers can also use stronger
    authentication algorithms to authenticate routing messages.</p>"
