abstract:
- content: "<p>The complexity of telecommunication networks, i.e. enterprise and carrier
    networks, has grown over the last two decades. Management of carrier networks
    and enterprise networks has followed different paradigms up to now: - In carrier
    networks the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) as created by ITU-T in
    the early 1980s is still being propagated. - In enterprise networks the SNMP based
    approach is widely accepted. The borders between public (carrier) and private
    (enterprise) networks are becoming increasingly transparent, a distinction between
    both types of networks may soon be irrelevant from a network management point
    of view.</p>"
