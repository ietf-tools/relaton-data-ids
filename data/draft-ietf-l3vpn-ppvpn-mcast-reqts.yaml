abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of functional requirements for network
    solutions that allow the deployment of IP multicast within Layer 3 (L3) Provider-Provisioned
    Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). It specifies requirements both from the end
    user and service provider standpoints. It is intended that potential solutions
    specifying the support of IP multicast within such VPNs will use these requirements
    as guidelines. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
