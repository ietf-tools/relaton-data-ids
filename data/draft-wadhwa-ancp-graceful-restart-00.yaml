abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes proposed extensions to ANCP (Access Node Control
    Protocol) for supporting a graceful state resynchronization between NAS (network
    access server) and AN (access node) upon control plane restart. Base ANCP as a
    dedicated control protocol between a NAS and an AN, and its various use cases
    are defined in [1].</p>"
