abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures potential impacts to IPv4 SIP implementations
    when interworking with IPv6 SIP implementations. Although some amount of interworking
    translation will occur at the network and application layers, an IPv4 SIP application
    may still encounter a SIP message with some IPv6 values in it, resulting in unforeseen
    error conditions. Such potential scenarios will be identified in this document
    so that SIP application developers can define solutions to handle these cases.
    Note, this document is not intended to be an exhaustive list, rather to provide
    an overview of some of the more commonly encountered potential scenarios.</p>"
