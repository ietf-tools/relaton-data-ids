abstract:
- content: "<p>Various technologies, including SRv6, allow to perform Traffic Engineering
    (TE), steering IP traffic through a specific path. However, there is no native
    mechanism in IP that allows to verify whether or not a packet did follow the path
    it was supposed to. This document specifies a new TLV for the Segment Routing
    Header (SRH) that allows to provide a cryptographically generated proof of transit
    over the different segments. The proposed mechanisms allows to verify whether
    a packet did go through the segments listed in its SRH header in the intended
    order.</p>"
