abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code. This response
    code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected their call
    attempt. No one will deliver, and thus no one will answer, the call. As a 6xx
    code, the caller will be aware that future attempts to contact the same User Agent
    Server will likely fail. The initial use case driving the need for the 608 response
    code is when the intermediary is an analytics engine. In this case, the rejection
    is by a machine or other process. This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response
    code, which a human at the target User Agent Server indicated the user did not
    want the call. In some jurisdictions this distinction is important. This document
    also defines the use of the Call-Info header field in 608 responses to enable
    rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls in error. This provides
    a remediation mechanism for legal callers that find their calls blocked.</p>"
