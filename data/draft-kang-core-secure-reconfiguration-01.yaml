abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a secure method to configure a key for a resource
    constrained node when it initially joins to network that is currently in operation.
    The method is suited for a scenario, where resource constrained nodes are interconnected
    with each other and thus form a network called Internet of Things. It is assumed
    that communications for all nodes are based on TCP/IP protocols and the nodes
    use the constrained application protocol (CoAP). The presented method does not
    cover all operations of secure bootstrapping for IoT networks, but it is intended
    to securely support self-reconfiguration of the pre-installed temporary key of
    joined node.</p>"
