abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a base profile for TLS protocol versions 1.2
    and 1.3, as well as DTLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 for use with the United
    States Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite. The profile applies
    to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National
    Security Systems that use TLS or DTLS. It is also appropriate for all other US
    Government systems that process high-value information. The profile is made publicly
    available here for use by developers and operators of these and any other system
    deployments.</p>"
