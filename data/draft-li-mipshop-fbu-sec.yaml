abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification introduces a symmetric cryptography mechanism for
    protecting signaling messages between the Mobile Node and previous Access Router
    for Fast Mobile IPv6. The method defined here utilizes the Master Session Key(MSK)
    generated from EAP authentication to derive a fast handover key between the Mobile
    Node and the Access Router in order to avoid certain attacks. This mechanism also
    adopts the Mobile Node Identifier option and the mobility message authentication
    option to the FMIPv6 signaling messages.</p>"
