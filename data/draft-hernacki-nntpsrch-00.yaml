abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News Transport
    Protocol [NNTP-977] that allows full-text searching of news articles across multiple
    newsgroups. This new search mechanism also allows search criteria to be saved
    into search profiles. Articles arriving on the server are checked against the
    profiles, and the articles that match are collected together for the client. The
    availability of the extensions described here will be advertised by the server
    using the extension negotiation-mechanism described in the new NNTP protocol specification
    currently being developed [NNTP-NEW].</p>"
