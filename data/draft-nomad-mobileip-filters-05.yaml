abstract:
- content: "<p>Filters for Mobile IPv4 bindings enables mobile nodes to associate
    one or more Filters with mobility bindings during registration. Flows that match
    a Filter will be processed as defined by the Filter. In this manner, it is possible
    for a mobile node to distribute flows or packets of a flow among its available
    points of attachment, or to request that such flows are dropped before reaching
    the mobile node.</p>"
