abstract:
- content: '<p>IPv6 rapid deployment on IPv4 infrastructures (6rd) builds upon mechanisms
    of 6to4 to enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service to
    IPv4 sites to which it provides customer premise equipment. Like 6to4, it utilizes
    stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure.
    Unlike 6to4, a 6rd service provider uses an IPv6 prefix of its own in place of
    the fixed 6to4 prefix. A service provider has used this mechanism for its own
    IPv6 "rapid deployment": five weeks from first exposure to 6rd principles to more
    than 1,500,000 residential sites being provided native IPv6, under the only condition
    that they activate it. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>'
