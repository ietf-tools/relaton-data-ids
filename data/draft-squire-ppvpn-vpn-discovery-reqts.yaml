abstract:
- content: "<p>VPNs are a common service being offered by providers. The PPVPN WG
    is tasked with defining a limited number of solutions to support the interoperable
    deployment of VPN services. As part of this effort, a design team was tasked with
    defining the requirements of PPVPN discovery proposals, to analyze if additional
    discovery schemes are needed, and to characterize potential solutions to the problem.
    This draft is the output of that design work. Consensus was not reached on the
    solution characteristics. However, this draft attempts to capture the discussions
    and positions of the design team exchanges.</p>"
