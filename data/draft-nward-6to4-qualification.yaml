abstract:
- content: "<p>A deployment problem exists with existing self-configuring 6to4 implementations
    making often incorrect assumptions about the state of their IPv4 network connectivity.
    This document describes the problem, and proposes a qualification mechanism by
    which nodes can validate that their connectivity to the global IPv6 network is
    suitable for use with the 6to4 protocol.</p>"
