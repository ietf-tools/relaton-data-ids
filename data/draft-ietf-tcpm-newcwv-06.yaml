abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that
    arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where the sending
    rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window. It provides
    an experimental update to TCP that allows a TCP sender to restart quickly following
    either a rate- limited interval. This method is expected to benefit applications
    that send rate-limited traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate
    response if congestion is experienced. It also evaluates the Experimental specification
    of TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV, defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that
    RFC 2861 sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used
    solution. This document therefore recommends that the status of RFC 2861 is moved
    from Experimental to Historic, and that it is replaced by the current specification.</p>"
