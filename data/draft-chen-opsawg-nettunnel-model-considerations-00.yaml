abstract:
- content: "<p>Tunnel is one typical service provided by carrier IP network. Network
    Tunnel service model can provide the northbound interface of network-level tunnel
    service of the controller to try to simplify the Tunnel provision without involving
    too much details of Tunnel implementation on the device. This document gives exploratory
    description about the requirement of network-level Tunnel service and how to define
    the data model which will provide the guidance for the future definition of the
    concrete data model.</p>"
