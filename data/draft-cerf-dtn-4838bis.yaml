abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant
    networks. It is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the Interplanetary
    Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like services
    across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration. This document
    describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with internetworks
    having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional (Internet-like)
    networking approaches either unworkable or impractical. We define a overlay protocol
    that interconnects multiple internets. The document presents a motivation for
    the architecture, an architectural overview, review of state management required
    for its operation, and a discussion of application design issues. This document
    represents the consensus of the IETF DTN working group and has been widely reviewed
    by that group.</p>"
