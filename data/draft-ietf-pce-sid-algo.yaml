abstract:
- content: "<p>The Algorithm associated with a prefix Segment-ID (SID) defines the
    path computation Algorithm used by Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). This information
    is available to controllers such as the Path Computation Element (PCE) via topology
    learning. This document proposes an approach for informing headend routers regarding
    the Algorithm associated with each prefix SID used in PCE-computed paths, as well
    as signalling a specific SID algorithm as a constraint to the PCE.</p>"
