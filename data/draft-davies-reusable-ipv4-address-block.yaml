abstract:
- content: "<p>Although IPv6 is being introduced globally, the entire IP ecosystem
    will not have transitioned to IPv6 before the forecast exhaustion of the global
    IPv4 address pools. This document describes a new transitional non-conflicting
    reusable IPv4 address block which will facilitate a smooth IPv4 to IPv6 transition
    for customers and transit providers. The address block would be assigned by IANA
    and have a limited time horizon to match its transitional purpose.</p>"
