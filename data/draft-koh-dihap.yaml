abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a proposed Dynamic Inter Home Agent solution to
    provide redundancy and load balancing of Home Agents. The proposed solution recommends
    additional communication between home agents that may be located far apart in
    terms of network topology but still belonging to or are trusted by the same administrative
    domains (service providers). While the mobile node is roaming away from its home
    network, intervening home agents in the path of the bidirectional tunnel between
    the mobile node and its registered home agent may detect its presence. The intervening
    home agents that are affiliated to the current home agent of the mobile node then
    proceed to update it of their availability to serve as home agent for the mobile
    node.</p>"
