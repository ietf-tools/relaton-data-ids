abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new streaming report block for the Extended
    Report (XR) packet type for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [1]. XR packets are
    an extension to the reception report blocks of RTCP sender report (SR) or Receiver
    Report (RR) packets. In [1] seven report blocks are defined to receive various
    information that helps the sender to monitor the network and assess quality of
    VoIP delivery. In this document we define a new report block for the XR packet,
    namely the streaming report block, to receive statistics about the quality of
    an audio and/or video streaming session.</p>"
