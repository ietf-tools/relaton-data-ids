abstract:
- content: "<p>This note proposes an address and service architecture designed to
    facilitate transition from an IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Internet. This service
    contains three parts: A DNS Application Layer Gateway, a stateful Network Address
    Translator that enables IPv6 clients to initiate connections to IPv4 servers and
    peers, and a stateless Network Address Translator that enables IPv4 and IPv6 systems
    to interoperate freely. It is couched as an update to RFCs 2765 and 2766. This
    is because the stateless service is essentially the SIIT with a different address
    format, and because the DNS Application Layer Gateway and the stateful translator
    have significant similarities to NAT-PT. There are, however, important differences
    from NAT-PT, responsive to the issues raised in RFC 4966.</p>"
