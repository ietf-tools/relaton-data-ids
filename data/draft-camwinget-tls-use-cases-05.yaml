abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, public sector,
    and cloud service providers today in order to both complement and enhance host-based
    security solutions. TLS 1.3 introduces several changes to TLS 1.2 with a goal
    to improve the overall security and privacy provided by TLS. However some of these
    changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions and deployments
    that adopt a multi-layered approach to security. While this may be viewed as a
    feature, there are several real-life use case scenarios where the same functionality
    and security can not be offered without such network-based security solutions.
    In this document, we identify the TLS 1.3 changes that may impact such use cases.</p>"
