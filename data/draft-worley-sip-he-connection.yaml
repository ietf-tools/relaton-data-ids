abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple transports running
    both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. In more and more cases, a SIP user agent (UA)
    is connected to multiple network interfaces. In these cases setting up a connection
    from a dual stack client to a dual stack server may suffer from the issues described
    in RFC 6555 [RFC6555] ("Happy Eyeballs") - significant delays in the process of
    setting up a working flow to a server. This negatively affects user experience.
    This document builds on RFC 6555 and explains how a [RFC3261] compliant SIP implementation
    can minimize delays when contacting a host name (obtained by using DNS NAPTR and
    SRV lookups) in a dual stack network using connection-oriented transport protocols.</p>
