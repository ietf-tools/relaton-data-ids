abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how BRSKI entities, such as registrars, proxies,
    pledges or others that are acting as responders, can be discovered and selected
    by BRSKI entities acting as initiators, especially in the face of variations in
    the protocols that can introduce non-interoperability when not equally supported
    by both responder and initiator. This document does not define any new discovery
    methods. Instead, it solves the challenges of announcing, discovering and selecting
    an interoperable instance of a BRSKI responder by defining a data model and simple
    string based encoding for BRSKI variations and by prescribing how to encode this
    encoding of variations into multiple pre-existing discovery mechanisms: DNS-SD,
    GRASP and CoAP discovery (CORE-LF). This document also defines the procedures
    necessary for interoperable announcement, discovery and selection in the face
    of redundant responder, making deployment more resilient by allowing easy and
    automatic redundancy. BRSKI Proxies are a core element of BRSKI. This document
    specifies how Proxies need to be implemented to support proxying of BRSKI variations,
    even supporting possible future variations not in existance when the proxy was
    implemented. Finally, this document defines the IANA registrities to track the
    definition of variations and their encoding and hence allow easy introduction
    of new variations, support of additional discovery protocols and even discovery
    of additional BRKI roles (such as MASA). All with no or minimum additional specification
    requirements other than new registry entries.</p>"
