abstract:
- content: <p>DNS messages between clients and servers may be received over either
    UDP or TCP. UDP transport involves keeping less state on a busy server, but can
    cause truncation and retries over TCP. Additionally, UDP can be exploited for
    reflection attacks. Using TCP would reduce retransmits and amplification. However,
    clients are currently limited in their use of the TCP transport as RFC 5966 suggests
    closing idle TCP sessions "in the order of seconds", making use of TCP only suitable
    for individual queries generated as a fallback protocol for truncated UDP answers.
    This document defines an EDNS0 option ("edns-tcp-keepalive") that allows DNS clients
    and servers to signal their respective readiness to conduct multiple DNS transactions
    over individual TCP sessions. This signalling facilitates a better balance of
    UDP and TCP transport between individual clients and servers, reducing the impact
    of problems associated with UDP transport and allowing the state associated with
    TCP transport to be managed effectively with minimal impact on the DNS transaction
    time.</p>
