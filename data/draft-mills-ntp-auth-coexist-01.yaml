abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to extend the NTP/SNTP authentication
    scheme to support additional features, including Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    cryptography, in order to certify the identity of the sender and verify the integrity
    of the data included in an NTP message, as well as provide support for other facilities
    such as a timestamp and non-repudiation service. This document describes a new
    extension field to support new services for securely binding sender credentials
    to the NTP message stream. One or more of these fields can be included in the
    NTP header to support designated security services or other services should they
    become necessary. The presence of these fields does not affect the operation of
    the NTP timekeeping model and protocol in any other way. Additional fields may
    provide means to securely bind arbitrary client data to be signed along with the
    other information in the message. The ability to sign arbitrary client data provides
    an important non- repudiation feature that allows this data to be cryptographically
    bound to an NTP timestamp, together with sender credentials and signature.</p>"
