abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used
    in Internet protocol design. More than seventeen years have passed since RFC3552
    was written and the structure and topology of the Internet have changed. With
    those changes comes a question: has the Internet Threat Model changed? Or, is
    the model described in RFC3552 still mostly accurate? This draft attempts to describe
    a non- exhaustive list of changes in the current threat environment. It finds
    that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences from the environment
    described in RFC3552 and is intended as input to the IAB program on the Internet
    threat model started in 2020.</p>"
