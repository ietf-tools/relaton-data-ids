abstract:
- content: "<p>Next generation Internet requires decentralized and distributed intelligence
    in order to make available a new type of experience to serve the user's interests.
    Such new services will be enabled by deploying the intelligence over a high volume
    of IoT devices in a form of distributed protocol. Such a protocol will orchestrate
    the machine learning (ML) application in order to train the aggregated data available
    from the IoT devices. The training is not an easy task in such a distributed environment,
    where the amount of connected IoT devices will scale up and the needs for both
    interoperability and computing are high. This draft, addresses both issues by
    combining two emerging technologies known as edge AI and fog computing. The protocol
    procedures aggregate the data collected by the IoT devices into a fog node and
    apply edge AI for data analysis at the edge of the infrastructure. The analysis
    of the IoT requirements resulted in an end-to-end ML protocol specification which
    is presented throughout this draft.</p>"
