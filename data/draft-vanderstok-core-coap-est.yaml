abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-resource devices in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) can operate
    in a mesh network using the IPv6 over Low-power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)
    and IEEE 802.15.4 link-layer standards. Provisioning these devices in a secure
    manner with keys (often called security bootstrapping) used to encrypt and authenticate
    messages is the subject of Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Key Infrastructures
    (BRSKI) [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]. Enrollment over Secure Transport
    (EST) [RFC7030], based on TLS and HTTP, is used for BRSKI. This document defines
    how low-resource devices are expected to use EST over DTLS and CoAP. 6LoWPAN fragmentation
    management and minor extensions to CoAP are needed to enable EST over DTLS-secured
    CoAP (EST-coaps).</p>"
