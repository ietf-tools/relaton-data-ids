abstract:
- content: "<p>Email address forgery is a problem on the Internet today. Domain owners
    want to control the use of their names in email, but are helpless because they
    lack the means. This document introduces a language for domains to make email-related
    declarations in DNS. It defines in detail one possible sender authentication scheme
    for domains to describe the hosts from which they send mail. SMTP receivers can
    use this scheme to detect sender forgery.</p>"
