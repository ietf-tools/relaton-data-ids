abstract:
- content: <p>It has been observed that specifications of new RTP payload formats
    often forget to register themselves in the IANA registry "RTP Payload Formats
    Media Types". In practice this has no real impact. One reason is that the Media
    Types registry is the crucial registry to register any Media Type to establish
    the media type used to identified the format in various signaling usage. To resolve
    this situation this document performs the following. First it updates the registry
    to include known RTP payload formats at the time of writing. Then it closes the
    IANA Registry for RTP Payload formats Media Types for future registration. Beyond
    instructing IANA to close this registry, the instructions to authors in RFC 8088
    are updated to reflect this.</p>
