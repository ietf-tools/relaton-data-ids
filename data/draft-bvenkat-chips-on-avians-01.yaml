abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an experimental method for the funneling IP datagrams
    using tweets and chirps, through avian carriers which are embedded with a processor/chip
    that is biomedically engineered to fit in their tiny brains. This specification
    is primarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks where agile predatory domestic
    or feral species are not widespread. This is an experimental, not recommended
    method.</p>"
