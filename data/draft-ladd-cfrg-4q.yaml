abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Curve4Q, a twisted Edwards curve proposed in
    [Curve4Q] that takes advantage of arithmetic over the field GF(2^127-1) and two
    endomorphisms to achieve the speediest Diffie- Hellman key agreements over a group
    of order approximately 2^246, which provides around 128 bits of security. Curve4Q
    implementations are more than two times faster than those of Curve25519 and, when
    not using endomorphisms, are between 1.2 and 1.6 times faster.</p>"
