abstract:
- content: "<p>The MarNEW workshop aimed to discuss solutions for badnwidth optimisation
    on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current solutions rely on unencrypted
    content which is not indicative of the security needs of today's internet users.
    The workshop gathered IETF attendees, IAB members and various organisations involved
    in the telecommunications industry including original equipment manufacturers
    and mobile network operators. The group discussed the current internet encryption
    trends and deployment issues identified within the IETF, and the privacy needs
    of users which should be adhered. Solutions designed around sharing data from
    the network to the endpoints and vice versa were then discussed as well as analysing
    whether the current issues experienced on the transport layer are also playing
    a role here. Content providers and CDNs gave an honest view of their experiences
    delivery content with mobile network operators. Finally, technical responses to
    regulation was discussed to help the regulated industries relay the issues of
    impossible to implement or bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators. A
    group of suggested solutions were devised which will be discussed in various IETF
    groups moving forward.</p>"
