abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a 'Green Model' for information commerce using the
    Internet. In this model, the information merchant carries all risk of non-payment.
    By shifting the risk of non-payment, we do not require guarantees of credit worthiness
    for a merchant. This allows every participant to be both a buyer and a merchant
    of information on the Internet. Transactions relating to accounting and settlement
    are performed through either the exchange of store-and-forward messages (using
    the 'application/green-commerce' format defined in [1]), or interactive protocol
    exchanges (using the 'Simple Green Commerce Protocol' defined in [2]).</p>"
