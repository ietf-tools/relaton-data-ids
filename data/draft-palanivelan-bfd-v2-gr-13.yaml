abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a historical record of discussions about extending
    the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol to provide additional capabilities
    to handle Graceful Restart. These discussions took place in the context of the
    IETF's BFD working group, and the consensus in that group was that these extensions
    should not be made. This document presents a summary of the challenges to BFD
    in surviving a graceful restart, and outlines a potential protocol solution that
    was discussed and rejected within the BFD working group. The purpose of this document
    is to provide a record of the work done so that future effort will not be wasted.
    This document does not propose or document any extensions to BFD, and there is
    no intention that it should be implemented in its current form.</p>"
