abstract:
- content: "<p>Operational efficiency in incident management on telecom and computer
    networks requires correlating and interpreting large volumes of heterogeneous
    technical information. Knowledge graphs can provide a unified view of complex
    systems through shared vocabularies. YANG data models enable describing network
    configurations and automating their deployment. However, both approaches face
    challenges in vocabulary alignment and adoption, hindering knowledge capitalization
    and sharing on network designs and best practices. To address this, the concept
    of a IT Service Management (ITSM) Knowledge Graph (KG) is introduced to leverage
    existing network infrastructure descriptions in YANG format and enable abstract
    reasoning on network behaviors. The key principle to achieve the construction
    of such ITSM-KG is to transform YANG representations of network infrastructures
    into an equivalent knowledge graph representation, and then embed it into a more
    extensive data model for Anomaly Detection (AD) and Risk Management applications.
    In addition to use case analysis and design pattern analysis, an experiment is
    proposed to assess the potential of the ITSM-KG in improving network quality and
    designs.</p>"
