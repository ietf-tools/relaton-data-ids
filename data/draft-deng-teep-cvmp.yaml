abstract:
- content: "<p>Confidential virtual machine (CVM) in the cloud environment is a use
    case of confidential computing where VM confidentiality is enabled by hardware.
    A cloud user’s CVM is isolated from the hypervisor provided by its cloud service
    provider, meaning the cloud service provider cannot access the workload and data
    in the CVM. This is used in the scenario where a cloud user intends to protect
    its sensitive workload and data from cloud service provider while at the same
    time desires to utilize the advantages of cloud technology. This document specifies
    the CVM provisioning in cloud environment including the provisioning process and
    protocol, and the security requirements.</p>"
