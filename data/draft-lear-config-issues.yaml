abstract:
- content: "<p>How are network elements configured? What are the different ways in
    which a device receives configuration, and why do they use those particular mechanisms?
    How do these mechanisms perform for their given use? This document discusses the
    problem of device configuration and state exchange. As we do so we will point
    out some protocol considerations, such as the objects being transported, how transfers
    are initiated, and what the security requirements are.</p>"
