abstract:
- content: "<p>Messaging Layer Security provides strong end-to-end security guarantees
    for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security
    (PCS). However, MLS requires a Delivery Service (DS) to facilitate agreement between
    group members on the order of Commit messages. In decentralized settings the only
    way to implement a functional DS is to require group members to retain key material
    so they can process commits out-of-order. Retaining key material this way is in
    violation of the MLS deletion schedule and significantly reduces the FS of the
    protocol. This draft specifies Decentralized MLS, based on the the Fork-Resilient
    Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK proposed by Alwen et al. [FRCGKA].
    In essence, DMLS extends MLS such that key material can be retained to process
    Commits out-of-order with minimal losses to FS, thus allowing safer deployment
    in decentralized environments.</p>"
