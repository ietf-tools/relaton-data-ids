abstract:
- content: "<p>Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for their application
    traffic (such as voice, video) based on SLAs negotiated with their providers,
    and translate those SLAs to vendor specific configuration language. Both learning
    of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other out-of-band method, and translating
    them to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, many times manual,
    process and prone to errors. This document proposes an in- band method of SLA
    signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities. This document defines
    an operational transitive attribute to signal SLA details in-band, across administrative
    boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up
    some of the complex tasks. Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is
    explicitly defined in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited
    to this use-case only.</p>"
