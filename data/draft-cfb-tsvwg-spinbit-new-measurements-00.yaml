abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces additional measurements by using the same
    spin bit signal as defined in [I-D.trammell-tsvwg-spin] and [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin].
    The spin bit signal alone is not enough to evaluate correctly in every network
    condition the RTT of a flow. In order to solve this problem, it is theorized the
    possibility of introducing an additional validation signal called delay bit, similar
    to what is done by the Valid Edge Counter (VEC), but using just one bit instead
    of two. An alternative with two bits is also introduced with a so called loss
    bit. More in general a loss signal is defined to measure packet loss and two alternatives
    are presented with one bit and two bits.</p>"
