abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2468 [1] defines the need of a standardized format for identifying
    ISP subscribers for dial-up roaming operations. It introduced the Network Access
    Identifier (NAI) to fulfill this need. The NAI is provided by the mobile node
    to the dialed ISP during PPP authentication. The ability to resolve an NAI for
    second and third generation cellular mobile nodes allow traditional cellular service
    providers to evolve their home cellular networks to provide cellular services,
    IP packet data services and so on with a single subscription using NAIs. Additionally,
    this allows cellular provider to evolve their networks to be IP based. Second
    and third generation cellular mobile nodes must perform a registration and authentication
    process with their wireless service provider before the mobile node user may initiate
    other operations (See [1] for examples). These mobile nodes do not support the
    programming of an NAI nor does the cellular registration message support the transfer
    of an NAI to the wireless access network. For example, North American cellular
    networks (e.g. AMPS, TDMA, CDMA) service mobiler nodes that register with a Mobile
    Identification Number (MIN). The MIN is then associated with a cellular subscriber.
    MIN is shown here only as an example, the same general idea is applicable to other
    types of identifiers used in different access network types. For the same reasons
    stated in [1], it would be convenient if an option was available to provide the
    wireless subscriber identification in the form of an NAI during the wireless registration
    and authentication process. This draft proposes a solution to resolve NAIs from
    traditional mobile node identifiers.</p>"
