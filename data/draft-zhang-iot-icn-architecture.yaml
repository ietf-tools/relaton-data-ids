abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to
    Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains, the
    current trend is to develop a unified IoT platform so that objects can be made
    accessible to applications across organizations and domains. Towards this goal,
    quite a few proposals have been made to build a unified IoT platform as an overlay
    on today's Internet. Such an overlay solution, however, is inadequate to address
    the important challenges posed by a unified IoT system, especially in terms of
    mobility, scalability, and communication reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies
    of the current Internet. To address this problem, we propose to build a unified
    IoT platform based on the Information Centric Network (ICN) architecture, which
    we call ICN-IoT. ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides
    seamless mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery.
    In this proposal, we first present a few popular IoT scenarios in smart homes,
    smart grid, smart transportation, and smart healthcare. Then we identify a list
    of important requirements with the unified IoT architecture that promises to support
    tens of billions of objects. After discussing the weaknesses of the current overlay-
    based IoT solution, we propose an ICN-based solution, ICN-IoT, which can sufficiently
    satisfy these requirements. We present an example ICN-IoT architecture and discuss
    how it supports efficient data discovery, data processing and data distribution.
    Finally, we show that ICN-IoT efficiently supports context- based scenarios, which
    are very common for many IoT applications.</p>"
