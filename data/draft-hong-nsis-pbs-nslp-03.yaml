abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP) for
    network traffic authorization on the Internet, the Permission-Based Sending (PBS)
    NSLP. This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and other forms
    of unauthorized traffic. PBS NSLP is based on the proactive approach of explicitly
    granting permissions and the reactive approach of monitoring and reacting against
    the attacks. Signaling installs and maintains the permission state of routers
    for a data flow. PBS NSLP uses two security mechanisms: message security in an
    end-to-end fashion and channel security in a hop-by-hop fashion. The message security
    is for protecting the integrity of the message on end-to-end traffic and channel
    security is for protecting the integrity and confidentiality between adjacent
    nodes. These security mechanisms enable the secure distribution of shared keys,
    as well as protection of signaling messages. To authenticate data packets, the
    PBS NSLP requests a sender to use an existing security protocol, the IPsec Authentication
    Header (AH). This allows routers to drop bogus packets by using an IP packet filter.
    To avoid a compromised router that drops legitimate packets, the PBS NSLP triggers
    the sender to change the data flow path. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft
