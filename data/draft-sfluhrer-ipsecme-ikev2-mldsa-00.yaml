abstract:
- content: "<p>One IPsec area that would be impacted by Cryptographically Relevant
    Quantum Computer (CRQC) is IKEv2 authentication based on traditional asymmetric
    cryptograph algorithms: e.g RSA, ECDSA; which are widely deployed authentication
    options of IKEv2. NIST has recently standardized ML-DSA, which is a signature
    algorithm believed to be secure against Quantum Computers. This document describes
    how to use ML-DSA with IKEv2 as an auhentication scheme.</p>"
