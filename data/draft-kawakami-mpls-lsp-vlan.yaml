abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to setup a Layer 2 tunnel over networks
    based on Ethernet technology. For this purpose, the ports of an Ethernet switch
    are configured to forward VLAN tag-labeled packets incoming from a certain port
    to another unambiguous port by using VLAN tag information. The Ethernet switches
    themselves are a part of the Label Switching Routers (LSRs), which distribute
    the VLAN tags using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). To enable LDP to fulfil
    this function, an LDP extension is proposed. The introduced method simplifies
    the transport of Ethernet frames over wide area Ethernet networks.</p>"
