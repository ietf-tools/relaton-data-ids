abstract:
- content: "<p>Renewable energy enabled sustainable energy management ensures a high
    degree of reliability in order to fulfill the energy demand of a smart city. In
    such case, renewable energy generation is random over time and also energy consumption
    of smart city users’ is nondeterministic in nature. Therefore, to ensure sustainable
    energy management for smart city, a proactive energy management scheme should
    be integrated into smart city network. In which, edge node should be considered
    as local computational unit for each energy user and microgrid controller should
    be played the role of energy management decision aggregator. As a result, proactive
    energy management scheme not only overcomes the challenges of renewable energy-aware
    demand scheduling but also establishes a strong relationship for both energy generation
    and consumption over time. Therefore, a distributed mechanism is considered, where
    the edge node for executing local agent to determine an individual users’ policy
    with respect to energy consumption and renewable energy generation (users’ own
    sources). On the other hand, microgrid controller determines meta-policy through
    a meta-agent with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since a meta-agent accepts local
    policy as an input with historical observations, which ensures fast and efficient
    execution of proactive energy management for the smart city.</p>"
