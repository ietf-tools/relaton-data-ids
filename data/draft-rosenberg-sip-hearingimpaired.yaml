abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a set of services enabled by the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP), that allow for access to voice services by people who are hearing
    impaired. SIP has gained much attention as a tool for voice communications on
    the Internet. Therefore, considerations for universal access of its services are
    important. This document does not propose any extensions or new capabilities to
    SIP, but rather a set of services enabled by it.</p>"
