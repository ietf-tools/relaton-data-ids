abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism designed
    for incremental deployment. They provide limited protection to DNS servers and
    resolvers against a variety of increasingly common denial-of-service and amplification/forgery
    or cache poisoning attacks by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of
    NAT, NAT- PT, and anycast.</p>"
