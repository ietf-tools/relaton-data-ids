abstract:
- content: "<p>The Designated Forwarder (DF) in Ethernet Virtual Private Networks
    (EVPN) is defined as the PE responsible for sending Broadcast, Unknown unicast
    and Broadcast traffic (BUM) to a multi-homed device/ network in the case of an
    all-active multi-homing Ethernet Segment (ES), or BUM and unicast in the case
    of single-active multi-homing. The Designated Forwarder is selected out of a candidate
    list of PEs that advertise the same Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN
    network, according to the Default Designated Forwarder Election algorithm. While
    the Default Algorithm provides an efficient and automated way of selecting the
    Designated Forwarder across different Ethernet Tags in the Ethernet Segment, there
    are some use cases where a more 'deterministic' and user-controlled method is
    required. At the same time, Service Providers require an easy way to force an
    on- demand Designated Forwarder switchover in order to carry out some maintenance
    tasks on the existing Designated Forwarder or control whether a new active PE
    can preempt the existing Designated Forwarder PE. This document proposes a Designated
    Forwarder Election algorithm that meets the requirements of determinism and operation
    control.</p>"
