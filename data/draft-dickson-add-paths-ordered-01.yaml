abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced format for encoding prefix
    information, to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different paths to be
    announced and withdrawn. Prefix instances using the new format include both unique
    identifiers, and ordinals to control path selection. Withdrawal of prefixes requires
    a slight modification to disambiguate prefix instances.Author's Note This Internet
    Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being placed on
    the Standards Track for idr. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [4].</p>
