abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo integrates the specifications for the lexical elements of
    the MIB module language from section 8 of the ASN.1 specification[4], augmented
    by the ASN.1 macros defined for the MIB module language, and modified by textual
    descriptions in SMIv2(RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2] and 1904[3]); and the standard practices
    found in most of the leading MIB compilers that are accepted by the SNMP community.
    Also include in this memo is a Lex specification for the tokens of the language.
    This memo is a rough first draft as requested by the SNMPv2 WG at the SMI Documentation
    BOF during the June 1996 IETF.</p>"
