abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an additional ip routing technique. A host
    will use a route table to determine how to best transmit a network datagram packet
    to the destination host. The destination address is compared to a locally maintained
    routing table to determine the specific gateway. The best route and/or lowest
    metric is used to determine the gateway to use to reach the destination host.
    A default gateway is used if no matches are found in the routing table.</p>"
