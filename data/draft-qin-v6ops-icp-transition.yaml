abstract:
- content: "<p>The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses is coming, while due to many reasons,
    no significant IPv6 deployment has occured. The transition of users, networks
    and services from IPv4 to IPv6 is not so smoothly and expeditiously as expected.
    The solutions now available are not sufficient for all the scenarios, so the IPv6
    deployment models are revisited, and some new methods used for transition have
    been developed to complement the existing ones. This document discusses the transition
    of services and the use of these new mechanisms from the ISP's point of view to
    provide approaches to the transition for ICPs.</p>"
