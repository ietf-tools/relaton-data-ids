abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, such as Deterministic Networking (DetNet), it
    is required to consider the bounded latency for path selection. This document
    describes the extensions to PCEP to carry bounded latency constraints and distribute
    deterministic paths for end-to-end path computation in DetNet service.</p>"
