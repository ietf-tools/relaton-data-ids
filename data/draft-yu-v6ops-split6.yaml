abstract:
- content: "<p>In the current TCP/IP architecture, the IPv6 address has a dual meaning
    in semantics. It not only represents the topological location of the network node,
    but also the identity of the node, which is usually referred to as the semantic
    overload problem of the IP address. The semantically overloaded IP address represents
    the topological position of the network, and the topological position of the network
    generally does not move, so the device entering the new network environment needs
    to replace the new identity IP to adapt to the change of the topological position.
    The semantic overload of IP addresses is not conducive to supporting mobility
    and user identity authentication, resulting in tight storage space for routing
    equipment, lack of unified communication identification for network equipment,
    and difficulties in network traceability and management. In order to solve the
    problem of IP address semantic overload, this draft focuses on the separation
    technology SPLIT6 (Separation Protocol of Locator and Identifier Towards IPv6)
    of IP address identity and location.</p>"
