abstract:
- content: "<p>The NEMO Basic Support protocol has well-known issues when multiple
    mobile routers are connected to each other in a nested fashion. These issues have
    been already analyzed in the NEMO Working Group. However, solutions are not yet
    considered and discussed in the IETF. MANEMO (MANET for NEMO) is an approach to
    resolve these issues. Although most of issues are relevant to what the MANET working
    group is chartered to deliver, a different approach may be required. This document
    identifies the problems which MANEMO will solve and provides the MANEMO requirements.</p>"
