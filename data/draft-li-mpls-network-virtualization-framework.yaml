abstract:
- content: "<p>As the virtual network operators develop, it is desirable to provide
    better network virtualization solutions to facilitate the service provision. In
    the past years, MPLS plays a key role in the process of implementing network virtualization.
    This document introduces a new framework to implement network virtualization based
    on MPLS global label. It can provide the virtualized network topology, nodes and
    links using MPLS global label which can make up the virtual network.</p>"
