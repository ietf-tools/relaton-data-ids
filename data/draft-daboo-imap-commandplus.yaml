abstract:
- content: "<p>The COMMAND+ extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
    defines a formal syntax for extending [IMAP4] commands. This includes adding requirements
    on future extensions to the [IMAP4] syntax that may add new commands, so that
    any command in an [IMAP4] session, be it part of the base-specification, or a
    current or future extension, can be extended in an arbitrary manner, without conflicts
    in syntax between current or future extensions.</p>"
