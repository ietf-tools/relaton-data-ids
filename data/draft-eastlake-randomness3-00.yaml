abstract:
- content: "<p>Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that
    foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent
    on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar
    values. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can result
    in pseudo- security. For example, the sophisticated attacker of these security
    systems may find it easier to reproduce the environment that produced the secret
    quantities, searching a resulting small set of possibilities, than to locate the
    quantities in the whole of the potential number space. Choosing random quantities
    to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary can be surprisingly difficult. This
    document points out many pitfalls in using poor entropy sources or traditional
    pseudo- random number generation techniques for generating such quantities. It
    recommends the use of multiple sources with a strong mixing function, so that
    no single source need be fully trusted, and provides techniques for extending
    a random seed to a larger quantity of pseudo-random material in a cryptographically
    secure way. And it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for
    some applications. This document obsoletes RFC 4086.</p>"
