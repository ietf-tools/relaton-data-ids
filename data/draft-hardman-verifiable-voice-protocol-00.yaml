abstract:
- content: "<p>Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes organizations
    and individuals making telephone calls. This eliminates trust gaps that scammers
    exploit. Like related technolgies such as SHAKEN, RCD, and BCID, VVP binds cryptographic
    evidence to a SIP INVITE, and verifies this evidence downstream. However, VVP
    builds from different technical and governance assumptions, and uses stronger,
    richer evidence. This allows VVP to cross jurisdictional boundaries easily and
    robustly. It also makes VVP simpler, more decentralized, cheaper to deploy and
    maintain, more private, more scalable, and higher assurance than alternatives.
    Because it is easier to adopt, VVP can plug gaps or build bridges between other
    approaches, functioning as glue in hybrid ecosystems. For example, it may justify
    an A attestation in SHAKEN, or an RCD passport for branded calling, when a call
    originates outside SHAKEN or RCD ecosystems. VVP also works well as a standalone
    mechanism, independent of other solutions. An extra benefit is that VVP enables
    two-way evidence sharing with verifiable text and chat (e.g., RCS and vCon), as
    well as with other industry verticals that need verifiability in non-telco contexts.</p>"
