abstract:
- content: "<p>The L2TP document [1] defines the base protocol which describes the
    method of tunneling PPP [2] data. The L2TP document states that the security mechanism
    used over an IP network is to use the IETF's IPSEC protocols. L2TP was designed
    in such a way as to be able to run over any underlying layer (i.e. Frame Relay,
    ATM, etc.). This document specifies extensions to the L2TP protocol in order to
    provide authentication and integrity of individual packets in a tunneled session
    over a network where IPSEC or another suitable security protocol is not available.</p>"
