abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a lightweight transport protocol-Labelcast,
    especially for long-lived connection video streams. This protocol provides a procedure
    for application programs to send media data to other programs. Like the UDP protocol,
    the Labelcast does not provide delivery and duplicate protection. However, it
    provides efficient support for the monitoring of video transmission quality. And,
    fast forwarding mechanism based on label is also supported by the protocol. Labelcast
    can coexist and integrate with existing mechanisms, such as IP multicast and RTP/RTCP,
    while offering more flexible deployment options and scaling to support a greater
    number of simultaneous multicast groups.</p>"
