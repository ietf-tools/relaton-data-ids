abstract:
- content: "<p>The connection model in MGCP grew from a half-connection model, to,
    more recently, a model that allows a second edgepoint to be specified [3]. In
    this document, we have taken the connection model a step further, making it symmetrical,
    identifying the difference between external connections and an MG- connection,
    allowing signalling related commands to be asso- ciated with either edgepoint,
    or with both edgepoints in an MG. While the half-connection model may work best
    for the simple case of MGs with an external IP connection on one side, the proposed
    more general connec- tion model adapts easily when the MG is for packet to packet
    connec- tions, when the MG is TDM on one side and IP on the other, as well as
    when the external connections are ATM on either side of an MG.</p>"
