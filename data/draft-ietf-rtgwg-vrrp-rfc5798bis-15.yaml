abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
    (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6. It obsoletes RFC 5798 which previously specified VRRP
    (version 3). RFC 5798 obsoleted RFC 3768 which specified VRRP (version 2) for
    IPv4. VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility
    for a Virtual Router to one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN. The VRRP Router controlling
    the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a Virtual Router is called the Active
    Router, and it forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. Active Routers
    are configured with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the
    address family of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the IP protocol
    version. Within a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6
    address families are independent of one another and always treated as separate
    Virtual Router instances. The election process provides dynamic failover in the
    forwarding responsibility should the Active Router become unavailable. For IPv4,
    the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without
    requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every
    end-host. For IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
    switchover to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery mechanisms.</p>"
