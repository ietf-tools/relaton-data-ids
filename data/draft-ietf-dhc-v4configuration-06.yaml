abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are choosing
    to deploy IPv6 only networks without dual-stack functionality for IPv4. However,
    as access to IPv4 based services will continue to be a requirement for the foreseeable
    future, IPv4 over IPv6 mechanisms, such as softwire tunnels are being developed.
    In order to provision end-user's hosts with the IPv4 configuration necessary for
    such mechanisms, a number of different approaches have been proposed. This memo
    discusses each of the proposals, identifies the benefits and drawbacks and recommends
    approaches to be used as the basis for future deployment and development.</p>"
