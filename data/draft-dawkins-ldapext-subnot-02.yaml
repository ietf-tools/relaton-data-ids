abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to
    support subscription and notification mechanism. An LDAP client can subscribe
    to data of interest available from an LDAP server and receive notifications from
    the LDAP server when this data is updated. By this means, an LDAP client can become
    aware of changes to data of interest in a timely manner. Status of this Memo This
