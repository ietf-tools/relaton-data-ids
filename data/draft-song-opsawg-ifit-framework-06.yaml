abstract:
- content: "<p>For efficient network operation, most operators rely on traditional
    Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include proactive
    and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes. As networks increase
    in scale they become more susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration
    errors. With the advent of programmable data-plane emerging on-path OAM techniques,
    such as flow telemetry, provide unprecedented insight and fast notification of
    network issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency, packet loss, significant bit
    error variations, and unequal load- balancing). In-situ Flow Information Telemetry
    (iFIT) provides a method for efficiently applying underlying on-path flow telemetry
    techniques, applicable across various network environments. This document outlines
    an iFIT framework, which enumerates several critical functional components and
    describes how these components are assembled together to achieve a complete and
    closed-loop working solution for on-path flow telemetry.</p>"
