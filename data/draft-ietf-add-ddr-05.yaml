abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR), a mechanism
    for DNS clients to use DNS records to discover a resolver's encrypted DNS configuration.
    This mechanism can be used to move from unencrypted DNS to encrypted DNS when
    only the IP address of a resolver is known. This mechanism is designed to be limited
    to cases where unencrypted resolvers and their designated resolvers are operated
    by the same entity or cooperating entities. It can also be used to discover support
    for encrypted DNS protocols when the name of an encrypted resolver is known.</p>"
