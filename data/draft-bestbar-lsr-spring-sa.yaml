abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) defines a set of topological "segments" within
    an IGP topology to enable steering over a specific SR path. These segments are
    advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF). This document
    describes extensions to the IS-IS that enable advertising Slice Aggregate SR segments
    that share the same IGP computed forwarding path but offer a forwarding treatment
    (e.g. scheduling and drop policy) that is associated with a specific Slice Aggregate.</p>
