abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides guidelines to developers of gateway systems, digital
    asset networks and client applications for the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol
    (SATP). Multiple gateways can represent the same digital asset network following
    the SATP standards, which necessitate basic implementation guidelines as outlined
    in this document. It also serves as an introduction to the SATP processing workflow
    for those new to the SATP standards. (Note. the initial draft (00) is submitted
    for a brief review regarding the document's direction by SATP WG members during
    IETF 12 in Bangkok, Mar 2025)</p>"
