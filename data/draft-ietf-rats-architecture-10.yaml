abstract:
- content: "<p>In network protocol exchanges it is often the case that one entity
    requires believable evidence about the operational state of a remote peer. Such
    evidence is typically conveyed as claims about the peer's software and hardware
    platform, and is subsequently appraised in order to assess the peer's trustworthiness.
    The process of generating and appraising this kind of evidence is known as remote
    attestation. This document describes an architecture for remote attestation procedures
    that generate, convey, and appraise evidence about a peer's operational state.</p>"
