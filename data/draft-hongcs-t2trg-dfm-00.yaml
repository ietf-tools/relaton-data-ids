abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have increased the use
    of sensing technologies for IoT applications. However, monitoring sensor nodes
    is still a challenging issue in distributed remote environments, especially wireless
    environments. Different from conventional centralized mechanism, Fog Computing
    becomes an essential role in a scalable IoT system. Fog Node can control and monitor
    its subdomain's devices and perform aggregation tasks to support the central server
    at the cloud. Since node fault detection can strongly affect the performance and
    accuracy in most IoT analysis applications, fault detection mechanism should be
    integrated into IoT Networks. Accordingly, these fault nodes could be detected
    and replaced by others available nodes in the same domain for the analysis by
    a distributed fault detection and node replacement mechanism based on their sensory
    values in a considered domain.</p>"
