abstract:
- content: <p>IGP Flexible Algorithm allows IGPs to compute constraint-based paths
    over the network using different types of metrics or constraints. This document
    defines a new type of constraint called "Time Constraint", which can be used to
    control the time period during which a Flex-Algorithm takes effect for constraint-based
    path calculation. Such mechanism may be useful in network scenarios where either
    the traffic demand or the characteristics of the network varies as a function
    of time. The procedures of using Time Constraint in Flexible Algorithm is also
    described.</p>
