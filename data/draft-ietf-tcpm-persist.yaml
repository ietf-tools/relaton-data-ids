abstract:
- content: <p>This document clarifies the Zero Window Probes (ZWPs) described in RFC
    1122 ("Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers"). In particular,
    it clarifies the actions that can be taken on connections that are experiencing
    the ZWP condition. Rather than making a change to the standard, this document
    clarifies what has been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as specified
    in RFC 1122. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>
