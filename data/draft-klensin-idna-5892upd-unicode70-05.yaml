abstract:
- content: "<p>The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated that each
    new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes had been introduced
    that required adjustments to the set of rules and, in particular, whether new
    exceptions or backward compatibility adjustments were needed. The review for Unicode
    7.0.0 first identified a potentially problematic new code point and then a much
    more general and difficult issue with Unicode normalization. This specification
    discusses those issues and proposes updates to IDNA and, potentially, the way
    the IETF handles comparison of identifiers more generally, especially when there
    is no associated language or language identification. It also applies an editorial
    clarification to RFC 5892 that was the subject of an earlier erratum and updates
    RFC 5894 to point to the issues involved.</p>"
