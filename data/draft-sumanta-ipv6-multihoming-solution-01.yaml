abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Multihoming design help host(s) in a site to switch dynamically
    between multiple attached global internet without impacting transport and application
    layer protocol whenever failure occur. Basic issue on this design when ipv-to-ipv6
    Network prefix translations not being used are:- 1. Source addresses selection,
    2. Next hop selection and 3. DNS resolution. Even though Ipv6-to-Ipv6 Network
    prefix translation (NPTv6) solve above mention problems, NPTv6 not ideal as it's
    not achieve End-to-End transparency of connectivity .Alternatively by using policy
    at End host to select source address and next hop also solve above mention issues.
    This document proposes solution which defines how automatically a policy can be
    enforced on host by first hop router using router advertisement. That's reduced
    administrative effort of updating policy on all hosts in site. This document not
    obsolete any of the previous work, only propose how policy on End-host can be
    enforce from router by mapping destination prefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.</p>"
