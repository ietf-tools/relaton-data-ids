abstract:
- content: "<p>While DNS-SD over mDNS significantly improves the convenience of network
    configuration, parts of the published information may seriously breach the users'
    privacy. Currently discussed privacy extensions either are not efficient in terms
    of multicast messages sent, reduce privacy and complicate key revocation by introducing
    an 1:m pairing system, or use trial encryptions which are inefficient in terms
    of necessary computational power. The method proposed in this document leverages
    Bloomfilters to significantly reduce the number of multicast (public) messages
    for a DNS-SD privacy extension based on an 1:1 pairing mechanism. This allows
    keeping the advantages of both an 1:1 pairing system and a hinting system that
    does not require trial encryptions, while mitigating the main disadvantage: multicast
    messages sent.</p>"
