abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework. The profile uses Group Object Security
    for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) to provide communication security
    between a Client and one or multiple Resource Servers that are members of an OSCORE
    group. The profile securely binds an OAuth 2.0 Access Token to the public key
    of the Client associated with the private key used by that Client in the OSCORE
    group. The profile uses Group OSCORE to achieve server authentication, as well
    as proof-of-possession for the Client's public key. Also, it provides proof of
    the Client's membership to the OSCORE group by binding the Access Token to information
    from the Group OSCORE Security Context, thus allowing the Resource Server(s) to
    verify the Client's membership upon receiving a message protected with Group OSCORE
    from the Client. Effectively, the profile enables fine-grained access control
    paired with secure group communication, in accordance with the Zero Trust principles.</p>"
