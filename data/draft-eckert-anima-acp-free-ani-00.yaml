abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to to build the software infrastructure
    for distributed automation agents using a lightweight variation of the "Autonomic
    Networking Infrastructure" (ANI), by using the existing ANI domain keying material
    (certificates and trust anchors) as well as the protocols GRASP and BRSKI protocols,
    but eliminating the expensive to implement "Autonomic Control Plane" (ACP) and
    adding proxying "Autonomic Software Agents" (ASA) instead. The resulting infrastructure
    is called "automation Network Infrastructure" and can be implemented solely as
    application level software components on routers, switches or co-located managemenet
    devices, avoiding the need to change any router or switches forwarding or control-plane
    protocols. The aNI achieves mosts of the benefits of the ANI but foregoes the
    ability to easily make pre-existing, insecure control-plane protocols secure or
    provide all the same protection against operator or SDN controller misconfigurations
    that the ACP provides.</p>
