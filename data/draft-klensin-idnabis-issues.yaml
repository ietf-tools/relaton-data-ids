abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent IAB report identified issues that have been raised with Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs). Some of these issues require tuning of the existing protocols
    and the tables on which they depend. Based on intensive discussion by an informal
    design team, this document provides an overview some of the proposals that are
    being made, provides explanatory material for them and then further explains some
    of the issues that have been encountered.</p>"
