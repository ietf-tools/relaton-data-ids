abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a light-weight data driven approach for multiplexing
    low bit rate RTP streams at the edge router of the Internet in order to reduce
    the RTP/UDP/IP header overhead associated with each RTP stream. Audio packets
    from different sources in a local access network destined to different users in
    the same remote access network are multiplexed into one packet, with the original
    RTP/UDP/IP header of each packet replaced with a mini-header (2 bytes), resulting
    in a reduction of the overhead. Access routers can use the IP telephony Border
    Gateway Protocol (TBGP) to exchange the reachability of IP destinations in their
    domains.</p>"
