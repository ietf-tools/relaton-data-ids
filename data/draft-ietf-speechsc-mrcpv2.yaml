abstract:
- content: <p>The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
    hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers,
    verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the network. MRCPv2 is not a
    "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between
    them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange
    capabilities. It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and
    associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server. Once
    this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established
    above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech
    resource server. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
