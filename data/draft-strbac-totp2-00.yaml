abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a second-factor authentication scheme that extends the Time-Based
    One-Time Password (TOTP) method to provide superior protection against phishing
    attacks. Unlike traditional one-time password flows that solely authenticate the
    user with the service, our approach introduces an extended flow that seamlessly
    authenticates both the user and the service to each other. This enhanced process
    ensures a secure submission of the user's second-factor authentication via a secondary
    and secure communication channel. By verifying the service's authenticity to the
    user, our scheme establishes a robust defence against potential phishing attempts,
    enhancing the overall security of the authentication process.</p>"
