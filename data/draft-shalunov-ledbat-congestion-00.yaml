abstract:
- content: "<p>LEDBAT is an alternative experimental congestion control algorithm.
    LEDBAT enables an advanced networking application to minimize the extra delay
    it induces in the bottleneck while saturating the bottleneck. It thus implements
    an end-to-end version of scavenger service. LEDBAT has been been implemented in
    BitTorrent DNA, as the exclusive congestion control mechanism, and in uTorrent,
    as an experimental mechanism, and deployed in the wild with favorable results.</p>"
