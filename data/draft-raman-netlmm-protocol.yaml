abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a local mobility solution controlled by the
    network within a local mobility domain. The proposed solution employs a Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 client that generates a Proxy Binding Update message. Two variants
    of the solution are suggested depending on the realization of the Proxy Mobile
    IP client function. The security association between the network elements for
    executing the local mobility is also discussed.</p>"
