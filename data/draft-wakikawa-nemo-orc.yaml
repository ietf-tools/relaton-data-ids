- content: "<p>This draft proposes Optimized Route Cache Protocol (ORC) to provide
    route optimization for the NEMO Basic Support protocol. ORC provides a dynamic
    route optimization mechanism, similar to route optimization in Mobile IPv6. The
    ORC aims to manage binding information as if routing information of each mobile
