abstract:
- content: "<p>In Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), Bundle Agents form an
    overlay network that forwards DTN bundles between their source and destination
    applications. This document describes a mechanism that Bundle Agents can use to
    discover when they are in contact with one another and optionally provide information
    on the additional properties of current or future contacts, such as duration and
    capabilities. This information can be used to trigger bundle forwarding or make
    future bundle scheduling decisions.</p>"
