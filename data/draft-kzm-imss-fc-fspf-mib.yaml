- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects for information related to the Fibre Channel network's
    Fabric Shortest Path First (FSPF) routing protocol. At present, this memo is in
    development as part of the SM-FSM project of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan
    is that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.</p>"
