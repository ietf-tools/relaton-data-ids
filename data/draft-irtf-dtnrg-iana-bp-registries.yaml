abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Research Group research group has
    defined many protocols such as the Bundle Protocol and Licklider Transmission
    Protocol. The specifications of these protocols contain fields that are subject
    to a registry. For the purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc
    registries. As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations,
    the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody.
    This document describes the actions executed by IANA. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
