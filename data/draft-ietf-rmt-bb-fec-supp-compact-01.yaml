abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces some Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes
    that supplement the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452. The primary benefits of
    these additional FEC schemes are that they are designed for reliable bulk delivery
    of large objects using a more compact FEC Payload ID, and they can be used to
    sequentially deliver blocks of an object of indeterminate length. Thus, they more
    flexibly support different delivery models with less packet header overhead. This
    document also describes the Fully-Specified FEC scheme corresponding to FEC Encoding
    ID 0. This Fully-Specified FEC scheme requires no FEC coding and is introduced
    primarily to allow simple interoperability testing between different implementations
    of protocol instantiations that use the FEC building block. This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
