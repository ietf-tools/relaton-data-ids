abstract:
- content: <p>Current mobility solutions generally introduce an anchor point in the
    network, e.g., HA in MIPv6, LMA in PMIPv6, GGSN in 3GPP. The anchor point is used
    to maintain the mapping between the stable IP address (e.g., Home address in MIPv6)
    and the current routable IP address (e.g., CoA in MIPv6). However, one of the
    trend in mobile network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture by confining
    mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the access routers level, keeping
    the rest of the network unaware of the mobility events and their support. This
    document discusses the deployment of current IP mobility mechanisms in such a
    flat architecture.</p>
