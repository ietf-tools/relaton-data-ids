abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to Simple Two-Way Active Measurement
    Protocol (STAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of
    a Link Aggregation Group (LAG). Knowing the measured metrics of each member link
    of a LAG enables operators to enforce a performance metric-based traffic steering
    policy across the member links.</p>"
