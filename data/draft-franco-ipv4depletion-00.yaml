abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the problem of IP v4 address space depletion.
    This document proposes an easy, technical solution based on the use of two options
    in the IP packet. The IP Version is used to extend the current IP v4 address universe
    to 25 to 30 billion IP addresses. A modified IP packet header Option 3, the Loose
    Source and Record Router (LSRR), is used to carry source ip version, source ip
    prefix, destination ip version, and destination ip prefix in the IP network packet.
    This document introduces the concepts of RIR nebulae (or IP address nebula) and
    mirror prefixes (or pseudo prefixes). RIR nebulae are concurrent IP v4 address
    spaces which are differentiated from one another by the IP Version in the IP network
    packet header. The mirror prefixes (/33 to /255) emulate or mirror standard prefixes
    (/0 to /31). The single host route (/32 or 255.255.255.255) is supported in all
    RIR nebulae. The new extended IP v4 universe (a new, hypothetical Internet) is
    comprised of multiple IP v4 address spaces and DNS domains of 4.2 billion addresses.</p>"
