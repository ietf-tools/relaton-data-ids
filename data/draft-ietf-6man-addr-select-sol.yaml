- content: "<p>In response to address selection problem statement and requirement
    documents, this document describes solution approaches and evaluates proposed
    solution mechanisms in line with requirements. It also examines the applicability
    for each solution mechanism, and concludes that no single solution solves the
    problems and the combination of the solutions should be the way forward.</p>"
