abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their users
    will frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes. Users will similarly
    frequently change their client software and the way they use the network. In order
    to allow troubleshooting and regression testing, it is useful to provide debugging
    as part of the network fabric. This draft describes an event package that provides
    debugging configuration to SIP entities and a SIP private header that triggers
    logging of SIP signalling and identifies logs at mulitiple SIP entities as belonging
    to a single end-to-end session. A list of related IETF drafts and non-IETF specifications
    is included to help develop this topic.</p>"
