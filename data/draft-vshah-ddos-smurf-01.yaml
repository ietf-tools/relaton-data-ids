abstract:
- content: "<p>Host Requirements RFC1122 states that an ICMP Echo Request destined
    to an IP broadcast or IP multicast address MAY be silently discarded. By discarding
    all broadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the end user may lose valuable diagnostic capability.
    By forwarding some broadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the host may be used as launching
    platform for Smurf Attacks[1]. This draft describes a solution for selectively
    dropping broadcast ICMP Echo Requests based on whether the source address is within
    the network or from outside the network. Any host implementing this solution ensures
    that it does not participate in a Smurf attack irrespective of whether responding
    to broadcast ICMP Echo Requests is enabled or disabled on it.</p>"
