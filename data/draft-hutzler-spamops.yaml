abstract:
- content: "<p>Email has become a popular distribution service for a variety of socially
    unacceptable, mass-effect purposes. The most obvious ones include spam and worms.
    This note recommends conventions for the operation of email submission and transport
    services between independent operators, such as enterprises and Internet Service
    Providers. Its goal is to improve lines of accountability for controlling abusive
    uses of the Internet mail service. To this end, this document offers recommendations
    for constructive operational policies between independent operators of email submission
    and transmission services. Email authentication technologies are aimed at providing
    assurances and traceability between internetworked networks. In many email services,
    the weakest link in the chain of assurances is initial submission of a message.
    This document offers recommendations for constructive operational policies for
    this first step of email sending, the submission (or posting) of email into the
    transmission network. Relaying and delivery entail policies that occur subsequent
    to submission and are outside the scope of this document. This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
