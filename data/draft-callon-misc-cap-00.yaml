abstract:
- content: "<p>The Framework for Operational Security Capabilities [11] outlines the
    proposed effort of the IETF OPSEC working group. This includes producing a series
    of drafts to codify knowledge gained through operational experience about feature
    sets that are needed to securely deploy and operate managed network elements providing
    transit services at the data link and IP layers. Current plans include separate
    capabilities documents for Packet Filtering; Event Logging; In-Band and Out-of-Band
    Management; Configuration and Management Interfaces; AAA; and Documentation and
    Assurance. This document describes some additional miscellaneous capabilities
    which do not fit into any of these specific catagories, and whose descriptions
    are brief enough that it does not seem appropriate to create a separate document
    for each. Operational Security Current Practices [12] lists current operator practices
    related to securing networks. This document lists miscellaneous capabilities needed
    to support those practices. Capabilities are defined without reference to specific
    technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that
    implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports. Current
    implementations that support the capability may be cited. Special considerations
    are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations
    of current implementations, tradeoffs, etc.</p>"
