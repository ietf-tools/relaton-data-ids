abstract:
- content: "<p>Reputation services offer quality assessments about likely future behavior,
    based on past behaviors. The use of these services has become a common tool in
    many applications that seek to apply collected intelligence about traffic sources.
    Often this is done because it is common or even expected operator practice. It
    is therefore important to be aware of a number of considerations for both operators
    and consumers of the data. This document includes a collection of the best advice
    available regarding providers and consumers of reputation data, based on experience
    to date. Much of this is based on experience with email reputation systems, but
    the concepts are generally applicable.</p>"
