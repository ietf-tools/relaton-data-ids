abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides a convenient interface for
    obtaining route views by monitoring BGP sessions. BMP operates over TCP and is
    unidirectional (from client to server). QUIC provides multiple simultaneous streams
    to carry data in one direction, enabling much better efficiency and performance
    for both peers, in particular unidirectional streams can provide reverse data
    protection for the sender. QUIC also provides shorter handshake and includes TLS.
    This document describes how to use BMP over the QUIC transport protocol, named
    BMPoQUIC.</p>"
