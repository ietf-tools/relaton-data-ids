    (IDWG) is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information
    of interest to intrusion detection and response systems and to the management
    systems that may need to interact with them. This document describes the high-level
    requirements for such a communication mechanism, including the rationale for those
    requirements where clarification is needed. Scenarios are used to illustrate some
    requirements. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
