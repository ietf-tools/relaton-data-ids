abstract:
- content: <p>In this draft, we discuss problems related to multi-session and multi-source
    transmission using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). Most of the input to
    this draft is taken from email discussion. Multi-session and multi-source transmission
    is motivated by media data which allows for different transport layer treatment
    of parts of the media. This is typically the case for layered media. Multi-session
    transmission is when media data from a single media source is split over multiple
    RTP sessions. Single-session multi- source transmission (from now on just called
    "multi-source transmission") is when data from a single media source is sent as
    several RTP streams in the same RTP session. The main problems discussed are the
    mechanisms used for data alignment and source correlation. This draft gives further
    an overview of payload formats using multi-sessions/multi-source transmission
    and highlights other transport related issues. The draft concludes with recommendations
    for the discussed problems.</p>
