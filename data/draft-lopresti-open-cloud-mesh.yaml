abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Cloud Mesh (OCM) is a server federation protocol that is used
    to notify a Receiving Party that they have been granted access to some Resource.
    It has similarities with authorization flows such as OAuth, as well as with social
    internet protocols such as ActivityPub and email. A core use case of OCM is when
    a user (e.g., Alice on System A) wishes to share a resource (e.g., a file) with
    another user (e.g., Bob on System B) without transferring the resource itself
    or requiring Bob to log in to System A. While this scenario is illustrative, OCM
    is designed to support a broader range of interactions, including but not limited
    to file transfers. Open Cloud Mesh handles interactions only up to the point where
    the Receiving Party is informed of their access to the Resource. Actual Resource
    access is subsequently managed by other protocols, such as WebDAV.</p>"
