abstract:
- content: "<p>Recovering from failure of IPsec gateways maintaining large numbers
    of SAs may take several minutes, if they need to re-establish the IPsec SAs by
    re-running the key management protocol, IKEv2. A similar problem arises in the
    event of a network outage resulting in the failure of several gateways and servers.
    The latency involved in this approach is significant, leading to a need for a
    faster and yet secure failover solution. This document describes the problem statement
    and the goals for an IPsec/IKEv2 gateway failover/ redundancy solution.</p>"
