abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet through a controlled
    set of instructions, called segments, by prepending a SR header to the packet.
    A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. SR allows
    to enforce a flow through any path (topological, or application/service based)
    while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR domain. Segment
    Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the addition of a new type
    of Routing Extension Header. This document analyzes the security aspects of the
    Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH) and how it is used by SR capable nodes
    to deliver a secure service.</p>"
