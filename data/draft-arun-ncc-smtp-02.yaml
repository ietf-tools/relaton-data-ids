abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a mechanism to simplify one of the cumbersome aspects
    of mailing, when one needs to send mails only to a subset of mail-ids from an
    alias [ALIAS] . The basic intention is only to minimize the complication and difficulty
    of a mail user when a mail needs to be sent to n - m mail IDs i.e. send it to
    a group Id of n and exclude m from the alias [ALIAS] list.</p>"
