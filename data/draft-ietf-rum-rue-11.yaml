abstract:
- content: <p>Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which
    a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired
    user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via a videophone
    to the deaf/hard of hearing/ hearing impaired user and an audio telephone call
    to the hearing user. The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link
    and voice on the telephone link. Often the interpreters may be employed by a company
    or agency termed a "provider" in this document. The provider also provides a video
    service that allows users to connect video devices to their service, and subsequently
    to CAs and other deaf/hard of hearing/hearing impaired users. It is desirable
    that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired user
    conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that
    direct video calls between deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired users work.
    This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.</p>
