abstract:
- content: "<p>Integrating RoHC with IPsec (RoHCoIPsec) offers the combined benefits
    of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization. Before this can be
    realized, however, several extensions to the Security Policy Database (SPD), the
    Security Association Database (SAD), and the IPsec process are required. This
    document describes the IPsec extensions required to support RoHCoIPsec.</p>"
