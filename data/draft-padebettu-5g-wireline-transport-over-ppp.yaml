abstract:
- content: "<p>To support connecting 5G residential gateways(5G-RG) to 5G Core (5GC)
    over wireline access, the control packets and data packets of the 5G- RG should
    be transported over the wireline access network (W-AN) to Access Gateway Function(W-AGF).
    The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP defines an extensible
    Link Control Protocol, and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols for
    establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols. This document
    defines the 5G Wireline Control Protocol(5WCP) for establishing and configuring
    the 5G Wireline Data protocol(5W Data) over PPP for Wireline Access for 5G Networks.
    The method inherits multiplexing of traffic for multiple 5G-RGs per VLAN from
    PPPoE [RFC2516] and defines multiplexing multiple PDU Sessions per 5G-RG.</p>"
