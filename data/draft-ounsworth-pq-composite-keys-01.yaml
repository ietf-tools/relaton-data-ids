abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
    the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic
    algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is
    at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in
    such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite keys,
    for use with composite signature and encryption data. This document defines the
    structures CompositePublicKey, CompositePrivateKey, which are sequences of the
    respective structure for each component algorithm. This document makes no assumptions
    about what the component algorithms are, provided that they have defined algorithm
    identifiers. The only requirement imposed by this document is that all algorithms
    be of the same key usage; i.e. all signature or all encryption. This document
    is intended to be coupled with corresponding documents that define the structure
    and semantics of composite signatures and encryption.</p>"
