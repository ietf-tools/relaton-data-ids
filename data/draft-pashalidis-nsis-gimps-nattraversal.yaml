abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a number of mechanisms for the implementation
    of the General Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol [1] on different
    types of Network Address Translator (NAT). The focus of these mechanisms is the
    interaction of GIST with the address translation function of the NAT, and their
    purpose is to enable GIST hosts that are located on either side of the NAT to
    correctly interpret signalling messages with respect to the data traffic they
    refer to. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to people that implement
    GIST and NSLPs on both NAT and non-NAT nodes.</p>"
