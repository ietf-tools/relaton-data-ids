abstract:
- content: "<p>IS-IS currently defines two different kinds of authentication schemes:
    Clear Text password and HMAC-MD5. There has been recently a new draft submitted
    that adds support for a generic cryptographic authentication scheme, which can
    make use of different cryptographic algorithms in order to authenticate the IS-IS
    PDUs. To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is imperative
    that we specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there
    is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document
    defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to be used for the
    cryptographic authentication for IS-IS as well as specifying the algorithms that
    should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future
    time.</p>"
