abstract:
  content: "\t <t>IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the fragmentation
    and reassembly mechanisms. The Fragment Header contains an \"Identification\"
    field that, together with the IPv6 Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address
    of a packet, identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram,
    such that they can be reassembled together by the receiving host. The only requirement
    for setting the Identification field is that the corresponding value must be different
    than that employed for any other fragmented datagram sent recently with the same
    Source Address and Destination Address. Some implementations use a simple global
    counter for setting the Identification field, thus leading to predictable Identification
    values. This document analyzes the security implications of predictable Identification
    values, and provides implementation guidance for setting the Identification field
    of the Fragment Header, such that the aforementioned security implications are
    mitigated.</p>"
