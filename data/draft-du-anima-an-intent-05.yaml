abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of autonomic networking is to simplify the management
    of networks by human operators. Intent Based Networking (IBN) is a possible approach
    to realize this goal. With IBN, the operator indicates to the network what to
    do (i.e. her intent) and not how to do it. In the field of Policy Based Management
    (PBM), the concept of intent is called a declarative policy. This document proposes
    a refinement of the intent concept initially defined in [RFC7575] for autonomic
    networks by providing a more complete definition, a life-cycle, some use cases
    and a tentative format of the ANIMA Intent Policy.</p>"
