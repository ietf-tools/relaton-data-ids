abstract:
- content: <p>Congestion control has been extensively studied for many years. Today,
    the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used in a wide range of networks (LAN,
    WAN, data center, campus network, enterprise network, etc.) as the de facto congestion
    control mechanism. Despite its common usage, TCP operates in these networks with
    little knowledge of the underlying network or traffic characteristics. As a result,
    it is deemed to continuously increase or decrease its congestion window size in
    order to handle changes in the network or traffic conditions. Thus, TCP frequently
    overshoots or undershoots the ideal rate making it a "Jack of all trades, master
    of none" congestion control protocol. In light of the emerging popularity of centrally
    controlled networks such as Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), we propose a framework
    that takes advantage of the information available at the central controller to
    improve TCP. Specifically, in this document, we propose OpenTCP as a dynamic and
    programmable TCP adaptation framework for centrally controlled networks. OpenTCP
    gathers global information about the status of the network and traffic conditions
    through the centralized controller, and uses this information to adapt TCP. OpenTCP
    periodically sends updates to end-hosts which, in turn, update their behaviour
    using a simple kernel module. This document describes a framework and message
    flows for centralized congestion control parameter adaptation based on congestion
    control policies and network status measurements, so that each end host in a network
    can make better use of the network resource according to the available resources.
    In the rest of this document we use TCP as a standard congestion control mechanism,
    but the same idea can be applied to other congestion control protocols as well.
    A TCP Optimization Element and a TCP Optimization Agent are introduced. The message
    patterns include request response and subscription/notification. This mechanism
    can be used in network service providers' networks, as well as in data center
    networks.</p>
