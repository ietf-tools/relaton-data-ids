abstract:
- content: "<p>The Limited Use of Remote Keys (LURK) BOF has been scheduled with the
    objective of discussing approaches to mitigating security risks to TLS private
    keys. In particular in situations where a Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used
    to deliver content and thus the party that is being authenticated is not the party
    that the user is attempting to authenticate. Three classes of solution are considered,
    short term credentials, a remote service offering to perform private key operations
    and a remote service that is further constrained through the use of some form
    of threshold approach. A JSON/HTTP protocol implementing the second and third
    protocol is demonstrated and documented.</p>"
