abstract:
- content: "<p>The JMAP base protocol (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly
    and scalable protocol that can be used for data of any type. This makes it a good
    fit for migrations or data portability use cases. However, due to its large set
    of features, it is also quite complex, which makes it difficult to explore new
    application domains in practice. The goal of this document is to provide a simplified
    version of JMAP for more rapid development.</p>"
