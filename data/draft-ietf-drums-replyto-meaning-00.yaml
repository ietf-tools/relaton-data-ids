abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a candidate proposal for one way which the problems with the
    reply-to header in email could be resolved. Under no circumstances should this
    be implemented as it is only a candidate for a solution and no decision has yet
    been made. This proposal distinguishes the different incompatible uses of the
    Reply-To header with a new Reply-To-Meaning header. This has the advantage of
    being relatively simple, not invalidating most current practices and allowing
    mail user agents to present more predictable user interfaces.</p>"
