abstract:
- content: <p>This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER) protocol.
    DABBER aims to provide a name-based routing solution to support the operation
    of Information-centric Networking frameworks in opportunistic wireless networks.
    By "opportunistic wireless networks" it is meant multi-hop wireless networks where
    finding an end-to-end path between any pair of nodes at any moment in time may
    be a challenge. The goal is to assist in better defining opportunities for the
    transmission of Interest packets in a store- carry-and-forward manner, based on
    a proactive approach. The document describes how to integrate DABBER in a networking
    node that implements some ICN approach, such as Named-Data Networking (NDN) or
    Content Centric Networking (CCN), along with the specification of the proactive
    approach based on the dissemination of name-prefix information.</p>
