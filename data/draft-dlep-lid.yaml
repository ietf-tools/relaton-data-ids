abstract:
- content: "<p>There exists a class of modems that wish to support the Dynamic Link
    Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] but do not present a single Layer 2 network
    domain as required by DLEP. Such devices may be: o Modems that maintain a varying
    link to some upstream backbone network infrastructure, where the ability to announce
    link state and DLEP metrics is desired, but the concept of a DLEP destination
    router for the backbone does not apply. Examples of such devices can include LTE
    modems, IEEE 802.11 stations not in ad-hoc mode, and some satellite terminals.
    o Modems that provide Layer 3 wide area network connectivity between devices,
    where individual DLEP destinations do exist, but are not directly reachable by
    MAC address. This document introduces an optional extension to the core DLEP specification,
    allowing DLEP to be used between routers and modems that operate in this way.
    Note: o This document is intended as an extension to the core DLEP specification,
    and readers are expected to be fully conversant with the operation of core DLEP.</p>"
