abstract:
- content: <p>This draft specifies a TLS extension that adds downgrade protection
    for another TLS extension, [dnssec-chain-extension]. Without the downgrade protection
    specified in this TLS extension, the only effect of deploying [dnssec-chain-extension]
    is to reduce TLS security from the standard "WebPKI security" to "WebPKI or DANE,
    whichever is weaker". This draft dictates that [dnssec-chain-extension] MUST only
    be used in combination with this TLS extension, whose only content is a two octet
    SupportLifetime value. A value of 0 prohibits the TLS client from unilaterally
    requiring ongoing use of both TLS extensions based on prior observation of their
    use (pinning). A non-zero value is the value in hours for which this TLS extension
    as well as [dnssec-chain-extension] MUST appear in subsequent TLS handshakes to
    the same TLS hostname and port. If this TLS extention or [dnssec-chain-extension]
    is missing from the TLS handshake within this observed pinning time, the TLS client
    MUST assume it is under attack and abort the TLS connection.</p>
