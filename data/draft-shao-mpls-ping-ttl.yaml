abstract:
- content: "<p>Packets with IP TTL 1 might be filtered by TTL-filtering access control
    lists deployed to mitigate TTL expiry attacks [CISCO]. Thus MPLS ping and traceroute
    will be inoperable in these networks if IP TTL is set to 1 according to RFC 4379
    [RFC4379] chapter 4.3. This document discuss and updates IP TTL setting in MPLS
    Ping and traceroute.</p>"
