abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach for network
    programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage
    network behavior dynamically via open interfaces as opposed to relying on closed-box
    solutions and their associated proprietary interfaces. SDN emphasizes the role
    of software in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for
    the data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane.
    This separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has
    already shown. However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is,
    what is the layer structure in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface
    with each other. This document, a product of the IRTF Software- Defined Networking
    Research Group (SDNRG), addresses these questions and provides a concise reference
    for the SDN research community based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the
    RFC series, and relevant documents by other standards organizations.</p>"
