abstract:
- content: "<p>The Admission Control enabled On-demand Routing (ACOR) protocol is
    intended for use by MANETs. It is a reactive routing protocol designed to support
    quality of service (QoS) on the end to end route. ACOR is based on simple local
    cost functions at each node, and global cost function to represent the end-to-end
    cost of a route, in addition to a simple admission control mechanism for implicit
    resource reservation adapted to frequent changing of network topology.</p>"
