abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the operating principles of Network Address
    Translator (NAT) devices and the behavioral properties required to make NAT more
    predictable and compatible with diverse application protocols. First, this document
    presents an architectural model for NAT devices and defines important terms used
    in conjunction with NAT operation. The architectural model sets the stage for
    a set of concrete recommendations for NAT implementers. The recommendations made
    by this document are independent of transport protocol. A set of companion documents
    provide behavioral recommendations specific to particular transport protocols.</p>"
