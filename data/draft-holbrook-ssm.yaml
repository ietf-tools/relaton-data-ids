abstract:
- content: "<p>IP addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255) range are
    designated as source-specific multicast (SSM) destination addresses and are reserved
    for use by source-specific applications and protocols [IANA-ALLOCATION]. This
    document defines the semantics of source- specific multicast addresses and specifies
    the policies governing their use. It defines an extension to the Internet network
    service that applies to datagrams sent to SSM addresses and defines the host extensions
    to support this service. Appendix I of this document describes changes to the
    Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) [IGMPv3] to support source-
    specific multicast.</p>"
