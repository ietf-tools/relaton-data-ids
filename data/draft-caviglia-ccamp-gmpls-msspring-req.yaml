abstract:
- content: "<p>GMPLS [1] provides ideally a robust and flexible control plane protocols
    set designed for application over generalized transport network. A typical application
    of GMPLS is, among others, the control of transport networks based on SDH/SONET
    [2] technology. In this scenario, the introduction of GMPLS based control plane
    should ensure support of and/or compatibility with the most important and widely
    exploited SDH/SONET features, making possible a seamless interworking with inherent
    data plane requirements. In this document we focus on one of the most attractive
    SDH/SONET protection mechanism, implemented through MS-SPRing (G.841 [3]), a widely
    deployed ITU standard for ring-shared protection.</p>"
