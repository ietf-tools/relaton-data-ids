abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes many features of the proposals for the successor
    to IKEv1. The purpose of the document is to help the IPsec Working Group decide
    which features they want for the next protocol. The document focuses on how those
    features are instantiated in two proposals, IKEv2 and JFK, but other ideas for
    features and options are also included. Most of the material in this document
    comes from many of the authors of the JFK and IKEv2 proposals. This document is
    meant to help the Working Group choose which features it finds important for the
    successor to IKE. It should be short-lived and is not expected to become an RFC.
