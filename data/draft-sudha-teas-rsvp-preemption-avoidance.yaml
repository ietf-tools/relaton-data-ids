abstract:
- content: "<p>When a high priority LSP is being setup, if there is reservation contention
    on a link along the path to the destination, any low priority LSP taking the link
    could get preempted and eventually rerouted. Low priority LSPs could suffer preemption
    repeatedly when they are placed in succession on heavily used links that have
    very less remaining bandwidth. This document describes a solution to avoid repeated
    preemption of low priority LSPs in the network.</p>"
