abstract:
- content: "<p>The LWAPP protocol defines interactions between wireless termination
    points and wireless access controllers. Communications between these components
    must be secured, and the current specification provides for transport security
    using proprietary mechanisms which are embedded in the protocol. This document
    describes an alternative approach which eliminates the embedded security, and
    instead uses DTLS as a secure, tightly-integrated wrapper.</p>"
