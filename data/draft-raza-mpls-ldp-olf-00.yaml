abstract:
- content: <p>The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) allows one Label Switching Router
    (LSR) to advertise to another a set of "bindings" between MPLS labels and "Forwarding
    Equivalence Classes" (FECs). Suppose LSR2 is advertising a set of label bindings
    to LSR1. Frequently, LSR1 does not need to know all of LSR2's label bindings,
    and LSR1 may be configured to disregard bindings in which it has no interest.
    This document defines an "Outbound Label Filtering" (OLF) mechanism that allows
    LSR1 to inform LSR2 dynamically of the set of FECs for which it needs to receive
    label bindings. LSR2 then applies this filter before sending its label bindings
    to LSR1. In addition to the generic aspects of this mechanism, this document also
    specifies outbound label filter for the "Address Prefix FEC" type.</p>
