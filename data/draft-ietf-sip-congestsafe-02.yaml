abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol allows the use of UDP for transport
    of SIP messages. The use of UDP inherently risks network congestion problems,
    as UDP itself does not define congestion prevention, avoidance, detection, or
    correction mechanisms. This problem is aggravated by large SIP messages which
    fragment at the UDP level. Transport protocols in SIP are also negotiated on a
    per-hop basis, at the SIP level, so SIP proxies may convert from TCP to UDP and
    so forth. This document defines by which a SIP User Agent may require that its
    requests are not sent over UDP or other transports having congestion-related characteristics
    similar to those of UDP.</p>"
