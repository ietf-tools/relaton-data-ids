abstract:
- content: "<p>The integration of multilayer switching capabilities within one box,
    such as the packet-switch capability (PSC) and the lambda- switch capability (LSC)
    under the MPLS/Generalized-MPLS control mechanism, paves the way for achieving
    network resource optimization considering multilayer routing. This document clarifies
    the model of the GMPLS-controlled integrated PSC/LSC label switch router (LSR)
    and discusses the requirements of the routing extensions needed to achieve optimized
    multilayer traffic engineering.</p>"
