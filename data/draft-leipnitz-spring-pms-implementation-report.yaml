abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports round-trip delay measurements captured by a single
    MPLS Path Monitoring System (PMS) compared with results of an IPPM conformant
    measurement system, consisting of three different Measurement Agents. The measurements
    were made in a research backbone with an LDP control plane. The packets of the
    MPLS PMS use label stacks similar to those to be used by a segment routing MPLS
    PMS. The measurement packets of the MPLS PMS remained in the network data plane.</p>"
