abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP) based event notification management of Data Over Cable Service Interface
    Specification (DOCSIS) compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.
    This MIB is defined as an extension to the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB. This memo
    specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the Structure of Management
    Information Version 2 (SMIv2). The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP
    framework and existing SNMP standards. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
