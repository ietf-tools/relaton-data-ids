abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) uses name-based authorization.
    GSSAPI authenticates two named parties to each other. Names can be stored on access
    control lists to make authorization decisions. Advances in security mechanisms
    require this model to be extended. Some mechanisms such as public-key mechanisms
    do not have a single name to be used. Other mechanisms such as Kerberos allow
    names to change as people move around organizations. This document proposes expanding
    the definition of GSSAPI names to deal with these situations.</p>"
