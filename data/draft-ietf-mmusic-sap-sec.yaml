abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) has been specified in such
    a way that authentication and privacy can be assured. However the algorithms and
    mechanisms to achieve such security are not prescribed in the current draft. This
    document extends the SAP protocol, by describing specific algorithms and formats
    of authentication and encryption formats based on PGP and PKCS#7 standards. It
    is a companion document to draft-ietf-mmusic-sap. This document is a product of
    the Multiparty Multimedia Session Control (MMUSIC) working group of the Internet
    Engineering Task Force Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working
    group's mailing list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.</p>"
