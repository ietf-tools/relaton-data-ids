abstract:
- content: <p>Whenever two hosts have the ability to set up and control a session
    on a peer-to-peer basis, situations can arise in which both parties attempt to
    change session parameters "at the same time," such that the session control messages
    cross on the wire. When this happens, implementations need to invoke extraordinary
    procedures to return the shared state of the session to a common view between
    the endpoints. For real-time communications, these session control messages are
    typically exchanged using the session description protocol (SDP), using an Offer/Answer
    model. This document expands the offer/answer model to include the ability to
    exchange information relating to discrete media streams within the session. By
    reducing the amount of session data, the frequency of session state conflicts
    can be reduced; and, for certain types of operations, conflicts can be eliminated
    altogether. This document updates RFC 3264.</p>
