abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increasing deployment of Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)
    and Route Origin Validation (ROV), the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
    has become a critical component for securing inter-domain routing. RPKI leverages
    cryptographic certificates to validate the authenticity and authorization of IP
    address and AS number allocations. All RPKI objects are stored in distributed
    repositories and periodically retrieved by relying parties (RPs). This document
    presents a data-driven analysis of the current RPKI repository system, including
    a global survey of AS administrators and an empirical evaluation of repository
    operations. The analysis reveals that the existing repository architecture suffers
    from limited scalability and suboptimal efficiency, and is highly sensitive to
    failures. As the number of ROAs and RPs increases, the growing number of point-to-point
    connections between repositories and RPs, coupled with the pull-based data synchronization
    model, significantly degrades the system's scalability and performance. Moreover,
    a failure or attack on any Publication Point (PP) can prevent RPs from obtaining
    a complete and up-to-date view of RPKI data. This document further outlines the
    fundamental requirements for building a scalable, resilient,and efficient RPKI
    repository architecture to address these limitations.</p>"
