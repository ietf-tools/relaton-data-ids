abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of he work on MPLS Network Actions (MNA) several questions
    arose concerning how existing MPLS implementations handle Special Purpose Labels
    (SPLs). The details of MNA protocol extensions may depend on how existing implementations
    may react when they see those extensions. In order to discover what deployed implementations
    currently do, the MPLS working group chairs polled participants to answer specific
    questions. This document is intended to report anonymized answers to that poll.
    It is not intended that this document should progress to publication as an RFC.</p>"
