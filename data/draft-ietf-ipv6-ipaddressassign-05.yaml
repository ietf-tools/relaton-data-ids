abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method to manage the assignment of bits of
    an IPv6 address block or range. When an organisation needs to make an address
    plan for its subnets or when an ISP needs to make an address plan for its customers,
    this method enables the organisation to postpone the final decision on the number
    of bits to partition in the address space they have. It does it by keeping the
    bits around the borders of the partition to be free as long as possible. This
    scheme is applicable to any bits addressing scheme using bits with partitions
    in the space, but its first intended use is for IPv6. It is a generalization of
    RFC 1219 and can be used for IPv6 assignments. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
