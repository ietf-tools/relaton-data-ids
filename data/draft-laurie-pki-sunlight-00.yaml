abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public end- entity
    TLS certificate issued by a known Certificate Authority recorded in one or more
    certificate logs. In order to detect mis- issuance of certificates, all logs are
    publicly auditable. In particular, domain owners will be able to monitor logs
    for certificates issued on their own domain. In order to protect clients from
    unlogged mis-issued certificates, logs sign all recorded certificates, and clients
    can choose not to trust certificates that are not accompanied by an appropriate
    log signature. For privacy and performance reasons log signatures are embedded
    in the TLS handshake via the TLS authorization extension [RFC5878], or in the
    certificate itself via an X.509v3 certificate extension [RFC5280]. In order to
    ensure a globally consistent view of the log, logs also provide a global signature
    over the entire log. Any inconsistency of logs can be detected through cross-checks
    on the global signature. Logs are only expected to certify that they have seen
    a certificate and thus, we do not specify any revocation mechanism for log signatures
    in this document. Logs will be append-only, and log signatures will be valid indefinitely.</p>"
