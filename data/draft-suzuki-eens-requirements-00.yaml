abstract:
- content: "<p>Requirements concerning an energy-efficient network system such as
    a cloud system are presented. Specifically, a large-scale cloud system, which
    is composed of multiple data centers (DCs) and a wide area network (WAN) to connect
    these DCs, is focused on. The problems needed to be overcome in order to make
    the system energy efficient are presented. The requirements that must be satisfied
    in order to solve these problems are also presented.</p>"
