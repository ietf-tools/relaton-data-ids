abstract:
- content: "<p>LCVP allows a client to delegate certificate path validation to a trusted
    server. The path validation (e.g. making sure that none of the certificates in
    the path are revoked) is performed according to a set of rules called a validation
    policy. It allows simplification of client implementations and only uses of a
    set of predefined validation policies. This document defines a protocol that can
    be used to: (1) validate one certificate according to one validation policy, (2)
    query the validation policies supported by an LCVP server.</p>"
