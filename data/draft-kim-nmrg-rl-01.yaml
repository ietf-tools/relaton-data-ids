abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an intelligent reinforcement learning agent
    system to autonomously manage agent path-planning over a communication network.
    The main centralized node called by the global environment should not only manage
    all agents workflow in a hybrid peer-to-peer networking architecture and, but
    transfer and share information in distributed nodes. All agents in distributed
    nodes are able to be provided with a cumulative reward for each action that a
    given agent takes with respect to an optimized knowledge based on a to-be-learned
    policy over the learning process. The optimized knowledge would be involved with
    a large state information by the control action. A reward from the global environment
    is reflected to the next optimized control action for autonomous path management
    in distributed networking nodes. The reinforcement learning process (RLP) have
    developed and expanded to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a data-driven
    approach technique for learning process. The trendy technique has been widely
    to attempt and apply to networking fields since DRL can be used in practice, since
    networking areas have the dynamics and heterogeneous environment disturbances,
    so that in the technique is able to be intelligently learned in the effective
    strategy.</p>"
