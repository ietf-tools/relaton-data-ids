abstract:
- content: "<p>Knowledge of what bandwidths the end-points intend to use is important
    both for the other end-point and for resource allocation in various types of networks.
    This is especially important for wireless access networks which typically have
    quite limited resources. The bandwidth attribute in Session Description Protocol
    (SDP), 'b=AS', is today quite widely used to define the bandwidth that the end-points
    intends to use, in various types of sessions. This document will show that the
    existing bandwidth attribute, such as 'b=AS', although widely used in todays scenarios,
    has limitations that make it hard or even impossible for the end-points to express
    their intentions accurately when it comes to bandwidth usage. To solve the identified
    problems, this document defines a new extensible SDP bandwidth attribute 'a=bw'
    which enables more detailed control over the bandwidth declarations, request,
    and allocations. With the new bandwidth attribute it is possible to define different
    scopes in the session setup and then negotiate the bandwidth individually for
    each scope.</p>"
