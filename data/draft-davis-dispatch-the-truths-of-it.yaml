- content: "<p>The internet and information technology landscape has changed in many
    ways since The Twelve Networking Truths was original published via [RFC1925] over
    twenty six years ago. As a result this document attempts to extend the truths
    of information technology into the twenty-first century. This memo does not specify
    a standard, except in the sense that all standards MUST implicitly follow the
    fundamental truths.</p>"
