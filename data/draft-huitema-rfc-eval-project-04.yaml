abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently published
    RFC. We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in 2018, looking for history
    and delays. We also use two randomly chosen sets of RFC published in 2008 and
    1998 for comparing delays seen in 2018 to those observed 10 or 20 years ago. The
    average RFC in the 2018 sample was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which
    2 years and 10 months were spent in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF
    consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation
    in RFC production delays comes from the AUTH-48 phase. We also measure the number
    of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts
    with what we know about deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic
    interest, but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications.
    The RFCs selected for this survey were chosen at random and represent a small
    sample of all RFCs produced, and only approximately 10% of the RFCs produced in
    each of 1998, 2008, and 2018. It is possible that different samples would produce
    different results. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn from the observations made
    in this document represent the author's opinions and do not have consensus of
    the IETF.</p>"
