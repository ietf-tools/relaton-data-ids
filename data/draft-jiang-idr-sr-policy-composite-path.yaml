abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR Policy is associated
    with one or more candidate paths. A candidate path is either dynamic, explicit
    or composite. This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR policies
    carrying composite candidate path information. So that composite candidate paths
    can be installed when the SR policy is applied.</p>"
