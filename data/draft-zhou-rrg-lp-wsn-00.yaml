abstract:
- content: "<p>With the related applications of wireless sensor networks getting into
    our lives quickly, the research of WSN is growing more and more necessary. The
    most significant problem which threatens the successful deployment of sensor systems
    is privacy, there are many protocols providing the security of news content for
    the WSNs. However, due to the open feature of sensor networks, context information
    is still in an exposed state, which makes the network be vulnerable to traffic
    analysis attack and hop by hop tracing back packet attack. Thus location privacy
    protection programs have been proposed. In this paper, we analyze and compare
    the existing major schemes comprehensively, meanwhile illustrate their theoretical
    models, principles and the advantages and disadvantages in detail.</p>"
