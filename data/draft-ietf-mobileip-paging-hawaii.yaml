abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the HAWAII IP micro-mobility protocol
    to enable paging. Paging facilitates efficient power management at the mobile
    host by allowing the host to update the network less frequently at the cost of
    providing the network with only approximate location information. The protocol
    extensions described here provide a means for the network to determine the exact
    location of a mobile host before delivering packets destined to the mobile host.</p>"
