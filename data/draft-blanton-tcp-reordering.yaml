- content: "<p>This document outlines actions a TCP sender can take after determining
    that a spurious fast retransmission has been sent due to packet reordering. The
    document outlines the method a TCP connection can use to 'undo' needless changes
    made to the congestion control state. In addition, several methods to help prevent
    future fast retransmits are outlined.</p>"
