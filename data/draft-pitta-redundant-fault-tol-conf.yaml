abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability of the system to deliver its normal service in the presence
    of any unexpected errors and able to recover from the errors and restore to normal
    operation is called a fault tolerant system. Such systems whose behavior is predictable
    in nearly every possible situation are often in redundant fault tolerant configurations.
    This document defines the various redundant fault tolerant configurations that
    make these systems dependable systems or high availability systems.</p>"
