abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "Intent Driven Service
    Mapping", that uses BGP to express intent based association of overlay routes,
    with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics,
    that satisfy a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA). The document achieves this
    by defining new constructs, to group underlay routes with sufficienty similar
    TE characteristics into identifiable classes (Transport Class), that overlay routes
    use as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Scheme) towards service
    endpoints. These constructs can be used to realize the "IETF Network Slice" defined
    in TEAS Network Slices framework. This document specifies protocol procedures
    for BGP that enable dissemination of such service mapping information in a network
    that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These domains may be
    administered either by the same provider or by closely coordinating providers.
    A new BGP address family that leverages RFC-4364 procedures and follows RFC-8277
    NLRI encoding, is defined to advertise underlay routes with its identified class.
    This new address family is called "BGP Classful Transport", a.k.a., BGP CT.</p>
