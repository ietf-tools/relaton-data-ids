abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of cryptographic
    algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data. There is currently
    an IANA registry for these algorithms that is incomplete in that it lacks the
    recommended implementation status of each algorithm. This document provides an
    applicability statement on algorithm implementation compliance status for DNSSEC
    implementations. This document lists each algorithm's status based on the current
    reference. In the case that an algorithm is specified without an implementation
    status, this document assigns one.</p>"
