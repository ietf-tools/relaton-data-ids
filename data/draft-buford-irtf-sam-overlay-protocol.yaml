abstract:
- content: "<p>The previously proposed Hybrid Overlay Multicast Framework uses a structured
    peer-to-peer overlay to connect peers in different types of multicast regions
    of the Internet. We use AMT (Automatic IP Multicast Without Explicit Tunnels)
    to connect peers in ALM (Application Layer Multicast) regions with peers in native
    multicast regions. Here we define the overlay messaging needed to support the
    multicast tree operations. One goal of this approach is to ensure that the SAM
    framework is compatible with the P2P-SIP overlay, which is still being defined.
    Another goal is to be overlay agnostic so that different overlay algorithms can
    interoperate in a single SAM (Scalable Adaptive Multicast) session.</p>"
