abstract:
- content: "<p>Early Media is the ability of two SIP user agents to communicate before
    a SIP call is actually established. Support for early media is important largely
    for interoperability with the PSTN. Unfortunately, many SIP devices are providing
    this capability today without a well- documented, consistent, and complete solution.
    We define the problem of early media, document and describe the difficulties with
    the current approach used in SIP UAs, and present a more formal protocol mechanism
    that resolves these difficulties</p>"
