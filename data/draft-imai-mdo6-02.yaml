abstract:
- content: "<p>The multiple Destination option on IPv6(MDO6) is an elastic multicast
    delivery system. MDO6 uses a list of final unicast addresses of each destination
    node that is embedded into an optional routing header, as the destination of a
    datagram. Routers on the multicast path could forward datagrams by looking up
    the next hop router for individual final unicast addresses with the existing unicast
    routing table. MDO6 has several advantages as follows.</p>"
