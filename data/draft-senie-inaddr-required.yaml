abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name Service has provision for providing mapping of IP addresses
    to host names. It is common practice to ensure both name to address, and address
    to name mappings are provided for networks. This practice, while documented, has
    never been documented as a requirement placed upon those who control address blocks.
    This document fills this gap.</p>"
