abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces Virtual Service-aware Networks (VSNs) as a
    solution for inter-domain resource reservation with Quality-of- Service (QoS)
    on an Internet-wide scale. A VSN is a single-domain overlay network that consists
    of guaranteed QoS pipes. VSNs of neighboring domains that offer the same level
    of QoS establish peering relationships. As such, they form a network of QoS-enabled
    networks with a specific (QoS) routing context. In this network, admission control
    for traffic flows is performed in two phases. The two-phase approach allows for
    the use of an off-path signaling protocol, which enables the gradual introduction
    of this architecture without changing the existing routers.</p>"
