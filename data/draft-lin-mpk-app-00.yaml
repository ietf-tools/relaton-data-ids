abstract:
- content: "<p>A traditional X.509 v3 certificate format contains only one public
    key. Nowadays, many Internet applications like SET, S/MIME and IPSEC etc. need
    more than one public key. This document describes a Multiple-Public-Key (MPK)
    certificate format to include multiple public keys in a digital certificate. The
    MPK certificate format is not only compatible with X.509 v3 certificate format;
    but also can reduce the length of multiple certificates and speed up the verification
    time needed for multiple public keys.</p>"
