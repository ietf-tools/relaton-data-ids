abstract:
- content: "<p>The discussion in the problem working group reached consensus that
    the current IETF 3-stage standards track, as implemented, is not working. This
    is a proposal for an alternate, also 3-stage, standards track that I feel better
    matches current reality. This is a republication of an ID originally published
    in June 2003</p>"
