abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Resource Partition (NRP) represents a subset of network resources
    and associated policies within the underlay network. This document describes the
    implementation of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism
    for NRPs in MPLS networks. By extending existing OAM mechanisms such as ping,
    traceroute, the proposed solution enables comprehensive NRP support in MPLS networks.</p>"
