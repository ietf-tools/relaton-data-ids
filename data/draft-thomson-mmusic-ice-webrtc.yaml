abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been selected as the
    basis for establishing peer-to-peer UDP flows between Web Real-Time Communication
    (WebRTC) clients. Using an unmodified ICE implementation in this context enables
    the use of the web platform as a denial of service platform. The risks and complications
    arising from this choice are discussed. A modified algorithm for sending ICE connectivity
    checks from the web platform is described.</p>"
