abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for scalable, tiered Internet routing,
    called TRIP. The goal of TRIP is to decrease the growth rate of the core Internet
    routing tables by increasing route aggregation and constraining the propagation
    of multihoming and traffic engineering routes. TRIP accomplishes this goal by
    defining separate routing domains for edge networks and transit networks. All
    current, non-TRIP-aware networks and nodes are considered part of the transit
    domain. Edge network domains may be created by deploying TRIP at a domain-boundary
    routers or within IP (v4 or v6) endpoints. In addition to defining the basic TRIP
    mechanism, this document describes an incremental deployment path that provides
    a means for endpoints in TRIP-enabled edge networks to talk directly to non-TRIP-
    aware end-points in transit domain. This is accomplished without the need to advertise
    edge network prefixes in the global routing tables or to create a separate global
    routing domain for edge network prefixes.</p>"
