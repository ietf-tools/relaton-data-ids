abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes another way to set up a PW between two ASs
    in the scenario of directly connected ASBR between the two ASs. The Single-Segment
    PW or PW Segment of a MS-PW setup between two directly connected ASBRs dose not
    need PSN tunnel, so as to provide a more simple way to set up inter-as PW. In
    the scenario described in this draft, MP-EBGP can also be used to signal the mapping
    of PW, then no other protocols are existed between the two ASBRs.</p>"
