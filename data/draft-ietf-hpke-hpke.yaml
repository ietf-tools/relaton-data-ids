abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE).
    This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts
    for a recipient public key. It also includes a variant that authenticates possession
    of a pre-shared key. HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key
    derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)
    encryption function. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used
    and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement,
    HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.</p>"
