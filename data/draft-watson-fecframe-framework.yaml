abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an initial proposal for a framework for using
    forward error correction (FEC) codes with applications in the Internet to provide
    protection against packet loss. The framework supports applying Forward Error
    Correction to arbitrary packet flows and is primarily intended for streaming media.
    This framework can be used to define Content Delivery Protocols that provide Forward
    Error Correction for streaming media delivery or other packet flows. Content Delivery
    Protocols defined using this framework can support any FEC Scheme (and associated
    FEC codes) which is compliant with various requirements defined in this document.
    Thus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined which are not specific to a particular
    FEC Scheme and FEC Schemes can be defined which are not specific to a particular
    Content Delivery Protocol.</p>"
