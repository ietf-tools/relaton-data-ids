abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a bundle of DKIM (RFC 6376) extensions and
    adjustments. They do not hinder the currently distributed processing environment
    that includes DKIM, ARC, DMARC and SPF, and are as such backward compatible. Their
    aim is however to ultimately slim down the email environment that needs to be
    administrated and maintained, by establishing mutual agreements in between sender
    and receiver(s), verifiable through public-key cryptography, and let the SMTP
    protocol handle decisions solely based upon that.</p>"
