abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to IP multicast traceroute facility,
    named Mtrace2 version 2 (Mtrace2), to include traced path for Layer 2 multicast.
    Mtrace2 allows tracing the path from Last-Hop Router (LHR) to a source. Tracing
    the Layer 2 path from LHR till the actual receivers requires special implementations
    on the part of switches in the Layer 2 path. This specification describes the
    required functionality in multicast routers and switches. This feature functions
    along with the Layer 2 multicast protocols like IGMP (Internet Group Management
    Protocol) Snooping and MLD(Multicast Listener Discovery) Snooping.</p>"
