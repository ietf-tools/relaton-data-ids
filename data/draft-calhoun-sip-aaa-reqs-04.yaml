abstract:
- content: "<p>The AAA Working Group has been defining requirements for Network Access
    in Inter-Domain (roaming) networks, including requirements from the Mobile IP
    and NASREQ Working Groups. Some of these requirements were input from work done
    in the 3rd Generation wireless SDOs. These same SDO's have a need to tie their
    IP Intelligent Servers (e.g. Softswitches, Call Agents, SIP Servers, etc.) to
    their AAA infrastructure.</p>"
