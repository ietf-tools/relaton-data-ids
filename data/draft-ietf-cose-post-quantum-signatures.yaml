abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes JSON and CBOR serializations for several Post-Quantum
    Cryptography (PQC) based suites including CRYSTALS Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+.
    This document does not define any new cryptography, only seralizations of existing
    cryptographic systems. This document registers key types for JOSE and COSE, specifically
    LWE, NTRU, and HASH. Key types in this document are specified by the cryptographic
    algorithm family in use by a particular algorithm as discussed in RFC7517. This
    document registers signature algorithms types for JOSE and COSE, specifically
    CRYDI3 and others as required for use of various post- quantum signature schemes.</p>"
