abstract:
- content: "<p>The Open Authentication Protocol (OAuth) specifies a security protocol
    that involves significant end-user interaction -- the model is based on having
    the end-user approve the authorization that is being requested. That aspect makes
    the user interaction a part of the security model, and raises additional security
    considerations beyond those that are typical for client/server protocols. This
    document describes those considerations.</p>"
