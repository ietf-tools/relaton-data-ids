abstract:
- content: <p>This short memo outlines the author's thoughts about the challenges
    and opportunities with the IETF's administrative support activities, currently
    organised as part of the IETF Administrative Support Activities (IASA), IETF Administrative
    Oversight Committee (IAOC), and IETF Trust. This memo is just input for discussion
    that the IETF community should have. The memo is a part of the author's goal to
    document the status and various challenges and opportunities in the context of
    the so called "IASA 2.0" project. The memo has no particular official standing,
    nor does it claim to represent more than the authors' thinking at the time of
    writing.</p>
