abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides use case studies and network design considerations
    for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). In the recent years,
    MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice for the new generation of packet
    transport. Many service providers (SPs) are working to replace the legacy transport
    technologies, e.g. SONET/SDH, TDM, and ATM technologies, with MPLS-TP for packet
    transport, in order to achieve higher efficiency, lower operational cost, while
    maintaining transport characteristics. The use cases for MPLS-TP include Metro
    Ethernet access and aggregation, Mobile backhaul, and packet optical transport.
    The design considerations discussed in this documents ranging from operational
    experience; standards compliance; technology maturity; end-to-end forwarding and
    OAM consistency; compatibility with IP/MPLS networks; multi-vendor interoperability;
    and optimization vs. simplicity design trade off discussion. The general design
    principle is to provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport solutions.</p>"
