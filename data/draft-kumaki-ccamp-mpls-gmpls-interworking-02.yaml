abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to deploy GMPLS technology in the existing IP/MPLS networks,
    various operation, deployment and interworking aspect of MPLS/GMPLS needs to be
    addressed. From the deployment perspective, GMPLS architecture document lists
    [RFC3945] three different scenarios in which GMPLS technology can be deployed:
    overlay, augmented and integrated. Reference [GMPLS-mig] addresses the problem
    of migration from MPLS to GMPLS networks using the integrated model. This draft
    addresses the same problem space for augmented model and illustrates the applicability
    of augmented model in deploying GMPLS technology in existing IP/MPLS networks.
    Another very important aspect of MPLS/GMPLS interworking is ability to effectively
    use GMPLS services in IP/MPLS networks. This includes ability to specify GMPLS
    LSPs in signaling requests based on the type of the setup desired, as well as
    considerations for the operation aspects of using GMPLS LSPs. In this draft, we
    highlight some deployment and MPLS/GMPLS interworking requirements and propose
    solutions to address them. We also highlight some operation aspects and the possible
    solution and provide applicability statement for the available options.</p>"
