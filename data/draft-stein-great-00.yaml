abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP is commonly perceived to be a low quality, but low cost, alternative
    to standard telephony. This poor perception is often well deserved, being fueled
    by implementations designed without regard to characteristics of IP networks.
    This problem statement attempts to catalog the shortcomings of current implementations,
    in order to explore the IETF community's interest in working to improve this situation.</p>"
