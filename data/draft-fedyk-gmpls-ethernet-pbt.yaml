abstract:
- content: "<p>Carrier Grade Ethernet transport solutions require the capability of
    flexible service provisioning and fast protection switching. Currently, Ethernet
    is being extended in IEEE to meet the scalability needs of transport networks.
    The IETF specified GMPLS to control transport networks. To enable integration
    of Ethernet based transport solutions the extension of GMPLS control plane for
    Ethernet is of value. This memo describes how a GMPLS control plane may be applied
    to Provider Backbone Transport (PBT) and how GMPLS can be used to configure VLAN-aware
    Ethernet switches in order to establish Ethernet P2P and P2MP MAC switched paths
    and P2P/P2MP VID based trees. This document assumes any standard changes to IEEE
    data planes will be undertaken only in the IEEE.</p>"
