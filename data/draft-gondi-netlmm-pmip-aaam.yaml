abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility access through IPv4 and IPv6 provides seamless services for
    the user terminals across different access networks. To provide seamless continuity
    while the mobile is moving from one access networks to another is provided by
    different mechanisms, on the whole the proposed mechanisms provides mobility with
    special requirements access mechanism. The foremost popular of the mobility mechanisms
    is provided by Charles Perkins in mobile IPv4 IETF RFC 2002. There are some of
    the issues that MIP doesn't provide as a total mobility solution. The Proxy MIP
    is a mobility mechanism to ensure mobility management of the user terminal in
    different access networks. This method provides the network based mobility management
    without any client interactions. By this method the signaling overhead and the
    latency during the handover and roaming is reduced. In this proposed mechanism
    the mobile node doesn't need to have support for the mobility instead the access
    network provide the mobility for the user terminal. Even though the proxy mobile
    IPv4 provides the mobility management there are some of the issues that have to
    be solved for the network controlled mobility management. In this proposed draft
    we proposed new mechanism using proxy mobile IP with the mobility extensions provided
    by the AAA server at the time of authentication and authorizing a user terminal.
    Later in the draft we discuss the novel architecture and packet format for PMIP
    interactions with AAA of the access networks.</p>"
