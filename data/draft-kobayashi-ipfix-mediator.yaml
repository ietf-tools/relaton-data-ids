abstract:
- content: "<p>An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX Devices and
    traffic Collectors. This node acts as a IPFIX proxy or IPFIX concentrator. Therefore,
    IPFIX Mediators enables cascade connection. This document defines the Option Template
    required by cascade connection and a reference internal component model and describes
    several solution scenarios that use IPFIX Mediators. An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate
    node between IPFIX Devices and traffic Collectors. This node acts as a IPFIX proxy
    or IPFIX concentrator. IPFIX Mediator has several capabilities such as storage
    function of original Flow Records, flexible aggregation function, and proper distribution
    function for collector or analyzer. The combination of these capabilities can
    solve several problems related to traffic monitoring.</p>"
