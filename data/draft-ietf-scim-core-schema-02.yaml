abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    is designed to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services
    easier. The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and
    deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration,
    while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its
    intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing
    a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide
    patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make
    it fast, cheap, and easy to move identity in to, out of, and around the cloud.
    This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model for representing
    users and groups in JSON format. This schema is intended for exchange and use
    with cloud service providers. Additional binding documents provide a standard
    REST API, SAML binding, and use cases.</p>"
