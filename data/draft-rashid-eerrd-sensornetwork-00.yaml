abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient energy utilization and prolonged lifetime are two most covetable
    targets for sensor network. For increased lifetime,each node must conserve energy
    as much as possible. In this paper we propose a protocol in which energy is conserved
    by amortizing the energy cost of superfluous packets and idle state energy consumption
    To achieve our goal we have exercised well-known periodic sleep protocol and reduce
    redundant transmission by creating broadcast tree based on residual energy and
    distance based communication cost. Wasteful energy consumption of sensor nodes
    (e.g. idle listening, retransmission due to packet collision, overhearing etc)
    can be minimized by selecting minimum number of forwarding nodes. Our proposed
    algorithm selects minimum number of forwarding while creating broadcast tree.
    All intermediate nodes acts as forwarding node (non-leaf) while all the other
    nodes acts as a non-forwarding (child) reduces wasteful energy consumption by
    keeping radio transceiver off. Simulation shows our algorithm is better in terms
    Dense Sensor Network Based on Residual Energy and Distance of energy conservation
    and network lifetime</p>"
