abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents techniques built upon BGP/IP MPLS VPN control
    plane mechanisms to construct virtual topologies for service chaining. These virtual
    service topologies interconnect network zones and constrain the flow of traffic
    between these zones via a sequence of service nodes so that service functions
    can be applied to the traffic. This document also describes approaches enabled
    by both the routing control plane and by network orchestration to realize these
    virtual service topologies.</p>"
