abstract:
- content: "<p>Issues with email header protection in S/MIME have been recently raised
    in the IETF LAMPS Working Group. The need for amendments to the existing specification
    regarding header protection was expressed. The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) implementations
    currently use a mechanism quite similar to the currently standardized message
    wrapping for S/MIME. The main difference is that pEp is using PGP/ MIME instead,
    and adds space for carrying public keys next to the protected message. In LAMPS,
    it has been expressed that whatever mechanism will be chosen, it should not be
    limited to S/MIME, but also applicable to PGP/MIME. This document aims to contribute
    to this discussion and share the pEp implementation experience with email header
    protection.</p>"
