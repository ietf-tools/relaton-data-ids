abstract:
- content: <p>Message redirection is a basic capability provided by the Diameter base
    protocol. In its conventional form, message redirection is performed by an application-independent
    "redirect agent", which returns one or more individual hosts to the message sender
    as possible destinations of the redirected message. However, in some circumstances
    an operator may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without specifying
    individual hosts. This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by
    which that can be achieved. New applications may incorporate this capability by
    reference to the present document. Because the redirection mechanism is application-specific,
    it must be performed by a Diameter server or proxy rather than a basic redirect
    agent as defined in the Diameter base protocol. A new term, "Realm- based Redirect
    Server", is introduced in this document to differentiate the application-specific
    nature of realm-based redirection from the conventional Diameter redirection performed
    by a basic redirect agent. This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733
    with respect to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time
    AVPs.</p>
