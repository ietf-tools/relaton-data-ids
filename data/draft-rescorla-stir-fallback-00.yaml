abstract:
- content: "<p>A major challenge with RFC 4474-style identity assertions has been
    that SIP operates in highly mediated and interworked environments. SIP requests
    may pass through gateways, policy enforcement devices or other entities that receive
    SIP requests and effectively act as user agents, re-initiating a request. In these
    circumstances, intermediaries may recreate the fields protected by the RFC4474
    signature, making end-to end integrity impossible. This document describes a mechanism
    for two compliant endpoints to exchange authentication data even in the face of
    intermediaries which remove all additional call signaling meta-data or which translate
    from SIP into protocols incapable of understanding identity meta-data (e.g., where
    one side is the PSTN).</p>"
