abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Synchronizing Internet Clock (sic) Frequency specifies a new
    secure\n   method to synchronize clocks on the Internet, assuring smoothness\n
    \  (i.e., frequency stability) and robustness to man-in-the-middle\n   attacks.
    \ This protocol is oriented to assure the quality of Internet\n   performance
    measurements, where they are frequently obtained as the\n   difference of timestamps,
    hence frequency stability is needed.  In\n   90% of all cases, Synchronized Internet
    Clock Frequency is highly\n   accurate, with a Maximum Time Interval Error of
    fewer than 25\n   microseconds by a minute.  Synchronized Internet Clock Frequency
    is\n   based on a regular packet exchange and works with commodity terminal\n
    \  hardware.\n\n\n\t </p>\n      "
