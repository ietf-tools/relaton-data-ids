abstract:
- content: <p>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
    (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from user input were mapped into
    a set of Unicode code points that "make sense", which were then encoded and passed
    to the domain name system (DNS). The current version of IDNA presumes that the
    input to the protocol comes from a set of "permitted" code points, which it then
    encodes and passes to the DNS, but does not specify what to do with the result
    of user input. This document describes the actions that can be taken by an implementation
    between user input and passing permitted code points to the new IDNA protocol.</p>
