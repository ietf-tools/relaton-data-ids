abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications that
    do not have resource requirements that may not be readily quantifiable (qualitative
    applications). We introduce the \\146qualitative\\106 service-type. This service-type
    can be used in conjunction with RSVP signaling to manage the allocation of network
    resources to traffic originating from qualitative applications. This mode of RSVP
    usage is particularly applicable to networks that combine differentiated service
    (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling [intdiff].</p>"
