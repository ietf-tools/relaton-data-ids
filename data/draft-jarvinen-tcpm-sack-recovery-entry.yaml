abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a TCP sender algorithm to trigger loss recovery
    based on the information gathered on a SACK scoreboard instead of simply counting
    the number of arriving duplicate acknowledgements in the traditional way. The
    given algorithm is more robust to ACK losses, ACK reordering, missed duplicate
    acknowledgements due to delayed acknowledgements, and extra duplicate acknowledgements
    due to duplicated segments and out-of- window segments. The algorithm allows not
    only a timely initiation of TCP loss recovery but also reduces false fast retransmits.
    It has a low implementation cost on top of the SACK scoreboard defined in RFC
    3517.</p>"
