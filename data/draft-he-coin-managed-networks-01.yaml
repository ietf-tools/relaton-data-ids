abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft wants to review the existing research and the open issues
    that relate to the addition of data plane programmability in managed networks.
    While some of the research hypotheses that are at the center of in-network-computing
    have been investigated since the time of active networking, recent developments
    in software defined networking, virtualization programmable switches and new network
    programming languages like P4 have generated a new enthusiasm in the research
    community and a flourish of new projects in systems and applications alike. This
    is what this draft is addressing.</p>"
