abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the techniques used in SPAM prevention and various solutions
    for denial of service attacks is to force the SIP client requesting a service
    to perform a calculation that limits the rate and increases the cost of the request.
    This draft defines a way to allow a UAS to ask the UAC to compute a computationally
    expensive hash based function and present the result to the UAS. Although the
    computation is expensive for the UAC to compute, it is cheap for the UAS to verify.
    The solution also allows for proxies to compute and check the puzzle on behalf
    of the UAC or UAS. This draft currently outlines enough information to evaluate
    and consider this approach or even run experiments. It would need finalization
    around the forking topics discussed in the open issues before it would be implementable
    in production system.</p>"
