abstract:
- content: "<p>Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead in
    many scenarios. However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may significantly degrade
    network and device performance in terms of link utilization, latency, memory usage
    and/or energy consumption. This document defines the TCP ACK Pull (AKP) mechanism,
    which allows a sender to request the ACK for a data segment to be sent without
    additional delay by the receiver. AKP makes use of one of the reserved bits in
    the TCP header, which is defined in this specification as the AKP flag.</p>"
