abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines YANG modules to add support for classifying traffic
    received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to sub-interfaces based
    on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN frame headers. These modules allow
    IETF forwarding protocols (such as IPv6 and VPLS) to interoperate with VLAN tagged
    traffic orginated from an IEEE 802.1Q compliant bridge. Primarily the classification
    is based on VLAN identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but the model also has support
    for matching on some other layer 2 frame header fields and is designed to be extensible
    to match on other arbitrary header fields. The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q
    bridge model in that the configuration is interface/sub-interface based as opposed
    to being based on membership of an 802.1Q VLAN bridge.</p>"
