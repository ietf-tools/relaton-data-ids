abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSPF specification requires that intra-area paths are always preferred
    over inter-area paths, regardless of the path's cost. In some situations this
    can lead to an inefficient usage of network resources. This document describes
    a solution that helps to address this problem by creating adjacencies through
    backbone area that belong to non-backbone areas.</p>"
