abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard means to signal that a zone cut exists
    in the DNS without specifying a set of nameservers to which a child zone is delegated.
    This is useful in situations where it is important to make it clear to clients
    that a zone cut exists, but when the child zone is only provisioned in a private
    namespace.</p>"
