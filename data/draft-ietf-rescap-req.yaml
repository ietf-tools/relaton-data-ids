abstract:
- content: "<p>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the
    Internet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and destinations.
    However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or characteristics to a given
    resource identifier and subsequently assessing those attributes or characteristics
    has not been specified and deployed. Two tasks are envisioned. The first task
    will be to define a general resolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers
    to a list of attributes. The second task will be to define an administrative model
    and update protocol that can be used to set up and maintain the information the
    resolution protocol accesses.</p>"
