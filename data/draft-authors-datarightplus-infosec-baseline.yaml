abstract:
- content: "<p>The DataRight+ Security Profile: Baseline is intended to be a compatible
    profile of the [CDS] presented as a profile of [FAPI-1.0-Advanced]. This profile
    focuses primarily on the obligations between Provider and Initiator with respect
    to authorisation requests and does so as an overlay on the underlying FAPI profile
    combined with the inclusion of specified authorisation types. This profile does
    not attempt to provide elaboration on registration protocols, certificate profiles,
    federation or other components specified within the [CDS]. Further terminology
    used is deliberately jurisdiction agnostic, please refer to [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA]
    for specific ecosystem mappings.</p>"
