abstract:
- content: "<p>Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant detrimental
    impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP association. The throughput achievable
    over an SCTP association also is negatively impacted by the occurrence of T3-Retransmissions.
    The present SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as specified by [RFC4960] are not able
    to adequately or timely recover losses in certain situations, thus resorting to
    loss recovery by lengthy T3-Retransimissions or by non-timely activation of Fast
    Recovery. In this document we specify a number of enhancements to the SCTP Loss
    Recovery algorithms which amends some of these deficiencies with a particular
    focus on Loss Recovery for drops in Traffic Tails. The enhancements supplement
    the existing algorithms of [RFC4960] with proactive probing and timer driven activation
    of the Fast Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of the
    Fast Retransmission algorithm in itself are specified.</p>"
