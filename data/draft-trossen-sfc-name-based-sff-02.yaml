abstract:
- content: <p>Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network, such as
    low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support several use
    cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics etc. Adoption of cloud
    and fog technology at the edge of the network allows operator to deploy a single
    "Service Function" to multiple "Execution locations". The decision to steer traffic
    to a specific location may change frequently based on load, proximity etc. Under
    the current SFC framework, steering traffic dynamically to the different execution
    end points require a specific 're-chaining', i.e., a change in the service function
    path reflecting the different IP endpoints to be used for the new execution points.
    In order to address this, we discuss separating the logical Service Function Path
    from the specific execution end points. This can be done by identifying the Service
    Functions using a name rather than a routable IP endpoint (or Layer 2 address).
    This draft describes the necessary extensions, additional functions and protocol
    details in SFF (Service Function Forwarder) to handle name based relationships.</p>
