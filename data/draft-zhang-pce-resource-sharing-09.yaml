abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can help save network
    resource and is useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or when two LSPs do not
    need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is responsible
    for path computation with such requirement. The resource-sharing-based path computation
    with better efficiency can be achieved together with the association object in
    PCEP. This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order
    to support resource sharing-based path computation, which is a special case in
    the association path computation.</p>"
