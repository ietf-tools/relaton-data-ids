abstract:
- content: "<p>Quality of Service in the IP protocol has been proposed in some service
    definitions (Int-Serv and Diff-Serv) and in a variety of schemes and supporting
    protocols (RSVP). These schemes assume, of course, that all the protocols supporting
    IP links in turn provide a well-defined degree of QoS the IP schemes can rely
    upon. One of the most common link protocols is PPP. The PPP protocol provides
    a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
    links. It was designed to be used in serial point-to-point links. These ones can
    be for example PSTN circuits, characterized by a fixed bandwidth and fixed delay.
    Hence, there was no need to specify QoS mechanisms for PPP: the IP layer (or more
    generally the network layer) did not take into account the data-link layer to
    calculate the available resources.</p>"
