abstract:
- content: "<p>Misconfiguration and malicious manipulation of BGP AS_Path may lead
    to route hijack. This document proposes to enhance the BGP [RFC4271] Inbound/
    Outbound route processing in the case of detecting an AS loop. It is an enhancement
    to the current BGP's Inbound/Outbound processing and can be implemented directly
    on the device, and this document also proposes a centralized usecase. This could
    empower networks to quickly and accurately figure out they're being victimized.
    Two options are proposed for the enhancement, a) a local check at the device;
    b) data collection/analysis at the remote network controller/ server. Both approaches
    are beneficial for route hijack detection.</p>"
