abstract:
- content: "<p>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a long-standing protocol for real-time
    chatting. Servers often provide features that are backward compatible with older
    clients, but do not provide a reliable method for making clients aware of what
    extensions exist. This memo presents a method for servers to advertise such extensions
    to clients.</p>"
