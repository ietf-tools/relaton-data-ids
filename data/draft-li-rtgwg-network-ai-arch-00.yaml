abstract:
- content: "<p>Artificial intelligence is an important technical trend in the industry.
    With the development of network, it is necessary to introduce artificial intelligence
    technology to achieve self- adjustment, self- optimization, self-recovery of the
    network through collection of huge data of network state and machine learning.
    This draft defines the architecture of Network Artificial Intelligence (NAI),
    including the key components and the key protocol extension requirements.</p>"
