abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an evaluation of the RSIP (Realm Specific IP)
    framework and protocol against the evaluation criteria provided by the MIDCOM
    working group for the evaluation of middle box control protocols. RSIP is defined
    in experimental RFCs 3102 (Realm Specific IP: Framework) [3] and 3103 (Realm Specific
    IP: Protocol Specification) [4]; see also RFCs 3104 (RSIP Support for End-to-end
    IPsec) [5] and 3105 (Finding an RSIP Server with SLP) [6] for more information
    on RSIP. The document has been updated based on comments made on the MIDCOM mailing
    list since the previous version of this document was distributed.</p>"
