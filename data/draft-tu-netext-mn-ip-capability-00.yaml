abstract:
- content: "<p>WiFi is beginning to be considered as a trusted non-3GPP access network
    which can provide the service of accessing to the EPC core network to the user.
    And EAP/AKA(and EAP/AKA') is specified as the access authentication protocol in
    this case. This document defines a new EAP attribute to provide the mobile node
    IPv4/IPv6/IPv4v6 capability to the network so that mobile node IP address/prefix
    assignment and PMIP session establishment can be processed accordingly.</p>"
