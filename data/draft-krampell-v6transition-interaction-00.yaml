abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses interaction of transition mechanisms that can
    be involved in a communication between two end-points. Various transition mechanisms
    are defined to solve single transition issues. They are supposed to be used once
    along the path of a single communication. During the transition phase disparate
    network architecture will introduce multiple transition mechanisms in different
    ways. It will not be possible to predict the number and the nature of the transition
    mechanisms that can be encountered along the path of a communication. This memo
    aims to identify cases where multiple transition mechanisms can be involved, and
    what can be the interaction effects between them.</p>"
