abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN and a particular set of resources
    in the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay
    network which has a customized network topology and a set of network resources
    allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used to support one or a group
    of VPN+ services. When Segment Routing is used as the data plane to provide VTNs,
    each VTN can be allocated with a group of SIDs to identify the topology and resource
    attributes of network segments in the VTN. The association between the network
    topology, the network resource attributes and the SR SIDs may need to be distributed
    to a centralized network controller. For network scenarios where each VTN can
    be identified by a unique Flex-Algo ID, this document describes a mechanism to
    distribute the information of SR based VTNs using BGP-LS with Flex-Algo.</p>"
