abstract:
- content: "<p>This document adds Source-Specific capabilities to the Bidirectional
    Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM-BIDIR) routing protocol. Similarly to PIM-BIDIR,
    multicast traffic is always forwarded to the RP Link, but packets are also filtered
    based on their source address and source-specific subscription state. This operation
    mode is backwards compatible with PIM-BIDIR, provides a simpler alternative to
    PIM-SM and does not suffer when the multicast source location cannot be determined.</p>"
