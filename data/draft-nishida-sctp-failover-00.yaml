abstract:
- content: <p>One of the major advantages in SCTP is supporting multi-homing communication.
    If an multi-homed end-point has redundant network connections, sctp sessions can
    have a good chance to survive from network failures by migrating inactive network
    to active one. However, if we follow the SCTP standard, there can be significant
    delay for the network migration. During this migration period, SCTP cannot transmit
    much data to the destination. This issue drastically impairs the usability of
    SCTP in some situations. This memo describes the issue of SCTP failover mechanism
    and discuss its solutions which require minimal modification to the current standard.
