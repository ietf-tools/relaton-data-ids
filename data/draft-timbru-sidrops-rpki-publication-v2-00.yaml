abstract:
- content: "<p>The RPKI Publication Protocol first described in RFC 8181 has worked
    very well. That said, as it turns out, there are a number of requirements emerging
    from operational experience which cannot be supported by the current protocol.
    In particular, identity key roll overs, support for publication quota and stricter
    verification of content by the server. This document is an early write-up with
    the following goals: (1) support discussions about requirements for additional
    work and (2) explore a possible version 2 with solutions to meet those requirements.</p>"
