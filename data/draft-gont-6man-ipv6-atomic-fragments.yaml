abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 allows packets to contain a Fragment Header, without the packet
    being actually fragmented into multiple pieces. Such packets typically result
    from hosts that have received an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" error message that advertises
    a "Next-Hop MTU" smaller than 1280 bytes, and are currently processed by hosts
    as "fragmented traffic". By forging ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" error messages an
    attacker can cause hosts to employ "atomic fragments", and the launch any fragmentation-based
    attacks against such traffic. This document discusses the generation of the aforementioned
    "atomic fragments", the corresponding security implications, and formally updates
    RFC 2460 and RFC 5722 such that the attack vector based on "atomic fragments"
    is completely eliminated.</p>
