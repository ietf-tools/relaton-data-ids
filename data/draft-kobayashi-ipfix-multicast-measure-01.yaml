abstract:
- content: "<p>The demand for streaming services is increasing because of the growing
    number of broadband users. In particular, multicast services might become core
    network services, and additional demand is expected. On the other hand, multicast
    operation is quite complex, and there are strict network quality requirements
    about packet loss and delay. A measurement system using IPFIX/PSAMP helps to monitor
    multicast traffic behavior carefully. However, some problems with IPFIX/PSAMP
    still remain when network operators try to introduce the measurement system. This
    document describes issues that the multicast traffic measurement system might
    encounter. The results are intended to be used to define multicast handling by
    IPFIX/PSAMP metering devices more clearly.</p>"
