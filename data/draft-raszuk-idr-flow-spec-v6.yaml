abstract:
- content: "<p>Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules [RFC5575] provides a protocol
    extension for propagation of traffic flow information for the purpose of rate
    limiting or filtering. The [RFC5575] specifies those extensions for IPv4 protocol
    data packets. This specification extends the current [RFC5575] and defines changes
    to the original document in order to make it also usable and applicable to IPv6
    data packets.</p>"
