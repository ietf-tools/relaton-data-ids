abstract:
- content: "<p>Many video applications require extremely low latency and high image
    quality. However, the limited bandwidth in wireless networks fails to meet the
    peak rate requirements for multiple video flows. MPTCP is suitable for wireless
    edge networks, supporting the simultaneous use of multiple networks on mobile
    devices. Nevertheless, accurately scheduling video data blocks to different subflows
    to satisfy their low latency requirements is challenging due to their micro-burst
    characteristic. This document proposes a novel cross-layer feedback method for
    video applications in edge networks, called the Cross- Layer Information-based
    One-Way Delay Predictive Scheduler (CPS). With these information, the MPTCP scheduler
    can accurately predict one-way delay and adaptively schedules video data blocks
    to the optimal subflow.</p>"
