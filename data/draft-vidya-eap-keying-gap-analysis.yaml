abstract:
- content: "<p>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) keying framework [1] leaves
    out guidelines for using the extended master session key (EMSK) for future discussion
    and specification. While the keying framework does provide guidance for EAP master
    session key (MSK) usage, some SDOs use that key in a non-compliant manner. This
    document provides a description and analysis of MSK and EMSK usage and provides
    an outline for a discussion on these topics.</p>"
