abstract:
- content: "<p>Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by informing
    the network which flows are more important and which packets within a flow are
    more important. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g.,
    packet prioritization), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation
    of both the sender and the network. This document outlines use-cases that highlight
    the need for a new signaling protocol from the receiver to its network elements
    which enables different traffic treatment.</p>"
