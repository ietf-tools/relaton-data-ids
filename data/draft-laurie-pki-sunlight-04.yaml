abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of Certificate Transparency is to have every public end- entity
    (for example, web servers) and intermediate TLS certificate issued by a known
    Certificate Authority recorded in one or more certificate logs. In order to detect
    misissuance of certificates, all logs are publicly auditable. In particular, domain
    owners or their agents will be able to monitor logs for certificates issued on
    their own domain. To protect clients from unlogged misissued certificates, each
    log signs all certificates it records, and clients can choose not to trust certificates
    that are not accompanied by an appropriate log signature. For privacy and performance
    reasons log signatures are embedded in the TLS handshake via the TLS authorization
    extension, in a stapled OCSP extension, or in the certificate itself via an X.509v3
    certificate extension. To ensure a globally consistent view of any particular
    log, each log also provides a global signature over the entire log. Any inconsistency
    of logs can be detected through cross-checks on the global signature. Consistency
    between any pair of global signatures, corresponding to snapshots of a particular
    log at different times, can be efficiently shown. Logs are only expected to certify
    that they have seen a certificate, and thus we do not specify any revocation mechanism
    for log signatures in this document. Logs are append-only, and log signatures
    do not expire.</p>"
