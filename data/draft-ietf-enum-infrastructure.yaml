abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the use case for Infrastructure ENUM and proposes
    its implementation as a parallel namespace to "e164.arpa", as defined in RFC 3761,
    as the long-term solution to the problem of allowing carriers to provision DNS
    records for telephone numbers independently of those provisioned by end users
    (number assignees). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
