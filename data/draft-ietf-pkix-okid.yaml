abstract:
- content: "<p>In general, certificates need not be communicated with communication
    or storage media that are integrity-secure or authentic. This is because certificates
    are digitally signed and users are expected to validate the signatures using configured
    trust anchors. However, distribution of trust anchor certificates, self-signed
    end-entity certificates, or bare (unsigned) public keys requires a mechanism for
    establishing the authenticity of the certificate or public key.</p>"
