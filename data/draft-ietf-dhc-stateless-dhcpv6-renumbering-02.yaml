abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able to configure
    their IPv6 address and default router settings automatically. However, further
    settings are not available. If these hosts wish to configure their DNS, NTP, or
    other specific settings automatically, the stateless variant of the Dynamic Host
    Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used. This combination of Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration and stateless DHCPv6 could be used quite commonly in
    IPv6 networks. However, hosts using this combination currently have no means by
    which to be informed of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings; e.g., the
    addition of a new NTP server address, a change in DNS search paths, or full site
    renumbering. This document is presented as a problem statement from which a solution
    should be proposed in a subsequent document. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
