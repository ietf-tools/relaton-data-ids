abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP-4 is utilised as a key intra- and inter-Autonomous System routing
    protocol in modern IP networks. The failure modes as defined by the original protocol
    standards are based on a number of assumptions around the impact of session failure.
    Numerous incidents both in the global Internet routing table and within Service
    Provider networks have been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATE
    message causing large-scale failures in one or more Autonomous Systems. This memo
    describes the current use of BGP-4 within Service Provider networks, and outlines
    a set of requirements for further work to enhance the mechanisms available to
    a BGP-4 implementation when erroneous data is detected. Whilst this document does
    not provide specification of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a
    set of enhancements to BGP-4 to improve the protocol's robustness to suit its
    current deployment.</p>"
