abstract:
- content: "<p>Several mechanisms for early media have been proposed in the past,
    each attacking a different aspect of the problem. A good example of this is RFC-3960
    which talks about two models of early media: the gateway model, and the application
    model. The gateway model uses a series of offer/answer exchanges to control the
    rendering of early media, but breaks down in the presence of forking (as mentioned
    in section 3 of RFC-3960). The application model relies on the UAS to know when
    it is generating early media and use RFC-3959 to keep early media and regular
    media streams separate to avoid clipping. Even in the presence of the recommendations
    in RFC-3960 some problems exist within SIP in the area of early media. Although
    some of these challenges are likely to never be overcome, for example when interworking
    with a PSTN gateway that does not take into account CPG or ACM messages (in the
    case of ISUP). However, the potential to improve on what is already there does
    exist. This document attempts to go into more detail around early media where
    RFC-3960 left off, what sorts of mechanisms are in use today in existing implementations
    to deal with the challenges at hand, derives requirements and a possible mechanism
    to improve upon the current model. In addition, the document goes into other areas
    that can complicate or be complicated by the presence of early media (especially
    with forking) such as SRTP keying and media flow authorization.</p>"
