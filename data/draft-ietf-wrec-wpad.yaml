abstract:
- content: "<p>A mechanism is needed to permit web clients to locate nearby web proxy
    caches. Current best practice is for end users to hand configure their web client
    (i.e., browser) with the URL of an 'auto configuration file'. In large environments
    this presents a formidable support problem. It would be much more manageable for
    the web client software to automatically learn the configuration information for
    its web proxy settings. This is typically referred to as a resource discovery
    problem.</p>"
