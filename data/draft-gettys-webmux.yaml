abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the experimental multiplexing protocol referred
    to as 'WebMUX'. WebMUX is a session management protocol separating the underlying
    transport from the upper level application protocols. It provides a lightweight
    communication channel to the application layer by multiplexing data streams on
    top of a reliable stream oriented transport. By supporting coexistence of multiple
    application level protocols (e.g. HTTP and HTTP/NG), WebMUX should ease transitions
    to future Web protocols, and communications of client applets using private protocols
    with servers over the same TCP connection as the HTTP conversation. WebMUX is
    intended for, but by no means restricted to, transport of Web related protocols;
    the name has been chosen to reduce confusion with other existing multiplexing
    protocols. This document is part of a suite of documents describing the HTTP-NG
    design and prototype implementation: * HTTP-NG Short- and Longterm Goals, ID *
    HTTP-NG Architectural Model, ID * HTTP-NG Wire Protocol, ID * The Classic Web
    Interfaces in HTTP-NG, ID * Description of the HTTP-NG Testbed, ID</p>"
