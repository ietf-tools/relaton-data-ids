abstract:
- content: "<p>AI Agent can do some tasks as an assistant to human beings. During
    the task process, the Agent may need to connect to other Agents with different
    skills relative to the task. The Agent to Agent communication is a new kind of
    traffic for Internet, and some new requirements for networking are proposed. This
    document talks about the requirements and key issues of global AI agent communication
    towards 6G. Some 6G related use cases from 3GPP documents are introduced. After
    that, the related requirements for the AI Agent Communication Network (ACN) are
    proposed, and potential ACN frameworks and standardization works for the AI Agent
    Communication are also discussed.</p>"
