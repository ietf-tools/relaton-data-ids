abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes guidelines for extending the Routing
    Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [3, 4]. Our experiences with PRDB [2], RIPE-81
    [6], and RIPE-181 [5] taught us that RPSL had to be extensible. These languages
    were not extensible and each transition to a new language turned out to be quite
    painful. As a result, extensibility was a primary design goal for RPSL. New routing
    protocols or new features to existing routing protocols can be easily handled
    using RPSL's dictionary class. New classes or new attributes to the existing classes
    can also be added.</p>"
