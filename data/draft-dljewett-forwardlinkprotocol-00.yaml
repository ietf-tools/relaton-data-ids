abstract:
- content: '<p>*Short* Description: This Protocol automates creation and storage of
    Internet Links and BackLinks, together with enhanced MetaData, by individual,
    independent WebSites. The MetaData is displayed to Readers in SortableTables.
    The information in the SortableTables will be used by Readers to decide whether
    to follow Links and BackLinks that they encounter in using the Web, and will speed
    development of Knowledge based upon Web- Information. The Categories in the Tables
    are guided by the interests of the Readers, and differ between WebSites hosting
    different topics. The Protocol is designed to be implemented on individual WebSites;
    it does not require a centralized server nor top-down supervision. *Longer* Description:
    The FL-P (ForwardLink-Protocol) provides new communication conventions by which
    two WebSites exchange information and MetaData to provide easy and useful means
    for Article-Readers to decide whether to follow a Link from one Article to the
    another. A *RetroLink* takes the Reader to a citED Older-Text, from a citING Newer-Text.
    A *ForwardLink* takes the Reader to the citING Newer- Text, from a citED Older-Text.
    (NOTE: The words "Older" and "Newer" apply to the *Text*, *not* to the *Article*
    or *WebSite*. The adjectives "Forward" and "Retro" refer to the point-of-view
    of the Reader *when reading* the text that contains the Link. The necessity for
    this new terminology is explained in the body of the proposal.) Text-specific
    and Article-specific MetaData are presented to the Reader in SortableTables whose
    organization is determined by the Reader. The Reader''s choices in data-categories
    and sorting are saved in Cookies on the Reader''s Computer. These features aid
    the Reader in organizing the information of the SortableTables so as to decide
    whether to follow a displayed Link or not. These features increase the Reader''s
    efficiency in searching for information on the Web. ForwardLinks will significantly
    increase the utility of the Web for scholars, thus enhancing Knowledge creation
    based upon Web- Information. Additionally, ForwardLinks will *increase the value*
    of open-access, online archives (of both Publishers and Libraries). Such archives,
    will, over time, collect increasing numbers of valuable ForwardLinks that point
    to newer developments in a field, which is critical information for further progress.
    ForwardLinks are based upon "human judgments of importance". For example, ForwardLinks
    may well occur between two Articles that do *not* share *any* duplicate words
    or phrases. Such Linkages *cannot be discovered* with *present WebSearch techniques*.</p>'
