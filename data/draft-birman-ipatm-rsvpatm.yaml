abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we focus on RSVP-based resource reservations in a
    heterogeneous environment which includes ATM networks. We describe a method for
    establishing 'shortcuts' through an ATM network which avoids the performance penalty
    associated with level 3 processing in a 'classical RSVP over ATM' approach. For
    the case of guaranteed service we show how to map the RSVP flow characteristics
    to ATM call parameters, and thus enable end-to-end performance guarantees. We
    also discuss the extensions to RSVP and to ATM signaling required for the implementation
    of these solutions.</p>"
