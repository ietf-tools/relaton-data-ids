abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide different customers with logically
    separated connectivity over a common network infrastructure. With the introduction
    and evolvement of 5G and also in some existing network scenarios, some customers
    may require network connectivity services with advanced features comparing to
    conventional VPN services. Such kind of network service is called enhanced VPNs
    (VPN+). VPN+ can be used, for example, to deliver IETF network slice services.
    A VTN is a virtual underlay network that is associated with a network topology,
    and is allocated with a set of dedicated or shared resources from the underlay
    physical network. VPN+ services can be delivered by mapping one or a group of
    overlay VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as the virtual underlay. For packet forwarding
    in a specific VTN, some fields in the data packet are used to identify the VTN
    the packet belongs to, so that VTN-specific processing can be performed on each
    node along a VTN-specific path. This document specifies a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
    option to carry the VTN related information in data packets, which could be used
    to identify the VTN-specific processing to be performed on the packets by each
    network node along a VTN-specific path.</p>"
