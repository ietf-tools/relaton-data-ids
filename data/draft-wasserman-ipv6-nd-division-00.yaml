abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a formal division of the existing IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery protocol into eight separable, related mechanisms: Address Resolution,
    Duplicate Address Detection (DAD), Router Discovery, Prefix/Parameter Discovery,
    Address Autoconfiguration, Router Unreachability Detection (RUD), Neighbor Unreachability
    Detection (NUD) and ICMPv6 Redirects. These mechanisms all depend upon a common
    set of ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages, but can be enabled and disabled independently,
    subject to the restrictions and recommendations outlined in this draft. It is
    not the intention of this memo to propose substantive changes to the existing
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol, but to allow the separate portions of IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery to be unambiguously identified, making it possible to specify or configure
    different portions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for use on specific link-types,
    links or interfaces.</p>"
