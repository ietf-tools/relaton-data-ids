abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 [1] defines two different modes to handle the mobility
    problem (i.e., mobile node moving accross different networks and changing its
    IP address). The two modes had been mainly designed for scenarios involving one
    mobile node and one static node (correspondent node). This document answers issues
    related to scenarios involving two mobile nodes (i.e., the correspodent node is
    also a mobile node). The document addresses also the double jumping problem where
    two mobile nodes move at the same time (i.e., switch to new subnets). The document
    proposes a new mode called 'BUB' (Binding Update Backhauling) allowing a more
    secure, reliable and optimized exchange of Binding Updates (BUs) between two mobile
    endpoints.</p>"
