abstract:
- content: "<p>according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there is a paragraph for
    recovery requirements just as section 2.5.6.1 in RFC5654 describles: within the
    context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization criteria considered in
    ring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the number of OAM entities that are
    needed to trigger the recovery operation; 2 Minimize the number of elements of
    recovery in the ring; 3 Minimize the number of labels required for the protection
    paths across the ring; 4 minimize the amount of control and management plane transactions
    during maintenance operation. this document will describle two types of ring protection
    solutions to implement these requirements.</p>"
