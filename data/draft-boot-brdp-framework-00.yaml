abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP)
    framework. This framework enables multi-homing for small to medium sites, using
    Provider Aggregatable IPv6 addresses. It describes a mechanism for automated IP
    address configuration and renumbering, a mechanism for optimized source address
    selection and a new paradigm for packet forwarding. The BRDP framework prevents
    ingress filtering problems with multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing
    for multi-path transport protocols. This work also prevents routing scalability
    problems in the provider network and Internet Default Free Zone because small
    to medium multi-homed size sites would not need to request Provider Independent
    address blocks.</p>"
