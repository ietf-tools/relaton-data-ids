abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP has become the transmission technique of choice for the
    multi-homed environment. Recently, there have been multiple attempts to verify
    the security of Multipath TCP; but an eavesdropper in the initial handshake breaches
    the primary security goal of Multipath TCP. In this paper, we introduce a secure
    scheme against an initial eavesdropper, using asymmetric key exchange. We optimize
    the public parameters to overcome two challenges to the use of asymmetric cryptography.
    Then we show that compared to previously proposed methods, our scheme has low
    overhead, and is more secure. Our approach applies to many weak authentication-based
    protocols that seek to use asymmetric cryptography.</p>"
