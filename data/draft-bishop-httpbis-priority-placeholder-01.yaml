abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7540 defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating priorities.
    Some implementations have begun using closed streams as placeholders when constructing
    their priority tree, but this has unbounded state commitments and interacts poorly
    with HTTP/QUIC. This document proposes an extension to the HTTP/2 priority scheme
    for both protocols.</p>"
