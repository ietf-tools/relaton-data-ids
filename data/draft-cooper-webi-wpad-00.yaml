abstract:
- content: "<p>A mechanism is needed to permit web clients to locate nearby (caching)
    web proxy. Current best practice is for end users to hand configure their web
    client (i.e., browser) with the URL of an 'auto configuration file'. In large
    environments this presents a formidable support problem. It would be much more
    manageable for the web client software to automatically learn the configuration
    information for its web proxy settings. This is typically referred to as a resource
    discovery problem.</p>"
