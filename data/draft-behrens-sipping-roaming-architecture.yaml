abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an authentication mechanism which can be used
    to enable users of VoIP to globally roam between any number of ITSPs (Internet
    Telephony Service Providers) without needing to have a prior customer or billing
    relationship with all of them. This enables profiles and one- line-billing. Providers
    using this authentication mechanism do neither need full-mesh trust relationships
    or roaming agreements with every other possible provider nor do they need to rely
    on a centralized brokerage entity to process calls. The Home Network (HN), which
    handles all AAA for a user attempting to use an ITSP's service is determined through
    a unique identifier submitted by the user. This Network Access Identifier [RFC2486]
    contains information about the trust domain or trust realm the user belongs to.
    Based on a simple discovery mechanism a provider can establish a trust path to
    this home network. Once this is established, the provider can authenticate the
    user and check his credit with the home network. Accounting and rate information
    will be sent to the home network for mediation and processing.</p>"
