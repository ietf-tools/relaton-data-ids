abstract:
- content: "<p>To date, the scenario of multiple IP addresses for same domain name
    arises for the case where either we have multihomed IP hosts or we have multiple
    servers having the same domain name and application on the client needs to approach
    only one of those IP hosts. However, the penetration of mobile hosts and personal
    devices identified, on the internet, by the user's Network Access Identifier (NAI)
    may create a scenario where multiple devices may have same domain name but different
    IP addresses and all of those devices may need to get the service or data from
    the application which only identifies them by their host name. This document proposes
    to add a new Resource Record called the Multiple Unicast Resource Record (MURR)
    to the DNS system. This resource record is added for a domain name where the applications
    retrieving the IP address for the domain name have to provide the service (like
    PUSH data) to all the IP addresses retrieved in the multiple MURRs for the domain
    name.</p>"
