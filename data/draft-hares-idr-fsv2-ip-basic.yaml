abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC 8956,
    and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters
    and actions) distributed via BGP. During the deployment of BGP FSv1 a number of
    issues were detected, so version 2 of the BGP flow specification (FSv2) protocol
    addresses these features. In order to provide a clear demarcation between FSv1
    and FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2. IDR requires two implementations
    prior to standardization. Implementers feedback on FSv2 was that the complete
    FSv2 has the contains the correct information, but that breaking FSv2 into a progression
    of documents would be helpful. The first priority in this progression is expanded
    IP DDOS capabilities. This document contains original FSv2 IP DDOS capabilities
    in FlowSpec v2 using just the extended communities to define actions.</p>"
