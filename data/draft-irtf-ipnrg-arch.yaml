abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant networks,
    and is a generalization of the architecture designed for the Interplanetary Internet:
    a communication system to provide Internet- like services across interplanetary
    distances in support of deep space exploration. This generalization addresses
    networks whose operational characteristics make conventional networking approaches
    become either unworkable or impractical. We define a message-based overlay that
    exists above the transport layer of the networks on which it is hosted. The draft
    presents an architectural overview followed by discussions of services, topology,
    routing, security, reliability and state management. It concludes with a discussion
    of end-to-end information exchange, including an example.</p>"
