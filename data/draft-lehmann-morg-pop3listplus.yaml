abstract:
- content: "<p>The Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) LIST+ Extension allows
    a POP3 client to instruct a POP3 server to send additional information with the
    LIST command response. It also can instruct a POP3 server to send only information
    about newly arrived messages, when polling for new messages. This will help save
    message round trips and network bandwidth, especially on large mailboxes containing
    several messages. On public POP3 servers, serving thousands of mailboxes, and
    being polled frequently, LIST+ will help reduce server load as well as network
    bandwith.</p>"
