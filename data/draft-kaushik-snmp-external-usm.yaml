abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a framework for SNMPv3 authentication and
    key distribution with support for various authentication systems such as RADIUS,
    X.509 certificates, Local Accounts, Kerberos etc. Support for these authentication
    systems for SNMPv3 allows for a common identity to be used with/shared across
    all management protocols since the other network management interfaces such as
    the NetConf protocol and device Command Line Interface (CLI) are already using
    these authentication systems.</p>"
