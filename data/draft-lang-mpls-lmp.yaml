abstract:
- content: "<p>Future networks will consist of photonic switches, optical crossconnects,
    and routers that may be configured with bundled links consisting of a number of
    user component links and an associated control channel. This draft specifies a
    link management protocol (LMP) that runs between neighboring nodes and will be
    used for both link provisioning and fault isolation. A unique feature of LMP is
    that it is able to isolate faults in both opaque and transparent networks, independent
    of the encoding scheme used for the component links. LMP will be used to maintain
    control channel connectivity, verify component link connectivity, and isolate
    link, fiber, or channel failures within the network.</p>"
