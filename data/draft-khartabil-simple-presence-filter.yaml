abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence event package for the SIP events framework describes the
    usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications
    of user presence. The document details how watchers can subscribe for notifications
    of all authorised and available presence information about the presentity. The
    document does not describe a mechanism of how filtering of presence information
    can be achieved. This document defines a presence filter package for the Event
    Notification Filtering Architecture. The package provides the mechanism whereby
    a watcher can specify the presence event filtering rules, using XML, for the presence
    agent (PA) and how that PA is to behave when receiving such filter.</p>"
