abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the AS hopcount path attribute for BGP. This
    is an optional, transitive path attribute that is designed to help limit the distribution
    of routing information in the Internet. By default, prefixes advertised into the
    BGP mesh are distributed freely, and if not blocked by policy will propagate globally.
    This is harmful to the scalability of the routing subsystem since information
    that only has a local effect on routing will cause state creation throughout the
    default-free zone. This attribute can be attached to a particular path to limit
    its scope to a subset of the Internet.</p>"
