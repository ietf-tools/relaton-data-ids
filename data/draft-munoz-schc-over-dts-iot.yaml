abstract:
- content: "<p>This document uses the Static Context Header Compression and Fragmentation
    (SCHC) standard in prone to disruptions communications such as Direct-to-Satellite
    Internet of Things (DtS-IoT) communications or any scenario where communications
    are interrupted or experience significant delays. To this end, the document defines
    a new fragmentation sublayer for communications with prone to disruptions and
    delay. The new fragmentation sublayer optimizes the transfer delay of a SCHC packet
    through a Type II Hybrid ARQ/FEC mechanism.</p>"
