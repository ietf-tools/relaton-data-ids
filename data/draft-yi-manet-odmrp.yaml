abstract:
- content: "<p>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing
    protocol designed for ad hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is a mesh-based,
    rather than a conventional tree-based, multicast scheme and uses a forwarding
    group concept (only a subset of nodes forwards the multicast packets via scoped
    flooding). It applies on-demand procedures to dynamically build routes and maintain
    multicast group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad hoc wireless networks
    with mobile hosts where bandwidth is limited, topology changes frequently and
    rapidly, and power is constrained.</p>"
