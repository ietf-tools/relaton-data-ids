abstract:
- content: "<p>IMAP4 has two commands for listing mailboxes: LIST and LSUB. As we
    have added extensions, such as Mailbox Referrals, that have required specialized
    lists we have had to expand the number of list commands, since each extension
    must add its function to both LIST and LSUB, and these commands are not, as they
    are defined, extensible. If we've needed the extensions to work together, we've
    had to add a set of commands to mix the different options, the set increasing
    in size with each new extension. This document describes an extension to the base
    LIST command that will allow these additions to be done with mutually compatible
    options to the LIST command, avoiding the exponential increase in specialized
    list commands. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
