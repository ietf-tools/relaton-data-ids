abstract:
- content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been
    in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document
    updates RFC 7233, Part 5 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol
    referred to as "HTTP/1.1". Part 5 defines range-specific requests and the rules
    for constructing and combining responses to those requests. This document improves
    support for responding to range requests for resources of indeterminate size.</p>
