abstract:
- content: "<p>For LSPs that span across multiple areas or multiple autonomous systems
    (AS), the path computation element (PCE) in each area or each AS can cooperate
    and conclude the optimal results if so exist. An upstream PCE, though incapable
    to carry out the path computation for the tailend outside of its domain, can provide
    the history of the computation to its downstream PCEs which will assume the computation
    job till it is accomplished or relay the baton to the next runner.</p>"
