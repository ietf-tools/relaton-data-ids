abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses inconsistencies observed in the handling of
    the Recursion Desired (RD) flag in DNS queries by various DNS resolver implementations,
    particularly when the RD flag is cleared (set to 0). Such inconsistencies have
    been shown to be exploitable, leading to potent Denial of Service (DoS) amplification
    attacks. This document provides clear guidance and recommendations for DNS resolver
    (including forwarding and recursive resolvers) behavior when processing queries
    with different RD flag settings. The goal is to enhance DNS security, mitigate
    specific amplification attack vectors, and ensure more predictable and robust
    DNS operations.</p>"
