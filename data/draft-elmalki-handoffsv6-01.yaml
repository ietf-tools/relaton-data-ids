abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in Mobile IPv6.
    Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv6 in order to limit the period of service
    disruption experienced by a wireless Mobile Node when moving between access routers.
    This requirement becomes even more important when supporting real-time services.
    Fast Handoffs involve anticipating the movement of MNs by sending multiple copies
    of the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement locations. Both flat and Hierarchical
    Mobile IPv6 models are considered. The Hierarchical MIPv6 mobility Management
    model in [1] already offers improvements to Mobile IP handoffs by providing a
    local Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) functionality. Some additions are made to the
    operation of this existing Hierarchical model to achieve Fast Handoffs.</p>"
