abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a new EAP method, EAP-AKA', which is a small
    revision of the EAP-AKA (Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for 3rd Generation
    Authentication and Key Agreement) method. The change is a new key derivation function
    that binds the keys derived within the method to the name of the access network.
    The new key derivation mechanism has been defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP). This specification allows its use in EAP in an interoperable manner.
    In addition, EAP-AKA' employs SHA-256 instead of SHA-1. This specification also
    updates RFC 4187, EAP-AKA, to prevent bidding down attacks from EAP-AKA'. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
