abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-liu-spring-sr-policy-energy-efficiency-00] describes how energy
    consumption information is utilized for path selection in Segment Routing (SR)
    networks. This document elaborates on extending IGP protocols to carry energy
    consumption information, enabling its dissemination within the IGP domain and
    ultimately transmitting it to the controller. This allows the controller to perform
    routing calculations based on energy consumption metrics.</p>"
