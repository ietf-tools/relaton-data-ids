abstract:
- content: "<p>The RFC Series has evolved to allow for the use of non-ASCII characters
    in RFCs. While English remains the required language of the Series, the encoding
    of RFCs is now in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically
    used in the English language. This document describes requirements and guidelines
    for the RFC Editor regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs. This document
    obsoletes RFC 7997. The differences reflect changes in the practices of the RFC
    series since RFC 7997 was published, and makes further changes based on agreements
    in the IETF community about what characters are allowed in RFCs. [[ A repository
    for this draft can be found here (https://github.com/ paulehoffman/7997bis). ]]</p>"
