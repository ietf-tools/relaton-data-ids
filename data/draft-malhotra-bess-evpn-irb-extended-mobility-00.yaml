abstract:
- content: "<p>Procedure to handle host mobility in a layer 2 Network with EVPN control
    plane is defined as part of RFC 7432. EVPN has since evolved to find wider applicability
    across various IRB use cases that include distributing both MAC and IP reachability
    via a common EVPN control plane. MAC Mobility procedures defined in RFC 7432 are
    extensible to IRB use cases if a fixed 1:1 mapping between VM IP and MAC is assumed
    across VM moves. Generic mobility support for IP and MAC that allows these bindings
    to change across moves is required to support a broader set of EVPN IRB use cases,
    and requires further consideration. EVPN-LAG based multi-homing further introduces
    scenarios that require additional consideration from mobility perspective. Intent
    of this draft is to enumerate a set of design considerations applicable to mobility
    across EVPN IRB use cases and define generic sequence number assignment procedures
    to address these IRB use cases.</p>"
