abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management
    (DMM) at the network layer. The hierarchical structure in traditional wireless
    networks has led primarily to centrally deployed mobility anchors. As some wireless
    networks are evolving away from the hierarchical structure, it can be useful to
    have a distributed model for mobility management in which traffic does not need
    to traverse centrally deployed mobility anchors far from the optimal route. The
    motivation and the problems addressed by each requirement are also described.</p>"
