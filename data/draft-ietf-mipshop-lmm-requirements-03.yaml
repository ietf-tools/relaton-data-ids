abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes goals for Localized Mobility Management (LMM)
    for IP layer mobility, such Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6. These goals are intended
    to guide the design of a protocol specification for LMM. Localized Mobility Management,
    in general, introduces enhancements to IP layer mobility protocols to reduce the
    amount of latency in IP layer mobility management messages exchanged between a
    Mobile Node (MN) and its peer entities. In addition, LMM seeks to reduce the amount
    of signaling over the global Internet when a mobile node traverses within a defined
    local domain. The identified goals are essential for localized mobility management
    functionality. They are intended to be used as a guide for analysis on the observed
    benefits over the identified goals for architecting and deploying LMM schemes.</p>"
