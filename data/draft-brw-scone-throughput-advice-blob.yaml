abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic exchanged over a network may be subject to rate-limit policies
    for various operational reasons. This document specifies a generic object (called,
    Throughput Advice) that can be used by mechanisms for hosts to dynamically discover
    these network rate-limit policies. This information is then passed to applications
    that might adjust their behaviors accordingly. The design of the throughput advice
    object is independent of the discovery channel (protocol, API, etc.).</p>"
