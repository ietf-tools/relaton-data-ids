abstract:
- content: "<p>Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) allows encrypted
    media to be used in environments where support for encryption is not known in
    advance, and not required. OSRTP is an implementation of Opportunistic Security,
    as defined in RFC 7435. OSRTP does not require advanced SDP extensions or features
    and is fully backwards compatible with existing secure and insecure implementations.
    OSRTP is not specific to any key management technique for SRTP. OSRTP is a transitional
    approach useful for migrating existing deployments of real-time communications
    to a fully encrypted and authenticated state.</p>"
