abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a router affiliation protocol for IPv6- over-(foo)-over-IPv4
    links, where (foo) is either an encapsulating layer (e.g., UDP) or a NULL layer.
    It is essentially a lightweight, link-layer mechanism for nodes and routers to
    establish security associations, discover and dynamically re-adjust maximum transmission
    units, and detect router failures. The protocol makes no attempt to ensure reliable
    message delivery; this function is performed by higher-layer protocols, e.g. TCP.</p>"
