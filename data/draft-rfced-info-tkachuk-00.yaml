abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is the specification of the code page, which was originally
    developed for the transmission of texts in the Ukrainian language through networks,
    and in particular the networks, employing Unix operating systems. It is, however,
    operating-system-neutral, and is used in various situations, just as its Russian
    language counterpart KOI-8R. With some minor exceptions, this specification can
    be considered to be an extension of KOI8-R (RFC-1489). The present edition of
    the specification is the result of the wide concensus reached after many prolonged
    exchanges and discussions, which took place in Ukraine and on some Usenet conferences
    covering Ukraine and read by the public who employs the Ukrainian language.</p>"
