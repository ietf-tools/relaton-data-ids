abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo has introduced IPv6 practices on China Mobile IP bearer network,
    in which IP backbone network and broadband access routers have been covered. In
    the practice, IPv6 protocol conformance and data packages forwarding capabiliteis
    have been tested in multi- vendors environments. Several IPv6 transition schemes
    have been deployed to validate interoperabilities. Based on concrete testing data,
    IPv6-enable deployment experiencies have been learned to share with community.</p>"
