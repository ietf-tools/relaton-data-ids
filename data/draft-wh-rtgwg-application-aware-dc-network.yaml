abstract:
- content: "<p>Deploying large-scale AI services in data centers poses new challenges
    to traditional technologies such as load balancing and congestion control. Besides,
    emerging network technologies such as in-network computing are gradually accepted
    and used in AI data centers. These network-assisted application acceleration technologies
    require that cross-layer interaction information can be flexibly transmitted between
    end-hosts and network nodes. APDN (Application-aware Date Center Network) adopts
    the APN framework for application side to provide more application-aware information
    for the data center network, enabling the fast evolution of network- application
    co-design technology. This document elaborates use cases of APDNs and provides
    specific requirements.</p>"
