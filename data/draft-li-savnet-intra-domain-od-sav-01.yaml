abstract:
- content: "<p>Source Address Validation (SAV) mechanisms, such as uRPF, ACLs, and
    BM-SPF, are applied to prevent IP source address spoofing. However, these mechanisms
    are typically designed for static routing scenarios and deployed at fixed network
    boundaries. With the increasing adoption of dynamic forwarding technologies such
    as SRv6 Policy and Fast Reroute (TI-FRR), the network's actual forwarding path
    may change frequently due to policy-based traffic steering or link failures. In
    such cases, statically deployed SAV rules may fail to validate traffic on newly
    activated or alternate paths, creating validation blind spots or even leading
    to false positives that block legitimate traffic. This draft proposes an On-Demand
    Source Address Validation Activation mechanism. It enables routers to dynamically
    activate or update SAV rules on specific interfaces only when the interface becomes
    part of an active forwarding path due to policy or failover triggers. This approach
    enhances SAV coverage, avoids unnecessary resource consumption, and ensures SAV
    correctness under dynamic path switching scenarios driven by SRv6-policy and TI-FRR.</p>"
