abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel so
    that DOTS clients can control their filtering rules when an attack mitigation
    is active. Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or de-
    activate existing filtering rules during a DDoS attack. The characterization of
    these filtering rules is supposed to be conveyed by a DOTS client during an idle
    time by means of the DOTS data channel protocol. Editorial Note (To be removed
    by RFC Editor) Please update these statements within the document with the RFC
    number to be assigned to this document: o "This version of this YANG module is
    part of RFC XXXX;" o "RFC XXXX: Controlling Filtering Rules Using Distributed
    Denial- of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel"; o reference:
    RFC XXXX o [RFCXXXX] Please update these statements with the RFC number to be
    assigned to the following documents: o "RFC SSSS: Distributed Denial-of-Service
    Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel Specification" (used to be [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel])
    o "RFC DDDD: Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Data Channel
    Specification" (used to be [I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel]) Please update the "revision"
    date of the YANG module.</p>'
