abstract:
- content: "<p>PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model
    draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies procedures that can
    be used for creation and deletion of PCE- initiated LSPs under the active stateful
    PCE model. However, this specification is focused on MPLS networks, and does not
    cover remote instantiation of GMPLS paths. This document complements PCEP Extensions
    for PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model draft by addressing the extensions
    required for GMPLS applications, for example for OTN and WSON networks. When active
    stateful PCE is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP, PCC may not be aware of the
    intended usage of the LSP (e.g., in a multi-layer network). PCEP Extensions for
    PCE-initiated LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model draft does not address this requirement.
    This draft also addresses the requirement to specify on how PCC should use the
    PCEP initiated LSPs.</p>"
