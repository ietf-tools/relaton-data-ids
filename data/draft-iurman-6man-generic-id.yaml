abstract:
- content: "<p>Some recent use cases have a need for carrying an identifier in IPv6
    packets. While those drafts might perfectly make sense on their own, each document
    requires IANA to allocate a new code point for a new option, and so for very similar
    situations, which could quickly exhaust the allocation space if similar designs
    are proposed in the future. As an example, one might need an 8-bit ID, while another
    one might need a 32-bit, 64-bit or 128-bit ID. Or, even worse, one might need
    a 32-bit ID in a specific context, while someone else might also need a 32-bit
    ID in another context. Therefore, allocating a new code point for each similar
    option is probably not the way to go.</p>"
