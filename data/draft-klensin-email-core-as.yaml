abstract:
- content: "<p>Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is
    still in very active use. While the basic protocols and formats for mail transport
    and message formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and thinking in
    more recent years have supplemented those core protocols with additional features
    and suggestions for their use. This Applicability Statement describes the relationship
    among many of those protocols and provides guidance and makes recommendations
    for the use of features of the core protocols.</p>"
