abstract:
- content: "<p>Lemonade server to client notifications and filtering provides some
    extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for optimization in a mobile
    setting, aimed at delivering extended functionality for mobile devices with limited
    resources. These notifications support pushing changes actively to a client, rather
    than requiring the client to initiate contact to ask for state changes. Filtering
    allows setting and controlling which email and events are notified to or synchronized
    with the mobile client.</p>"
