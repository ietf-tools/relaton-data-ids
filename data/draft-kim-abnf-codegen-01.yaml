abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation. ABNF
    has been widely used for decades. While its popurarity is ascribed to its simplicity
    and ease of use, the demand for code generation has been fulfilled only marginally,
    by some sort of non-standard extensions, or by conversion to yet another meta
    language. One possible solution is to add more detailed specifications to the
    existing ABNF standard, but this hurts the very competitiveness of ABNF itself.
    Another solution is to standardize an extension and make it a 'sister' standard
    in parallel to the existing ABNF standaard. In this document we propose such an
    extension as a standard. The generated code using the proposed extension would
    be "complete", meaning no need to modify by hand, if there exist no concepts of
    unordered groups in the specification.</p>
