abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow selection is the process of selecting only a limited number of
    flows out of all the flows observable/observed at an IPFIX device. The selection
    can be done in the metering process, by selectively accounting only some of the
    incoming packets, in the flow recording process, by keeping only some of the created
    flow records, or in the exporting process, by exporting only some of the flow
    records of the flow recording process. This document describes the scenarios where
    flow selection can be applied, discusses what information about the flow selection
    process is beneficial to export and provides an information model for it.</p>"
