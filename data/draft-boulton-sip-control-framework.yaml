abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Framework and protocol for application deployment
    where the application logic and processing are distributed. The framework uses
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level control
    mechanism between application servers and associated external servers such as
    media servers. The motivation for the creation of this Framework is to provide
    an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a distributed, centralized conference
    system, as defined by the XCON work group of the IETF. It is not, however, limited
    to this scope and it is envisioned that this generic Framework will be used for
    a wide variety of de-coupled control architectures between network entities.</p>"
