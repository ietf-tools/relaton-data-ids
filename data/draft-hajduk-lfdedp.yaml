abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to detect link failures which relies
    solely on Ethernet data plane. An ordinary Ethernet frame can be modified and
    sent back to sender to signal a loss of connection. No control plane protocol
    is utilized in the process which makes the method very simple and fast to react.</p>"
