abstract:
- content: "<p>Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
    and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation. RFC 7344 automates this
    for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold
    the prospective DS parameters. Similarly, RFC 7477 specifies CSYNC records to
    indicate a desired update of the delegation's NS (and glue) records. Parent-side
    entities (e.g. Registries, Registrars) typically discover these records by querying
    them from the child, and then use them to update the delegation's DS RRset accordingly.
    This document specifies that when performing such queries, parent- side entities
    MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC records are consistent
    across the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on
    these records.</p>"
