abstract:
- content: "<p>When a message transport agent (MTA) finds itself permanently unable
    to deliver a mail message, it generates a new message, generally known as a bounce
    message, back to the envelope sender. Bounce messages produced by the qmail-send
    program display the list of failed recipient addresses, an explanation for each
    address, and a copy of the original message, in a format that is easy for both
    humans and programs to read. This document defines the format.</p>"
