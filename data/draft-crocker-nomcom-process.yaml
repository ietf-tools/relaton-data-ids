abstract:
- content: "<p>Every year the IETF's Nominating Committee (Nomcom) reviews and selects
    half of the IETF's leadership on the IESG, IAB and IAOC/ Trust. In the 18 years
    since the inception of the Nomcom process, the Internet industry and the IETF
    have gone through many changes in funding, participation and focus, but not in
    the basic formation, structure or operation of Nomcom. This paper explores challenges
    that have emerged in the conduct of Nomcom activities, particularly due to changing
    IETF demographics. The paper reviews the nature, causes and consequences of these
    challenges, and proposes a number of specific changes. The changes provide better
    communication of Nomcom institutional memory, enhance Nomcom membership expertise,
    and produce stronger confidentiality and etiquette practices among Nomcom participants.
    Some changes require formal modification to Nomcom rules; others can be adopted
    immediately.</p>"
