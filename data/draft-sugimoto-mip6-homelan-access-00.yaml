abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we propose to relax forwarding rule of the Mobile
    IPv6 home agent. In addition to utilizing link-local scope home address, mobile
    node may request home agent to bypass specific link- local scope multicast traffic
    which may be of its interest. The extensions allow mobile node to seamlessly access
    the home network through link-local communication. Modifications to mobility signals
    for home registration are made in order to realize the extensions. This document
    also provides a set of requirements and guidelines for target usage scenario and
    implications to Mobile IPv6 system design.</p>"
