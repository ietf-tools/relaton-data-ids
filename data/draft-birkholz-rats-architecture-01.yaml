abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS) architecture facilitates the attestation
    of device characteristics that, in general, are based on specific trustworthiness
    qualities intrinsic to a device or service. It includes trusted computing functionality
    provided by device hardware and software that allows trustworthiness qualities
    to be asserted and verified as part of, or pre-requisite to, the device's normal
    operation. The RATS architecture maps corresponding attestation functions and
    capabilities to specific RATS Roles. The goal is to enable an appropriate conveyance
    of evidence about device trustworthiness via network protocols. RATS Roles provide
    the endpoint context for understanding the various interaction semantics of the
    attestation lifecycle. The RATS architecture provides the building block concepts,
    semantics, syntax and framework for interoperable attestation while remaining
    hardware-agnostic. This flexibility is intended to address a significant variety
    of use-cases and scenarios involving interoperable attestation. Example usages
    include, but are not limited to: financial transactions, voting machines, critical
    safety systems, network equipment health, or trustworthy end-user device management.
    Existing industry attestation efforts may be helpful toward informing RATS architecture.
    Such as: Remote Integrity VERification (RIVER), the creation of Entity Attestation
    Tokens (EAT), software integrity Measurement And ATtestation (MAAT)</p>"
