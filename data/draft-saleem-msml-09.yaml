abstract:
- content: "<p>The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke
    many different types of services on IP media servers. The MSML control interface
    was initially driven by RadiSys with subsequent significant contributions from
    Intel, Dialogic, and others in the industry. Clients can use it to define how
    multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individuals
    or groups of users. MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing
    features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or
    personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams. As well, clients can
    use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application
    interactions with users or conferences. Transformation of media streams to and
    from users or conferences as well as interactive voice response (IVR) dialogs
    are examples of such interactions, which are specified using MSML. MSML clients
    may also invoke dialogs with individual users or with groups of conference participants
    using VoiceXMLThis document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
