abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extendible architecture whereby an event subscriber
    (client) may specify the rules for SIP event notification from the notifier (server).
    Potential solutions meeting the architecture specification are also provided in
    the annexes. Requirements for event filtering were previously described in [1].</p>"
