abstract:
- content: "<p>A VTN is a virtual underlay network which has customized network topology
    and a set of dedicated or shared network resources. Network Resource Partition
    (NRP) refers to a set of network resources that are available to carry traffic
    and meet the SLOs and SLEs. Multiple NRPs can be created in a network to provide
    different Virtual Transport Networks (VTN) to meet the requirements of different
    services or different service groups. As the number of NRP increases, there can
    be scalability concerns about using Interial Gateway Protocols (IGP) to distribute
    the NRP information in the network. In networks where BGP Shortest Path First
    (SPF) can used as the underlay routing mechanism to distribute the link-state
    information among network nodes, the information of NRPs needs to be distributed
    along with the basic network information. This document specifies the BGP SPF
    mechanisms with necessary extensions to distribute the NRP information and perform
    NRP-specific path computation.</p>"
