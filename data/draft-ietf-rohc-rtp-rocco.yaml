abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing header compression schemes do not work well when used over
    links with significant error rates, especially when the round-trip time of the
    link is long. For many bandwidth limited links where header compression is essential,
    such characteristics are common. A header compression framework and a highly robust
    and efficient header compression scheme is introduced in this document, adaptable
    to the characteristics of the link over which it is used and also to the properties
    of the packet streams it compresses.</p>"
