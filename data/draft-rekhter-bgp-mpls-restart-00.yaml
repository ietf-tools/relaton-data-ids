abstract:
- content: "<p>[1] describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize the negative
    effects on routing caused by BGP restart. This document extends this mechanism
    to also minimize the negative effects on MPLS forwarding when BGP is used to carry
    MPLS labels [2]. The mechanism described in this document is agnostic with respect
    to the types of the addresses carried in the BGP NLRI. As such it works in conjunction
    with any of the address famililies that could be carried in BGP (e.g., IPv4, IPv6,
    etc...)</p>"
