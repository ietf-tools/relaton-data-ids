abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new extensibility point to OAuth 2.0 which
    allows clients to identify through different methods to an authorization server
    using an identifier not assigned or managed by the authorization server. Beyond
    this general extensibility point, the specification defines one client ID scheme
    "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-id-scheme:oauth-discoverable-client", including
    the nessary rules around how the client makes its metadata available for an authorization
    server and how an authorization server can obtain this metadata without the need
    for a registration process.</p>
