abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoRE working group has proposed a Resource Directory (RD) solution
    to facilitate the discovery of the resources provided by constrained sensor and
    actuator networks. For such a mechanism to be effectively deployable, endpoints
    must first discover the existence of an RD in the network before being able to
    exploit its functionalities. This document presents Proactive RD Discovery (PRD);
    a scalable and effective mechanism to discover RDs. To achieve such qualities,
    PRD follows an announce-based model that builds upon CoAP Group Communication.
    PRD aims to provide important performance in terms of energy consumption, generated
    traffic, expressivity, and RD discovery time.</p>"
