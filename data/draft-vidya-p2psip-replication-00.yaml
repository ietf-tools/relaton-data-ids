abstract:
- content: "<p>RELOAD [1] provides successor replication of data to protect against
    data loss occurring from churn on the overlay. It specifies storing of two redundant
    copies of data on the two immediate successors of a particular node. This provides
    for basic replication and is highly essential for stability of the overlay. However,
    it does not address the problem of replication to meet the availability requirements
    for a particular piece of data or to have the replicas be useful in some inherent
    load balancing on the overlay. This document specifies a mechanism to provide
    application-agnostic, deterministic replication on the overlay to meet these needs.</p>"
