abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two application scenarios where Network Service
    Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) techniques can be deployed together to support
    Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while maintaining separation
    of the service and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.
    In the first scenario, an NSH-based SFC is created using SR as the transport between
    SFFs. SR in this case is just one of many encapsulations that could be used to
    maintain the transport- independent nature of NSH-based service chains. In the
    second scenario, SR is used to represent each service hop of the NSH-based SFC
    as a segment within the segment-list. SR and NSH in this case are integrated.
    In both scenarios SR is responsible for steering packets between SFFs along a
    given SFP while NSH is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the service
    plane, the SFC instance context, and any associated metadata. These application
    scenarios demonstrate that NSH and SR can work jointly and complement each other
    leaving the network operator with the flexibility to use whichever transport technology
    makes sense in specific areas of their network infrastructure, and still maintain
    an end-to-end service plane using NSH.</p>"
