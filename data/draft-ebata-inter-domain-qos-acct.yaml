abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, IETF has started to examine policy as a tool for managing
    and controlling the provision of QoS guaranteed services. In a multi-domain environment,
    each domain will define its own policies and manage the services according to
    its own policies. So it is natural that the policy in one domain is different
    from the policy in another domain. Therefore, this document focuses on the policy
    setup required for supporting inter-domain QoS provisioning and accounting and
    describes the policy exchange required between the domains. For supporting the
    policy exchanges, this document describes two protocols, namely 'Policy Advertisement
    Protocol (PAP)' and 'Policy Negotiation and Notification Protocol (PNP)'. PAP
    is used by a domain to advertise its service policies to other domains. PNP is
    used by a domain to request another domain to provide a QoS guaranteed service
    and for the requested domain to notify the requesting domain of the policies governing
    the charges for the services. This allows dynamic negotiation for the service
    charges based on the offered QoS.</p>"
