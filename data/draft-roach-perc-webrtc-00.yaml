abstract:
- content: '<p>The Privacy-Enhanced Realtime Conferencing (PERC) architecture defines
    a system by which multiparty conferences can be handled by a conference server
    that is "semi-trusted": that is, it is trusted to correctly handle media packets,
    but it is not trusted with the actual contents of the media streams. In order
    to use this architecture within WebRTC, we must describe how information is conveyed
    among various network functions. This document describes the information to be
    conveyed and how it is transferred.</p>'
