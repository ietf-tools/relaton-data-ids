abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the adaptation of the ISO Inter-Domain Routing
    Protocol that enables it to be used as an inter-domain routing protocol in the
    Internet that supports SIP/IPAE. IDRP with this adaptation will be called 'IDRP
    for SIP' in this document. Multiprotocol IDRP, that is, a single instance of IDRP
    that can simultaneously support Inter-Domain/Inter-Autonomous System routing for
    multiple network layer protocols (e.g. SIP, IP, CLNP) Internets is outside the
    scope of this document.</p>"
