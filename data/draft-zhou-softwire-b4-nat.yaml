abstract:
- content: "<p>Dual-Stack Lite, combining IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and Carrier Grade NAT
    technologies, provides an approach that offers IPv4 service via IPv6 network by
    sharing IPv4 addresses among customers during IPv6 transition period. Dual-stack
    lite, however, requires CGN to maintain active NAT sessions, which means processing
    performance, memory size and log abilities for NAT sessions should scale with
    number of sessions of subscribers; Hence increasing in CAPEX for operators would
    be resulted in when traffic increase. This document propose the NAT offload extensions
    to DS-Lite, which allows offloading NAT translation function from centralized
    network side (AFTR) to distributed customer equipments (B4), thereby offering
    a trade-off between CAPEX (e.g. less performance requirements on AFTR device)
    and OPEX (e.g., easy and fast deployment of Dual-Stack Lite) for operators. The
    ability of easily co-deploying with basic Dual- Stack Lite is essential to NAT
    offload extension to DS-Lite.</p>"
