abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent widescale deployments of large public Wi-Fi networks, and
    in their integration with cellular networks EAP based authentication has been
    considered as a good candidate to making Wi-Fi user experience seamless similar
    to what it has been for cellular users. A few new functions which could enhance
    CAPWAP protocol have been identified in such deployments that can help improve
    the large scale carrier grade Wi-Fi networks.</p>"
