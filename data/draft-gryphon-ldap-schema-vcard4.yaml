abstract:
- content: "<p>This document works to harmonize the vCard directory information card
    and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) standards by extending both standards
    to support a common directory card entity. Additional LDAP attributes and object
    classes, and additional properties for vCard are defined. A standard mapping process
    between the two designed to support vCard's goal of being a transport format between
    directories (not just LDAP) is defined.</p>"
