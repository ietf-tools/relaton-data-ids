abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability
    and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless
    network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other
    standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the
    wireless medium, in particular intermittently lossy connectivity. This document
    defines a network control loop that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum
    and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties, typically reliability
    and latency. The loop involves DetNet Operational Plane functions, with a new
    recovery Function and a new Point of Local Repair operation, that dynamically
    selects the DetNet path(s) for the future packets to route around local degradations
    and failures.</p>"
