abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), a
    hash-based digital signature system that is based on existing descriptions in
    scientific literature. This note specifies Winternitz One-Time Signature Plus
    (WOTS+), a one-time signature scheme; XMSS, a single-tree scheme; and XMSS^MT,
    a multi-tree variant of XMSS. Both XMSS and XMSS^MT use WOTS+ as a main building
    block. XMSS provides cryptographic digital signatures without relying on the conjectured
    hardness of mathematical problems. Instead, it is proven that it only relies on
    the properties of cryptographic hash functions. XMSS provides strong security
    guarantees and is even secure when the collision resistance of the underlying
    hash function is broken. It is suitable for compact implementations, is relatively
    simple to implement, and naturally resists side-channel attacks. Unlike most other
    signature systems, hash-based signatures can so far withstand known attacks using
    quantum computers.</p>"
