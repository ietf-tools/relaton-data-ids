abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent
    using spoofed addresses -- 'spoofed' in this case means the address is used without
    the permission of the domain owner. This document describes the following: mechanisms
    by which a domain owner can publish its set of outgoing MTAs, mechanisms by which
    SMTP servers can determine what email address is allegedly responsible for most
    proximately introducing a message into the Internet mail system, and whether that
    introduction is authorized by the owner of the domain contained in that email
    address. The specification is carefully tailored to ensure that the overwhelming
    majority of legitimate emailers, remailers and mailing list operators are already
    compliant.</p>"
