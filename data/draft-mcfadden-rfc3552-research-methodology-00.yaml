abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3552 provides guidance to authors in crafting RFC text on Security
    Considerations. The RFC is more than fifteen years old. With the threat landscape
    and security ecosystem significantly changed since the RFC was published, RFC3552
    is a candidate for update. This draft proposes that, prior to drafting an update
    to RFC3553, an examination of recent, published Security Considerations sections
    be carried out as a baseline for how to improve RFC3553. It suggests a methodology
    for examining Security Considerations sections in published RFCs and the extraction
    of both quantitative and qualitative information that could inform a revision
    of the older guidance. It also reports on a recent experiment on textual analysis
    of sixteen years of RFC Security Consideration sections.</p>"
