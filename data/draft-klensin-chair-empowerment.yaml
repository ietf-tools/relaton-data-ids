abstract:
- content: "<p>From time to time, there have been complaints about internal conflicts
    within the IESG that have retarded projects. Some IETF Chairs have expressed frustration
    about not being able to resolve the problems and several members of the community
    have expressed frustration that the Chairs cannot do so. The recall process has
    not been effective in either dealing with or deterring these problems. This document
    proposes, as a process experiment, an alternate model whose intent is to give
    the Chair some leverage on solving any such problems that may arise in the future.</p>"
