abstract:
- content: "<p>Browsers and web applications may want to know if there are one or
    more DoH servers associated with the DNS recursive resolver that the operating
    system is already using. This would allow them to get DNS responses from a resolver
    that the user (or, more likely, the user's network administrator) has already
    chosen. This document describes two protocols for a resolver to tell a client
    what its associated DoH servers are. It also describes a protocol for a client
    to find out the address of the resolver it is using, if it cannot find that address
    by an operating system API or some other means.</p>"
