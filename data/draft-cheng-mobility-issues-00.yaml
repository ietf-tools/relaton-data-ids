abstract:
- content: "<p>The draft listed out some of the issues related to IP mobility that
    may have impact on the design and implementation of the NSIS protocols. These
    issues, namely, the multiple flow support and the ping-pong type of movement,
    needs to be considered in the context of the QoS NSLP protocol design, so that
    the NSIS framework would not break when they present.</p>"
