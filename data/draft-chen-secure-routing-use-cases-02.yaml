abstract:
- content: "<p>Current routing mechanism is based on the shortest path, which only
    take the link status and the path accessibility into consideration, without the
    security of links and forwarding nodes. As security has become an important factor
    to the user. This paper proposes to add security factor in the routing process.
    With the frequent occurrence of security incidents, services security is an essential
    demand for the users. As there are many security devices in the ISP's network,
    this draft proposes secure routing mechanism. The purpose of secure routing is
    to converge security and routing to ensure the secure data transmission. The scope
    is transmission process security, while end-to-end security and application layer
    security are out of scope.</p>"
