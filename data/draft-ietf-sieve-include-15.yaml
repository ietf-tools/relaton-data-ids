abstract:
- content: <p>The Sieve Email Filtering "include" extension permits users to include
    one Sieve script inside another. This can make managing large scripts or multiple
    sets of scripts much easier, and allows a site and its users to build up libraries
    of scripts. Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide
    scripts. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
