abstract:
- content: "<p>A generic VPLS solution for E-Tree services is proposed which uses
    VLANs to indicate root/leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is illustrated
    as an example for the solution. In the solution, E- Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected
    by PWs which carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute, the MAC address based
    Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as before. A signaling
    mechanism for E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping negotiation is further described.</p>"
