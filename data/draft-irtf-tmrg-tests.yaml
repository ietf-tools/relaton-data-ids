abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial evaluation
    of proposed TCP modifications. The goal of the test suite is to allow researchers
    to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed TCP extensions in simulators and
    testbeds using a common set of well- defined, standard test cases, in order to
    compare and contrast proposals against standard TCP as well as other proposed
    modifications. This test suite is not intended to result in an exhaustive evaluation
    of a proposed TCP modification or new congestion control mechanism. Instead, the
    focus is on quickly and easily generating an initial evaluation report that allows
    the networking community to understand and discuss the behavioral aspects of a
    new proposal, in order to guide further experimentation that will be needed to
    fully investigate the specific aspects of a new proposal.</p>"
