abstract:
- content: "<p>User-Agent Display Attributes Headers provide a means for an HTTP client
    [3] and server to negotiate for content dependent on the client display capabilities.
    This memo describes feature tags for introducing this information into an HTTP
    transmission. The intent is to present resource variants when available [5] such
    that a capable server may present documents in a preferred form to a client. If
    such a preferred form is not available, the server should still provide the requested
    documents. This specification is intended as an extension to HTTP/1.1 [4], to
    be implemented using the negotiation mechanism, transparent content negotiation
    [5].</p>"
