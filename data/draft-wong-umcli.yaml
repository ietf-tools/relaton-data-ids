abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Internet Unified Messaging is to provide, over the Internet,
    a single infrastructure, mailbox, and set of interfaces for a user to get, respond
    to, and manipulate all of his or her messages from a collection of clients with
    varying capabilities, no matter what the media or source is. Towards this goal,
    this document considers what is required of Internet messaging protocols to enable
    the support of Unified Messaging on two new classes of limited capability messaging
    clients: those limited to having a telephone user interface (TUI) and those that
    can be supported by small hand-held wireless devices with simple displays such
    as cell phones with data features and wireless-enabled PDAs (WUI). Included in
    the discussion is also a list of general principles to guide the design of Unified
    Messaging protocols. Discussion of this and related drafts are on the UM list.
