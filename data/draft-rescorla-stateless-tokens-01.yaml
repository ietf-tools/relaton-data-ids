abstract:
- content: "<p>A common protocol problem is to want to arrange to maintain client
    state with little or no local storage. The usual design pattern here is to provide
    the client with a token which is returned with subsequent interactions. In order
    to prevent tampering, forgery, and privacy issues, such tokens should be cryptographically
    protected. This draft describes one workable mechanism for constructing such tokens.</p>"
