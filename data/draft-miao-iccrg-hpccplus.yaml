abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,
    high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks. However, the existing
    high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations for reaching these goals. In this
    document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion Control), a new high-speed
    CC mechanism which achieves the three goals simultaneously. HPCC++ leverages inband
    telemetry to obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely.
    By addressing challenges such as delayed signaling during congestion and overreaction
    to the congestion signaling using inband and granular telemetry, HPCC++ can quickly
    converge to utilize all the available bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and
    can maintain near-zero in- network queues for ultra-low latency. HPCC++ is also
    fair and easy to deploy in hardware, implementable with commodity NICs and switches.</p>"
