abstract:
- content: "<p>Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is a network-based function, which is
    under MPTCP architecture. It can help two MPTCP-unaware hosts enjoy multipath
    support, and can be extensively used both in the access networks and operators'
    networks. Meanwhile, in MPTCP architecture with TMPP, TMPP needs to modify the
    received packets and transmit them again(just like gateway in NAT environment).
    In this document, we also discuss the guarantee for data transfer on TMPP's side.
    The consideration of data transfer can be expanded to the MPTCP architecture with
    proxy.</p>"
