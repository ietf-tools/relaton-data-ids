abstract:
- content: "<p>Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for
    emergency call routing. However, there are situations in which a location provider
    is unable or unwilling to provide precise location, yet still wishes to enable
    subscribers to make emergency calls. This document describes the level of location
    accuracy that providers must provide to enable emergency call routing. In addition,
    we describe additional rules for networks and endpoints to enable emergency calling
    by endpoints that do not have access to precise location.</p>"
