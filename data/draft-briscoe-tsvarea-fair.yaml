abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource allocation and accountability have been major unresolved problems
    with the Internet ever since its inception. The reason we never resolve these
    issues is a broken idea of what the problem is. The applied research and standards
    communities are using completely unrealistic and impractical fairness criteria.
    The resulting mechanisms don't even allocate the right thing and they don't allocate
    it between the right entities. We explain as bluntly as we can that thinking about
    fairness mechanisms like TCP in terms of sharing out flow rates has no intellectual
    heritage from any concept of fairness in philosophy or social science, or indeed
    real life. Comparing flow rates should never again be used for claims of fairness
    in production networks. Instead, we should judge fairness mechanisms on how they
    share out the `cost' of each user's actions on others.</p>"
