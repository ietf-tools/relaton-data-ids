abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a SIP Event Package "kpml" that enables monitoring
    of Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals and uses Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) documents referred to as Key Press Markup Language (KPML). The kpml Event
    Package may be used to support applications consistent with the principles defined
    in the document titled "A Framework for Application Interaction in the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP)". The event package uses SUBSCRIBE messages and allows
    for XML documents that define and describe filter specifications for capturing
    key presses (DTMF Tones) entered at a presentation-free User Interface SIP User
    Agent (UA). The event package uses NOTIFY messages and allows for XML documents
    to report the captured key presses (DTMF tones), consistent with the filter specifications,
    to an Application Server. The scope of this package is for collecting supplemental
    key presses or mid-call key presses (triggers). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
