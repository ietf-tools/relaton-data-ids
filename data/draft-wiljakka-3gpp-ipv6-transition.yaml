abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes making the transition to IPv6 in Third Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) packet networks.
    The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios, applicable transition
    mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios. In these scenarios,
    the User Equipment (UE) connects to nodes in other networks, e.g. in the Internet,
    and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed.</p>"
