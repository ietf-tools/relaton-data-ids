abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents RISAV, a protocol for establishing and using
    IPsec security between Autonomous Systems (ASes) using the RPKI identity system.
    In this protocol, the originating AS adds authenticating information to each outgoing
    packet at its Border Routers (ASBRs), and the receiving AS verifies and strips
    this information at its ASBRs. Packets that fail validation are dropped by the
    ASBR. RISAV achieves Source Address Validation among all participating ASes.</p>"
