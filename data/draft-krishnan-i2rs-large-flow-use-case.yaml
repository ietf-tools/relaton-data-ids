abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses two use cases to help identify the requirements
    for policy-based routing in I2RS. Both of the use cases involve identification
    of certain flows and then using I2RS to program routers with special handling
    for those flows. The first use case deals with improving bandwidth efficiency.
    Demands on networking bandwidth are growing exponentially due to applications
    such as large file transfers and those with rich media. Link Aggregation Group
    (LAG) and Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) are extensively deployed in networks to
    scale the bandwidth. However, the static hash-based load balancing techniques
    used today make inefficient use of the bandwidth in the presence of long-lived
    large flows. We discuss how I2RS can be used for achieving better load balancing.
    The second use case is for recognizing and mitigating Layer 3-4 based DDoS attacks.
    Behavioral security threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
    are an ongoing problem in today's networks. DDoS attacks can be Layer 3-4 based
    or Layer 7 based. We discuss how such attacks can be recognized and how I2RS can
    be used for mitigating their effects.</p>"
