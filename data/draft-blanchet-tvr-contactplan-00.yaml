abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks, such as in space, have links that are up and down based
    on a known schedule. The links characteristics, such as latency and bandwidth,
    are often also known in advance. This document describes a data model, also known
    as contact plan or graph, and file format to be used as input to forwarding and
    routing engines. This specification applies for both IP and Bundle Protocol.</p>"
