abstract:
- content: "<p>Content distribution prevails in today's Internet and Content-Centric
    Networking (CCN) proposes to access the data directly by their content instead
    of their location. In this memo we present a LISP based solution to interconnect
    CCN routers over the Internet. We first describe how content names can be encoded
    in LISP with LCAF. We then detail the operations of CCN routers to determine the
    CCN routers to which forward Interest and Data messages.</p>"
