abstract:
- content: "<p>This note presents Lightweight Fair Queueing (LFQ), a fair queueing
    algorithm with a small code footprint, low memory requirements, no multiply operations,
    only two physical queues, and only one set of AQM state. LFQ provides throughput
    fairness, sparse flow prioritization and ordering guarantees, making it suitable
    for a mixture of traffic flow types.</p>"
