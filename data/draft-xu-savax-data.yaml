abstract:
- content: "<p>Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination
    address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection of the source
    address and malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses.
    The inter-domain source address validation architecture is an effort to enhance
    the Internet by using state machine to generate consistent tags. When communicating
    between two end hosts at different ADs of IPv6 network, tags will be added to
    the packets to identify the authenticity of the IPv6 source address. This memo
    focus on the data plane of the SAVA-X mechanism.</p>"
