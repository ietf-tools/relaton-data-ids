abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a symmetric key format for transport and provisioning
    of symmetric keys (for example One Time Password (OTP) shared secrets or symmetric
    cryptographic keys) to different types of crypto modules such as a strong authentication
    device. The standard key transport format enables enterprises to deploy best-of-breed
    solutions combining components from different vendors into the same infrastructure.
    This work is based on earlier work by the members of OATH (Initiative for Open
    AuTHentication) to specify a format that can be freely distributed to the technical
    community. The authors believe that a common and shared specification will facilitate
    adoption of two- factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability
    between commercial and open-source implementations.</p>"
