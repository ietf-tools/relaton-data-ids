abstract:
- content: <p>The "Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)" workshop was
    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from December 3-5, 2024, as
    a three-day online meeting. It builds on a previous 2002 workshop, the outcome
    of which was documented in RFC 3535, identifying 14 operator requirements for
    consideration in future network management protocol design and related data models,
    along with some recommendations for the IETF. Much has changed in the Internetâ€™s
    operation and technological foundations since then. The NEMOPS workshop reviewed
    the past outcomes and discussed any operational barriers that prevented these
    technologies from being widely implemented. With the industry, network operators
    and protocol engineers working in collaboration, the workshop developed a suggested
    plan of action and network management recommendations for the IETF and IRTF. Building
    on RFC 3535, this document provides the report of the follow-up IAB workshop on
    Network Management. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of
    the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of the
    workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</p>
