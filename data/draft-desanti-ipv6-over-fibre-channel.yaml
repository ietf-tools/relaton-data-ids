abstract:
- content: "<p>Fibre Channel (FC) is a high speed serial interface technology that
    supports several higher layer protocols including Small Computer System Interface
    (SCSI) and IPv4, as specified in [IP-FC]. The purpose of this document is to specify
    a way of encapsulating IP version 6 [IPv6] over Fibre Channel and to describe
    a method of forming IPv6 link-local addresses [AARCH] and statelessly autoconfigured
    addresses on Fibre Channel networks. This document also describes the content
    of the Source/Target Link-layer Address option used in Neighbor Discovery [DISC]
    when the messages are transmitted on a Fibre Channel network.</p>"
