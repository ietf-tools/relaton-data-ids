abstract:
- content: "<p>The Link Management Protocol (LMP) has been developed as part of the
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocol suite to manage Traffic Engineering (TE) resources
    and links. The GMPLS control plane (routing and signaling) uses TE links for establishing
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This memo describes the relationship of the LMP procedures
    to 'discovery' as defined in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T),
    and ongoing ITU-T work. This document provides an overview of LMP in the context
    of the ITU-T Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) and transport network
    terminology and relates it to the ITU-T discovery work to promote a common understanding
    for progressing the work of IETF and ITU-T. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
