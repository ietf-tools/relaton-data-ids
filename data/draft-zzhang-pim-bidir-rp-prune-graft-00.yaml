abstract:
- content: "<p>In a BIDIR-PIM network, data packets could be forwarded from the source
    to the RP and then get dropped there because there is no receiver on the other
    side of the distribution tree. This document specifies a way to prune the unnecessary
    traffic with minimum additional states and procedures.</p>"
