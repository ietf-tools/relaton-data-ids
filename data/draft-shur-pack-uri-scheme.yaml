abstract:
- content: <p>A package is a logical entity that holds a collection of parts. Given
    the URI for a complete package, the "pack" URI scheme provides for the construction
    and use of URIs referring to individual parts within the package. It also provides
    for the use of part's URIs as base URIs for resolving relative references between
    the parts in a single package.</p>
