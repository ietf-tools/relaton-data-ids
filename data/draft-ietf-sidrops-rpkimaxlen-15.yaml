abstract:
- content: <p>This document recommends ways to reduce the forged-origin hijack attack
    surface by prudently limiting the set of IP prefixes that are included in a Route
    Origin Authorization (ROA). One recommendation is to avoid using the maxLength
    attribute in ROAs except in some specific cases. The recommendations complement
    and extend those in RFC 7115. The document also discusses the creation of ROAs
    for facilitating the use of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services.
    Considerations related to ROAs and origin validation in the context of destination-based
    Remotely Triggered Discard Route (RTDR) (elsewhere referred to as "Remotely Triggered
    Black Hole") filtering are also highlighted.</p>
