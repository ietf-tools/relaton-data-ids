abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an architectural framework for a wide variety of
    Internet signaling protocols. This framework has a two-level organization: a common
    lower layer 'transport' protocol together with a suite of upper-level signaling
    protocols. The common lower level protocol CSTP (Common Signaling Transport Protocol)
    provides a transport-like service that may include reliable delivery and soft
    state management. The upper layer protocols, which implement algorithms and data
    structures specific to particular signaling applications, are generically called
    ULSPs (Upper-layer Signaling Protocols). This memo motivates the two-level design
    and describes the service model, API, and operation of the lower level CSTP.</p>"
