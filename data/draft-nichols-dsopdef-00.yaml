abstract:
- content: "<p>Differentiated services are intended to provide scalable service discrimination
    in the Internet without the need for per-flow state and signaling at every hop.
    The differentiated services approach to providing quality of service in networks
    employs a small, well- defined set of building blocks from which a variety of
    services may be built. The services may be either end-to-end or intra-domain.
    A wide range of services can be provided by a combination of: - setting bits in
    the TOS octet at network edges and administrative boundaries, - using those bits
    to determine how packets are treated by the routers inside the network, and -
    conditioning the marked packets at network boundaries in accordance with the requirements
    of each service. A differentiated-services-capable network node includes a classifier
    that selects packets based on the TOS octet and is capable of delivering the treatment
    corresponding to that marking of the TOS octet. Setting of the TOS octet and other
    conditioning of the dynamic behavior of marked packets need only be performed
    at network boundaries and may vary in complexity. This draft presents a differentiated
    services definition of the TOS octet and the operational model behind that definition.</p>"
