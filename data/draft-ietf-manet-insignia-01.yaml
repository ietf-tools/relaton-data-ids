abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system for supporting
    quality of service (QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. The term `in-band signaling`
    refers to the fact that control information is carried along with data in IP packets.
    We argue that in-band signaling is more suitable than explicit out-of-band approaches
    (e.g., RSVP) when supporting end-to-end quality of service in highly dynamic environments
    such as mobile ad hoc networks where network topology, node connectivity and end-to-end
    quality of service are strongly time-varying. INSIGNIA is designed to support
    the delivery of adaptive real-time services and includes fast session/flow/microflow
    reservation, restoration and adaptation algorithms between source/destination
    pairs. In this memo we discuss how INSIGNIA fits into our broader vision of a
    wireless flow management model for mobile ad hoc networks and how it interfaces
    to the proposed MANET Working Group routing algorithm.</p>"
