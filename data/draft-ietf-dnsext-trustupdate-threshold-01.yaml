abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) works by validating so called
    chains of authority. The start of these chains of authority are usually public
    keys that are anchored in the DNS clients. These keys are known as the so called
    trust anchors. This memo describes a method how these client trust anchors can
    be replaced using the DNS validation and querying mechanisms (in-band) when the
    key pairs used for signing by zone owner are rolled. This memo also describes
    a method to establish the validity of trust anchors for initial configuration,
    or priming, using out of band mechanisms.</p>"
