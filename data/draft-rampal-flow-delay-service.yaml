abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to illustrate when and how flow aggregation
    can be of benefit in the context of the Guaranteed Service. Specifically, it identifies
    simple cases and provides generic rules for when grouping of flows allows a reduction
    in the amount of resources (bandwidth) needed to ensure the deterministic Guaranteed
    Service delay bounds of all flows. The benefits of grouping should be especially
    of interest to, say, Internet Service Providers, wishing to interconnect sites
    with Guaranteed Service flows. In particular, this document shows that in the
    case of flows with identical traffic characteristics and requirements, e.g., Internet
    voice, grouping of flows is ALWAYS beneficial. This technique is not intended
    for IETF standardization and is being submitted for informational purposes only.</p>"
