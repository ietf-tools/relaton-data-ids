abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight web transfer
    protocol designed to be used in constrained environments. Transport layer security
    for CoAP has been addressed with a DTLS binding for CoAP. This document describes
    a generic and dynamic access control framework suitable for constrained devices
    e.g. using CoAP and DTLS. The framework builds on well known paradigms for access
    control, externalizing authorization decision making to unconstrained nodes while
    performing authorization decision enforcement and verification of local conditions
    in constrained devices.</p>"
