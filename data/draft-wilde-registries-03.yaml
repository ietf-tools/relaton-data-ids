abstract:
- content: "<p>Registries for Internet and Web protocols fulfill a wide range of tasks,
    ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type identifiers, all
    the way up to application-level protocols and standards. This document summarizes
    some of the reasons of why, when, and how to use registries. It serves as an informative
    reference for specification writers considering whether to create and manage a
    registry, allowing them to better understand some of the issues associated with
    certain design and operational decisions.</p>"
