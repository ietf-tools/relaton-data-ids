abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a model for discussing metadata in ForCES.
    It defines multiple kinds of metadata, and shows which ones are in scope for ForCES,
    and which ones are out of scope for ForCES. It further defines a vocabulary for
    discussing metadata, which should help to avoid much of the historical confusion
    and disagreement surrounding discussions of metadata.</p>"
