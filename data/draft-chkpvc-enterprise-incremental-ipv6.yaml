abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise network administrators worldwide are in various stages of
    preparing for or deploying IPv6 into their networks. The administrators face different
    challenges than operators of Internet access providers, and have reasons for different
    priorities. The overall problem for many administrators will be to offer Internet-
    facing services over IPv6, while continuing to support IPv4, and while introducing
    IPv6 access within the enterprise IT network. The overall transition will take
    most networks from an IPv4-only environment to a dual stack network environment
    and potentially an IPv6-only operating mode. This document helps provide a framework
    for enterprise network architects or administrators who may be faced with many
    of these challenges as they consider their IPv6 support strategies.</p>"
