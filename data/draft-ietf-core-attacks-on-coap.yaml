abstract:
- content: "<p>Being able to securely read information from sensors, to securely control
    actuators, and to not enable distributed denial-of-service attacks are essential
    in a world of connected and networking things interacting with the physical world.
    Using a security protocol such as DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE to protect CoAP is a requirement
    for secure operation and protects against many attacks. This document summarizes
    a number of known attacks on CoAP deployments and show that just using CoAP with
    a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not always enough for secure
    operation. Several of the discussed attacks can be mitigated with a security protocol
    such as DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE providing confidentiality and integrity combined
    with the solutions in RFC 9175.</p>"
