abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to define IPv6 Multicast Id ranges
    that will not allow overlap between dynamically assigned global scoped addresses
    and dynamically assigned non-global scoped addresses, specifically dynamically
    assigned link-local scoped addresses. [RFC3307] defines IPv6 Multicast Group ID
    ranges for the following Permanent Addresses, Permanent Identifiers and Dynamic
    Addresses. However, there are certain multicast addresses that need to be assigned
    for closed systems that should not collide with the Group IDs used within the
    Internet. This document further defines the Dynamic Addresses into two ranges
    Dynamically Assigned Global (DAG) addresses and Dynamically Assigned Non-Global
    (DANG) addresses. The DANG range is further broken down to Dynamically Assigned
    Link-Local (DALL) addresses and the rest reserved for future. Future uses might
    be for Site-Local Scoped and Organization Scoped ranges. The DALL range may be
    used to simplify the design of MLD Snooping layer 2 switches. [RFC3171] defines
    the Local Network Control Block address range for IPv4. A similar range should
    be defined to possibly simplify the design of MLD Snooping layer 2 switches.</p>"
