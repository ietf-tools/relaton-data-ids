abstract:
- content: "<p>Energy-efficient network management is primary meant to enhance conventional
    network management with energy-related management capabilities to optimize the
    overall energy consumption at the level of a network. To that aim, specific features
    and capabilities are required to control (and thus optimize) the energy use of
    involved network element and their components. This document is defines a set
    of key terms used within the IETF when discussing energy efficiency in network
    management. Such reference document helps framing discussion and agreeing upon
    a set of main concepts in this area.</p>"
