abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 does not allow a mobile node to hide its location from
    a correspondent node without compromising optimized routing. Hence, a mobile node
    has the choice: it can either get location privacy support or short packet delay,
    but not both at the same time. This document discusses the problem of achieving
    both simultaneously and specifies a solution. The solution utilizes the Mobile
    IPv6 bootstrapping mechanisms and does neither introduce new network entities
    nor changes to home agent or correspondent node implementations.</p>"
