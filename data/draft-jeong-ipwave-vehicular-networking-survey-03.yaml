abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys the IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered
    a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main topics of
    vehicular networking are vehicle-to- vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure- to-vehicle (I2V) networking. This document deals with
    some critical aspects in vehicular networking, such as IP address autoconfiguration,
    vehicular network architecture, routing, mobility management, and security. This
    document also surveys standard activities for vehicular networks. Finally, this
    document summarizes and analyzes the previous research activities that use IPv4
    or IPv6 for vehicular networking.</p>"
