abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to take advantage of the IP Security Architecture [Atk95],
    an application should be able to tell the system what IP-layer security services
    it needs to function with some degree of confidence. A simple API that also allows
    simple security association policy to be set is presented here. This document
    descends from earlier work performed in the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory's
    IPv6 and IP security implementation [AMPMC96].</p>"
