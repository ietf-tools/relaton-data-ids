abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the incorporation of a Reject message to ICMP
    to improve a server’s ability for controlling TCP connection requests during periods
    of overload beyond dropping them. The Reject message serves two purposes: (1)
    it can inform a connecting host (the client) to completely abort the connection
    attempt as if a connection timeout has expired, and (2) modify the retransmission
    timeout interval to reduce the client’s wait times and also to break the re-synchronization
    of connection requests when multiple SYN packets are dropped. Introducing an additional
    ICMP message, as opposed to modifying the behavior of TCP, was motivated by the
    need for backward compatibility (i.e., a host can ignore the ICMP Reject message
    without affecting the behavior of TCP) and incremental deployment.</p>"
