abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Internet engineering ecosystem, there is increasingly a need
    for specifications that evolve over time, and are encoded directly in structured
    formats (e.g., YANG models). Internet-Drafts are a poor fit for working groups
    that want to produce structured specifications, and publishing versions of an
    evolving specification as RFC makes it difficult to track the specification over
    time. This document outlines recommendations for how working groups can provide
    semantic versioning for, and work directly on, structured documents while still
    fitting within established IETF processes.</p>"
