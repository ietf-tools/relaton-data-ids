abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the export of aggregated Flow information using
    IPFIX. An aggregated Flow is essentially an IPFIX Flow with an externally imposed
    time interval, generally representing packets from one or more original Flows.
    The document describes aggregated Flow export within the framework of IPFIX Mediators,
    defines an interoperable, implementation-independent method for aggregated Flow
    export, covering time interval export, counter distribution and export, and counting
    of original Flows.</p>"
