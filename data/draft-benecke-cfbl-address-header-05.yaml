abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method that allows an email sender to specify
    a complaint feedback loop (FBL) address as an email header. Also it defines the
    rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation for this
    arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide mailbox
    providers with an address for a complaint feedback loop. Currently, providing
    and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for email
    senders and providers. It is unclear, at the time of publication, whether the
    function provided by this document has widespread demand, and whether the mechanism
    offered will be adopted and found to be useful. Therefore, this is being published
    as an Experiment, looking for a constituency of implementers and deployers, and
    for feedback on the operational utility. The document is produced through the
    Independent RFC stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process.</p>"
