abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE).
    This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts
    for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including
    one that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key and two optional ones that
    authenticate possession of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) private key. HPKE
    works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF),
    and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function.
    Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations
    of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve
    Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF),
    and SHA2. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)
    in the IRTF.</p>"
