abstract:
- content: "<p>Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)
    permits a client and a Kerberos Domain Controller (KDC) to use a Diffie-Hellman
    (DH) exchange to derive an encryption key. The group with minimum modulus size
    permitted for this exchange is 1024 bits, which recent security research has shown
    to provide insufficient protection against organizations with sufficient computing
    resources, such as state-sponsored actors. This document updates RFC 4556 to increase
    the minimum group size to 2048 bits and define permitted groups of size larger
    than 4096-bits.</p>"
