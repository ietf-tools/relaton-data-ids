abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines a cryptographically secure mechanism for Certificate
    Authorities (CAs) and other self-signed trust anchors to perform controlled self-revocation
    upon compromise detection. This addresses a fundamental architectural paradox
    in current internet infrastructure: self-signed trust anchors (PKI Root CAs, DNSSEC
    KSKs, Code Signing Roots, Government PKIs, Industrial Control System CAs, Mobile
    Platform Roots, and Critical Infrastructure Trust Anchors) cannot be cryptographically
    revoked because any revocation mechanism requires the anchor''s private key, but
    if attackers possess that key (the primary threat), they control the revocation
    process. This specification solves this 25-year-old "unsolvable" problem by making
    attackers inadvertently help terminate their own attacks. The mechanism provides
    automated detection with mandatory manual authorization, enabling trust anchor
    operators to terminate anchor validity within hours instead of months while maintaining
    strict dual-person control. This addresses fundamental architectural limitations
    exposed by historical incidents such as the DigiNotar compromise in 2011 and Symantec
    certificate missuance incidents, where extended cleanup periods affected millions
    of users globally, as well as theoretical compromise scenarios affecting DNSSEC,
    government PKI, industrial control systems, and other critical infrastructure
    trust anchors.</p>'
