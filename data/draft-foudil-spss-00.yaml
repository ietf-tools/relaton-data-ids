abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a way of standardising the structure, language,
    and grammar used in security policies. The goal is to reduce ambiguity and confusion
    that stems from poorly-worded security policies. Organisations and individuals
    can refer back to this document if their security policy uses definitions found
    in this document.</p>"
