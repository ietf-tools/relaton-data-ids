abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo updates and replaces RFC 2140's description of interdependent
    TCP control blocks, in which part of the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent
    or consecutive connections. TCP state includes a combination of parameters, such
    as connection state, current round-trip time estimates, congestion control information,
    and process information. Most of this state is maintained on a per-connection
    basis in the TCP Control Block (TCB), but implementations can (and do) share certain
    TCB information across connections to the same host. Such sharing is intended
    to improve overall transient transport performance, while maintaining backward-compatibility
    with existing implementations. The sharing described herein is limited to only
    the TCB initialization and so has no effect on the long-term behavior of TCP after
    a connection has been established.</p>"
