abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to engineer paths for IP multicast
    traffic in a network, by directing the control messages to setup multicast trees
    on engineered paths. This enables the network operator to have control over the
    topology of multicast trees. This proposal partitions the multicast traffic engineering
    problem such that multicast routing protocols do not have to be modified to allocate
    resources for multicast traffic nor do resource allocation protocols such as RSVP
    or CR-LDP have to be able to setup forwarding states (in this case labels) like
    multicast routing protocols. Resources are allocated on the same trip that paths
    are selected and setup. This prevent the problem of data being forwarded on branches
    of the tree where resources have not being allocated yet. An important aspect
    of this proposal is that it enables multicast paths to be engineered in an aggregatable
    manner, allowing this solution to scale in the backbone.</p>"
