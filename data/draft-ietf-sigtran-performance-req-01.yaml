abstract:
- content: "<p>This document serves as input into the IETF SIGTRAN requirements process.
    It includes call setup delay requirements, derived from relevant ISDN and SS7
    standards published by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union--Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector) and generic requirements published by Telcordia Technologies
    (formerly Bellcore). To gain user acceptance of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services
    and to enable interoperability between Switched Circuit Networks (SCNs) and VoIP
    systems, it is imperative that the VoIP signaling performance be comparable to
    that of the current SCNs. The requirements given in this Internet Draft are intended
    to be the worst-case requirements, for at least in the United States SCN calls
    are typically set up at a faster speed than the derived requirements. At the end
    of the draft, several VoIP call connection scenarios based on the latest megaco
    protocol are analyzed and compared with similar cases in the PSTN. It indicates
    the PDD performance of VoIP systems is somewhat worst but not by much. An improvement
    in some network element can bring VoIP systems to have comparable PDD performance
    as the PSTN.</p>"
