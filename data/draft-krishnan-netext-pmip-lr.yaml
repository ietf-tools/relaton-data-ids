abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management protocol
    that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any
    mobility-related signaling. PMIPv6 requires all communications to go through the
    local mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, localized routing allows mobile
    nodes attached to the same or different mobile access gateways to exchange traffic
    by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways. This document
    proposes an initiation mechanism for localized routing.</p>"
