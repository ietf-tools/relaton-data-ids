abstract:
- content: "<p>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways. One of the most costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and router vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected
    RIB entries into the FIB. This document specifies two styles of FIB suppression.
    Edge suppression (ES) allows ISPs that deploy a core- edge topology to shrink
    the FIBs of their edge routers, including those that interface to other ISPs and
    exchange the full DFRT. Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs
    of any and all routers. Both styles may be deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation
    between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</p>"
