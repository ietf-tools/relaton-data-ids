abstract:
- content: "<p>In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to
    support 1+1 and 1:n linear protection for p2mp connectivity. The requirement was
    descirbled in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document(RFC 6372). The basic protocol
    for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear Protection document
    [RFC 6378] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection for p2p connectivity. in addtion,
    The 1:N protection in which all of working transport paths and the protection
    path have the same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N protection document(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This
    document applies the existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection)
    to support scenarios of protecting the p2mp path by extending the existing p2p
    linear protection mechanism. . This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within
    the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
