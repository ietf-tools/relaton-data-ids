abstract:
- content: "<p>Neither the Kerberos V5 protocol [RFC1510] nor the Kerberos V4 proto-
    col [RFC????] describe any mechanism for clients to learn critical configuration
    information necessary for proper operation of the pro- tocol. Such information
    includes the location of Kerberos key dis- tribution centers or a mapping between
    DNS domains and Kerberos realms. Current Kerberos implementations generally store
    such configuration information in a file on each client machine. Experience has
    shown this method of storing configuration information presents problems with
    out-of-date information and scaling problems, especially when using cross-realm
    authentication. This memo describes a method for using the Domain Name System
    [RFC1035] for storing such configuration information. Specifically, methods for
    storing KDC location and hostname/domain name to realm mapping information are
    discussed.</p>"
