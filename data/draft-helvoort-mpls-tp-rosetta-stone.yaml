abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS-TP is based on a profile of the MPLS and PW procedures as specified
    in the MPLS-TE and (MS-)PW architectures developed by the IETF. The ITU-T has
    specified a Transport Network architecture. This document provides a thesaurus
    for the interpretation of MPLS-TP terminology within the context of the ITU-T
    Transport Network recommendations. It is important to note that MPLS-TP is applicable
    in a wider set of contexts than just Transport Networks. The definitions presented
    in this document do not provide exclusive nor complete interpretations of MPLS-TP
    concepts. This document simply allows the MPLS-TP terms to be applied within the
    Transport Network context.</p>"
