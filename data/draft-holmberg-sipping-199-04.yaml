abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog
    Terminated, which a SIP entity can use to indicate upstream that an early dialog
    has been terminated. The response code can be used by a SIP entity, normally a
    forking SIP proxy, to allow the UAC to know that an early dialog has been terminated
    before it a final response is sent to the request.</p>"
