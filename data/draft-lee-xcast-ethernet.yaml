abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit multicast(Xcast)[XCST] is a new kind of Internet multicast
    and complements the Host Group Model multicast in the sense of multicast benefits.
    Xcast encodes addresses of destinations within its packet and requires neither
    any routing information exchange nor state management. Xcast routing utilizes
    legacy unicast routing information managed at every node and is expected to have
    performance good enough for small size multicast groups.</p>"
