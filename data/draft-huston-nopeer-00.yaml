abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use of a scope control BGP community. This
    new well-known advisory transitive community is intended to allow an origin AS
    to specify the extent to which a specific route should be externally propagated.
    In particular this community, termed here as NOPEER, allows the origin AS to specify
    that a route with this attribute need not be advertised across bilateral peer
    connections.</p>"
