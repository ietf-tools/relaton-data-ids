abstract:
- content: "<p>As the cloud and computing migrates to edges further away from the
    traditional centered cloud, the services residing at the distributed cloud start
    to be delivered in such a ubiquitous and dynamic way. That it is challenging to
    the ongoing routing and interconnecting scheme under which host address is the
    global networking identification. This draft proposes a service identification
    which is designed to be treated both as a service routable ID and an interface
    to the service requirements as well as service-associated cloud resources. A SAN
    header which including the service identification is illustrated and specified.</p>"
