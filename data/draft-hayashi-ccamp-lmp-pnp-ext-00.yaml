abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane (c-plane)
    is expected to reduce operational expenditure (OPEX). Currently we need to, however,
    manually configure interface addresses of links before we advertise the link-state
    using a GMPLS routing protocol for an automatic topology discovery mechanism.
    Especially in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, there are a number
    of optical fibers between neighbor nodes, each of which again carries a bunch
    of wavelength links. It is a tedious task to configure interface addresses of
    wavelength links between neighbor nodes. In order to suppress the tasks of configuring
    addresses of wavelength links between neighbor nodes, an optical plug and play
    (PnP) technique is effective. Optical PnP includes automatic assignment of interface
    addresses, parameter information exchange between neighbor nodes, database construction,
    and so on. This document assumes to use extended version of LMP (link management
    protocol) for information exchange and describes LMP extension necessary for applying
    to the optical PnP.</p>"
