abstract:
- content: "<p>ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core-
    Edge Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problem can tunnel
    packets from an ITR to an ETR. EAF involves using 31 bits of the IPv4 header for
    new purposes: bit 48, the More Fragments flag, the Fragment Offset field and the
    Header Checksum field - to carry a 30 bit ETR address. Consequently, packets in
    this format need to be handled by routers with upgraded functionality. EAF is
    an alternative to encapsulation and has advantages including: simpler ITRs and
    ETRs, direct support for conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD, no encapsulation overhead
    and full compatibility with IPsec AH and Traceroute. This I-D also briefly explores
    an alternative to this approach: a new header, of the same length and different,
    with a different 4 bit Version, to carry 31 bits of ETR address.</p>"
