abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer's issue, it is not easy to
    mandate all the applications in the host to change in the first place, the network
    layer may have to have a solution to support the conventional IPv4 appliations
    during the IPv6 migration such as in the dual stack or IPv6 only network, especially
    when multiple applications need to be supported. This document describes a mechanism
    for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technology which could guarantee IPv4
    application backward compatibility. Applications need not necessarily to understand
    what the network connection and the destination's IP family type are. A well-known
    prefix could be used when the destination is public IPv4 Internet's address.</p>"
