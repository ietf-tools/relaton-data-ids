abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion
    issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of the original
    IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for Easy IPv4), discusses the
    IPv4 public address pool expansion and the Internet system architecture enhancement
    aspects. It was originated by a study called ExIP (Extended IPv4) analyzing the
    use of the first available octet (eight bits) in the reserved private network
    pools (10/8, 172.16/12 and 192.168/16) to achieve a moderate address space expansion
    factor of 256 by each, while maintaining their familiar operation characteristics.
    Along the way, a parallel yet similar effort, called EnIP (Enhanced IPv4), was
    discovered. EnIP fully utilizes the same private network pools to increase the
    address space by a factor of 17.1M with end-to-end connectivity. EzIP is a superset
    that proposes one unified format for not only encompassing the considerations
    of both, but also identifying additional capabilities and flexibilities. For example,
    the EzIP may expand an IPv4 address at least by a factor of 256 to as high as
    256M without affecting the existing IPv4 public address assignments, and even
    keeping the current private networks intact for the 256M case. The EzIP is in
    full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only both categories
    of connectivity, but also their interoperability. The traditional Internet traffic
    and the IoT (Internet of Things) operations may coexist simultaneously without
    perturbing their existing setups, while offering end-users the freedom to choose
    one or the other. If the IPv4 public pool were reorganized, the assignable pool
    could be multiplied by 512M or even up to 2B times with end-to-end connectivity.
    The EzIP may be implemented as a software / firmware enhancement to the Internet
    edge routers or private network gateways wherever needed, or simply installed
    as an inline adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless introduction.
    The 256M case establishes a spherical layer of routers providing a complete interconnection
    between the Internet and end- users. This configuration enables the entire current
    IPv4 based Internet and private networks characteristics to remain intact. Under
    the Dual-Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities would relieve the
    IPv4 address shortage issue, while afford IPv6 more time to orderly reach the
    maturity and the availability levels required for delivering a long-term general
    service.</p>"
