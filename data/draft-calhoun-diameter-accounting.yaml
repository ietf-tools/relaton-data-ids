abstract:
- content: "<p>The DIAMETER protocol provides Authentication and Authorization for
    network access technologies, such as NASREQ, ROAMOPS and Mobile IP. The ROAMOPS
    WG has been working on an accounting data format, called Accounting Data Interchange
    Format (ADIF), as a method to transfer accounting information over a wide variety
    of transports. This extension describes how accounting records can be securely
    transmitted over the DIAMETER protocol. When combined with the Strong Security
    extension, accounting records MAY traverse intermediate proxies in a secure fashion
    and is compatible with the referral broker model. This extension allows for both
    real-time and batched accounting transfers.</p>"
