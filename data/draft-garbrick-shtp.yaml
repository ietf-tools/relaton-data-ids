- content: "<p>This document describes HTTPX, a protocol for providing access to materials
    that may be objectionable or that have age or locale-based restrictions, while
    providing a simple method to filter such content where required. HTTPX uses the
    protocol HTTP 1.1 ([RFC 2068]), with the single exception of designating a separate
    range of TCP and UDP port numbers that are allocated to a specific content type.</p>"
