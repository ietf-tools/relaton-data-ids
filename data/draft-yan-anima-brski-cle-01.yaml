abstract:
- content: "<p>The Class 1 constrained IoT devices, defined in RFC7228, may be unable
    to use certificates within limited RAM. Exiting enrollment protocols of BRSKI
    are all using certificates. This document defines a certificateless enrollment
    framework in BRSKI (BRSKI-CLE) for constrained IoT devices. Considering the evolution
    towards quantum- safe algorithms, the framework is based on Key Encapsulation
    Mechanism (KEM). Cooperating with the authentication mechanism shown in I-D.selander-lake-authz,
    a constrained IoT device does not need to configure a public key to identify itself
    for the whole bootstrapping process. An authentication centre (AC) is used for
    issuing lightweight credentials, such as CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs), to constrained
    IoT devices. This document does not specify any lightweight credentials.</p>"
