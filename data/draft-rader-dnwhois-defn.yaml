abstract:
- content: "<p>Efforts are currently being undertaken to review the role of Whois
    (as defined in RFC 954 [2] and formalize registry/registrar communications protocols
    in light of the current and evolving scope and utility of DNS, domain name registries
    and related entities. In order for this work to be truly effective and broadly
    applicable, it is important that accepted definitions act as the foundation. This
    document is an attempt to create a starting point for the requisite dialogue that
    will ultimately foster the determination and acceptance of these definitions.</p>"
