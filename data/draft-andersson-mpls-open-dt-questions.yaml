abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a living document, meaning that during the life timme
    of the MPLS Open Design Team we will put additonal questions/ issues into the
    document. When we find an answer amd a way to document the issu it will be removed
    from this document. Ideally when the Design Team is closed this document will
    be empty, or maybe we just add a pointer to where the answer to quesstion is documented.
    Thus this document will never go on to become an RFCc.</p>"
