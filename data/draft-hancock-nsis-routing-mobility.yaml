abstract:
- content: "<p>IP packet routing and changes in routes can have major influence on
    protocols and services that set state in network nodes. Routing may change, for
    example, due to node failure within the network, need for load balancing, multihoming
    or due to end-host or even network mobility. This draft is a first step in helping
    us to decide on how these problems should be handled and how interactions with
    other protocols should be handled and a stimulus to further security work.</p>"
