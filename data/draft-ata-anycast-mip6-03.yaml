abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited. In this document we
    explain a new network architecture for global anycasting to solve (1) in practical
    use and able to realize with existing technology easily, (2) about support for
    stateful communications keeping a session information at the end nodes such as
    TCP. The architecture is based on MIPv6 because there are many similarities between
    MIPv6 and global anycast.</p>"
