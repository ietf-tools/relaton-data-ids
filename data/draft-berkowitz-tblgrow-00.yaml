abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements [3,4,5] have shown that the rate of growth of routes and
    route instances in the default-free table have resumed exponential growth, which
    had slowed to linear growth after the introduction of CIDR [7]. This memorandum
    explores some analytical methods, admittedly heuristic in most cases, to understand
    why growth is faster than the simple rate of allocation. When accelerated growth
    can be attributed to operational practices or poor understanding, it may be possible
    to propose approaches to reducing the rate of table explosion without reducing
    the services delivered to end users.</p>"
