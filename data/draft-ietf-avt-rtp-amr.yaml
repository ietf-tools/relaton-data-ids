abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload
    format to be used for Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband
    (AMR-WB) encoded speech signals. The payload format is designed to be able to
    interoperate with existing AMR and AMR-WB transport formats on non-IP networks.
    In addition, a file format is specified for transport of AMR and AMR-WB speech
    data in storage mode applications such as email. Two separate MIME type registrations
    are included, one for AMR and one for AMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP payload
    format and the storage format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
