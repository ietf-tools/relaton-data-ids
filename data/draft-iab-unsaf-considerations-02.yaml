abstract:
- content: <p>As a result of the nature of Network Address Translation (NAT) Middleboxes,
    communicating endpoints that are separated by one or more NATs do not know how
    to refer to themselves using addresses that are valid in the addressing realms
    of their (current and future) peers. Various proposals have been made for "UNilateral
    Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF)" processes. These are processes whereby some originating
    endpoint attempts to determine or fix the address (and port) by which it is known
    to another endpoint - e.g., to be able to use address data in the protocol exchange,
    or to advertise a public address from which it will receive connections. This
    document outlines the reasons for which these proposals can be considered at best
    as short term fixes to specific problems and the specific issues to be carefully
    evaluated before creating an UNSAF proposal. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>
