abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanism. It allows
    for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths with IGP topologies by encoding
    paths as sequences of topological sub-paths which is called segments. These segments
    are advertised by the link- state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF). Unlike the
    MPLS, SR does not have the specific path construction signaling so that it cannot
    support the Path MTU. This draft provides the necessary IS-IS extensions about
    the Path MTU that need to be used on SR.</p>"
