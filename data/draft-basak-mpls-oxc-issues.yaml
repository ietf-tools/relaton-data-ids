abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the domain specific enhancements required to
    adapt MPLS traffic engineering control plane constructs to control optical cross-connects
    in emerging automatically switched optical transport networks. These enhancements
    are within the framework of Multiprotocol LAMBDA switching proposed in [1]. Specifically,
    this memo investigates the behavior of the MPLS based control plane technique
    for OXCs, and identifies required enhancements to both OXCs and to existing MPLS
    traffic engineering control plane objects (routing and signaling protocols) to
    support the application to OXCs.</p>"
