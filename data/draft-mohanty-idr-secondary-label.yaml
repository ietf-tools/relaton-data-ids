abstract:
- content: <p>This draft utilizes the concept of a secondary label to solve few cases
    in L3VPN Deployments.In BGP VPN networks, BGP speakers associate a local MPLS
    label when the next-hop is reset and advertise that label to other peers. The
    receiving peer installs this "received" label in the forwarding and forwards traffic
    to the sending router using this label. In some deployments, there arises need
    where a different label is required to be sent. We illustrate with two use-cases.
    This draft presents a method where this label is encoded in a newly defined attribute
    that is advertised with the BGP updates targeting these specified use-cases</p>
