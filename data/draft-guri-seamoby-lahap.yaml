abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new paging protocol nick-named LAHAP, which
    makes use of layer 2 triggers to anticipate events related to paging in layer
    2. LAHAP uses the architectural entities defined in RFC 3154 to support dormant
    mode in hosts connected to the Internet. LAHAP is not dependent on any mobility
    protocol. Tracking agent keeps track of the paging area of the HOST using layer
    2 triggers. Dormant monitoring agent intercepts the traffic for the node and queries
    tracking agent for the last registered paging area. Dormant monitoring agent asks
    paging agent to page the host. The paging is done in the paging areas if available
    and on the subnet. The host deregisters its paging registration after entering
    into the active mode.</p>"
