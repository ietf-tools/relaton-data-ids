abstract:
- content: "<p>Changes to Fibre Channel have caused the specification of the Internet
    Fibre Channel Protocol (iFCP) address translation mode to become incorrect. Due
    to the absence of usage of iFCP address translation mode, it is deprecated by
    this document. iFCP address transparent mode remains correctly specified. iFCP
    address transparent mode has been implemented and is in current use; therefore,
    it is not affected by this document. This document also records the state of Protocol
    Number 133, which was allocated for a pre-standard version of the Fibre Channel
    Internet Protocol (FCIP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
