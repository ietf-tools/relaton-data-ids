abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login
    and other secure network services over an insecure network. This document describes
    the SSH authentication protocol framework and public key, password, and host-based
    client authentication methods. Additional authentication methods are described
    in separate documents. The SSH authentication protocol runs on top of the SSH
    transport layer protocol and provides a single authenticated tunnel for the SSH
    connection protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
