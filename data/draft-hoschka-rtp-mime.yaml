abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a procedure to register RTP Payload Types as
    audio or video MIME types. This is useful to identify the type of an RTP transmission
    in a text-based format or protocol. It also registers all RTP payload types defined
    in the document 'RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences' (AVT profile) as
    MIME types. This is a rough draft.</p>"
