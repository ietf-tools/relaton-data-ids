abstract:
- content: "<p>Several documents on BFD based OAM for MPLS-TP has been put forward
    and the dependencies between those drafts are not yet fully sorted out; this document
    is one of these drafts. It is published in now to make ideas, motivations and
    approaches available. However we expect the final BFD based solution for MPLS-TP
    will be a cooperation of the parties between the existing drafts and that the
    BFD based OAM solution for MPLS-TP will merge into an agreed set of drafts approved
    by the MEAD team. This document specifies the BFD extension and behaviour to meet
    the requirements for MPLS-TP proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification
    functionality and the RDI functionality as defined in [3].</p>"
