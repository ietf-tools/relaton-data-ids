abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. Privacy has also been a key focus area,
    and understanding the privacy implications of new Internet technology is an important
    factor when IETF works on such technologies. This document highlights the need
    for a particular focus with respect to privacy. It is necessary to protect against
    endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align
    with the interests of users. It is important to consider the role of data passed
    to various parties - including the primary protocol participants - and balance
    the information given to them considering their roles and possible compromise
    of the information.</p>"
