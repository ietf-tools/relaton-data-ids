abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can
    be employed in OSPF networks in order to decrease data loss associated ith deterministic
    blackholing of packets during transient network conditions. The mechanism proposed
    here requires no OSPF protocol changes and is completely interoperable with the
    existing OSPF specification.</p>"
