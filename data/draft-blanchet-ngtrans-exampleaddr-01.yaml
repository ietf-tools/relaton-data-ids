abstract:
- content: "<p>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefix
    is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like. Since
    site local addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these cannot be used in many
    example situations and are confusing. Instead, an IPv6 prefix 3ffe:ffff::/32 is
    reserved in the range of the test address space.</p>"
