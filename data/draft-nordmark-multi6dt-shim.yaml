abstract:
- content: <p>This document outlines an approach to solving IPv6 multihoming in order
    to stimulate discussion. The approach is based on using a multi6 shim placed between
    the IP endpoint sublayer and the IP routing sublayer, and, at least initially,
    using routable IP locators as the identifiers visible above the shim layer. The
    approach does not introduce a "stack name" type of identifier, instead it ensures
    that all upper layer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting
    while still seeing a stable IPv6 address. This document does not specify the mechanism
    for authenticating and authorizing the "rehoming" - this is specified in the HBA
    document. Nor does it specify the messages used to establish multihoming state.
    The document does not even specify the packet format used for the data packets.
    Instead it discusses the issue of receive side demultiplexing and the different
    tradeoffs. The resolution of this issue will effect the packet format for the
    data packets.</p>
