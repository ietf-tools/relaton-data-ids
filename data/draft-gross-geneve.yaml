abstract:
- content: "<p>Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a wide
    variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel endpoints, transit
    fabrics, and centralized control clusters. As a result of their role in tying
    together different elements in the system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced
    by all of these components. Flexibility is therefore the most important aspect
    of a tunnel protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of the system. This
    draft describes Geneve, a protocol designed to recognize and accommodate these
    changing capabilities and needs.</p>"
