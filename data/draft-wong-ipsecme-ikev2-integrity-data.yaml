abstract:
- content: "<p>IKEv2 supports mutual authentication of the peers but does not support
    platform integrity validation of the peers nor does it support the exchange of
    data related to the platform integrity validation. This extension allows platform
    integrity validation data to be exchanged from one peer (initiator) to another
    (respondent), allowing the other peer to either use the data for statistical analysis,
    pass it along to a validation entity for validation or pass it along to a Fraud
    Information Gathering System for fraud detection or analysis.</p>"
