abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents a simple mechanism, based on 'threads', which can
    be used to prevent MPLS from setting up label switched path (LSPs) which have
    loops. The mechanism is compatible with, but does not require, VC merge. The mechanism
    can be used with either the ordered downstream-on-demand allocation or ordered
    downstream allocation. The amount of information that must be passed in a protocol
    message is tightly bounded (i.e., no path-vector is used). When a node needs to
    change its next hop, a distributed procedure is executed, but only nodes which
    are downstream of the change are involved.</p>"
