abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable implementations.
    Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly gaining popularity in several
    deployment scenarios, not the least in what used to be solely areas of traditional
    telecommunication protocols. Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods
    that enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and two-way
    network performance. Unfortunately, however, standard IP performance measurement
    mechanisms cannot be readily used with IPsec. This document makes the case for
    employing IPsec to protect O/TWAMP and proposes a method which combines IKEv2
    and O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively. This specification
    aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be secured well, while on the
    other hand, it extends the applicability of O/TWAMP to networks that have already
    deployed IPsec.</p>"
