abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an email header field, Require-Recipient-Valid-
    Since, to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers the time when
    the sender last confirmed the ownership of the target mailbox. This can be used
    to detect changes of mailbox ownership, and thus prevent mail from being delivered
    to the wrong party. The intended use of this header field is on automatically
    generated messages that might contain sensitive information.</p>"
