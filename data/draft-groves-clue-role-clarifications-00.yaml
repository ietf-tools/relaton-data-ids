abstract:
- content: <p>There have been recent discussions on the CLUE and DISPATCH mailing
    lists about "roles" associated with multimedia conferences. From the discussions
    it was apparent that there is some confusion as to what the current defined roles
    actually imply and that people had different understanding of the meaning and
    scope of the term "role". This draft seeks to identify the various "roles" that
    may be associated with a multimedia conference and to provide a grouping and nomenclature
    for further discussions on this topic. Specific to CLUE this draft proposes a
    number of attributes to be able to clearly identify the various roles that may
    be associated with a media capture.</p>
