abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been
    proposed, none of which has withstood the test of time. The last remnant of IPv6
    classful addressing is a rigid network interface identifier boundary at /64. This
    document removes the fixed position of that boundary for interface addressing.</p>"
