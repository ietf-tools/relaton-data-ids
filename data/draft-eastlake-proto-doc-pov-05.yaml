abstract:
- content: '<p>This document contrasts two points of view: the "document" point of
    view, where digital objects of interest are like pieces of paper written and viewed
    by people, and the "protocol" point of view where objects of interest are composite
    dynamic network messages. Although each point of view has a place, adherence to
    a document point of view can be damaging to protocol design. By understanding
    both points of view, conflicts between them may be clarified and reduced. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>'
