abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of SCS, a small cryptographic protocol
    layered on top of the HTTP cookie facility, that allows its users to produce and
    consume authenticated and encrypted cookies, as opposed to usual cookies, which
    are un-authenticated and sent in clear text. An interesting property, rising naturally
    from the given confidentiality and authentication properties, is that by using
    SCS cookies, it is possible to avoid storing the session state material on the
    server side altogether. In fact, an SCS cookie presented by the user agent to
    the origin server can always be validated (i.e. possibly recognized as self-produced,
    fresh, untampered material) and, as such, be used to safely restore application
    state. Hence, typical use cases may include devices with little or no storage
    offering some functionality via an HTTP interface, as well as web applications
    with high availability or load balancing requirements which would prefer to handle
    application state without the need to synchronize the pool through shared storage
    or peering. Another noteworthy application scenario is represented by the distribution
    of authorized web content (e.g. by CDNs), where an SCS token can be used, either
    in a cookie or embedded in the URI, to provide evidence of the entitlement to
    access the associated resource by the requesting user agent. Nevertheless, its
    security properties allow SCS to be used whenever the privacy and integrity of
    cookies is a concern, by paying an affordable price in terms of increased cookie
    size, additional CPU clock cycles needed by the symmetric key encryption and HMAC
    algorithms, and related key management, which can be made a nearly transparent
    task.</p>"
