abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
    locate items. These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced tracking network
    in which devices belonging to other network users (e.g., phones) report which
    tags they see and their location, thus allowing the owner of the tag to determine
    where their tag was most recently seen. While there are many legitimate uses of
    these tags, they are also susceptible to misuse for the purpose of stalking and
    abuse. A protocol that allows others to detect unwanted location trackers must
    incorporate an understanding of the unwanted tracking landscape today. This document
    provides a threat analysis for this purpose, will define what is in and out of
    scope for the unwanted location tracking protocols, and will provide some design
    considerations for implementation of protocols to detect unwanted location tracking.</p>"
