abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the MOBIKE protocol, a mobility and multihoming
    extension to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2). MOBIKE allows the IP addresses associated
    with IKEv2 and tunnel mode IPsec Security Associations to change. A mobile Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) client could use MOBIKE to keep the connection with the
    VPN gateway active while moving from one address to another. Similarly, a multihomed
    host could use MOBIKE to move the traffic to a different interface if, for instance,
    the one currently being used stops working. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
