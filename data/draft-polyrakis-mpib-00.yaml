abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of COPS-PR meta-policies and defines
    the Meta-Policy Information Base. The meta-policy PIB does not introduce a new
    policing area. On the contrary, it defines some provisioning classes that can
    be used by all other PIBs, in order to add meta-policing functionality into them.
    The meta-policy PIB, like every PIB, stores policing information that controls
    some policing mechanisms of the device. However, unlike other PIBs, the policing
    mechanism controlled by the meta-policy PRCs is the PIB itself. The data maintained
    by these PRCs implement policies that control other policies, this is why they
    are called meta-policies. Meta-policies is an attempt to push intelligence towards
    the COPS-PR PEPs and overcome the rigidity of their PIBs. Through meta-policies,
    more policing information and functionality can be pushed towards the PEP, less
    interaction with the PDP is necessary and less network and PDP resources are consumed.
    The PEP is more independent and it can bear longer PDP absences.</p>"
