abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an addendum to Version 1 of RSVP (Resource ReSerVation
    Protocol) as defined in the proposed standard [RFC2205]. The flow label, one of
    the new header fields of the IPv6 protocol, allows improvements to resource reservation
    protocols on IPv6 capable networks. Utilization of the flow label simplifies packet
    classification and optimizes packet processing in routers along the transport
    path. The main objectives of this document are to specify the proper usage of
    the IPv6 flow label and to promote its support within RSVP. This memo defines
    extensions required to the Version 1 specification and additional processing rules
    needed to ensure correct operation. Rather than simply presenting the specification
    with no justification, we have tried to present the benefits of adopting the flow
    label within RSVP for IPv6. This addendum does not have any effect on the implementation
    or usage of RSVP for IPv4.</p>"
