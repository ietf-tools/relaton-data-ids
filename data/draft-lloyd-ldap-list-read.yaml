abstract:
- content: "<p>LDAP was originally developed as a lightweight protocol but through
    its development it has added many features to a point where there is very little
    difference in terms of simplicity or code size to that of DAP. However, DAP included
    features which provided efficient navigation through a multi server distributed
    directory systems (List), efficient retreival (Read)and the ability to provide
    service controls to select operation requestpriority, permit/deny chained operations
    and the ability to select master/replica data in the operation response. LDAP
    is now widely used as the access for X.500 distributed directory systems, however
    LDAP in its original form omitted the items (List, Read and Service Controls)
    as defined above. The List/Read requirements were serviced by LDAP through the
    use of 'pre-selected' Search operations. The Service Controls as per X.511 for
    distributed operation control have in most part been omitted from LDAP. (These
    are the subject of another proposal.) Experience in the field is showing that
    not having a List (and to a lesser degree, Read) operations in LDAP accessing
    to distributed directory system causes very inefficient multi server navigation
    compared to that of an LDAP Search being used. A Search operation is the most
    complicated of directory services, yet in the LDAP case it is being used for lesser
    and more efficient functions. For instance, in the LDAP only multi - server environments,
    not having a List operation causes considerable client re processing and protocol
    exchanges due to dealing with system referrals. This leads to extended user/client
    response times. For those who have already implemented a LDAP Search operation
    a Read and List should be of little consequence. This document defines two additional
    operations for LDAP namely List and Read that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] operations
    to provide a simple navigation/browsing and information retrieval mechanism by
    which a LDAP client can be</p>"
