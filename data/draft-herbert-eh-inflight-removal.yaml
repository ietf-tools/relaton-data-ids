abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an experimental method to allow intermediate
    nodes to remove IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Headers or Routing Headers from packets
    in flight. The goal is to reduce the probability of packets being dropped, because
    they contain these extension headers, without impacting functionality.</p>"
