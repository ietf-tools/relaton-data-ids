abstract:
- content: "<p>At present, the collaboration of documents in a single cloud-office
    Website works wonderfully. However, the one among different cloud- office websites
    is a little clumsy. This document analyzes the status quo of the collaboration
    of documents among those existing different cloud-office websites and provides
    a solution how to realize IDCOA (the interconnection and interoperability of different
    cloud-office applications) with the html file format.</p>"
