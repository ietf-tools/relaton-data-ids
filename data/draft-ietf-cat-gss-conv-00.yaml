abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, the GSSAPI specification has not included in its scope
    the acquisition of initial credentials, or mechanisms which have required interaction
    with the user in the course of the security context. This has limited the applicability
    of the GSSAPI specification. This specification allows an application program
    to register a callback function so that a GSSAPI mechanism can request conversation
    services from the application program. The application program is responsible
    for displaying messages to the user and requesting input from the user via the
    callback function. The goal of this specification is to allow certain low- infrastructure-requiring
    mechanisms to prompt the user for a username, password, SecureID response, etc.
    It might also be used by mechanisms such as Kerberos when the GSSAPI library wishes
    to obtain initial credentials itself, instead of assuming that they are already
    present in the process.</p>"
