abstract:
- content: "<p>Port Control Protocol (PCP) Rapid Recovery allows PCP clients to repair
    failed mappings within seconds, rather than the minutes or hours it might take
    if they relied solely on waiting for the next routine renewal of the mapping.
    Mapping failures may occur when a NAT gateway is rebooted and loses its mapping
    state, or when a NAT gateway has its external IP address changed so that its current
    mapping state becomes invalid.</p>"
