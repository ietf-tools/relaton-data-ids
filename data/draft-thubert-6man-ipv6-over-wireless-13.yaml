abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends RFC 4291 for IPv6 over modern Non-Broadcast /
    Non-Transitive networks that decouples the physical concepts of interface, link
    and broadcast domain from the IP concepts of Interface, Link and Subnet, with
    the primary goal to apply on networks where broadcast is undesirable. A study
    of the issues with classical ND over wireless media is presented, and a framework
    to solve those issues within the new architecture is proposed.</p>"
