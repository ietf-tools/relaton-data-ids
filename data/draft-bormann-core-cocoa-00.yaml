abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does
    not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses. The CoRE CoAP specification
    defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of congestion with minimal implementation
    requirements. It also leaves room for combining the base specification with advanced
    congestion control mechanisms with higher performance. This specification defines
    some simple advanced CoRE Congestion Control mechanisms, Simple CoCoA. In the
    present version -00, it is mainly a straw-man document to gauge the implementation
    effort required, with a view towards simplifying it further.</p>"
