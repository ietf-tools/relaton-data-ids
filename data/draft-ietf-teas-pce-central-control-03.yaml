abstract:
- content: '<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) has become established as a core
    component of Software Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal
    paths for traffic across a network for any definition of "optimal" and can also
    monitor changes in resource availability and traffic demands to update the paths.
    Conventionally, the PCE has been used to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs). These paths are supplied using the Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) to the head end of the LSP for signaling in the MPLS network.
    SDN has a far broader applicability than just signaled MPLS traffic engineered
    networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a wide range of use cases
    including static LSPs, segment routing, service function chaining (SFC), and indeed
    any form of routed or switched network. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider
    PCEP as a general southbound control protocol for use in these environments to
    allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. This document briefly
    introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller, examines the motivations
    and applicability for PCEP as a southbound interface, and introduces the implications
    for the protocol. A PCE-based central controller can simplify the processing of
    distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily
    completely replacing it. This document does not describe use cases in detail and
    does not define protocol extensions: that work is left for other documents.</p>'
