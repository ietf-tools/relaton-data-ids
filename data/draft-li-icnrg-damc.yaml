abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a new communication architecture, called Distributed
    Architecture for Microservices Communication (DAMC). It includes multiple aspects
    of microservice communication, such as service registration, service discovery,
    service routing, service scheduling, and more, Which to achieve all the essential
    functionalities provided by current centralized service networks. The purpose
    of this draft is to combine the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) concept to
    enhance the overall performance, scalability and reliability of microservices
    communication. The DAMC architecture provides a powerful framework for managing
    the complex communication requirements of distributed microservices, ensuring
    integrity, security and efficient resource utilization.</p>"
