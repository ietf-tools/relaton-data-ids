abstract:
- content: "<p>Designers of information models for challenged devices connected to
    the Internet, and most especially for devices that will be carried by people or
    that will be operating in people's homes, need to not forget that people own the
    devices and the data, and expect those to work for them, not against them. This
    draft discusses some security and privacy issues that may be relevant for the
    IAB's IOTSI workshop on information models for such devices and related services.</p>"
