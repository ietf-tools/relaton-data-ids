abstract:
- content: <p>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of
    service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN architecture
    is described in RFC 5559. This memo describes a behaviour for PCN egress nodes
    known as the "piggybacking" edge behaviour, because it "piggybacks" PCN information
    in resource signalling messages. This version of the memo describes two alternatives,
    where piggybacking is derived from the CL edge behaviour and where it is derived
    from the SM edge behaviour. The SM and CL edge behaviours are specified in companion
    documents.</p>
