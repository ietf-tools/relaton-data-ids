abstract:
- content: <p>BGP speakers learn their next hop addresses for NLRI in RFC-4271 in
    the NEXT_HOP field and in RFC-4760 in the "Network Address of Next Hop" field.
    Under certain circumstances, it might be desirable for a BGP speaker to know both
    the next hops and the next-next hops of NLRI to make optimal forwarding decisions.
    One such example is global load balancing (GLB) in a Clos network. Draft-ietf-idr-entropy-label
    defines the "Next Hop Dependent Characteristics Attribute" (NHC) which allows
    a BGP speaker to signal the forwarding characteristics associated with a given
    next hop. This document defines a new NHC characteristic, the Next-next Hop Nodes
    (NNHN) characteristic, which can be used to advertise the next- next hop nodes
    associated with a given next hop.</p>
