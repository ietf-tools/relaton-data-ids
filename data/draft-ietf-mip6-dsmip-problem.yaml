abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the issues associated with mobility management
    for dual stack mobile nodes. Currently, two mobility management protocols are
    defined for IPv4 and IPv6. Deploying both in a dual stack mobile node introduces
    a number of problems. Deployment and operational issues motivate the use of a
    single mobility management protocol. This document discusses such motivations.
    The document also discusses requirements for the Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and Mobile
    IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol so that they can support mobility management for a dual
    stack node. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
