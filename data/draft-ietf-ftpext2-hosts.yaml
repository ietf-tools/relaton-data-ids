abstract:
- content: "<p>The File Transfer Protocol, as defined in RFC 959 [RFC0959], does not
    provide a way for FTP clients and servers to differentiate between multiple DNS
    names that are registered for a single IP address. This document defines a new
    FTP command that provides a mechanism for FTP clients and servers to identify
    individual virtual hosts on an FTP server.</p>"
