abstract:
- content: "<p>Finding out functionality, nodes or services, in general resources,
    in a network has a number of well-known solutions. A sensor network has inherent
    limitations and requires a solution that has a low footprint and follows the networking
    concepts defined within 6LoWPAN. This draft discusses two alternative solutions
    to service discovery in a sensor network. Both approaches are based on the 6LowPAN
    Neighbor Discovery.</p>"
