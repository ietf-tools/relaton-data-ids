abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Three Color Marker (TCM), which can be used
    as component in a Diffserv traffic conditioner [RFC2475, RFC2474]. The TCM meters
    a traffic stream and marks its packets according to three traffic parameters,
    Committed Information Rate (CIR), Committed Burst Size (CBS), and Excess Burst
    Size (EBS), to be either green, yellow, or red. The TCM is useful, for example,
    in policing a service, where green, yellow, and red packets are forwarded with
    increasing discard probability.</p>"
