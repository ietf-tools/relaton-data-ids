abstract:
- content: "<p>The base WebDAV protocol [WebDAV] provides basic support for collections.
    It defines a MKCOL method for creating collections and specifies how other HTTP
    and WebDAV methods interact with collections. It supports internal members of
    collections, which it defines as URIs that are immediately relative to the URI
    of the collection. Many applications, however, need more powerful collections.
    There are two areas in particular where more powerful functionality is often needed:
    referential resources and ordering. This draft specifies extensions to the base
    WebDAV protocol to support these more powerful collections.</p>"
