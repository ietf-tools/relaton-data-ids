abstract:
- content: "<p>For many or most sites, site-local addresses are used for packets between
    nodes within the site. The fact that site-local addresses are not globally unique
    makes their usage and administration more difficult than they would be if there
    were globally unique (or nearly globally unique). For instance, before two sites
    can be merged, one of them has to be renumbered. The meaning of site-local addresses
    becomes ambiguous when they are taken out of the immediate context of the IPv6
    layer, for instance when they are conveyed in email or stored in text files.</p>"
