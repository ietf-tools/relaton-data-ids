abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used to support
    variable-rate traffic that exhibts periods where the transmission rate is limited
    by the application rather than the congestion window. It updates TCP to allow
    a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or applications-limited
    interval. The method is expected to benefit variable-rate TCP applications, while
    also providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced. The document
    also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation (CWV), an IETF experimental specification
    defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that CWV sought to address important issues,
    but failed to deliver a widely used solution. This document recommends that the
    IETF should consider moving RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic status, and
    that this is replaced by the current specification.</p>"
