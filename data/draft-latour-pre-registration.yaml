abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft introduces an extension to the Extensible Provisioning
    Protocol (EPP) for top-level domain (TLD) registries, enabling registrars to submit
    pre-registration information for domain names. The extension facilitates quality
    verification by the registry, employing advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine
    Learning (AI/ML) techniques. Pre-registrations are assigned a quality score based
    on the analysis of the submitted data, ranging from 0 for non-abusive registrations
    to 100 for potentially abusive ones. This extension addresses the critical need
    to proactively identify and mitigate abusive domain registrations within TLDs,
    contributing to a safer and more reliable internet environment. The document outlines
    the EPP command definitions, XML schemas, data flow, and security considerations
    necessary to implement this innovative quality assurance mechanism, thereby enhancing
    the integrity and trustworthiness of TLD registrations.</p>"
