abstract:
- content: <p>This document summarizes benefits that operators perceive to be provided
    by intermediary devices that provide functions apart from normal IP forwarding.
    Such intermediary devices are often called "middleboxes". RFC3234 defines a taxonomy
    of middleboxes and issues in the Internet. Most of those middleboxes utilize or
    modify application-layer data. This document primarily focuses on devices that
    observe and act on information carried in the transport layer, and especially
    information carried in TCP packets. A primary goal of this document is to provide
    information to working groups developing new transport protocols, to aid understanding
    of what might be gained or lost by design decisions that may affect (or be affected
    by) middlebox operation.</p>
