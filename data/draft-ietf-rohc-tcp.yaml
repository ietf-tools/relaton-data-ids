abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile
    for compression of TCP/IP packets. The profile, called ROHC-TCP, provides efficient
    and robust compression of TCP headers, including frequently used TCP options such
    as SACK (Selective Acknowledgments) and Timestamps. ROHC-TCP works well when used
    over links with significant error rates and long round-trip times. For many bandwidth-limited
    links where header compression is essential, such characteristics are common.
