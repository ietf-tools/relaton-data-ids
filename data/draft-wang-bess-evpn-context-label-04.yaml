abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN is designed to provide a better VPLS service than [RFC4761] and
    [RFC4762], and EVPN indeed introduced many new features which couldn't be achieved
    in those old VPLS implementions. But EVPN didn't inherit all features of old VPLS,
    and a few issues arises for EVPN only. Some of these issues can be imputed to
    the MP2P nature of EVPN labels. The PW label in old VPLS is a label for P2P VC,
    so it contains more context than a identifier in dataplane for it's VSI instance.But
    the EVPN label just identifies it's VSI instnace and it can't stand for the ingress
    PE in dataplane. So the following issues arises with MPLS EVPN service: * MPLS
    EVPN statistics can't be done per ingress PE. * MPLS EVPN can't support hub/spoke
    use case which the spoke PE can</p>"
