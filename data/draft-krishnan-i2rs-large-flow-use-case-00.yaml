abstract:
- content: "<p>Demands on networking bandwidth are growing exponentially due to applications
    such as large file transfers and those with rich media. Link Aggregation Group
    (LAG) and Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) are extensively deployed in networks to
    scale the bandwidth. However, the flow based load balancing techniques used today
    make inefficient use of the bandwidth in the presence of long lived large flows.
    This draft presents a use-case to improve the efficiency under such conditions
    and aims to drive requirements for the I2RS WG.</p>"
