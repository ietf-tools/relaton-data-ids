    of Service (QoS) routing protocols that provide multiple classes of service with
    multi-dimensional QoS requirements. In particular, it discusses enhancements to
    Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGPv4) that allow nodes to discover multiple
    paths with associated QoS attributes. In addition, this documents discusses the
