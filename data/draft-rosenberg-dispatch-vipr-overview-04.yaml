abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment
    within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video communications.
    Though it was designed from the outset to support inter-domain federation over
    the public Internet, such federation has not materialized. The primary reasons
    for this are the complexities of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns
    over security. This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements,
    and then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federation with
    SIP, called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR). ViPR addresses the
    problems that have prevented inter-domain federation over the Internet. It provides
    fully distributed inter- domain routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings
    from phone numbers to domains, a new technique for automated VoIP anti-spam, and
    privacy of number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model of SIP.
