abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides an extensible
    interface to various authentication mechanisms. Some EAP methods derive cryptographic
    material between the EAP peers; these keys can be used, for instance, with IEEE
    802.11i encryption. This document proposes a mechanism that can be used to derive
    cryptographically separate keys for more than one cryptographic application, such
    as protecting subsequent EAP messages, distributing credentials for re- authentication,
    or handoff mechanisms involving multiple WLAN access points.</p>"
