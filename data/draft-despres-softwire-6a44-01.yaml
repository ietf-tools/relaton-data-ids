abstract:
- content: "<p>Most CPEs should soon be dual stack, but a large installed base of
    IPv4-only CPEs is likely to remain for several years. Also, with the IPv4 address
    shortage, more and more ISPs will assign private IPv4 addresses to their customers.
    The need for IPv6 connectivity therefore concerns hosts behind IPv4-only CPEs,
    including such CPEs that are assigned private addresses. The 6a44 mechanism specified
    in this document addresses this need, without limitations and operational complexities
    of Tunnel Brokers and Teredo to do the same. 6a44 is based on an address mapping
    and on a mechanism whereby suitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6
    connectivity via a stateless 6a44 server function operated by their Internet Service
    Provider. With it, IPv6 traffic between two 6a44 hosts in a single site remains
    within the site. Except for IANA numbers that remain to be assigned, the specification
    is intended to be complete enough for running codes to be independently written
    and interwork.</p>"
