abstract:
- content: "<p>This document sets out steps that DNS servers (recursive resolvers
    and authoritative servers) can take unilaterally (without any coordination with
    other peers) to defend DNS query privacy against a passive network monitor. The
    steps in this document can be defeated by an active attacker, but should be simpler
    and less risky to deploy than more powerful defenses. The goal of this document
    is to simplify and speed deployment of opportunistic encrypted transport in the
    recursive-to-authoritative hop of the DNS ecosystem. With wider easy deployment
    of the underlying transport on an opportunistic basis, we hope to facilitate the
    future specification of stronger cryptographic protections against more powerful
    attacks.</p>"
