abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification proposes proxy operations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    on behalf of devices located on broadcast-inefficient wireless networks. A broadcast-efficient
    backbone running classical IPv6 Neighbor Discovery federates multiple wireless
    links to form a large MultiLink Subnet, but the broadcast domain does not need
    to extend to the wireless links for the purpose of ND operation. Backbone Routers
    placed at the wireless edge of the backbone proxy the ND operation and route packets
    from/to registered nodes, and wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered
    to the Backbone Router to setup proxy services in a fashion that is essentially
    similar to a classical Layer-2 association.</p>"
