abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) defines a mechanism and
    protocol for controlling backup, recovery, and other transfers of data between
    primary and secondary storage. The NDMP architecture separates the network attached
    Data Management Application (DMA), Data Servers and Tape Servers participating
    in archival or recovery operations. NDMP also provides low-level control of tape
    devices and SCSI media changers. The XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations
    for NDMP. The key goals of NDMP include interoperability, contemporary functionality,
    and extensibility. The XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations for NDMP. The
