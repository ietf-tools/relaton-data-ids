- content: "<p>This is an update of an individual contribution that has been accepted
    as a work item by the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group, and will split into
    two BMWG documents. It is being posted for information. T This document defines
    a specific set of tests that router implementers can use to measure and report
    the convergence performance of BGP-4 processes. It doe not consider the forwarding
    performance of such routers once they have converged, or the convergence characteristics
    of the global routing system.</p>"
