abstract:
- content: "<p>Integration of Generalized MPLS-capable SONET/SDH networks in existing
    backbone environments has generated the need to determine inter-working capabilities
    between nodes interconnected by both SONET/SDH and non-SONET/SDH overhead terminating
    networks. This is particularly the case for critical functions and applications
    such as the ones provided by the Link Management Protocol [LMP] and its WDM extensions
    [LMP-WDM]. In this context, this document describes the applicability of their
    respective functions and illustrates them through several inter-connection architectures.</p>"
