abstract:
- content: "<p>Real Time Communications (RTC) tools are becoming as prevalent and
    essential for users on the Internet as email. While RTC tools can, like email,
    be implemented directly by users in a point-to-point fashion, they are often provided
    for or on behalf of a community of users within an administrative domain. As the
    use of these tools grows, users increasingly have the need to communicate with
    users not only within their own community but with those in other communities
    as well. In practice, each community is controlled by some authority, and so there
    is a need to provide for easier establishment of connectivity between communities,
    and the management of the inter- community link. This document contains an initial
    list of requirements for provisioning and managing connectivity between communities.</p>"
