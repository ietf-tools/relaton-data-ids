abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-aware Networking (APN) framework defines that application-aware
    information (i.e. APN attribute) including APN identification (ID) and/or APN
    parameters (e.g. network performance requirements) is encapsulated at network
    edge devices and carried in packets traversing an APN domain in order to facilitate
    service provisioning, perform fine-granularity traffic steering and network resource
    adjustment. This document defines the extension of the APN framework for the application
    side. In this extension, the APN resources of an APN domain is allocated to applications
    which compose and encapsulate the APN attribute in packets. When the network devices
    in the APN domain receive the packets carrying APN attribute, they can directly
    provide fine-granular traffic operations according to these APN attributes in
    the packets.</p>"
