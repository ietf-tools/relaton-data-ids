abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP slow start is designed to ramp up to the network congestion point
    quickly, doubling the congestion window each round-trip time until the congestion
    point is reached, whereupon TCP exits the slow start phase. Unfortunately, the
    default Linux TCP slow start implementation -- TCP Cubic with HyStart -- can cause
    premature exit from slow start, especially over wireless links, degrading link
    utilization. However, without HyStart, TCP exits slow start too late, causing
    unnecessary packet loss. To improve TCP slow start performance, this document
    proposes using the Slow start Exit At Right CHokepoint (SEARCH) algorithm where
    the TCP sender determines the congestion point based on acknowledged deliveries
    -- specifically, the sender computes the delivered bytes compared to the expected
    delivered bytes, smoothed to account for link latency variation and normalized
    to accommodate link capacities, and exits slow start if the delivered bytes are
    lower than expected. We implemented SEARCH as a Linux kernel v5.16 module and
    evaluated it over WiFi, 4G/LTE, and low earth orbit (LEO) and geosynchronous (GEO)
    satellite links. Analysis of the results show that the SEARCH reliably exits from
    slow start after the congestion point is reached but before inducing packet loss.</p>"
