abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a protocol called the Home Agent Redundancy
    Protocol or HARP. HARP is an optional extension to Mobile-IP [RFC- 2002]. Mobile-IP
    includes the notion of a Home Agent which is a host located on the home IP subnet
    for Mobile Nodes. Home Agents forward packets to Mobile Nodes that are away from
    home. Since Mobile Nodes are dependent on the Home Agent for connectivity when
    away from home, the Home Agent represents a possible single source of failure
    for the Mobile IP system. HARP is a protocol which allows a pair (or set) of Home
    Agents to cooperate and share Mobile-IP Mobile Node registration information.
    If one of the HARP peers should fail, the Mobile-IP system will not necessarily
    fail, hence HARP introduces Home Agent redundancy into the Mobile-IP system. Mobile
    Nodes are not aware that HARP exists, so HARP requires no changes to Mobile-IP
    as a protocol. In this document, we present the HARP architecture and protocol.</p>"
