abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the extensions needed by certain features for
    the purpose of RSVP Graceful Restart (defined in[RFC3473]). One of these extensions
    refers to the ability of a node to recover the ERO in the case it has performed
    an ERO expansion before control plane restart. Also a small modification is proposed
    in the basic procedure to support simultaneous multiple node restarts in a network.
    Specifically, a node should use a non-zero Recovery Time while in the recovery
    phase. This allows a node to determine at restart time if any of its neighbors
    has previously restarted and it is currently in the recovery phase.</p>"
