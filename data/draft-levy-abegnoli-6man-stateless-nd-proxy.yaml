abstract:
- content: <p>A legacy or incorrect host implementation may assume an on-link prefix
    on an interface where it owns an address that matches the prefix. This mistake
    may prevent connectivity on networks where this is not the case, e.g., when the
    physical or logical connectivity of the network does not allow transitive connectivity,
    in which case all the traffic should transit via the router. This document proposes
    a stateless routing proxy operation in the router to force a "not-on- link" behavior
    on the misbehaving host and attract all the packets to the router.</p>
