abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to provide an alternative perspective to
    the document prepared by Jim Fenton for DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), although
    it borrows from his substantial effort. This review removes emphasis on email-address
    domains, as DKIM allows signatures to be independent of the email-address. This
    document also considers the impact of adding an opaque-identifier and implementing
    abusive message replay abatement. This document considers threats against Internet
    mail and threats created when employing a signature-based method for establishing
    an accountable domain for a message, in particular DKIM. This document also ranks
    threat levels, modes of access, Bad Actors and their capabilities, and possible
    motivations for various attack scenarios.</p>"
