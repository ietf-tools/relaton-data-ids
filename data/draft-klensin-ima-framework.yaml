- content: "<p>Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that people
    be able to use their own names, written correctly in their own languages and scripts,
    as mailbox names in email addresses. This document introduces a series of specifications
    and operational suggestions that define mechanisms and protocol extensions needed
    to fully support internationalized email addresses. These changes include an SMTP
    extension and extension of email header syntax to accommodate UTF-8 data. The
    document set also will include discussion of key assumptions and issues in deploying
    fully internationalized email.</p>"
