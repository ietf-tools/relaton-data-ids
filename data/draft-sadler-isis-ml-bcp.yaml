abstract:
- content: "<p>Work has started in the ITU, the IETF IP over Optical Working Group,
    and in the OIF to specify the requirements for ASON NNI routing. One of the requirements
    identified is support for multi-level hierarchies. IS-IS is one of the candidate
    protocols to provide this functionality. Therefore, methods for multi-level IS-IS
    routing need to be developed. This draft documents one that provides multi-level
    routing through the 'stacking' of Level 2 IS-IS instances. The method is possible
    using existing extensions to IS-IS. It also provides insight into some of the
    resulting operational issues.</p>"
