abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a vCard S/MIME Capabilities property and it defines
    or references values for many algorithms. The SMIME Capability values can also
    be included in S/MIME messages as a signed attribute and in public key certificates
    as an extension. The S/MIME Capabilities property is a complement to key property,
    which together enable usage of S/MIME without an initial exchange of email messages.</p>"
