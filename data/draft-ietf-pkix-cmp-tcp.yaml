- content: "<p>This document describes how to layer Certificate Management Protocols
    [CMP] over [TCP]. A method for doing so is described in section 5.2 of [CMP],
    but that method does not solve problems encountered by implementors. This document
    specifies an enhanced method which extends the protocol.</p>"
