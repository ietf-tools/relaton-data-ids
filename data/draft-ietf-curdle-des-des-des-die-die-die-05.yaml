abstract:
- content: "<p>The triple-DES (3DES) and RC4 encryption types are steadily weakening
    in cryptographic strength, and the deprecation process should begin for their
    use in Kerberos. Accordingly, RFC 4757 has been moved to Historic status, as none
    of the encryption types it specifies should be used, and RFC 3961 has been updated
    to note the deprecation of the triple-DES encryption types. RFC 4120 is likewise
    updated to remove the recommendation to implement triple-DES encryption and checksum
    types.</p>"
