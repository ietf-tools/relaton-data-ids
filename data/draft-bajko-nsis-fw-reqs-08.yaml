abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP2 is working in specifying a way to allow the mobile network subscribers
    to configure the Firewalls in their network according to their needs[3]. This
    document defines requirements for a Firewall Configuration Protocol. It has been
    produced by a number of 3GPP2 member companies and endorsed by 3GPP2. It contains
    3GPP2 requirements to a next generation Firewall Configuration Protocol. With
    the number of threats that keep increasing on the Internet, many networks have
    decided to deploy Firewalls to reduce the possible risks and protect their users
    as well as their network resources. Firewalls can however present many issues
    with new protocols, applications and scenarios to be supported. Data packets may
    be discarded at the Firewalls. In addition, the clients may often be the only
    parties that know the requirements and details of the data communications. This
    document therefore explains why a protocol allowing clients to configure Firewalls
    would be useful, and attempts to identify the requirements and features to be
    supported by such a protocol.</p>"
