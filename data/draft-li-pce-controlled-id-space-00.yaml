abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for
    computing paths in SR networks. Stateful PCE provide active control of MPLS-TE
    LSPs via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally
    configured LSPs to the PCE. Further, stateful PCE could also create and delete
    PCE-initiated LSPs itself. A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) simplify the
    processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) and without necessarily completely replacing it. In some use
    cases, such as PCECC, Binding Segment Identifier (SID), SR Path Identification,
    there is a requirement for a stateful PCE to make allocation of labels, SID, Path-ID
    respectively. These use cases require for the PCE to be aware of the various identifier
    space from which to make allocations on behalf of PCC. This documents specify
    a mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of the identifier space under its control
    via PCEP. The identifier could be MPLS label, SID, Path ID or another future identifier
    to be allocated by a PCE.</p>"
