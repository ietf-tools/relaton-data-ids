abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is today widely used in the
    Internet to announce as well as negotiate multimedia sessions and exchange capabilities.
    Having originally been designed for session announcements only, as opposed to
    announcements and capabilities negotiation announcements, native SDP lacks numerous
    features to be applicable in many session scenarios. Numerous extensions have
    been developed to circumvent SDP's shortcomings -- but they have also repeatedly
    shown its inherent limitations. A successor protocol -- termed 'SDPng' for the
    time being -- is developed to address the aforementioned needs of Internet applications
    in a more structured manner. With the huge installed base of SDP-based applications,
    a migration path needs to be developed to move from SDP to SDPng over time. This
    document outlines how this migration can be achieved: in general as well as for
    the various IETF control protocols that potentially make use of SDP and SDPng.</p>"
