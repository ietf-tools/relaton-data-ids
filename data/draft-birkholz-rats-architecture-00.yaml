abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS), such as Remote Integrity VERification
    (RIVER), the creation of Entity Attestation Tokens (EAT), software integrity Measurement
    And ATtestation (MAAT), or the attestation of device characteristics, in general,
    are based on specific operations and qualities provided by hardware and software.
    The RATS architecture maps corresponding functions and operation capabilities
    to specific RATS roles. The goal is to enable an appropriate conveyance of believable
    evidence about device health or trusted claims about device capabilities via network
    protocols. The flows of data between these roles depend on the composition of
    RATS roles and their location with respect to devices or services. The RATS architecture
    provides these roles as building blocks to enable suitable composition, while
    remaining hardware-agnostic. This flexibility is intended to address a significant
    majority of use cases or usage scenarios in the domain of RATS. Examples include,
    but are not limited to: financial transactions, voting machines, critical safety
    systems, network equipment health, or trustworthy end-user device management.</p>"
