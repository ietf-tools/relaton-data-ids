abstract:
- content: <p>The document "FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation" [I-D.francis-intra-va]
    describes how FIB size may be reduced. The latest revision of that draft refers
    generically to tunnels, and leaves it to other documents to define the usage and
    signaling methods for specific tunnel types. This document provides those definitions
    for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP), without tag stacking.</p>
