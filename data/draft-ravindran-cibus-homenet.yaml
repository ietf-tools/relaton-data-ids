abstract:
- content: "<p>Home network (Homenet) is a good application scenario for ICN considering
    it is a point where diverse users, devices, applications, and services meet. Homenets
    are getting increasingly complex with the presence of application specific sensors,
    smart appliances, and smart networking devices such as residential gateway. Home
    automation today is being driven by several alliances such as DLNA, AllJoyn, ZigBee,
    and Z-Wave aimed at supporting homenet services such as multimedia sharing, lighting
    control, climate control, and energy management. These standards overlay application
    semantics over a host centric architectures which is inefficient, and the lack
    of inter-operability among these standards results in high cost, inflexibility,
    and management issues. Homenet is an information- centric environment where the
    objective is to enable consumers and producers to interact in a contextual manner
    independent of their underlying topology arrangement. Although the overall homenet
    objectives over an ICN framework versus any other are the same; ICN can distinguish
    itself by providing a rich service abstraction layer applicable in local scale
    as in BAN/PAN/LAN, and also enable intelligent interaction beyond the homenet
    boundary. In this draft we share the idea of a contextualized information- centric
    bus (CIBUS) which builds on ICN abstractions of naming, name resolution, and content
    dissemination for home network by providing support for service management, context
    processing and monitoring, policy management, and policy based routing and forwarding.
    CIBUS allows applications and services to discover each other, subscribe/ notify
    to event upon which service composition can be realized locally or in a centralize
    manner. Furthermore, service policies can be applied at high granularity which
    can be imposed in the routing and forwarding plane through ICN extensions. Some
    of these CIBUS features that were realized in [5] is presented here.</p>"
