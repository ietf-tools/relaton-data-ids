abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental method to extend the option
    space for connection parameters within the initial TCP SYN segment at the start
    of a TCP connection. In this method the TCP client sends two alternative SYNs:
    one intended for legacy servers and one intended for upgraded servers. Once it
    establishes which type of server has responded, it continues the connection appropriate
    to that server type and aborts the other. The SYN intended for upgraded servers
    includes additional options at the end of the payload. It is designed to traverse
    all known middleboxes. In the longer term, clients will be able to send only the
    SYN intended for upgraded servers.</p>"
