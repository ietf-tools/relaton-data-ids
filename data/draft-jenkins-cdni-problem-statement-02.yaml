abstract:
- content: "<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits: reduced
    delivery cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experience for End Users
    and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons they are frequently used
    for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling
    up their infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying
    their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered
    to an end user regardless of that end user's location or attachment network. This
    creates a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate
    as an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content
    from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users. However, no standards or open
    specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN interconnection. The goal
    of this document is to outline the problem area for the IETF with a view towards
    creating a working group. This working group would work on interoperable and scalable
    solutions for CDN interconnection.</p>"
