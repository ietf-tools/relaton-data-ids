abstract:
- content: <p>The combination of "rn" and "npdi" parameters which are normally used
    for number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routing problems. Database
    dips to obtain routing numbers are not only needed for NP, but also for the routing
    of service numbers and short code numbers in the PSTN and also in SIP networks.
    This document defines the use of the tel URI parameters defined for NP ("rn" and
    "npdi") to route service numbers and short code numbers.</p>
