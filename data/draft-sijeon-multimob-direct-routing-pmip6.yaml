abstract:
- content: "<p>To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [RFC6424] has been determined
    as a base solution. This solution requires all the LMA to forward multicast packets
    to MAG via PMIPv6 tunnel. This approach creates a tunnel convergence problem.
    To resolve the issue, the current MULTIMOB WG charter is trying to draw a solution
    about how to separate multicasting routing from a mobility anchor. To address
    the issue, we propose the local routing approach that makes the direct connection
    between MAG and multicast router. The advantages of the proposed local routing
    solution are compared with the base solution and dedicated LMA approach. In addition,
    we present the applicability of local routing solution depending on several constraints.</p>"
