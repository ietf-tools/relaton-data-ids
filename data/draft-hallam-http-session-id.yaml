abstract:
- content: "<p>A Uniform Resource Identifier for identifying HTTP sessions is described.
    Session identification URIs permit HTTP transactions to be linked within a limited
    domain. This provides a balance between the needs of commercial servers for demographic
    data collection and the privacy concerns of users. In addition session identification
    URIs may be used as part of a high security authentication mechanism to prevent
    replay attacks.</p>"
