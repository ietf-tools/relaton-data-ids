abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the
    Content-Disposition header field in SIP. The treatment of 'early-session' bodies
    is similar to the treatment of 'session bodies. That is, they follow the offer/answer
    model. Their only difference is that session descriptions whose disposition type
    is 'early-session' are used to establish early media sessions within early dialogs,
    as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialog</p>"
