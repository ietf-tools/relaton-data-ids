    Large Access Providers (LAP). Since a LAP has hundreds of locations, thousands
    of nodes, millions of subscribers, where the law of large number affects the bottom
    line of network operation, a LAP has been always strives to streamline network
    operation functions. The use cases presented in this document are generic with
    respect to the type of network technology and can be augmented with technology-specific
    details. They are intended to be the baseline for other network operation streamlining
    requirements.</p>"
