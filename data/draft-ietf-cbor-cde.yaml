abstract:
- content: <p>CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in
    its Section 4.2, providing some flexibility for application specific decisions.
    To facilitate Deterministic Encoding to be offered as a selectable feature of
    generic encoders, the present document defines a CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding
    (CDE) Profile that can be shared by a large set of applications with potentially
    diverging detailed requirements. This document also introduces the concept of
    Application Profiles, which are layered on top of the CBOR CDE Profile and can
    address more application specific requirements. Application Profiles are defined
    in separate documents.</p>
