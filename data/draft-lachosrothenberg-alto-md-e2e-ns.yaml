abstract:
- content: "<p>Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) are considering the provision
    of value-added and on-demand end-to-end (E2E) network services in multi-domain
    (multi-operator/multi-technology) environments. This document presents different
    initiatives, mainly within standardization efforts and research projects, working
    on E2E network services across multiple domains. Problem statement and a layered
    network model are also described. In addition, this document raises an initial
    proposal towards a new ALTO service in support of E2E network service requirements.
    Finally, another important objective of this document is to begin a discussion
    about motivating use cases in scope of the ALTO WG after the re-chartering process.</p>"
