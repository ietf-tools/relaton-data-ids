abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of heuristics for distinguishing IPsec
    ESP-NULL (Encapsulating Security Payload without encryption) packets from encrypted
    ESP packets. These heuristics can be used on intermediate devices, like traffic
    analyzers, and deep-inspection engines, to quickly decide whether or not a given
    packet flow is encrypted, i.e., whether or not it can be inspected. Use of these
    heuristics does not require any changes made on existing IPsec hosts that are
    compliant with RFC 4303. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
