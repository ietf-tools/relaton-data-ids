abstract:
- content: "<p>The extensibility of Internet protocols is a key factor to their success.
    Yet, their implementations are often not designed with agility in mind. In this
    document, we leverage the features of the QUIC protocol and propose a solution
    to dynamically extend QUIC implementations. Our solution relies on QUIC Plugins
    that allow tuning and extending the QUIC protocol on a per-connection basis. These
    platform-independent plugins are executed inside a sandboxed environment which
    can be included in QUIC implementations. We describe how such plugins can be used
    in different use cases. This document is a straw-man proposal. It aims at sparking
    discussions on the proposed approach.</p>"
