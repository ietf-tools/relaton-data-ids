abstract:
- content: "<p>ACE16x is a simplified version of DUDE [DUDE-02] that requires no 5
    bit or base-32 mapping. ACE16x encoding results in a string that performs as well
    as DUDE technically. Instead of resorting to a quartet-to-quintet mapping mechanism,
    ACE16x simply uses the hex values with an extended hex (16x) scheme for compression.
    In essence, instead of pre-pending an extra bit, ACE16x shifts the last quartet
    of a compressed code point up to another character. Additionally, the 16x value
    is calculable instead of needing to be mapped.</p>"
