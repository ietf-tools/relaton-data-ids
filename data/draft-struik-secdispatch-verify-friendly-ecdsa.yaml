abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to represent ECDSA signatures so as to
    facilitate accelerated verification of single signatures and fast batch verification.
    We demonstrate that this representation technique can be applied retroactively
    by any device (rather than only by the signer), thereby facilitating transitioning
    to always generating ECDSA signatures in this way, without changing standardized
    ECDSA specifications with instantiations with prime- order curves. This facilitates
    verifying devices to reap the significant speed-up potential (ranging from ~1.3x
    to ~6x) fast verification techniques afford.</p>"
