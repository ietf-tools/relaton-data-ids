abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism by which Access Routers on a link
    may automatically assign a consistent identifier to this link to aid in Movement
    Detection. This assists Movement Detection by allowing a Mobile Node to rapidly
    determine whether it has moved to a new link upon reception of a Router Advertisement
    containing this identifier.</p>"
