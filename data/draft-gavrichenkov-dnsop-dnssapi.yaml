abstract:
- content: "<p>Managed DNS services are widely used to maintain DNS zones. Virtually
    all of them have an API of some sort, in most cases an XML- RPC or JSON-RPC API,
    while most of them lack the support of zone transfers. The latter is unlikely
    to change any time soon due to the reasons outlined below. This document describes
    a protocol, a common denominator of existing API protocols, that both a service
    provider and its customer can use to exchange information about DNS zones and
    policies.</p>"
