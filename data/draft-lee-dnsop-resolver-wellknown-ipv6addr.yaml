abstract:
- content: "<p>A host needs to configure itself with its own global unicast IP addresses,
    default gateway IP addresses, and DNS resolver IP addresses. For the IPv6 address
    of DNS resolver, there is need to define alternative automatic configuration mechanism
    that enables for an IPv6 host to configure its own DNS resolver IPv6 addresses
    by itself, even when there is no other additional autoconfiguration mechanism
    applied.</p>"
