abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture based on two levels of addressing.
    A logical addressing level is used to identify logical objects independently of
    their current IP address, such as multicast groups or mobile hosts. This schema
    is then used to define in a unified way mechanisms for inter-domain multicasting
    and mobility.</p>"
