abstract:
- content: <p>RSVP takes a "soft state" scheme to manage the reservation states in
    routers and hosts, the soft states are created and periodically refreshed by Path
    and Resv messages. Soft state scheme gives a simple way to maintain the state
    synchonization between neighbors, but also introduces scalability issue. This
    document provides a framework that describes and discusses the architecture for
    stateless RSVP (SL-RSVP), which disabled the soft-state scheme to improve the
    protocol scalability and the other processes of RSVP are kept. This document does
    not describe specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize this
    architecture.</p>
