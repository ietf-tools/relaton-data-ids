abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure transport protocols often consist of three logically distinct
    components: transport, control (handshake), and record protection. Typically,
    such a protocol contains a single module that is responsible for all three functions.
    However, in many cases, this coupling is unnecessary. For example, while cryptographic
    context and endpoint capabilities need to be known before encrypted application
    data can be sent on a specific transport connection, there is otherwise no technical
    constraint that a cryptographic handshake must be performed on said connection.
    This document recommends a logical separation between transport, control, and
    record components of secure transport protocols. We compare existing protocols
    such as Transport Layer Security, QUIC, and IKEv2+ESP in the context of this logical
    separation.</p>"
