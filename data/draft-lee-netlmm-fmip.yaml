abstract:
- content: "<p>The PMIPv6 protocol provides local mobility to a mobile node without
    requiring any modification of the mobile node. A PMIPv6 domain contains multiple
    MAGs which the mobile node is attached to, and they advertise the same prefix
    to the mobile node so that the mobile node feels like it is always on the same
    link. However, horizontal/ vertical handover still happens while the mobile node
    moves among MAGs in a PMIPv6 domain, and this handover could give undesirable
    delay to mobile nodes running real time applications, such as VoIP. To solve this
    problem, this memo proposes a fast handover for PMIPv6 based on 802.11 networks.
    This scheme uses IAPP to transfer context information like the mobile node's authentication
    information and HNP.</p>"
