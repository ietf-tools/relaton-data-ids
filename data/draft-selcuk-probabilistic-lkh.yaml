abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, the most efficient techniques for multicast key management
    are based on the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) scheme. In current practice, LKH
    trees are organized as balanced binary trees, which give a uniform O(log n) complexity
    for compromise recovery in an n- member group. In this draft, we propose organizing
    the LKH trees with respect to the members' compromise probabilities instead of
    keeping a balanced tree, in a spirit similar to data compression techniques such
    as Huffman and Shannon-Fano coding. We describe two such probabilistic algorithms
    which improve the performance of an LKH scheme by probabilistic organization of
    the tree. Preliminary simulation results show that significant gains can be obtained
    by these techniques.</p>"
