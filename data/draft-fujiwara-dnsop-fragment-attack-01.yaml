abstract:
- content: "<p>Researchers proposed practical DNS cache poisoning attacks using IP
    fragmentation. This document shows feasible and adequate measures at full-service
    resolvers and authoritative servers against these attacks. To protect resolvers
    from these attacks, avoid fragmentation (limit requestor's UDP payload size to
    1220/1232), drop fragmented UDP DNS responses and use TCP at resolver side. To
    make a domain name robust against these attacks, limit EDNS0 Responder's maximum
    payload size to 1220, set DONTFRAG option to DNS response packets and use good
    random fragmentation ID at authoritative server side.</p>"
