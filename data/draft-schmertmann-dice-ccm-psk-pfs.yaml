abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6655 describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    in the Counter with Cipher Block Chaining - Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC)
    Mode (CCM) of operation within Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS
    (DTLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication. The AES-CCM
    algorithm is amenable to compact implementations, making it suitable for constrained
    environments. It has been chosen as one of the preferred cipher suites for use
    with DTLS in the Constrained Application Protocol, CoAP. The present document
    defines additional cipher suites that provide forward secrecy. It also discusses
    an option to replace the Hash- based PRF in RFC 6655 by CMAC, reducing the number
    of cryptographic primitives required for implementation. (The intention is that
    the option is either chosen or not chosen before this document is agreed, not
    that both options are defined.) This document is initially addressed at the DICE
    working group in order to build consensus that there is an actual gap to be filled
    and about the technical parameters of a solution for that gap. Once this is agreed,
    the usual path for agreeing a cipher suite will need to be taken.</p>"
