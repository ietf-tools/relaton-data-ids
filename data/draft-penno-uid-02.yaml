abstract:
- content: "<p>With the advent of Content Delivery Networks and personalized services
    there is a need to uniquely identify a user in oder to be able to offer customized
    services and content. Unfortunately, the IP Internet makes personalizing content
    and services difficult for the providers. With the virtualization of Web resources
    and the widespread use of proxies, an IP address no longer uniquely identifies
    a Web user or destination. So in oder to uniquely identify a user, the service
    provider has to make the identification on the edge (or access) network, before
    the user looses his identity in the core of the network. We present here a overview
    of these techniques available on the different types of access networks.</p>"
