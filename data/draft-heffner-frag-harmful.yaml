abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 fragmentation is not sufficiently robust for use under some conditions
    in today's Internet. At high data rates, the 16-bit IP identification field is
    not large enough to prevent frequent incorrectly assembled IP fragments, and the
    TCP and UDP checksums are insufficient to prevent the resulting corrupted datagrams
    from being delivered to higher protocol layers. This note describes some easily
    reproduced experiments demonstrating the problem, and discusses some of the operational
    implications of these observations. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
