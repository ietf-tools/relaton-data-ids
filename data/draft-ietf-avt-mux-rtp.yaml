abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a method to multiplex a number of low bit rate
    audio streams (upto 256) into a single RTP/UDP/IP connection between IP telephony
    gateways. Audio samples from different users are assem- bled into an RTP payload
    thus reducing the overhead of RTP/UDP/IP headers. To identify users sharing a
    single RTP/UDP/IP connection, a 2 byte MINI-Header is proposed. A channel negotiation
    procedure to assign and release channels on a single UDP connection between gateways
    is described.</p>"
