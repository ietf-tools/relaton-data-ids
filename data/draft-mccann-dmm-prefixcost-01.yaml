abstract:
- content: "<p>In a network implementing Distributed Mobility Management, it has been
    agreed that Mobile Nodes (MNs) should exhibit agility in their use of IP addresses.
    For example, an MN might use an old address for ongoing socket connections but
    use a new, locally assigned address for new socket connections. Determining when
    to assign a new address, and when to release old addresses, is currently an open
    problem. Making an optimal decision about address assignment and release must
    involve a tradeoff in the amount of signaling used to allocate the new addresses,
    the amount of utility that applications are deriving from the use of a previously
    assigned address, and the cost of maintaining an address that was assigned at
    a previous point of attachment. As the MN moves farther and farther from the initial
    point where an address was assigned, more and more resources are used to redirect
    packets destined for that IP address to its current location. The MN currently
    does not know the amount of resources used as this depends on mobility path and
    internal routing topology of the network(s) which are known only to the network
    operator. This document provides a mechanism to communicate to the MN the cost
    of maintaining a given prefix at the MN's current point of attachment so that
    the MN can make better decisions about when to release old addresses and assign
    new ones.</p>"
