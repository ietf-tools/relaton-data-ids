abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple client/server model for supporting
    QOS policies. A router that supports RSVP or one of the proposed differentiated
    service schemes will require a policy database and a means to access it. This
    document describes the extensions to a protocol based originally on RADIUS [1]
    called DIAMETER[2]. This document does not describe the policy database or policy
    enforcement.</p>"
