abstract:
- content: "<p>An SNMP MIB models a managed device as if every one of its objects
    may be atomically read and changed. In reality, many of a device's objects may
    be interdependent. Typically such dependencies are either undocumented or simply
    noted in MIB comments or DESCRIPTION clauses. This draft defines a syntax to capture
    MIB object dependencies and proposes tools for real-world implementation.</p>"
