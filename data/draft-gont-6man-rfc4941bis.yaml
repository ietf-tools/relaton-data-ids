abstract:
- content: "<p>Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate addresses
    using a combination of locally available information and information advertised
    by routers. Addresses are formed by combining network prefixes with an interface
    identifier. This document describes an extension that causes nodes to generate
    global scope addresses from interface identifiers that change over time. Changing
    the interface identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over
    time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors
    to identify when different addresses used in different transactions actually correspond
    to the same node.</p>"
