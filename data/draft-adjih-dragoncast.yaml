- content: "<p>This document describes a Network Coding (NC) based broadcast protocol
    suitable mainly for wireless networks, including mobile ad hoc networks (MANET).
    It provides data dissemination from a single source, based on intra-flow network
    coding and for Internet Protocol (IP). It is designed to minimize the assumptions
