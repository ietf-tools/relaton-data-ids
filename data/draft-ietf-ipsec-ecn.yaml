abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec supports secure communication over potentially insecure network
    components such as intermediate routers. IPsec protocols support two operating
    modes, transport mode and tunnel mode. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
    is an experimental addition to the IP architecture that provides notification
    of onset of congestion to delay- or loss- sensitive applications. ECN provides
    congestion notifications to enable adaptation to network conditions without the
    impact of dropped packets [RFC 2481]. The use of two bits in the IPsec header
    for ECN experimentation conflicts with header processing at IPsec tunnel endpoints
    in a manner that makes ECN unusable in the presence of IPsec tunnels. This document
    considers issues related to this conflict, describes two alternative solutions,
    and updates the IPsec architecture [RFC 2401] to include these alternatives. Support
    for one or the other of these alternatives is REQUIRED to remove the underlying
    conflict.</p>"
