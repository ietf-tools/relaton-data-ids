- content: "<p>This document specifies a new DNS RR type for applications to store
    public keys in. Experience with DNSSEC has indicated that mixing DNS keys and
    application keys is a bad idea in many regards. The new RR expands certain fields
    based on experience from early DNSSEC deployment.</p>"
