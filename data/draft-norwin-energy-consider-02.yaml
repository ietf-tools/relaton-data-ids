abstract:
- content: "<p>With rising cost and an increasing awareness of the environmental impact
    of energy consumption, a desirable feature of networked devices is to be able
    to assess their power state and energy consumption at will. With this data available,
    one can build sophisticated applications such as monitoring applications or even
    active energy management systems. These systems themselves are out of scope of
    this memo, as it discusses only considerations for the monitored devices. Implementation
    specifics such as the definition of a Management Information Base are also outside
    the scope of this document.</p>"
