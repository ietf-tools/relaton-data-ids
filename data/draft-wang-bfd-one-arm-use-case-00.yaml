abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is a fault detection protocol
    that can quickly determine a communication failure between devices and notify
    upper-layer applications [RFC5880]. BFD has asynchronous detecting mode and demand
    detection mode to satisfy different scenarios, also supports echo function to
    reduce the device requirement for BFD. One-Arm BFD this draft descripted supports
    another BFD detecting function rather than the echo as described in [RFC5880]
    [RFC5881], it needs nothing BFD capability to one of the devices deployed BFD
    detecting. Using One-Arm BFD function, the one device works on BFD detecting normally
    and the other device just loopback the BFD packets like echo function. One-Arm
    BFD is suitable for the cloud virtualization network, the One-Arm BFD is deploy
    on NFV gateways, and NFV virtual machine vNICs just enable the echo/ loopback
    process.</p>"
