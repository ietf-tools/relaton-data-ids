abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is submitted as part of the Midcom protocol selection
    process. It evaluates the suitability of the Diameter protocol as a transport
    for Midcom. The general conclusions are:. the Diameter architecture may be too
    heavy for the Midcom application, although this is a matter for discussion. It
    is clear in any event that much of the Diameter base is not needed;. a new application
    extension to Diameter would have to be defined to meet Midcom's requirements;.
    with these reservations, the protocol is a good fit to Midcom requirements. This
    version contains added details describing how to use Diameter to meet the requirements.</p>"
