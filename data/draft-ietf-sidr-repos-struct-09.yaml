abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a profile for the structure of the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI) distributed repository. Each individual repository publication
    point is a directory that contains files that correspond to X.509/PKIX Resource
    Certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists and signed objects. This profile defines
    the object (file) naming scheme, the contents of repository publication points
    (directories), and a suggested internal structure of a local repository cache
    that is intended to facilitate synchronization across a distributed collection
    of repository publication points and to facilitate certification path construction.
