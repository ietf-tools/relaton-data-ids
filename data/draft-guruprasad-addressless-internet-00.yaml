abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft proposes elimination of end-to-end IP addresses
    from the Internet, presenting a stronger embodiment of the end-to-end principle
    by elevating the end-to-end aspects of connectivity and routing above the network
    to an operating system-like framework that implements virtual network addressing
    and efficient translation to switched paths, obviating end-to-end addressing at
    all levels. The resulting flexibility would allow, for example, piecewise transition
    to IPv6 and full access to the existing Internet for the emerging wireless services
    without allocating new addresses.</p>"
