abstract:
- content: <p>The ARK (Archival Resource Key) naming scheme is designed to facilitate
    the high-quality and persistent identification of information objects. The label
    "ark:" marks the start of a core ARK identifier that can be made actionable by
    prepending the beginning of a URL. Meant to be usable after today's networking
    technologies become obsolete, that core should be recognizable in the future as
    a globally unique ARK independent of the URL hostname, HTTP, etc. A founding principle
    of ARKs is that persistence is purely a matter of service and neither inherent
    in an object nor conferred on it by a particular naming syntax. The best any identifier
    can do is lead users to services that support robust reference. A full-functioning
    ARK leads the user to the identified object and, with the "?info" inflection appended,
    returns a metadata record and a commitment statement that is both human- and machine-readable.
    Tools exist for minting, binding, and resolving ARKs. Responsibility for this
    Document The ARK Alliance Technical Working Group [ARKAtech] is responsible for
    the content of this Internet Draft. The group homepage lists monthly meeting notes
    and agendas starting from March 2019. Revisions of the spec are maintained on
    github at [ARKdrafts].</p>
