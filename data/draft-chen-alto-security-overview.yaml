abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the security mechanisms that
    are probably fit for ALTO. Specifically it discusses those mechanisms for authentication,
    encryption and attack-preventing. The goal of this draft is to list and analyze
    the existing security mechanisms, and to explore suitable solutions to guarantee
    the security of ALTO protocol. This draft is a very early draft to outline the
    possible security mechanisms and leaves considerable contents and details to be
    added later.</p>"
