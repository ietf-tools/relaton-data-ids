- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to BGP-4 to enable the exchange of
    information about detected malicious traffic (e.g., Distributed Denial of Service
    Attacks) and provide options for coordinated, collaborative responses to mitigate
    such traffic. The extensions are backward compatible - a BGP speaker that supports
    the extensions can interoperate with speakers that do not support the extensions.</p>"
