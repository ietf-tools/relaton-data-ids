abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when the
    signing operation is performed cooperatively between two parties. When performing
    two-party signing, the first party typically hashes the data to be signed and
    the second party signs the hashed data computed by the first party. This can be
    useful when communication with the party holding the signing private key occurs
    over a limited- bandwidth channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
    in which it is infeasible to send the complete set of data to be signed. The resulting
    signatures are identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and
    can be verified using the same verification procedure without additional steps
    to preprocess the signed data.</p>"
