abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an additional policy with last calls regarding
    Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosures or other knowledge of IPR. The
    existence and the pointer to the IPR disclosures or an indication of non-existence
    of knowledge of such disclosures must be mentioned in all IETF last calls and
    should be mentioned in working group last calls. Additionally, all documents under
    the IETF change control for which a last call prior to the approval was not required
    and IPR disclosures are known, must now be either last-called or rejected. This
    memo updates RFC 2026 and RFC 2418.</p>"
