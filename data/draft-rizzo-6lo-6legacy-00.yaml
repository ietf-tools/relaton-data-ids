abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 is an important enabler of the Internet of Things, since it provides
    an addressing space large enough to encompass a vast and ubiquitous set of sensors
    and devices, allowing them to interconnect and interact seamlessly. Many of those
    devices presently are based on networking technologies other than IP. In order
    to include them into an IPv6 based Internet of Things, a mechanism for assigning
    an IPv6 address to each of them is required. The only existing proposal for a
    standard way of assigning an IPv6 address to devices which do not support IPv6
    or IPv4, is very generic, it leaves many problems unsolved and it is nowadays
    inadequate to cope with the new scenarios opened by the Internet of Things. This
    document defines a mechanism, 6TONon-IP, for assigning automatically an IPv6 address
    to devices which do not support IPv6 or IPv4, in a way which minimizes the chances
    of address conflicts, and of frequent configuration changes due to instability
    of connection among devices. Such a mapping mechanism enables stateless autoconfiguration
    for legacy technology devices, allowing them to to interconnect through the Internet
    and to fully integrate into a world wide scale IPv6 IoT.</p>"
