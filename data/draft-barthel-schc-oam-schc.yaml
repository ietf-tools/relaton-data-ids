abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes ICMPv6 compression with SCHC and how basic
    OAM is performed on Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) by compressing ICMPv6/IPv6
    headers and by protecting the LPWAN network and the Device from undesirable ICMPv6
    traffic. With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained networks, users expect
    to be able to Operate, Administer and Maintain them with the familiar tools and
    protocols they already use on less constrained networks. OAM uses specific messages
    sent into the data plane to measure some parameters of a network. Most of the
    time, no explicit values are sent is these messages. Network parameters are obtained
    from the analysis of these specific messages. This can be used: * To detect if
    a host is up or down. * To measure the RTT and its variation over time. * To learn
    the path used by packets to reach a destination. OAM in LPWAN is a little bit
    trickier since the bandwidth is limited and extra traffic added by OAM can introduce
    perturbation on regular transmission. Three main scenarios are investigated: *
    OAM reachability messages coming from internet. In that case, the SCHC core should
    act as a proxy and handle specifically the OAM traffic. * OAM messages initiated
    by LPWAN devices: They can be anticipated by the core SCHC. * OAM error messages
    coming from internet. In that case, the SCHC core may forward a compressed version
    to the device. The primitive functionalities of OAM are achieved with the ICMPv6
    protocol. ICMPv6 defines messages that inform the source of IPv6 packets of errors
    during packet delivery. It also defines the Echo Request/ Reply messages that
    are used for basic network troubleshooting (ping command). ICMPv6 messages are
    transported on IPv6. This document also introduces the notion of actions in a
    SCHC rule, to perform locally some operations.</p>"
