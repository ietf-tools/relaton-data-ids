- content: "<p>Application Layer Gateway (ALG) has been widely implemented and used
    to support address and port translation in the payload for some well- known protocols.
    Due to the lackness of standardization on addressing ALG related issues, a number
    of serious problems are faced by service deployments and upgrades. This document
    specifies the common problems for ALG in various aspects. In addition, some collected
    feedbacks are also listed as the next steps to tackle these problems.</p>"
