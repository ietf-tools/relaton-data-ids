abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an initial application of IP and ARP in an MCNS Community
    Access Television (CATV) Residential Access Network environment where the cable
    system is used for bi-directional data transfer. The MCNS network provides a traditional
    Ethernet or 802.2 link layer service between a cable system head end and the customer
    premises using the cable television system infrastructure. This interface is available
    via IEEE 802.1D layer services to support IP residential access networking services.
    In this memo, the term Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) is defined to apply to traditional
    IP over Ethernet operating over MCNS services. The recommendations in this draft
    rely on existing IETF standards for IP and ARP over Broadcast Ethernet networks.</p>"
