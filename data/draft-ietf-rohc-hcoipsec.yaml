abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Security (IPsec) provides various security services for IP traffic.
    However, the benefits of IPsec come at the cost of increased overhead. This document
    outlines a framework for integrating Robust Header Compression (ROHC) over IPsec
    (ROHCoIPsec). By compressing the inner headers of IP packets, ROHCoIPsec proposes
    to reduce the amount of overhead associated with the transmission of traffic over
    IPsec Security Associations (SAs). This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
