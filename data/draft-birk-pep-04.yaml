abstract:
- content: "<p>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of
    conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to
    the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end- to-end interpersonal
    messaging. These include, but are not limited to, key management, key discovery,
    and private key handling (including peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys
    and other user data across devices). Human Rights-enabling principles like Data
    Minimization, End-to-End and Interoperability are explicit design goals. For the
    goal of usable privacy, pEp introduces means to verify communication between peers
    and proposes a trust-rating system to denote secure types of communications and
    signal the privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level. Significantly,
    the pEp protocols build on already available security formats and message transports
    (e.g., PGP/MIME with email), and are written with the intent to be interoperable
    with already widely- deployed systems in order to ease adoption and implementation.
    This document outlines the general design choices and principles of pEp.</p>"
