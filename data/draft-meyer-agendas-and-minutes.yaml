abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2418 outlines the procedures for IETF Session operation. However,
    it contains little information about post-IETF meeting working group chair responsibilities.
    In particular, it provides little guidance with respect to either form or submission
    deadlines for the artifacts of the meeting, namely, session minutes and presentation
    materials. This document addresses the form and content of Working Group agendas
    and minutes.</p>"
