abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft presents a new scheme that enables the simultaneous
    re-authentication of a group of nodes in an efficient manner. The Internet-Draft
    proposes to aggregate the re- authentications of multiple network nodes members
    of the same group. The scheme is based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) framework, defined in RFC 3748. As an example of operation, a method inspired
    from EAP-GPSK RFC 5433, is provided.</p>"
