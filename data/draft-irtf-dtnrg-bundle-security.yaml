- content: "<p>This document defines the bundle security protocol, which provides
    data integrity and confidentiality services for the Bundle Protocol. Separate
    capabilities are provided to protect the bundle payload and additional data that
    may be included within the bundle. We also describe various security considerations
    including some policy options. This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant
    Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to
    its publication as an RFC were raised. This document defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.</p>"
