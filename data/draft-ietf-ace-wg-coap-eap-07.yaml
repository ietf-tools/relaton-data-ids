abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP) transported employing Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) messages. As such, it defines an EAP lower layer based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.
    One of the main goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled IoT device (EAP peer)
    that intends to join a security domain managed by a Controller (EAP authenticator).
    Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between
    them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling
    the establishment of a security association between them.</p>"
