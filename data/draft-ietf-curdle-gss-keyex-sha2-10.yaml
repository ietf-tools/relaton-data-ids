- content: "<p>This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC 4462. It defines
    a new key exchange method that uses SHA-2 for integrity and deprecates weak Diffie-Hellman
    (DH) groups. The purpose of this specification is to modernize the cryptographic
    primitives used by Generic Security Service (GSS) key exchanges.</p>"
