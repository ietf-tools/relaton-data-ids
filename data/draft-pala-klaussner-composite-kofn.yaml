abstract:
- content: "<p>With the need to evolve the cryptography used in today applications,
    devices, and networks, there are many scenarios where the use of a single-algorithm
    is not sufficient. For example, there might be the need for migrating between
    two existing algorithms because of a weakening of earlier generations (e.g., from
    classic or traditional to post-quantum or quantum-safe). Another example might
    involve the need to test, instead, the capabilities of devices via test drivers
    and/or non-standard algorithms. Another very common case is the need to combine
    certified cryptography (e.g., FIPS) with newer algorithms that are not yet certified
    or that are not planned for certification. This work extends the options provided
    by Explicit Composite, defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs], by providing
    a mechanism to manage backward and forward compatibility via k-of-n signature
    validation procedures. This document provides the definition of a new type of
    the kofn- CompositePublicKey and kofn-CompositeSignature which are aligned with
    the definitions of the respective structures for Explicit Composite [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs].</p>"
