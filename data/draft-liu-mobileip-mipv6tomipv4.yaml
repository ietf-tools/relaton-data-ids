abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for Mobile IPv6 nodes of IPv6 Site
    to continue utilizing Mobile IPv6 services when they roam into IPv4 domains. The
    mechanism is based on Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 glued together by IPv4 encapsulation
    for delivering IPv6 packets between the Mobile IPv6 nodes and their Mobile IPv6
    home agents. To support the mechanism specified in this draft, the Mobile IPv6
    nodes MUST be Mobile IPv4 capable and MUST NOT utilize Mobile IPv6 route optimization
    when in IPv4 domain, and some of the border routers of the site MUST be capable
    to act as Mobile IPv4 home agent(s). The IPv6 site does not need to run 6to4 protocol,
    however.</p>"
