abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes a framework, consistent with the model
    defined in the PINT group in the IETF, for controlling voice and voice-band data
    (e.g., FAX) calls on the PSTN from an IP Client. As such, it is solely concerned
    with call control and associated functions. It is not concerned with how to convert
    packetized voice into a form suitable for carriage over the PSTN. We introduce
    a logical entity (called CallBroker) that initiates and manages calls on the PSTN
    and controls the session on behalf of an IP Client to establish a telephone connection
    between two or more end points specified by the customer (i.e., IP Client). By
    way of this session, as mediated by the Call Broker, the customer can set up calls
    and receive notifications regarding the status of the calls and its participants.
    The interface between the CallBroker and the Service Control Function (as defined
    in the work on Intelligent Network Standards in ITU-T) in the Service Node (SN)
    in the PSTN will be defined and standardized as part of this activity. The interface
    between the IP client and the CallBroker also nees to be defined and standardized
    as part of this activity. This Internet Draft further advances the discussion
    on the issues involved in interconnecting the Internet and the Public Switched
    Telephone Networks (PSTNs), focusing on potential interfaces between Internet-based
    entities and Intelligent Network (I.N.) entities. The services identified and
    discussed earlier (e.g., Click-to-Dial, Click-to-FAX, etc.) can be provided using
    the architecture identified here.</p>"
