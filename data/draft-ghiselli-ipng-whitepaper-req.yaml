- content: "<p>This white paper is sent by INFN network team, the Italian National
    Institute for nuclear phisics, whose network, named INFNet, is a nationwide network
    founded to provide the access to existing national and international HEP laboratory
    and to facilitate communications between the researchers. With this paper we would
    like to emphasize the key points that we would to consider if charged with IPng
    plan. We do not really expect to add original items to the selection, but we think
    that it could be useful to submit the opinions and ideas that come from our network
    experience.</p>"
