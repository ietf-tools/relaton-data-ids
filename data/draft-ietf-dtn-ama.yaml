abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a management architecture suitable for deployment
    in challenged networking environments for the configuration, monitoring, and local
    control of application services. Challenged networking environments exhibit interruptions
    in end-to- end connectivity and communications delays that are both long-lived
    and unpredictable. Even in these challenging conditions, such networks must provide
    some type of end-to-end information transport and fault protection while also
    supporting configuration and performance reporting. This management may need to
    operate without human- or system-in-the-loop synchronous interactivity and without
    the preservation of transport-layer sessions. In such a context, challenged networks
    must exhibit behavior that is both determinable and autonomous while maintaining
    as much compatibility with non- challenged-network operational concepts as possible.
    The architecture described in this document is termed the Asynchronous Management
    Architecture (AMA). The AMA supported two types of asynchronous behavior. First,
    the AMA does not presuppose any synchronized transport behavior between managed
    and managing devices. Second, the AMA does not support any query-response semantics.
    In this way, the AMA allows for operation in extremely challenging conditions,
    to include over uni-directional links and cases where delays/disruptions would
    otherwise prevent operation over traditional transport layers, such as when exceeding
    the Maximum Segment Lifetime (MSL) of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).</p>"
