abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two additional MIME content-transfer-encodings,
    deflate-8bit and deflate-base64. Adding these CTEs to MIME that provide facilities
    for loss-less, adaptive, general-purpose compression. The first of these, deflate-8bit,
    produces 8bit output, while the second, deflate-base64, produces the same sort
    of output as the base64 content-transfer-encoding defined in RFC 2045.</p>"
