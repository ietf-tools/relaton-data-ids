abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework to define Interface to In-Network
    Computing Functions (I2ICF) for user services both on the network- level and application-level.
    In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) include In-Network Network Functions (INF),
    defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN). ICFs also include In-Network Application Functions (IAF) which
    appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles
    (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This document describes an I2ICF framework,
    which includes components and interfaces to configure and monitor the ICFs that
    implement applications and services.</p>"
