abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a revised Version 3 of the Internet Group Management
    Protocol, IGMPv3. IGMP is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to report their IP
    multicast group memberships to neighboring multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP
    adds support for source filtering, that is, the ability for a system to report
    interest in receiving packets only from specific source addresses, or from all
    but specific source addresses, sent to a particular multicast address. That information
    may be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets
    from specific sources to networks where there are no interested receivers. This
    document obsoletes RFC 3376.</p>"
