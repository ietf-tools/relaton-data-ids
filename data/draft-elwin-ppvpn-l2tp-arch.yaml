abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of L2TP for establishing PPVPNs. It
    proposes to use L2TP for VPN membership, topology discovery, and as a tunneling
    mechanism. The basic idea is based on leveraging the inherent strengths of L2TP
    for tunneling traffic, and extend the same advantages to PPVPNS. The mechanism
    is applicable for both Layer2 and Layer3 PPVPNs.</p>"
