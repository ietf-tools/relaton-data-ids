abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework to build HIP (Host Identity Protocol)-based
    overlay networks. This framework uses HIP to perform connection management. Other
    functions, such as data storage and retrieval or overlay maintenance, are implemented
    using protocols other than HIP. These protocols are loosely referred to as peer
    protocols.</p>"
