abstract:
- content: '<p>Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has
    no staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel to the location
    to perform the initial install and configuration, even in shared facilities with
    "remote-hands" type support. In many cases, this could be avoided if there were
    an easy way to transfer the initial configuration to a new device, while still
    maintaining confidentiality of the configuration. This document extends existing
    vendor proprietary auto-install to provide confidentiality to initial configuration
    during bootstrapping of the device. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([])
    is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general
    musings, etc. They will be removed before publication. This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft- wkumari-opsawg-sdi.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. ] [ Ed note: This document
    introduces concepts and serves as the basic for discussion. Because of this, it
    is conversational, and would need to be firmed up before being published ]</p>'
