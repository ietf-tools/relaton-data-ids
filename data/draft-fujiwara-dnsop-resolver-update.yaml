abstract:
- content: <p>Parent side NS RRSet and glue records are all information to access
    servers for child zone. However, they may be overwritten by child zone data (zone
    apex NS RRSet and other A/AAAA RRSets). The overwrite makes name resolution unstable
    and induces vulnerabilities. RFC 2181 section 5.4.1 specifies trustworthiness
    of DNS data. And it is deemed that that all cached data (authoritative data, non-
    authoritative data, referrals and glue records) are merged into one. Resolvers
    may answer non-authoritative data, referrals and glue records that should not
    be returned. This document proposes updating resolver algorithm that separates
    the cache to "authoritative data cache" and "delegation cache". The former is
    used to answer stub resolvers, and the latter is used to iterate zones.</p>
