abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document the concept of a so-called Driving Policy is pre-
    sented. A Driving Policy determines the behavior of an AAA server (Authentication,
    Authorization, Accounting) when it is confronted with a specific message type
    of the AAA protocol. The first part of this document defines the role of a Driving
    Policy and how it fits into the AAA concept. According to the model presented,
    the main task of a Driving Policy is to describe which pre-conditions have to
    be checked before the corresponding actions, needed to fulfill an incoming AAA
    request, can be called, and how to deal with the post-conditions of these actions.
    In the second part a grammar is proposed for these Driving Policies accompanied
    by the necessary comments about the semantics.</p>"
