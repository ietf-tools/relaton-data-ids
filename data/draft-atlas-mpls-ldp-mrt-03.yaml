abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol(LDP)
    to support the creation of label-switched paths for Maximally Redundant Trees
    (MRT). A prime use of MRTs is for unicast and multicast IP/LDP Fast-Reroute, which
    we will refer to as MRT-FRR. The sole protocol extension to LDP is simply the
    ability to advertise an MRT Capability. This document describes that extension
    and the associated behavior expected for LSRs and LERs advertising the MRT Capability.
    MRT-FRR uses LDP multi-topology extensions and requires three different multi-topology
    IDs to be allocated from the LDP MT-ID space.</p>"
