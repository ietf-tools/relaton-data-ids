abstract:
- content: "<p>BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA) based on tunnel
    bonding protocols and Multipath TCP (MPTCP) are two different technology suites
    that offer subscribers with higher bandwidth and reliability. MPTCP excels at
    conducting TCP traffic since its flow/congestion control scheme has been well
    developed while tunnel bonding protocols support not only TCP traffic but also
    UDP traffic. The integration of the two kinds of technologies can be considered
    to make use of advantages of both. Moreover, extensions made to the tunnel bonding
    protocols can simplify the MPTCP stack and keep it intact. This document specifies
    the extensions for tunnel bonding protocols to realize integrative deployment
    of tunnel bonding solutions and MPTCP.</p>"
