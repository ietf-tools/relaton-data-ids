abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the application of policy based traffic engineering
    techniques to load-balancing in MPLS networks. The objective is not to mandate
    a specific policy, but to (a) provide an example of a policy based approach to
    a traffic engineering problem and (b) elucidate a range of potential policies
    related to load balancing as a traffic engineering objective as guidance for the
    development of a Policy Information Base (PIB) for MPLS networks.</p>"
