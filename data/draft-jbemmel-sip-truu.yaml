abstract:
- content: "<p>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
    a user agent (UA) to construct a URI which can only be used to route messages
    to that specific UA instance for a time limited period, for example only for the
    duration of a particular call. A URI whose lifetime is controlled by the UA instance
    to which it indirectly routes is called a Temporarily Routable UA URI (TRUU).
    This document describes an extension to SIP for obtaining a TRUU from a registrar,
    and for using this TRUU as a Contact.</p>"
