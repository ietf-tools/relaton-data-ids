abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational draft presents results of a study on using different
    drop precedence assignments to address fairness issues when UDP and TCP traffic
    share the same Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB class. In particular, six different
    possible combinations of drop precedence assignment were explored with two different
    models of RED parameter settings. We present results showing that the type of
    RED model utilized can play a role in the nature of bandwidth sharing between
    TCP and UDP flows. The results also show that with the current four Class, three
    Drop Precedence AF specification, complete fairness between TCP and UDP cannot
    be completely achieved using separate drop precedence assignment. This is true
    for both under-provisioned networks and over-provisioned networks. Certain drop
    precedence mapping schemes are beneficial to TCP while others are beneficial for
    UDP.</p>"
