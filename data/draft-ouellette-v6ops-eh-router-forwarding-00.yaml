abstract:
- content: "<p>It has become accepted that packets containing IPv6 Extension Headers,
    especially Hop-by-hop Options, are frequently dropped on the Internet. However,
    the question still remains as to why they get dropped and what type of devices
    may be dropping them. This document describes research conducted to isolate routers
    in a simple topology, with minimal configuration, and shows that router implementations
    alone are likely not the cause of packets containing IPv6 Extension Headers being
    dropped on the Internet.</p>"
