abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a framework of supporting multicast traffic,
    , in a network that uses Network Virtualization using Overlays over Layer 3 (NVO3).
    Both infrastructure multicast and application- specific multicast are discussed.
    It describes the various mechanisms and considerations that can be used for delivering
    such traffic as well as the data plane and control plane considerations for each
    of the mechanisms.</p>"
