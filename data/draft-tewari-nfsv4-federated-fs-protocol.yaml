abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a file system federation protocol that enables
    file access and namespace traversal across collections of independently administered
    fileservers. The protocol specifies a set of interfaces by which fileservers and
    collections of fileservers with different administrators can form a fileserver
    federation that provides a namespace composed of the filesystems physically hosted
    on and exported by the constituent fileservers.</p>"
