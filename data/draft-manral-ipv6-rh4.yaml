abstract:
- content: "<p>The functionality provided by IPv6's Type 0 Routing Header can be exploited
    in order to achieve traffic amplification over a remote path for the purposes
    of generating denial-of-service traffic. This document updates the IPv6 specification
    to the use of a new IPv6 Type 4 Routing Header, in light of this security concern.
    This new header provides the same functionality of the Routing Header Type-0,
    while taking care of the major security concerns defined in the draft [draft-ietf-ipv6-deprecate-rh0-01].</p>"
