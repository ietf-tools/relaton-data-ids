abstract:
- content: "<p>The design of the core QUIC transport and the mapping of HTTP semantics
    over it subsume many HTTP/2 features, prominent among them stream multiplexing
    and HTTP header compression. A key advantage of the QUIC transport is that provides
    stream multiplexing free of HoL blocking between streams, while in HTTP/2 multiplexed
    streams can suffer HoL blocking primarily due to HTTP/2's layering above TCP.
    However, assuming HPACK is used for header compression, HTTP over QUIC is still
    vulnerable to HoL blocking, because of how HPACK exploits header redundancies
    between multiplexed HTTP transactions. This draft defines QCRAM, a variation of
    HPACK and mechanisms in the QUIC HTTP mapping that allow QUIC implementations
    the flexibility to avoid header-compression induced HoL blocking.</p>"
