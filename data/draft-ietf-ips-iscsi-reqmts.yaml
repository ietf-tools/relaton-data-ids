abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP Storage Working group is chartered with developing comprehensive
    technology to transport block storage data over IP protocols. This effort includes
    a protocol to transport the Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) protocol over
    the Internet (iSCSI). The initial version of the iSCSI protocol will define a
    mapping of SCSI transport protocol over TCP/IP so that SCSI storage controllers
    (principally disk and tape arrays and libraries) can be attached to IP networks,
    notably Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GbE).</p>"
