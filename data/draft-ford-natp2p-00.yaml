abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and recommends methods by which peer-to-peer
    (P2P) applications can operate efficiently in the presence of Network Address
    Translation (NAT). This document also provides recommendations for the design
    of network address translators, in order for them to support P2P applications
    effectively without compromising security or performance. This memo focuses on
    the interaction of P2P with NAT in the absence of any special proxy, gateway,
    or relaying protocols. While not intending to preclude the use of such protocols,
    the goal of this memo is to enable P2P applications to function automatically
    without specific knowledge of the type, location, or configuration of the NAT.</p>"
