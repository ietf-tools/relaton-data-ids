abstract:
- content: "<p>Making the Internet faster is the goal of many product and service
    companies. Many strategies exist, from data caching to packet switching, performance
    improvements in Internet browser clients and server software, without forgetting
    the transport network scaling from the fiber core to the access edges. This report
    investigates two proposed protocol enhancements aimed at making the web browsing
    user experience better by optimizing the transport of web objects and thereby
    reducing the page load time. The two enhancements are SPDY, a replacement of the
    HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requiring client and server changes, and a
    TCP tune-up, an increase in the TCP initial congestion window accomplished by
    a setting change on the web servers. Both show promise, but there are some caveats,
    particularly with SPDY. SPDY is a candidate for standardization as HTTP/2.0. In
    addition to a discussion of the two enhancements, this report provides the results
    of laboratory testing on SPDY version 2 and the proposed increase in the TCP initial
    congestion window in a variety of simulated conditions, comparing the page load
    time when using the proposed enhancement to the page load time for the default
    case of HTTPS and current initial congestion window settings. The proposed enhancements
    generate mixed results: web page load times were reduced in some scenarios but
    increased significantly in others. The performance improvement (or degradation)
    varied depending on the number of servers, configuration of the initial TCP congestion
    window, and especially any network packet loss. The following results were obtained
    across all scenarios comparing SPDY and congestion window enhancements to standard
    HTTPS. o Average reduction in page load time was 29% o Best improvement was over
    78% reduction in page load time o Worst cases showed a negative impact, resulting
    in a 3.3x increase in page load time These results lead us to the following conclusions:
    o The SPDY protocol is currently a moving target, and thus it would be challenging
    to realize a return on investment for general- purpose usage in web servers. o
    Protocol improvements, standardization in the IETF and wider adoption by the client/server
    software may warrant a second look at SPDY. o Some applications in controlled
    environments may gain by leveraging SPDY. SPDY might be a valuable tool where
    the a single entity provides the servers, the client software, and the web content.
    o If SPDY were adopted very widely it may have some secondary benefits for network
    operators through improved infrastructure scalability due to a significant reduction
    in concurrent TCP sessions, as well as a reduction in Packets Per Second. o The
    proposed increase in the TCP initial congestion window is straightforward, requires
    no client modifications, and on its own provides consistent (albeit modest) performance
    gains. This report is available in a somewhat more detailed form in [SPDY-ANALYSIS].</p>"
