abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal describes proposed language for the 822bis draft, draft-ietf-drums-msg-fmt-03.txt,
    that clarifies the semantics of the Reply-To header. The intention is to clarify
    the rather vague language in 822bis in a way which preserves compatibility with
    the largest possible subset of existing mail user agents. This document should
    be read in conjunction with Jacob Palme's Mail-Followup-To proposal (draft-ietf-drums-mail-followup-to-00.txt),
    which the working group chair, Jacob Palme and the author regard as a natural
    complement of this proposal.</p>"
