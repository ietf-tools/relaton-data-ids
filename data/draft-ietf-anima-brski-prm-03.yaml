abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines enhancements to bootstrapping a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995]) to facilitate bootstrapping in domains featuring
    no or only timely limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar.
    It specifically targets situations, in which the interaction model changes from
    a pledge-initiator-mode, as used in BRSKI, to a pledge-responder-mode as described
    in this document. To support both, BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar- agent
    component, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during
    the bootstrapping phase. For the establishment of a trust relation between pledge
    and domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained
    objects (signature-wrapped objects). The defined approach is agnostic regarding
    the utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the domain registrar to communicate
    with the Domain CA.</p>"
