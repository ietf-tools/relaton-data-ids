- content: "<p>With the development of DDoS defense technologies, the interfaces and
    parameters defined by DOTS are no longer sufficient to support the collaborative
    signaling required between DDoS mitigation systems. This document defines three
    YANG model to extend the data models of existing interfaces on the DOTS signaling

    information between DDoS mitigation systems via DOTS and enabling efficient collaborative
    mitigation based on this information.</p>"
