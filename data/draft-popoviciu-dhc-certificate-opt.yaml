- content: "<p>The Certificate options for DHCP-PD RFC3633 [4] provide a mechanism
    to deliver, along with the IPv6 prefix, the certificate or the information needed
    to obtain a certificate entitling the client router to advertise the prefix delegated
    to it. This information is neccesary if Secure Neighbor Discovery RFC3971 [6]
    is used by the devices connected to the DHCP-PD client router.</p>"
