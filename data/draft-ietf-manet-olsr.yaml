abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol
    for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization of the classical link
    state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN. The key
    concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected
    nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique
    substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding
    mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first
    copy of the message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes
    elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number
    of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node
    may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as
    contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is
    distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation.
    OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is particularly
    suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this
    context.</p>"
