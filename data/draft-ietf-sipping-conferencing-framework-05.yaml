abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation, modification,
    and termination of media sessions between user agents. These sessions are managed
    by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents.
    Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party communications
    (such as a phone call), is obvious. Communications sessions with multiple participants,
    generally known as conferencing, are more complicated. This document defines a
    framework for how such conferencing can occur. This framework describes the overall
    architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-party conferencing.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
