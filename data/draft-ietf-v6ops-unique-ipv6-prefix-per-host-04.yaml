abstract:
- content: "<p>In some IPv6 environments, the need has arisen for hosts to be able
    to utilize a unique IPv6 prefix, even though the link or media may be shared.
    Typically hosts (subscribers) on a shared network, either wired or wireless, such
    as Ethernet, WiFi, etc., will acquire unique IPv6 addresses from a common IPv6
    prefix that is allocated or assigned for use on a specific link. In most deployments
    today, IPv6 address assignment from a single IPv6 prefix on a shared network is
    done by either using IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) and/or
    stateful DHCPv6. While this is still viable and operates as designed, there are
    some large scale environments where this concept introduces significant performance
    challenges and implications, specifically related to IPv6 router and neighbor
    discovery. This document outlines an approach utilising existing IPv6 protocols
    to allow hosts to be assigned a unique IPv6 prefix (instead of a unique IPv6 address
    from a shared IPv6 prefix). Benefits of unique IPv6 prefix over a unique IPv6
    address from the service provider include improved subscriber isolation and enhanced
    subscriber management.</p>"
