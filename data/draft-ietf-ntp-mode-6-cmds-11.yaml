abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the structure of the control messages that
    were historically used with the Network Time Protocol before the advent of more
    modern control and management approaches. These control messages have been used
    to monitor and control the Network Time Protocol application running on any IP
    network attached computer. The information in this document was originally described
    in Appendix B of RFC 1305. The goal of this document is to provide an updated
    description of the control messages described in RFC 1305 in order to conform
    with the updated Network Time Protocol specification documented in RFC 5905. The
    publication of this document is not meant to encourage the development and deployment
    of these control messages. This document is only providing a current reference
    for these control messages given the current status of RFC 1305.</p>"
