abstract:
- content: "<p>Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can create
    an association between endpoints known as a dialog. Some of these methods can
    also create a different, but related, association within an existing dialog. These
    multiple associations, or dialog usages, require carefully coordinated processing
    as they have independent life-cycles, but share common dialog state. Processing
    multiple dialog usages correctly is not completely understood. What is understood
    is difficult to implement. This memo argues that multiple dialog usages should
    be avoided. It discusses alternatives to their use and clarifies essential behavior
    for elements that cannot currently avoid them. This is an informative document
    and makes no normative statements of any kind. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
