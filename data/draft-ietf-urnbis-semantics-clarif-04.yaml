abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience has shown that identifiers associated with persistent names
    have properties and requirements that may be somewhat different from identifiers
    associated with the locations of objects. This is especially true when such names
    are expected to be stable for a very long time or when they identify large and
    complex entities. In order to allow Uniform Resource Names (URNs) to evolve to
    meet the needs of the Library, Museum, Publisher, and Information Science communities
    and other users, this specification separates URNs from the semantic constraints
    that many people believe are part of the specification for Uniform Resource Identifiers
    (URIs) in RFC 3986, updating that document accordingly. The syntax of URNs is
    still constrained to that of RFC 3986, so generic URI parsers are unaffected by
    this change.</p>"
