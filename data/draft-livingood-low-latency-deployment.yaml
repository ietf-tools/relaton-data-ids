abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized experimental
    RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and new Non-Queue-Building
    (NQB) per hop behavior. These documents do a good job of describing a new architecture
    and protocol for deploying low latency networking. But as is normal for many such
    standards, especially those in experimental status, certain deployment design
    decisions are ultimately left to implementers. This document explores the potential
    implications of key deployment design decisions and makes recommendations for
    those decisions that may help drive adoption.</p>"
