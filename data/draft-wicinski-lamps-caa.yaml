abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC6844] defines the Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS
    Resource Record type to specify one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) authorized
    to issue certificates for that domain name. With large domains covering multiple
    web properties, defining all possible certificate authorities for the domain has
    security implications. It would be beneficial to define a CAA for individual host
    names. This will allow CAA records that can be managed with fine grain control.
    This document provides an alternative CAA record using a _caa prefix label that
    will take precedent on a per Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), if it exists.
    It will override any CAA record at the zone apex. This will not change current
    CAA record behavior, but will be an additional option.</p>"
