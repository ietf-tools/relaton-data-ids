abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure MIME (S/MIME) defined a method of placing security labels on
    a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object. These labels are placed as part of
    the data signed and validated by the parties. This means that the message content
    is visible to the recipient prior to the label enforcement. A new model for enforcement
    of policy using a third party is described in RFC TBD [I-D.freeman-plasma-requirements].
    This is the Policy Augmented S/ MIME (PLASMA) system. This document provides the
    details needed to implement the new Plasma model in the CMS infrastructure. An
    additional benefit of using the Plasma module is that the server, based on policy,
    manages who has access to the message and how the keys are protected. The document
    details how the client encryption and decryption processes are performed, defines
    how to construct the CMS recipient info structure, a new content to hold the data
    required for the Plasma server to store the keys and policy information. The document
    does not cover the protocol between the client and the Plasma policy enforcement
    server. One example of the client/server protocol can be found in RFC TBD [I-D.schaad-plasma-service].</p>"
