abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a RESET_STREAM frame to reset a stream. When
    a sender resets a stream, it stops retransmitting STREAM frames for this stream.
    On the receiver side, there is no guarantee that any of the data sent on that
    stream is delivered to the application. This document defines a new QUIC frame,
    the CLOSE_STREAM frame, that allows closing and resetting of a stream, while guaranteeing
    reliable delivery of stream data up to a certain byte offset.</p>"
