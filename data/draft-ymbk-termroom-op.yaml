abstract:
- content: "<p>Creating and running the 'terminal room' for an IETF meeting is tantamount
    to building, running, and dismantling a small computer center. Although this is
    a well-known area of operations, the unique environment and its ephemeral nature
    warrant passing on the lore in a mildly organized fashion. It is expected that
    this document will be updated regularly. However, it is not clear that this will
    ever be published as an RFC. As the IETF can ill afford failure of this service,
    it is assumed that the host and organizers have the experience and resources to
    build such environments, understand power facilities, cabling, WAN and LAN building,
    workstation provisioning, staffing, etc. So this document does not attempt to
    detail how to build computer facilities or carry out prudent project management.
    Rather it concentrates on the unique aspects of the IETF 'terminal room'.</p>"
