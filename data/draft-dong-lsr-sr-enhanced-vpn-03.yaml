abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require enhanced isolation and have more
    stringent performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional
    overlay VPNs. An enhanced VPN may be used for 5G transport network slicing, and
    will also be of use in more generic scenarios. To meet the requirement of enhanced
    VPN services, a number of Virtual Transport Networks (VTN) need to be created,
    each with a subset of the underlay network topology and a set of network resources
    allocated to meet the requirement of a specific VPN+ service, or a group of VPN+
    services. This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with necessary extensions
    to build a set of Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs. The VTNs could be used as the
    underlay of enhanced VPN service. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both
    Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data
    plane (SRv6).</p>"
