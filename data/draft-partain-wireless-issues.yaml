abstract:
- content: "<p>The rapidly growing popularity of IP and its flexibility make it a
    good candidate to be used for transmission in cellular networks. Using IP-based
    transport on the wired transmission links in the cellular networks gives operators
    an opportunity to upgrade their transport network to a packet-based one. When
    compared with a traditional STM-based system, the gain is seen in the statistical
    aggregation of traffic that can be done. This results in increased transmission
    efficiency and reduced leasing cost for the operator.</p>"
