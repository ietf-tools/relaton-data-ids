- content: "<p>This document specifies the process by which the IETF appoints its
    2 representatives to ICANN's Protocol Support Organization's Protocol Council
    (PSO-PC). Additionally, mechanisms that the IETF will adopt for identifying candidates
    for the PSO's appointments to the ICANN Board of Directors are specified. This
    process specification reflects 2 years of IETF experience with ICANN, the PSO-PC
    and the PSO organization, since their inception in 1999.</p>"
