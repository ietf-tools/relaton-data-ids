abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes TRAM, a scalable reliable multicast transport
    protocol. TRAM is designed to support bulk data transfer from a single sender
    to many receivers. A dynamically formed repair tree provides local error recovery
    allowing the multicast group to support a large number of receivers. TRAM provides
    flow control, congestion control, and other adaptive techniques necessary to operate
    efficiently with other protocols. Several bulk data applications have been implemented
    with TRAM. TRAM has been tested and simulated in a number of network environments.
    This update contains a new flow and congestion control section, an updated and
    expanded security section, updated packet formats to accommodate IPV6 addressing,
    and several other minor updates.</p>"
