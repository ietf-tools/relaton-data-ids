abstract:
- content: "<p>The transition mechanism described in the 6to4 draft [2] [6to4] raises
    scaling concerns when the matrix of IPv4 connected 6to4- router systems, communicating
    across to the native IPv6 only connected systems, are on the order of tens to
    hundreds of millions. This document will address those concerns, offer additional
    mechanisms for resolving them, and identify use for the scenario of link-local
    addressing postulated in section 3.1.</p>"
