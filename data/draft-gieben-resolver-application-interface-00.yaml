abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an interface between a DNSSEC aware resolver
    and an application. This interface will define which kind of information a DNSSEC
    aware resolver is able to send back to an application. The basic question we want
    to answer is: 'What does an application want to know from a secure aware resolver?'.
    In Section 4 we define an error bit array. The secure aware resolver will set
    specific bits in the array. With the added information in the error array, the
    application can have extra control on what to do with bogus data. When something
    goes wrong during the secure resolving process the application may also want to
    know where in the DNS tree this happened. With a simple error array one can not
    convey this information. A possibility might be to give the application the owner
    name of the DNS node where the validation failed. This document is written in
    the hope that it will lead to a discussion within the IETF on the resolver-application
    interaction(s).</p>"
