abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such as
    video gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used to provide
    application services are distributed geographically around a network, many decisions
    made in the control and management of application services, such as where to instantiate
    another service instance or to which data center out of several a new client is
    assigned, can have a significant impact on the state of the network. Conversely
    the capabilities and state of the network can have a major impact on application
    performance. Currently application decisions are made with very little or no information
    concerning the underlying network used to deliver those services. Hence such decisions
    may be sub-optimal from both application and network resource utilization and
    quality of service objectives. This document proposes a research program into
    cross stratum application/network optimization focusing on the challenges and
    opportunities presented by data center based applications and carriers networks.</p>"
