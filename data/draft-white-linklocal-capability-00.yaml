abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP, described in [RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability
    between domains and between the edges of a domain. As such, BGP assumes the next
    hop towards any reachable destination may not reside on the advertising speaker,
    but rather may either be through a router connected to the same subnet as the
    speaker, or through a router only reachable by traversing multiple hops through
    the network. Because of this, BGP does not recognize the use of IPv6 link-local
    addresses, as described in [RFC4291], as a valid next hop for forwarding purposes.
    However, BGP speakers are now often deployed on point-to-point links in networks
    where multihop reachability of any kind is not assumed or desired (all next hops
    are assumed to be the speaker reachable through a directly connected point-to-point
    link). This is common, for instance, in data center fabrics. In these situations,
    a global IPv6 address is not required for the advertisement of reachability information;
    in fact, providing global IPv6 addresses in these kinds of networks can be detrimental
    to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). This draft standardizes the operation of BGP
    over a point-to-point link using link-local IPv6 addressing only.</p>"
