abstract:
- content: "<p>In Network Virtualization Over Layer-3 (NVO3) networks, Network Virtualization
    Edge devices (NVEs) sit at the edge of the underlay network and provide Layer-2
    and Layer-3 connectivity among Tenant Systems (TSes) of the same tenant. The NVEs
    need to build and maintain mapping tables so that they can deliver encapsulated
    packets to their intended destination NVE(s). While there are different options
    to create and disseminate the mapping table entries, NVEs may exchange that information
    directly among themselves via a control- plane protocol, such as Ethernet Virtual
    Private Network (EVPN). EVPN provides an efficient, flexible and unified control-plane
    option that can be used for Layer-2 and Layer-3 Virtual Network (VN) service connectivity.
    This document describes the applicability of EVPN to NVO3 networks and how EVPN
    solves the challenges in those networks. This document does not introduce any
    new procedures in EVPN.</p>"
