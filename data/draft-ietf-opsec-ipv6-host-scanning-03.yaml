abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart.
    The standard /64 IPv6 subnets can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844
    * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses)
    than is typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or less unique
    addresses. As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort
    to perform address scanning attacks against IPv6 networks, and therefore brute-force
    IPv6 address scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible. This document updates
    RFC 5157 by providing further analysis on how traditional address scanning techniques
    apply to IPv6 networks, and exploring some additional techniques that can be employed
    for IPv6 network reconnaissance. In doing so, this document formally obsoletes
    RFC 5157.</p>"
