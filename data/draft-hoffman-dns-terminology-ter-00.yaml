abstract:
- content: <p>This document adds abbreviations to "DNS Terminology" (RFC 8499) that
    relate to DNS running over various transports, as well as abbreviations for DNS
    resolution at traditional and non-traditional locations. [[ This is an early attempt
    at these terms. They will probably be improved over time. []</p>
