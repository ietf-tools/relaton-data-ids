abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to be a source of information about the Russian
    Federal standard for electronic encryption, decryption, and message authentication
    algorithms (GOST 28147-89), which is one of the Russian cryptographic standard
    algorithms called GOST algorithms). Recently, Russian cryptography is being used
    in Internet applications, and this document has been created as information for
    developers and users of GOST 28147-89 for encryption, decryption, and message
    authentication. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
