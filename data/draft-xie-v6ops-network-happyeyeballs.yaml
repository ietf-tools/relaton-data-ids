abstract:
- content: "<p>During the period of IPv6 transition, both ISPs and ICPs (Internet
    Content Providers) care about user's experience in dual-stack networks. They hesitate
    to provide IPv6 to their users due to the fear of poor IPv6 performance. Network-based
    Happy Eyeballs (NHE) is proposed in this memo as an approach to facilitate ISPs
    to identify IPv6 connectivity issues and provide better connectivity to end users.
    NHE does accurate measurements and comparison on IPv6/IPv4 performance on the
    network side compared with client-side as in Happy Eyeballs v2 (HEv2) [RFC8305].
    It works independently with client's adoption of HEv2 and both coexist without
    conflicting. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test script
    is currently placed at GitHub [NHE-GitHub]. Comments and pull request are welcome.</p>"
