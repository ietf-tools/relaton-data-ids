- content: "<p>From a carrier perspective, the possibility of transferring the ownership
    and control of an existing and in-use path between the management plane and the
    control plane, without actually affecting data plane traffic being carried over
    it, is a valuable option. This memo sets out the requirements for such procedures.</p>"
