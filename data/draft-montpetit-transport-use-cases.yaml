abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some of the services and application use cases
    that may require specific transport services over an Internet subnetwork. It also
    presents, when available, some derived requirements and conditions of utilization
    that will allow to choose the most appropriate transport service. The use cases
    assume that choice of transport service is fully based on the requirements. In
    all cases however, the fallback is considered to be TCP or UDP.</p>"
