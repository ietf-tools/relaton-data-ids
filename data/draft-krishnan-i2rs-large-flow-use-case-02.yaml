abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses two use cases to help identify the requirements
    for policy-based routing in I2RS. Both of the use cases involve identification
    of certain flows and then using I2RS to program special handling for those flows.
    The first use case deals with improving bandwidth efficiency. Demands on networking
    bandwidth are growing exponentially due to applications such as large file transfers
    and those with rich media. Link Aggregation Group (LAG) and Equal Cost Multipath
    (ECMP) are extensively deployed in networks to scale the bandwidth. However, the
    flow-based load balancing techniques used today make inefficient use of the bandwidth
    in the presence of long-lived large flows. We discuss how I2RS can be used for
    achieving better load balancing. The second use case is for recognizing and mitigating
    Layer 3-4 based DDoS attacks. Behavioral security threats such as Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are an ongoing problem in today's networks. DDoS
    attacks can be Layer 3-4 based or Layer 7 based. We discuss how such attacks can
    be recognized and how I2RS can be used for mitigating their effects.</p>"
