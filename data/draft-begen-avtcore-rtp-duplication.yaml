abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can
    occur due to congestion, or other unplanned network outages. This is especially
    true for IP multicast networks, where packet loss patterns can vary greatly between
    receivers. One technique that can be used to recover from packet loss without
    incurring unbounded delay for all the receivers is to duplicate the packets and
    send them in separate redundant streams. This document explains how Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP media
    streams, or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.</p>"
