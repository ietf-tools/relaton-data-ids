abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an optional implementation technique within IS-IS
    [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds.
    IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI and
    used with IP extensions as IGP. This draft describes how to effectively bypass
    the problem of 255 circuits that IS-IS allows to maintain with minor violations
    of the specification that however does not prevent interoperability with existing
    implementations.</p>"
