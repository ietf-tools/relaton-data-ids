abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family
    of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use
    of security features provided at the RPC transport level. This prelimimary version
    of the document, is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion
    regarding NFSv4 security issues and ientify issues on which the working group
    needs to work on achieving consensus. When published as an RFC, it will supersede
    the description of security appearing in existing minor version specification
    documents such as RFC 7530 and RFC 8881.</p>"
