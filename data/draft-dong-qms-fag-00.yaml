abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the issue of provisioning end-to-end Quality
    of Service (QoS) for multimedia services over heterogeneous networks and introduces
    a parametric model by using network calculus theory for QoS class mapping between
    different QoS domains. Then a QoS Mapping Scheme based on Flow Aggregation (QMS-FAG)
    is proposed in this document to mitigate the information loss problem due to mapping
    between QoS domains with different granularity of QoS class and to provide efficient
    network resources utilization by considering user's Quality of Experience (QoE).
    In QMS-FAG, the QoS requirements of service flows are indicated by a unique FAG
    identifier which is described in a service flow map of QoS parameters. With FAG
    identifier and mapping executors sitting at the border of different QoS domains,
    QMS-FAG allows smooth QoS class mapping between networks with different granularity
    of QoS class. Both numerical analysis and simulation studies are given to demonstrate
    the efficiency of the proposed method.</p>"
