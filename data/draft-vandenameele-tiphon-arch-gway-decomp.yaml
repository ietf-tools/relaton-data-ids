abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft contains an update of ETSI-TIPHON's work on requirements
    for a protocol at the reference point N (in TIPHON parlance) of the TIPHON reference
    configuration. Reference point N designates the information flows required for
    control of a Media Gateway in a decomposed Gateway [0]. This Internet-Draft supercedes
    the one submitted in November 1998 and represents consensus of working group 2
    in TIPHON. ETSI-TIPHON is working on standards to connect VoIP (Voice over IP)
    networks and phone networks.</p>"
