abstract:
- content: "<p>Source address validation (SAV) table consists of SAV rules that are
    manually configured or automatically generated. The table will take effect in
    data plane for checking the validity of source addresses. SAV mechanisms may enable
    SAV tables in data plane using different methods (e.g., ACL or FIB), and these
    tables are suitable for different application scenarios. This document aims to
    provide a systematic view of existing SAV tables, which makes it convenient for
    engineers or operators to improve existing SAV mechanisms or properly apply SAV
    on routers. The document first examines existing forms of SAV tables and provides
    a unified abstraction. Then, three validation modes are concluded as well as suggestions
    for application scenarios. Finally, diversified actions for each validity state
    are introduced for compliance of different operation requirements.</p>"
