abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a 'two-plane three-tier' framework structure
    for NSIS signaling. In this framework the Access Networks are connected with wired
    backbone through default routers. It is assumed that one can do a competent job
    of network configuration &amp; provisioning in the backbone network, and just
    keeps backbone networks stupid simple.Resource policies which are implemented
    in inter-NSIS Domains and intra-NSIS Domain, NSIS Signaling and NSIS negotiations
    are in the control plane. User data is transported in the transport plane. COPS/Diameter
    is used for exchanging resource policies. Three-Tier NSIS signalings mean that
    NSIS signaling should be done in three levels. The first level is Inter-NSIS Domain
    NSIS signaling across neighboring NSIS Domains, and the second level is Intra-NSIS
    Domain NSIS signaling inside each NSIS Domain while the third level is end-to-edge
    NSIS signaling and end-to-end NSIS signaling. The aggregate traffic crossing NSIS
    Domain borders is served according to relatively stable, long-lived bilateral
    agreements. End-to-end QoS support is achieved through the concatenation of such
    bilateral agreements.</p>"
