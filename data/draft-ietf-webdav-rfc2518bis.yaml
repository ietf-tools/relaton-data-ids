abstract:
- content: "<p>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) consists of a set
    of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management
    of resource properties, creation and management of resource collections, URL namespace
    manipulation, and resource locking (collision avoidance). RFC 2518 was published
    in February 1999, and this specification obsoletes RFC 2518 with minor revisions
    mostly due to interoperability experience. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
