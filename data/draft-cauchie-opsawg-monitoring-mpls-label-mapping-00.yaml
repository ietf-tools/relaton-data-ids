abstract:
- content: "<p>Because one MPLS label only identifies one single flow on a link between
    two MPLS routers, information related to one MPLS label is exchanged only between
    (physically and logically) neighbour routers. In other words, MPLS label have
    a link-local significance on which two neighbour routers have previously agreed
    on. It is therefore not a trivial task for a network operator to know where a
    flow is going as it implies to retreive the MPLS labels mappings on each hops
    in order to get a complete view of end-to-end LSP paths. This taks is even harder
    when it comes to get the MPLS label mappings over time in a purpose of monitoring
    and/or troubleshooting network services. This document thus defines a new method
    to monitor MPLS label mappings that collects and stores MPLS labels mapping information
    so as to offer to one IP/MPLS network operator a reliable and clear view of its
    network LSPs end-to-end establishment over time while minimising the impact on
    network convergence and router CPU.</p>"
