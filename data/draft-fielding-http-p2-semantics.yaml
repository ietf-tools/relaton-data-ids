abstract:
- content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been
    in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document
    is Part 2 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to
    as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together, updates RFC 2616 and RFC 2617. Part 2 defines
    the semantics of HTTP messages as expressed by request methods, request-header
    fields, response status codes, and response- header fields.</p>
