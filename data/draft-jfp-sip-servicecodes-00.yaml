abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) needs no special mechanism
    to enable network services and applications, in complex architectures, feature
    composition and service invocation become unmanageable without a mechanism for
    specifying the services that are associated with routes. This draft introduces
    distributed application architectures that span multiple administrative domains
    and proposes the use of ServiceCodes in SIP to allow service providers to compose
    chains of features across application servers.</p>"
