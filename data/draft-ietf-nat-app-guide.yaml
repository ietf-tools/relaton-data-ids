abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses those things that application designers might
    wish to consider when designing new protocols. While many common Internet applications
    will operate cleanly in the presence of Network Address Translators, others suffer
    from a variety of problems when crossing these devices. Guidelines are presented
    herein to help ensure new protocols and applications will, to the extent possible,
    be compatible with NAT (Network Address Translation). This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
