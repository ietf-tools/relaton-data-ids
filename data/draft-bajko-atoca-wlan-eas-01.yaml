abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE 802.11 specification is evolving by defining new amendments
    to it, which are then rolled into the base spec. The 802.11u amendment, published
    in November 2010, contains support for Citizen to Authority type of Emergency
    Calls and Authority to Citizen type of Alerts. This document attempts to explain
    what level of support for Authority to Citizen type of Emergency Alerts has been
    defined for IEEE 802.11 protocol.</p>"
