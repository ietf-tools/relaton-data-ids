abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, Internet Standards have been characterized by three primary
    criteria: the specifications are stable, implementations of them have been demonstrated
    to be interoperable, and they have achieved sufficient deployment to be considered
    useful. The IETF has developed specific rules for determining whether those criteria
    have been met, but the rules and their implementation have sometimes not adequately
    reflected those underlying criteria. The result has been that the application
    of the rules has not resulted in STDs for all protocols that meet the underlying
    criteria. This document proposes a process experiment to reclassify standards-track
    documents whose interoperability and utility have been demonstrated by the fact
    of deployment and use in products being used by Internet users.</p>"
