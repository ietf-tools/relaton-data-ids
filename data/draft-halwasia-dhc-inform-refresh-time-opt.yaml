abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4
    (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] option for specifying an upper bound for how long a client
    should wait before refreshing information retrieved from DHCPv4 Server by using
    DHCP INFORM message. It is used with stateless DHCPv4 as there are no addresses
    or other entities with lifetimes that can tell the client when to contact the
    DHCPv4 server to refresh its configuration.</p>"
