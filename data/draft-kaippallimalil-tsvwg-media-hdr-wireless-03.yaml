abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant
    variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless channel conditions,
    interference, or the end-user's movement. These variations in capacity take place
    in the order of hundreds of milliseconds and is much too fast for end-to-end congestion
    signaling by itself to convey the changes for an application to adapt. Media applications
    on the other hand demand both high throughput and low latency, and can dynamically
    adjust the size and quality of a stream to match available network bandwidth.
    However, catering to such media flows over a radio link with rapid changes in
    capacity requires the buffers and congestion to be managed carefully. This draft
    proposes to provide metadata about the media transported in each packet to allow
    the wireless network to manage radio resources optimally and to maximize network
    utilization while also improving application performance. This draft discusses
    potential solution options to this problem and the trade-offs involved. The draft
    then defines a new UDP option to carry media metadata between a UDP source and
    destination. This metadata is designed to be minimal, compact and has low processing
    overhead per-packet for encoding and retrieval.</p>"
