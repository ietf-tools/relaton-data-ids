abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) enables and permits endpoints
    in an INVITE transaction to send media packets before an SDP offer/ answer exchange
    has completed; we refer to such media packets as early media. The use of early
    media is common in current SIP implementations, and causes several problems, which
    have been documented elsewhere. This document puts forward the goal of modifying
    SIP so that compliant implementations will complete an SDP exchange before sending
    media, and lays out high-level requirements for such a solution. The set of possible
    solutions is then laid out, and each possibility examined in light of these requirements.</p>"
