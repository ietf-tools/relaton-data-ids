abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6488 standardized a template for specifying Signed Objects that
    can be validated using the RPKI. Since the publication of that document, a new
    additional protocol for distribution of RPKI repositories was developed (RFC 8182),
    and new insights arose with respect to querying and combining the different distribution
    mechanisms. This document describes how Publishers and Relying Parties can use
    the CMS signing-time attribute to optimize seamless transitions from RRDP to RSYNC.
    Additionally, this document updates RFC 6488 by mandating the presence of the
    CMS signing-time attribute and disallowing the binary-signing-time attribute.</p>"
