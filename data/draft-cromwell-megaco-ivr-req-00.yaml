abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the functional requirements for a protocol
    used by a call processing agent in a packet network to control an interactive
    voice response function located in the same packet net- work or at the interface
    of the packet network and the traditional telephone network. These requirements
    focus primary on audio, however the protocol could be extended in the future to
    support other media streams such as video.</p>"
