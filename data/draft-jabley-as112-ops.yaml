abstract:
- content: "<p>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses which
    are not globally unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC1918 for
    private use within individual sites. Devices in such environments may occasionally
    originate reverse DNS queries corresponding to those private-use addresses. Since
    the addresses concerned have only local significance, it is good practice for
    site administrators to ensure that they are answered locally. However, it is not
    uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS
    instead of being answered within the site. It is not possible for public DNS servers
    to give useful answers to such queries. In addition, due to the wide deployment
    of private-use addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume
    of such queries is large and growing. The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed
    sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the root and IN-ADDR.ARPA
    authority servers. This document describes the steps required to install a new
    AS112 node, and offers advice relating to such a node's operation.</p>"
