    websites. The proposed architecture can use its own profiles database as well

    proposes a modular design for online meeting and similar kind of applications
    on Internet. The architecture proposes an application specific search without
    breaching privacy of the registered members. It also proposes to utilize member
    profiles from legacy databases and websites as well as other implementations of
    this architecture.</p>"
