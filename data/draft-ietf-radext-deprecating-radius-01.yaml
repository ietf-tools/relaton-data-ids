abstract:
- content: "<p>RADIUS crypto-agility was first mandated as future work by RFC 6421.
    The outcome of that work was the publication of RADIUS over TLS (RFC 6614) and
    RADIUS over DTLS (RFC 7360) as experimental documents. Those transport protocols
    have been in wide-spread use for many years in a wide range of networks. They
    have proven their utility as replacements for the previous UDP (RFC 2865) and
    TCP (RFC 6613) transports. With that knowledge, the continued use of insecure
    transports for RADIUS has serious and negative implications for privacy and security.
    It is no longer acceptable for RADIUS to rely on MD5 for security. It is no longer
    acceptable to send device or location information in clear text across the wider
    Internet. This document therefore deprecates insecure uses of RADIUS, and mandates
    the use of secure TLS-based transport layers. We also discuss related security
    issues with RADIUS, and give many recommendations for practices which increase
    security and privacy.</p>"
