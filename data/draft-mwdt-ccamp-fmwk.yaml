abstract:
- content: "<p>To ensure an efficient data transport, meeting the requirements requested
    by today's transport services, the unification of control and management of microwave
    and millimeter wave radio link interfaces is a precondition for seamless multilayer
    networking and automated network wide provisioning and operation. This document
    describes the required characteristics and use cases for control and management
    of radio link interface parameters using a YANG Data Model. It focuses on the
    benefits of a standardized management model that is aligned with how other packet
    technology interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node are modeled, the need
    to support core parameters and at the same time allow for optional product/feature
    specific parameters supporting new, unique innovative features until they have
    become mature enough to be included in the standardized model. The purpose is
    to create a framework for identification of the necessary information elements
    and definition of a YANG Data Model for control and management of the radio link
    interfaces in a microwave/millimeter wave node.</p>"
