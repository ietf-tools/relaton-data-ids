abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7
    MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services
    of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Some parts of the specification are
    unclear that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability between
    different implementations. RFC 4666 doesn't define the application of IPSTP-IPSEP
    interface. For the signalling network management function, messages and procedures,
    it needs more contributes. This document provides clarifications and amendments
    to RFC 4666.</p>"
