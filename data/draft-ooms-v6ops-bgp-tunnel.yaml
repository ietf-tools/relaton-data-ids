abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains how to interconnect IPv6 islands over a Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv4 cloud. This approach relies on IPv6 Provider
    Edge routers (6PE), which are Dual Stack in order to connect to IPv6 islands and
    to the MPLS core, which is only required to run IPv4 MPLS. The 6PE routers exchange
    the IPv6 reachability information transparently over the core using the Multiprotocol
    Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4. In doing so, the BGP Next Hop field
    is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 6PE router so that dynamically established
    IPv4-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel
    configuration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
