abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet switching network usually contains links formed by non-fiber
    media, e.g., copper, radio, etc. Some kinds of non-fiber links have non-fixed
    bandwidth capacity because they are very sensitive to external environment. This
    document describes an extension for GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling for setting up a LSP
    in a PSN network which contains non-fixed bandwidth link by introducing an optional
    availability field in GMPLS signaling.</p>"
