abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast support in the Offer/Answer Model for SDP is mainly focussed
    on receiving and not on sending multicast streams, it assumes usage of the service
    announcement protocol for multicast sessions which is hardly in use. In this document
    requirements are described to enable multicast sessions with a group of users,
    switching session parts between unicast and multicast, and sessions containing
    both unicast and multicast streams.</p>"
