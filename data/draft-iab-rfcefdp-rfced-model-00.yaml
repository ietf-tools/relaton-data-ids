abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model. As specified
    here, the model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two high-level
    functions: policy definition governing the Series as a whole, and policy implementation
    through publication of documents in the Series. The policy definition function
    is the responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy
    proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB).
    The policy implementation function is primarily the responsibility of the RFC
    Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration
    Limited Liability Company (LLC). This document reflects experience gained with
    version 1 of the RFC Editor Model as specified in RFC 5620 and with version 2
    as specified in RFC 6635 and RFC 8728. This document obsoletes RFC 8728.</p>"
