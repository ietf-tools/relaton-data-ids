abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC 8956,
    and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters
    and actions) distributed via BGP. During the deployment of BGP FSv1 a number of
    issues were detected, so version 2 of the BGP flow specification (FSv2) protocol
    addresses these features. In order to provide a clear demarcation between FSv1
    and FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2. The IDR WG requires two implementation.
    Implementers feedback on FSv2 was that FSv2 has a correct design, but that breaking
    FSv2 into a progression of documents would aid deployment of the draft (basic,
    adding more filters, and adding more actions). This document specifies the basic
    FSv2 NLRI with user ordering of filters added to FSv1 IP Filters and FSv2 actions.</p>"
