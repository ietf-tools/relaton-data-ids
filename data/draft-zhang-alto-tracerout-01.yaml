abstract:
- content: <p>Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between the randomly
    constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical network topology, causing
    a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT time. This document describes how DHT
    overlay peers can interact with the routers by traceroute to get the path information,
    and execute 2- Means Classification, thereafter peers leverage the DHT itself
    to build efficient "closer" cluster. This scheme only requires the infrastructure
    to enable traceroute queries.</p>
