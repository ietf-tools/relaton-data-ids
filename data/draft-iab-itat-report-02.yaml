abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet
    Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT).
    The workshop was hosted by the University of Cambridge in Cambridge on December
    4th and 5th of 2013. The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet
    protocols, through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular
    emphasis at the waist of the hourglass. This report summarizes contributions and
    discussions. As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations
    for IETF participants to pursue at this time. Instead, in the classic sense of
    early research, the workshop noted areas that deserve further exploration. Note
    that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and
    positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and
    do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</p>"
