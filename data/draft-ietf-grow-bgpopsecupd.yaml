abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol is a critical component
    in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains. Due to
    this central nature, it is important to understand the security and reliability
    requirements that can and should be ensured to prevent accidental or intentional
    routing disturbances. Previously, security considerations for BGP have been described
    in RFC7454 / BCP194. Since the publications of RFC7454 / BCP194, several developments
    and changes in operational practice took place that warrant an update of these
    best current practices. This document replaces RFC7454 / BCP194, focusing on the
    overall goals, and providing a less implementation centric set of best practices.
    To this end, the document describes the security requirements and goals when operating
    BGP for exchanging routing information with other networks. The document explicitly
    does not focus on specific technical implementations and requirements. Operators
    are advised to consult documentation and contemporary informational documents
    concerning methods to ensure that these properties are sufficiently ensured in
    their network.</p>"
