abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents describes functions implemented in Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) intermediaries known as Session Border Controllers (SBCs). Although
    the goal of this document is to describe all the functions of SBCs, a special
    focus is given to those practices that are viewed to be in conflict with SIP architectural
    principles. It also explores the underlying requirements of network operators
    that have led to the use of these functions and practices in order to identify
    protocol requirements and determine whether those requirements are satisfied by
    existing specifications or additional standards work is required.</p>"
