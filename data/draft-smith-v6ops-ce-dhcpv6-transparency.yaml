abstract:
- content: <p>[RFC6204] defines basic requirements for IPv6 Customer Edge Routers,
    to suit residential or small office IPv6 deployments. It describes a WAN interface
    DHCPv6 client and LAN interface DHCPv6 server implementation model. This model
    constrains the set of DHCPv6 options that can be conveyed between the upstream
    service provider and the hosts downstream of the CE device, to those supported
    by both the CE device's DHCPv6 client and server. To support further current and
    future DHCPv6 options, this memo instead proposes a DHCPv6 option "transparent"
    implementation model for CE devices, primarily using DHCPv6 message relaying.</p>
