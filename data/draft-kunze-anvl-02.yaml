abstract:
- content: '<p>ANVL (A Name-Value Language) is a simple record syntax based on email
    headers. An ANVL record is a sequence of data elements ending in a blank line.
    An element consists of a label, a colon, and an optional value, and a long value
    may be folded (continued) onto the next line by inserting a CRLF and indenting
    the next line. A value folded across several lines is treated as if the lines
    were joined on one long line; any line beginning with `#'' is treated as a "comment".
    Example ANVL record: entry: # first draft who: Gilbert, W.S. | Sullivan, Arthur
    what: The Yeomen of the Guard when/created: 1888</p>'
