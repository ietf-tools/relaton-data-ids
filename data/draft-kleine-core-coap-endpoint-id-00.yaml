abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application layer
    protocol for constrained devices (e.g.low power, few memory) and networks (e.g.
    lossy, low bandwidth) which relies on UDP on the transport layer. With CoAP it
    is often the case, that message exchanges need to extend the common request/response
    pattern, e.g. for seperate responses. This holds, e.g. for CON requests that are
    confirmed by the server with an empty ACK and answered later with a seperate response.
    According to the CoAP specification the request/ response matching is realized
    using a unique pair of server address and token per client. Due to the mobile
    nature of some devices. e.g. smartphones, they are often assigned new IP addresses
    because of a network change. Thus, the IP address of a CoAP server might change
    during an ongoing conversion. This draft proposes a method to assign each communication
    partner with an identifier (endpoint ID) which replaces the IP address as (partial)
    key to relate requests and responses. Besides the common seperate responses, the
    proposed method is also useful to handle IP address changes, e.g. during an ongoing
    observation ([observe]) or a blockwise transfer ([block]).</p>"
