abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how MAC filtering programmed by the IEEE multiple
    MAC registration protocol (MMRP or 802.1ak) can be employed by VPLS-PE devices
    as the exclusive mechanism for interworking with 802.1ah PBBNs. No new protocol
    standardization is required to do this, however there are small procedural changes
    associated with the interworking of protocols.</p>"
