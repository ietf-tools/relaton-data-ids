abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) network architecture is to
    choose the best edge computing server by considering both the network environment
    and available computing/storage resources of the edge computing server. This draft
    describes the mechanism in which service continuity is provided even when the
    client moves and connects to a new ingress CATS-Router by using the PMIPv6-based
    mobility management method in the CATS-based edge computing networking environment.</p>"
