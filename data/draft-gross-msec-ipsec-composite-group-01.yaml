abstract:
- content: <p>The Multicast IP Security extension architecture [Weis] implicitly assumes
    a basic group endpoint population that shares homogeneous cryptographic capabilities
    and security policies. In practice, large- scale cryptographic groups may contain
    a heterogeneous endpoint population that can not be accommodated by that basic
    multicast IPsec architecture. For example, some endpoints may not have been upgraded
    to handle the successor algorithm for one that is being retired (e.g. SHA1 transition
    to SHA-ng). Group deployments that span multiple legal jurisdictions may have
    a different security policy in each jurisdiction (e.g. key strength). This document
    defines the "composite cryptographic group" IP security architecture capability.
    A composite cryptographic group allows multicast IPsec applications to transparently
    interact with the single logical group that is formed by the union of one or more
    basic cryptographic groups.</p>
