abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification extends the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749]
    to enable AI agents to securely obtain access tokens for acting on behalf of users.
    It introduces the *requested_actor* parameter in authorization requests to identify
    the specific agent requiring delegation and the *actor_token* parameter in token
    requests to authenticate the agent during the exchange of an authorization code
    for an access token. The flow can be initiated by a resource server challenge,
    ensuring that user consent is obtained dynamically when access is attempted. This
    extension ensures secure delegation with explicit user consent, streamlines the
    authorization flow, and enhances auditability through access token claims that
    document the delegation chain from the user to the agent via a client application.</p>"
