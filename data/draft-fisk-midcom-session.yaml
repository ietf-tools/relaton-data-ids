abstract:
- content: "<p>Application- and transport-layer gateways are considered harmful to
    the Internet since they hinder the operation of existing and new end-to-end protocols.
    A survey of such upper-level gateways shows that they exist because of realm-specific
    performance, security, and protocol needs of certain portions of the Internet.
    Expecting this realm-specific functionality to be added manually deployted to
    every end hosts or application is, conversely, harmful to the flexibility of using
    the Internet to link disparate networks.</p>"
