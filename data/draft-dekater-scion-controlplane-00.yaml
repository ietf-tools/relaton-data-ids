abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the control plane of the path-aware, inter-
    domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
    networks). One of the basic characteristics of SCION is that it gives path control
    to SCION- capable endpoints. In fact, endpoints can choose between multiple path
    options, enabling the optimization of network paths. The SCION control plane is
    responsible for discovering these paths and making them available to the endpoints.
    The main goal of SCION's control plane is to create and manage path segments,
    which can then be combined into forwarding paths to transmit packets in the data
    plane. This document first discusses how path exploration is realized through
    beaconing and how path segments are created and registered. Each SCION autonomous
    system (AS) can register segments according to its own policy - it is free to
    specify which path properties and algorithm(s) to use in the selection procedure.
    The document then describes the path lookup process, where endpoints obtain path
    segments - a fundamental building block for the construction of end-to-end paths.</p>"
