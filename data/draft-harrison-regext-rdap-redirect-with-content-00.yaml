abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) is used by Regional Internet
    Registries (RIRs) and Domain Name Registries (DNRs) to provide access to their
    resource registration information. When an RDAP service operator has delegated
    authority for a resource to a third party, the operator will configure its RDAP
    service to redirect requests for that resource to the third party. However, the
    client may be interested in the resource registration data that the first service
    operator has in its own right, for various reasons. This document defines a conformance
    code that a service operator can use to indicate that when redirecting requests,
    it will also include as the body of the response the RDAP object (if any) that
    it has in its own right for the requested resource.</p>"
