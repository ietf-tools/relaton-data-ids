abstract:
- content: "<p>In some Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] deployments, a mobility
    session needs to be traced by the back-end network manager for network diagnosis,
    troubleshooting, new service testing, etc. This document defines a Trace Session
    option for PMIPv6 protocol to control and manage (activation and de-activation)
    a trace session associated with a mobility session of the mobile node. This option
    is sent by the mobile access gateway in Proxy Binding Update message to request
    the local mobile anchor to activate the trace session. When the local mobile anchor
    successfully processes the Proxy Binding Update, it then activates the trace session
    and starts to record/report the traced mobility session based on the corresponding
    trace parameters.</p>"
