abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Address Translation is a technique for reducing the complexity
    of address re-assignment. It can also lead to a reduction in the routing state
    in the core. This draft is about using the technique for the same reasons for
    multicast. The approach is complementary to IP-in-IP tunnels for multicast, but
    avoids the overhead of encapsulation. It has the same state setup requirements
    at the edges, as does NAT.</p>"
