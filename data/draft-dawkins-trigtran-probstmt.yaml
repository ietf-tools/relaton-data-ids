abstract:
- content: "<p>When transport protocols are deployed over a path including a wireless
    sub-network, a wireless access device now has significantly better knowledge of
    the wireless portion of the connection path characteristics than one or both endpoints.
    End-to-end mechanisms continue to work (see [PILC] and related specifications),
    but must rely on communication over a sub- network link that experiences outages
    and degradation. This document will set the framework for investigation of whether
    this special knowledge from wireless access devices can be useful to endpoint
    transports. While the initial focus is on wireless links, other links will also
    be taken into account.</p>"
