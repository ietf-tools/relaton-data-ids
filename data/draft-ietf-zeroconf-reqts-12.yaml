abstract:
- content: "<p>Many common TCP/IP protocols such as DHCP [RFC2131], DNS [RFC1034][RFC1035],
    MADCAP [RFC2730], and LDAP [RFC2251] must be configured and maintained by an administrative
    staff. This is unacceptable for emerging networks such as home networks, automobile
    networks, airplane networks, or ad hoc networks at conferences, emergency relief
    stations, and many others. Such networks may be nothing more than two isolated
    laptop PCs connected via a wireless LAN. For all these networks, an administrative
    staff will not exist and the users of these networks neither have the time nor
    inclination to learn network administration skills. Instead, these networks need
    protocols that require zero user configuration and administration. This document
    is part of an effort to define such zero configuration (zeroconf) protocols. Before
    embarking on defining zeroconf protocols, protocol requirements are needed. This
    document states the zeroconf protocol requirements for four protocol areas; they
    are: IP interface configuration, translation between host name and IP address,
    IP multicast address allocation, and service discovery. This document does not
    define specific protocols, just requirements. The requirements for these four
    areas result from examining everyday use or scenarios of these protocols.</p>"
