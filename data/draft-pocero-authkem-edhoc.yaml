abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
    over COSE (EDHOC) protocol to provide resistance against quantum computer adversaries
    by incorporating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) mechanisms for both key exchange
    and authentication. It defines a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)-based authentication
    method to enable signature-free post-quantum authentication when PQC KEMs, such
    as NIST-standardized ML-KEM, are used.</p>"
