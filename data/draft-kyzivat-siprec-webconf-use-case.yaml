abstract:
- content: "<p>The current work of SIPREC will soon finish. As its charter defined,
    SIPREC has covered industries like financial trading floors, contact center and
    emergency service bureaus. But when talking about products or solutions like data
    or web conferencing, SIPREC is insufficient to record all aspects of calls with
    different interactive media channels. This draft tries to show a use case for
    web conference recording and show how it can work well under SIPREC mechanism.</p>"
