abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes requirements for Localized Mobility Management
    (LMM) for Mobile IP and Mobile Ipv6 protocols. These requirements are intended
    to guide the design of a protocol specification for LMM. Localized Mobility Management,
    in general, introduces enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 to reduce the
    amount of latency in binding updates sent to the Home Agent and, for route-optimization,
    Correspondent Nodes, upon Care of Address change. In addition, LMM seeks to reduce
    the amount of signaling over the global Internet when a mobile node traverses
    within a defined local domain. The identified requirements are essential for localized
    mobility management functionality. They are intended to be used as a guide for
    analysis on the observed benefits over the identified requirements for architecting
    and deploying LMM schemes.</p>"
