abstract:
- content: "<p>A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input source,
    produces marks on that media according to some page description or page control
    language and puts the result in some output destination, possibly with finishing
    applied. The information needed in the management of the physical printer and
    the management of a printing job overlap highly and many of the tasks in each
    management area require the same or similar information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
