abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a Proxy Mobile IPv6 mobility session redirection
    functionality at the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol level. The redirection functionality
    would allow a Local Mobility Anchor to redirect the Mobile Access Gateway during
    the Proxy Binding Update and Acknowledgement exchange to an alternative Local
    Mobility Anchor. The benefit of redirection at the protocol level is that it removes
    the dependence on having such functionality provided by the Authentication, Authorization
    and, Accounting elements or the Domain Name System in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain.
    Furthermore, doing the redirection at the base protocol level reduces the amount
    of signaling, unnecessary costly setup of mobility sessions and unnecessary costly
    interactions with backend systems.</p>"
