abstract:
- content: "<p>BMPP is a protocol which allows bulk emailers to discover if a mailbox
    is willing to accept bulk email. From the bulk emailer's point of view, it allows
    them to find out for certain if their email will be accepted or rejected by the
    recipient. From the mailbox owner's point of view, it allows them to provide permission
    to bulk emailers in jurisdictions where permission is required, and allows them
    to express their desire not to receive such bulk mailings in jurisdictions where
    permission is not required.</p>"
