- content: "<p>This document surveys existing three party authentication and authorization
    protocols for use with Internet of Things use cases. The discussed protocol frameworks
    are Kerberos, OAuth, ABFAB, and the certificate model. The aim is to understand
    whether any of the available standardized security protocols are re-usable for
    constrained environments. A future version of this document will provide a more
    detailed analysis against the requirements.</p>"
