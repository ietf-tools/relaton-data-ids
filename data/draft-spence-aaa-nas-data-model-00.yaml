abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, considerable attention has been given to the need to better
    structure the information carried in protocols operating within the network access
    environment. The arguable benefits of structured information is consistency in
    the definitions and reuse of individual data elements and well defined means for
    extending existing structures to support new or proprietary features and capabilities.
    In an effort to demonstrate the benefits of organizing data elements and provide
    a practical means for deploying such a model, this memo takes the existing attributes
    currently used in RADIUS and maps them into a data model. To demonstrate the deployment
    of the data model within the network access environment, the data model has been
    represented as a PIB. While the data model could be implemented to run over protocols
    other than COPS, SPPI is currently the only language available which expresses
    data modeling concepts with sufficient detail to demonstrate the benefits in a
    practical manner.</p>"
