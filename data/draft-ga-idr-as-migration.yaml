abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses common methods of managing an ASN migration using
    some BGP feaures that while commonly-used are not formally part of the BGP4 protocol
    specification and may be vendor-specific in exact implementation. It is necessary
    to document these de facto standards to ensure that they are properly supported
    in future BGP protocol work such as BGPSec.</p>"
