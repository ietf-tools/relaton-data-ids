abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework in container orchestration systems
    poses challenges, particularly in managing credentials such as client_id and client_secret,
    which can be complex and prone to errors. To address this, the industry has shifted
    towards a federation-based approach where credentials of the underlying workload
    platform are used as assertions towards an OAuth authorization server, leveraging
    the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication [RFC7521], specifically
    [RFC7523]. This specification describes a meta flow in Section 3.1, gives security
    recommendations in Section 4 and outlines concrete patterns in Appendix A.</p>"
