abstract:
- content: <p>The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
    advertise reachability for IP prefixes. This reachability information is propagated
    in a peer-to-peer topology. Sometimes routes are announced to peers for which
    the local peering policy does not permit. And sometimes routes are propagated
    indiscriminantly, once they have been accepted. This document considers the situations
    that can lead to routes being leaked, and tries to find acceptable definitions
    for describing these scenarios. The purpose of these definitions is to facilitate
    discussion on what a route leak is, and what the scope of the problem space for
    route leaks is. This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements document for
    detection of (and prevention of) route leaks. And finally, the definitions and
    requirements are intended to allow proposed solutions which meet these criteria,
    and to facilitate evaluation of proposed solutions. The fundamental objective
    is to "solve the route leaks problem".</p>
