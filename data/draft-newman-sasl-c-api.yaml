abstract:
- content: "<p>Almost every protocol needs authentication. However, there does not
    exist an authentication mechanism suitable for all organizations, nor is it likely
    that a small fixed set of authentication mechanisms will remain suitable. SASL
    [SASL] provides the on-the-wire framework for authentication (and a security layer)
    which separates the design of authentication mechanisms from the protocols in
    which they're used. The SASL protocol model suggests a software architecture where
    application protocols call a generic API to authenticate which in turn calls a
    generic plug-in interface for extensible authentication modules. This memo documents
    the API used in one implementation of this architecture in the hope that it will
    be useful to others. An associated memo documenting the plug-in interface is forthcoming.</p>"
