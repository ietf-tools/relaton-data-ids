abstract:
- content: "<p>Ad Hoc networks present an interesting challenge for IPv6 addressing
    due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes
    must assign IPv6 addresses to their multihop interface connections to Ad Hoc networks
    that are locally unique but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes
    must therefore be able to assign self-generated addresses to their interfaces
    when there are no IPv6 Internetworking routers present that can coordinate topology-
    relative IPv6 addresses or prefixes. This document specifies a means for IPv6
    nodes to generate and assign address types useful for Ad Hoc network communications.</p>"
