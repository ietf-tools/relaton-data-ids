abstract:
- content: "<p>X.121 Address Resolution is important for the routing of Internet datagrams
    through the worldwide system of X.25 Public Data Networks. An X.121 Address Resolution
    Protocol (XARP) with several options has been presented in this document. Depending
    whether the mapping between the Internet (PDN-cluster) address of a PDN-host or
    VAN-gateway and its corresponding X.121 address on the X.25 network can be solved
    locally, or by another PDN-host or VAN-gateway, or even by a remote X.121 address
    server, not directly connected to the X.25 network, the appropriate option can
    be chosen.</p>"
