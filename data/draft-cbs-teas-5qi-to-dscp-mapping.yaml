abstract:
- content: "<p>5G End-to-End Network Slice QoS is an essential aspect of network slicing,
    as described in both IETF drafts and the 3GPP specifications. Network slicing
    allows for the creation of multiple logical networks on top of a shared physical
    infrastructure, tailored to support specific use cases or services. The primary
    goal of QoS in network slicing is to ensure that the specific performance requirements
    of each slice are met, including latency, reliability, and throughput.</p>"
