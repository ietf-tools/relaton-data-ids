abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for the expression
    of location information that is defined relative to a reference point. The reference
    point may be expressed as a geodetic or civic location, and the relative offset
    may be one of several shapes. Optionally, a reference to a secondary document
    (such as a map image) can be included, along with the relationship of the map
    coordinate system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allow display of
    the map with the reference point and the relative offset. Also included in this
    document is a Type/Length/Value (TLV) representation of the relative location
    for use in other protocols that use TLVs.</p>"
