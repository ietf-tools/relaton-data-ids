abstract:
- content: "<p>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a
    link-layer agnostic transport for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to
    enable network access authentication between clients and access networks. PANA
    framework defines two types of security associations which can be bootstrapped
    as a consequence of PANA execution: IP layer security is established with IPsec
    by using IKE and link-layer security with WPA/IEEE 802.11i in PSK mode. This document
    is focused on how PANA can bootstrap link layer security through IEEE 802.11i
    and exposes issues which can be raised as a consequence of this interaction.</p>"
