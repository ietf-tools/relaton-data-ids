abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal describes a mechanism to connect multiple PIM-SM domains
    together. Each PIM-SM domain uses it's own independent RP(s) and do not have to
    depend on RPs in other domains. This proposal is being submitted as a method for
    the initial phase of Inter-Domain Multicast deployment in the Internet and may
    be upward compatible with the IDMR protocols being proposed for subsequent phases.</p>"
