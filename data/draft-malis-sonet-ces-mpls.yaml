abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a historical method for encapsulating Synchronous
    Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) Path signals for transport
    across packet-switched networks (PSNs). The PSNs explicitly supported by this
    document include MPLS and IP. Note that RFC 4842 describes the standards-track
    protocol for this functionality, and new implementations must use RFC 4842 rather
    than this document except when interoperability with older implementations is
    desired. This memo defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.</p>"
