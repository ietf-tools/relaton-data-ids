abstract:
- content: "<p>Emerging technologies are adding information into IS-IS TLVs at a steady
    pace while deployment scales are simultaneously increasing. This causes the contents
    of many critical TLVs to exceed the currently supported limit of 255 octets. Extensions
    such as [RFC7356] require significant IS-IS changes that could help address the
    problem, but a less drastic solution would be beneficial. This document codifies
    the common mechanism of extending the TLV space through multiple TLV instances.</p>"
