abstract:
- content: "<p>To enable automated network OAM (Operations, administration and management),
    the availability of network protocol running status information is a fundamental
    step. In this document, a network monitoring protocol (NMP) is proposed to provision
    the information related to running status of IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) and
    other control protocols. It can facilitate the network troubleshooting of control
    protocols in a network domain. Typical network issues are illustrated as the usecases
    of NMP for ISIS to showcase the necessity of NMP. Then the operations and the
    message formats of NMP for ISIS are defined. In this document ISIS is used as
    the illustration protocol, and the case of OSPF and other control protocols will
    be included in the future version.</p>"
