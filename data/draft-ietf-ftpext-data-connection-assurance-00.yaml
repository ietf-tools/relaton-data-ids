abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol
    (FTP) by which a user and server can exchange data port connection information
    which may then be used to provide connection assurance. Two new commands are introduced.
    Through use of these commands and their replies, the user and server exchange
    information allowing verification of the socket addresses for a data connection
    prior to actual data transmission over the connection. Implementation of this
    extension is RECOMMENDED.</p>"
