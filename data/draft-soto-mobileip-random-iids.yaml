abstract:
- content: "<p>This document evaluates the use of random numbers to generate the interface
    identifier part of an IPv6 address on mobile environments, where Duplicate Address
    Detection (DAD) mechanisms are expensive. We have estimated the probability of
    having an address duplication using this mechanism and we conclude that the IPv6
    addresses created in this way could be used without previously doing DAD to test
    the uniqueness of the address in a link.</p>"
