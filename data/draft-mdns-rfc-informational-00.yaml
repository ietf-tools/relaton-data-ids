abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a globally scalable and hierarchical approach
    to multicast session directory service architecture. This approach allows for
    sessions to be discovered using keywords as soon as they are registered with the
    system. It allows session registration to be tagged with geographical data to
    provide location-based search capability to the end users. It is able to assign
    URI strings to multicast sessions. This document provides a general overview of
    the architecture and describes the protocol used. The architecture is able to
    operate in networks supporting either traditional ASM or the newer SSM.</p>"
