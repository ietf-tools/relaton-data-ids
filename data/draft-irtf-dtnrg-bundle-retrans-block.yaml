abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an optional extension block, called a Retransmission
    Block (RB), that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [refs.DTNBP] within the
    context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [refs.DTNarch]. The Retransmission
    Block (RB) is designed to be used within a DTN that, as a matter of policy, deletes
    all replayed bundles from the network. It is designed to be used in a network
    that permits duplicate bundles to be forwarded if those bundles have been retransmitted
    by a custodian, that may (if possible) permit duplicate bundles to be forwarded
    if those bundles are in intentional or unintentional routing loops (contingent
    on the availability of mechanisms to distinguish looping bundles from other bundles),
    but that will consider all other duplicate bundles to be maliciously replayed
    bundles and delete them as such. The Retransmission Block is designed to be inserted
    into a bundle by a custodian when the custodian is retransmitting that bundle.
    The purpose of the RB is to mark the bundle as a custody-based retransmission
    so that it can be distinguished from other types of duplicate bundles and thereby
    be spared from deletion. This document defines the format and processing of this
    new Retransmission Block.</p>"
