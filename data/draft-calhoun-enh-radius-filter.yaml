- content: "<p>This specification defines an extension to the Enhanced RADIUS protocol
    [1]. As the dial-up services grow in complexity, there is a need for a user's
    filters to change dynamically, which could be initiated via an out-of-band request
    from the user to the RADIUS server or by the RADIUS server itself.</p>"
