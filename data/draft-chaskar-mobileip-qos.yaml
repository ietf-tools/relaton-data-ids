abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a solution to perform QoS signaling along the
    new network path, when mobile node using Mobile IPv6 acquires a new care-of address.
    The solution is based on the definition of new option called QoS OBJECT OPTION.
    This option is included in the hop-by-hop extension header of certain packets,
    preferably the ones carrying binding messages, propagating between mobile node
    and correspondent node or between mobile node and regional mobility agent(s).</p>"
