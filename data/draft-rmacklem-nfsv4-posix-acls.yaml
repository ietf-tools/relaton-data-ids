abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a potential protocol extension involving the
    addition of four new attributes to be used by servers to provide support for POSIX
    ACLs. The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL component of the Portable Operating
    System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e draft 17 document for which sponsorship was withdrawn
    in January 1998. Although the draft POSIX standard that describes these ACLs was
    never ratified, several POSIX-based operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris
    and FreeBSD include support for them. The NFS Version 4 (NFSv4) ACLs described
    in Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 henceforth referred to
    as NFSv4 ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between the ACLs of these
    two models have not been completely successful. In order to adequately support
    POSIX ACLs, this document proposes four new attributes that may optionally be
    used by an NFS Version 4, minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) server to support ACLs that
    conform to the aforementioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.</p>"
