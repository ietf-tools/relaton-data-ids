abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need for XML based scripting mechanism that allows ease
    of script construction and delegation with standardized mechanism. A management
    script composed of a set of instructions will allow periodic, coordinated and
    policy based management action. This memo describes a method of expressing management
    script and architecture for seamless management of XML based mobile devices along
    with SNMP based devices.</p>"
