abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is evolving to become a more ubiquitous network, driven
    by the low prices of wireless routers and access points and by the users' requirements
    of connectivity anytime and anywhere. For that reason, a cloud of nodes connected
    by wireless technology is being created at the edge of the Internet. We refer
    to this cloud as a Fringe Stub (FS). It is expected that networking in the FS
    will be highly unmanaged and ad-hoc, but at the same time will need to offer excellent
    service availability. The NEMO Basic Support protocol could be used to provide
    global reachability for a mobile access network within the FS and the Tree-Discovery
    mechanism could be used to avoid the formation of loops in this highly unmanaged
    structure. Since Internet connectivity in mobile scenarios can be costly, limited
    or unavailable, there is a need to enable local routing between the Mobile Routers
    within a portion of the FS. This form of local routing is useful for Route Optimization
    (RO) between Mobile Routers that are communicating directly in a portion of the
    FS. Network In Node Advertisement (NINA) is the second of a 2-passes routing protocol;
    a first pass, Tree Discovery, builds a loop-less structure -- a tree --, and the
    second pass, NINA, exposes the Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) up the tree. The
    protocol operates as a multi-hop extension of Neighbor Discovery (ND), to populate
    TD-based trees with prefixes, and establish routes towards the MNPs down the tree,
    from the root-MR towards the MR that owns the prefix, whereas the default route
    is oriented towards the root-MR. The NINA protocol introduces a new option in
    the ND Neighbor Advertisement (NA), the Network In Node Option (NINO). An NA with
    NINO(s) is called a NINA (Network In Node Advertisement). NINA is designed for
    a hierarchical model, and by using this NA based approach it abstracts the embedded
    network of a Mobile Router as a host to the upper level of network abstraction.
    With NINA, a Mobile Router presents its sub-tree to its parent as an embedded
    network and hides the inner topology and movements.</p>"
