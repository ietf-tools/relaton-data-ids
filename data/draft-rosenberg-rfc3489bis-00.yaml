abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocol
    that provides the ability for applications to determine the public IP addresses
    allocated to them by the NAT. These addresses can be placed into protocol payloads
    where a client needs to provide a publically routable IP address. STUN works with
    many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them. As a
    result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT
    infrastructure.</p>"
