abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a usecase, called BBU aggregation, for integreting
    radio and optical networks. It aims to compact several low-utilized BBU cards
    into one BBU to improve the BBU utilization. A flexible optical fronthaul network
    is connecting BBU and RRU to enable BBU aggregation by recongfiguring the lightpath
    between BBU and RRU. The procedure of the usecase is based on the unified radio
    and optical control archtecture, and an extended OpenFlow protocol is introduced
    to realize the procedure.</p>"
