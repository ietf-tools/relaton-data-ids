abstract:
- content: "<p>Large Proxy Mobile IPv6 deployments would benefit from a functionality
    where a Mobile Access Gateway could dynamically discover a Local Mobility Anchor
    for a Mobile Node attaching to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. The purpose of the
    dynamic discovery functionality is to reduce the amount of static configuration
    in the Mobile Access Gateway. This document describes several possible dynamic
    Local Mobility Anchor discovery solutions. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
