abstract:
- content: <p>RC4 is extremely weak as shown by RFC 6649 and RFC 7457, is prohibited
    in TLS by RFC 7465, is prohibited in Kerberos by RFC xxxx and it needs to be prohibited
    in all IETF protocols. Documents that provide technology that can only use RC4
    are obsoleted by this document, so this document obsoletes and moves to Historic
    RFC 3078 "Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) Protocol" (only supports
    RC4, RFC 3079 that is also part of that protocol is also obsoleted), RFC 4345
    "Improved Arcfour Modes for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol" (note
    Arcfour and RC4 are synonymous), RFC 4757 "The RC4-HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types
    Used by Microsoft Windows" (only supports RC4) and RFC 6229 "Test Vectors for
    the Stream Cipher RC4" (provides test vectors for historic cryptography). RFC
    2118, RFC 3501, RFC 3961, RFC 4120, RFC 4253, RFC 6150, RFC 6649, RFC 6733, RFC
    7457, RFC 7905 and RFC xxxx are updated to note the deprecation of RC4 in all
    IETF protocols. (Please do not confuse RFC 4757 with RFC 7457.)</p>
