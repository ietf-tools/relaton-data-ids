abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource provisioning
    solution for Diffserv network. The Load Control PCN (LC-PCN) addresses the following
    issues: o Admission Control for real time data flows in stateless Diffserv Domains
    o Flow Termination: Termination of flows in case of exceptional events, such as
    severe congestion after re-routing. Admission control in a Diffserv stateless
    domain can be performed using two methods: o Admission Control based on data marking,
    whereby in congestion situations the data packets are marked to notify the PCN-egress-
    node that a congestion occurred on a particular PCN-ingress-node to PCN-egress-node
    path. o Probing, whereby a probe packet is sent along the forwarding path in a
    network to determine whether a flow can be admitted based upon the current congestion
    state of the network The scheme provides the capability of controlling the traffic
    load in the network without requiring signaling or any per-flow processing in
    the PCN-interior-nodes. The complexity of Load Control is kept to a minimum to
    make implementation simple. LC-PCN can support the ingress-egress-aggregate (i.e.,
    trunk/pipe) bandwidth management model as well as the HOSE bandwidth management
    model.</p>"
