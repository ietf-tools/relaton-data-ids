abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an
    interface on a network device. Routing protocols have been developed based on
    the assumption that a destination address has this semantic. Many proposals have
    been made to add semantics to IP addresses. These proposals may set the meaning
    of an address within the scope of a limited domain, or suggest an address semantic
    that is meaningful at specific points in the network (such as the source and destination),
    and ideally can continue to be used without special interpretation at transit
    points. This document presents a brief survey of technologies related to IP address
    semantic proposals and describes the challenges to the existing routing system
    that they present. It then summarizes the opportunities for research into new
    or modified routing protocols to make use of new address semantics. It does not
    pass comment on the advisability or practicality of any of the solutions. This
    document is presented as study to support further research into clarifying and
    understanding the issues without directly proposing technical solutions that are
    ready for productization, deployment, or standardization.</p>"
