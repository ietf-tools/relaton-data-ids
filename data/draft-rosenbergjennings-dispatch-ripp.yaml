abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the Realtime Internet Peering Protocol (RIPP).
    RIPP is used to provide telephony peering between a trunking provider (such as
    a telco), and a trunking consumer (such as an enterprise, cloud PBX provider,
    cloud contact center provider, and so on). RIPP is an alternative to SIP, SDP
    and RTP for this use case, and is designed as a web application using HTTP/3.
    Using HTTP/3 allows trunking consumers to more easily build their applications
    on top of cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, all of which are
    heavily focused on HTTP based services. RIPP also addresses many of the challenges
    of traditional SIP-based trunking. Most notably, it mandates secure caller ID
    via STIR, and provides automated trunk provisioning as a mandatory protocol component.
    RIPP supports both direct and "BYO" trunk configurations. Since it runs over HTTP/3,
    it works through NATs and firewalls with the same ease as HTTP does, and easily
    supports load balancing with elastic cluster expansion and contraction, including
    auto-scaling - all because it is nothing more than an HTTP application. RIPP also
    provides built in mechanisms for migrations of calls between RIPP client and server
    instances, enabling failover with call preservation.</p>
