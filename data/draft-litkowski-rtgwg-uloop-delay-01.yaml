abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols
    to prevent a subset of transient loops during topology changes. It introduces
    a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the network wide convergence
    and the node advertising the failure. As the network wide convergence is delayed
    in case of down events, this mechanism can be used for planned maintenance or
    for unplanned outage provided a fast reroute mechanism is used in conjunction
    to convert a failure into a less urgent topology change. Simulation using real
    network topologies and costs, with pathological convergence behaviour, have been
    performed. While the proposed mechanism does not provide a complete solution,
    it is simple and it solves an interesting fraction of the transient loops in the
    analyzed SP topologies.</p>"
