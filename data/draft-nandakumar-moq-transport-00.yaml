abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defined MoqTransport (moqt), an unified media delivery
    protocol over QUIC. It aims at supporting multiple application classes with varying
    latency requirements including ultra low latency applications such as interactive
    communication and gaming. It is based on a publish/subscribe metaphor where entities
    publish and subscribe to data that is sent through, and received from, relays
    in the cloud. The data is delivered in the strict priority order. The information
    subscribed to is named such that this forms an overlay information centric network.
    The relays allow for efficient large scale deployments.</p>"
