abstract:
- content: "<p>The [IMAP4] BODYSTRUCTURE FETCH data item allows a client to learn
    about the MIME structure of a message without the need to download the entire
    message. This document extends the syntax of the [IMAP4] BODYSTRUCTURE FETCH response
    data item to include information from the Content-Location header field described
    in [MHTML]. This extension helps MHTML-aware IMAP clients to save both the number
    of round trips and the amount of information sent across the network. Fallback
    strategies are also discussed when an IMAP server doesn't support this extension.</p>"
