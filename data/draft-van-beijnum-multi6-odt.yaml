abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol to negotiate and subsequently use
    tunnels on demand, and the use of such tunnels to achieve scalable multihoming.
    The tunnels may run over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport, and the payload may consist
    of any upper layer protocol that can be used with IPv4 or IPv6. Tunnels are defined
    end-to-end, which means that a single outer or 'locator' address pair maps to
    a single inner or 'identifier' address pair. In order to avoid unnecessary overhead,
    tunneled packets (in the absence of option headers) only carry an outer header,
    an upper layer header and payload data. There is no inner header containing the
    original addresses; this information is reconstituted from the state associated
    with the tunnel where required. Additional mechanisms are used to provide basic
    security for the mapping between inner and outer addresses and to avoid unnecessary
    overhead and delays for short-lived sessions, and to facilitate rehoming in the
    event of a reachability problem. This document is a first draft, and as such doesn't
    contain a full protocol specification as higher-level changes are expected.</p>"
