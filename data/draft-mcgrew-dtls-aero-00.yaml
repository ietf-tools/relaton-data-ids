abstract:
- content: "<p>Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communication security
    protocol that is attractive for use in constrained environments, in which it is
    important to minimize the data expansion added by the security protocol, and to
    support multicast security . Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO)
    is a cryptographic technique that is well suited for use in DTLS, especially in
    these scenarios: it has minimal data expansion, avoids the need to manage implicit
    state, works well with multiple receivers and multiple senders, and provides strong
    misuse resistance. This document describes how AERO can be used in DTLS.</p>"
