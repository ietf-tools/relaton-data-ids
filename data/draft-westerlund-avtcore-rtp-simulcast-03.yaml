abstract:
- content: "<p>In some application scenarios it may be desirable to send multiple
    differently encoded versions of the same Media Source in independent Source Packet
    Streams. This is called Simulcast. This document discusses the best way of accomplishing
    Simulcast in RTP and how to signal it in SDP. A solution is defined by making
    three extensions to SDP, and using RTP/RTCP identification methods to relate RTP
    Source Packet Streams. The first SDP extension consists of two new session level
    SDP attributes that express capability to send or receive Simulcast Source Packet
    Streams, respectively. The second SDP extension introduces an SDP media level
    attribute that groups and identifies a selected set of media level parameters
    for a specific direction, called a media configuration. The third SDP extension
    describes how to group such media configurations on SDP session or media level
    for Simulcast purposes.</p>"
