abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the extensions to the NSIS QoS signalling protocol
    (QoS-NSLP)[QoS-NSLP] for support of the Controlled Load (CL) service over a DiffServ
    cloud using Pre-Congestion Notification as defined in [CL-DEPLOY]. The CL-DEPLOY
    is a QoS architecture similiar to RMD-QOSM measurement-based admission control.
    This draft is based on [RSVP-PCN] and uses some text from it.</p>"
