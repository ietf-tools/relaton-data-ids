abstract:
- content: "<p>Several wireless ad-hoc routing protocols have been and are being developped
    for MANET. However, autoconfiguration of MANET networks is still an unsettled
    area, and several methods have been proposed to perform such a task. One of the
    mecanisms that may be required for address autoconfiguration, is the detection
    of address conflicts. This is specially true for one of scenarios for MANET autoconf,
    the This document specifies a general protocol for the detecting address conflicts
    in a MANET network, and hence addresses a subset of the requirements of a full
    MANET address autoconfiguration solution. It is specified as an independent protocol
    from the MANET routing protocol, and the address configuration method, and may
    be used with any of them. It aims at conceptual simplicity: essentially, a tree
    of the nodes is built, from which all the information from all the existing nodes
    is known. Conflicts are detected by the node at root of the tree, or as inconsistent
    information on the root of the tree.</p>"
