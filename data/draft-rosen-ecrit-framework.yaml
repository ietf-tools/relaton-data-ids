abstract:
- content: "<p>Summoning emergency help by the public is a core feature of telephone
    networks. This document describes a framework of how various IETF protocols are
    combined to place emergency calls. This includes how these calls are routed to
    the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the physical location
    of the caller, while providing the call taker the necessary information to dispatch
    a first responder to that location. This document explains how location mapping,
    call identification and end system behavior are combined to allow multimedia emergency
    calls. It describes at a high level how the pieces (recognizing a call as an emergency
    call, marking it as such, determining the location of the caller, routing the
    call based on location) go together, and references the Internet standards that
    define the details of these mechanisms.</p>"
