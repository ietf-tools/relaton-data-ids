abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed
    from layered service networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency
    to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers. PCE
    is a candidate solution for such requirements. Generic requirements for a communication
    protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "PCE
    Communication Protocol Generic Requirements". This document complements the generic
    requirements and presents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements
    for inter-layer traffic engineering.</p>
