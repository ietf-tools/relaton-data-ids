abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to IS-IS to allow the use of any
    cryptographic authentication algorithm in addition to the already documented authentication
    schemes, described in the base specification and RFC 3567. Although this document
    has been written specifically for using MAC construct along with the SHA family
    of cryptographic hash functions, the method described in this document is generic
    and can be used to extend IS-IS to support any cryptographic hash function in
    the future.</p>"
