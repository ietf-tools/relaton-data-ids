abstract:
- content: "<p>Identifier Systems have been in existence for many years and are in
    widespread use. An opaque identifier conveys essentially nothing about the information
    identified and must be converted into useful intermediate information, known as
    state information, before the information being identified can be accessed or
    used. An identifier that is can be processed by a system in the Internet to provide
    useful and actionable intermediate state information is said to be resolvable.
    Although there is ongoing discussion about the value of opaque versus non-opaque
    identifiers, we assume the existence of a minimal syntax structure for the identifier
    and also that the resolution mechanisms only knows about the minimal syntax of
    the identifier. In this document we introduce the notion of interoperability of
    identifier resolution systems as a key component for enabling interoperability
    of heterogeneous information systems more broadly, and discuss the role of unique
    persistent resolvable identifiers. Terminology is proposed to facilitate this
    discussion and a set of use cases demonstrating the need for interoperability
    of resolution systems are included.</p>"
