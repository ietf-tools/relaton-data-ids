abstract:
- content: "<p>Given a concern for pervasive monitoring, messaging information needing
    protection includes primary payload, descriptive meta-data, and traffic-related
    analysis. Complete protection against pervasive monitoring (PM), for traffic through
    complex handling sequences, has not yet been achieved reliably in real-world operation.
    Consequently, it is reasonable to consider a range of mechanisms, for protecting
    differing amounts of information and against monitoring of different kinds. Although
    channel-based encryption can be helpful, it is not sufficient. This paper considers
    pursuing different levels of end-to-end protection, referencing examples of component
    mechanisms that already have encouraging field experience.</p>"
