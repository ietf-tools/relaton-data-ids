abstract:
- content: "<p>Many people learn technical concepts best in a hands-on environment,
    and Internet protocols and standards are no exception. Internet Research Labs
    (IRL) will facilitate a platform and encourage the technical community (seasoned
    professionals and newcomers alike) to discuss, collaborate, design and develop
    utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations
    (Proof of Concept) of existing IETF standards. These labs may also be used by
    the IETF Mentoring Program and/or EDU teams for hands-on training to mentees or
    newcomers. This base draft intends to provide a high-level overview of the concept
    of Internet Research Labs in terms of objectives, requirements, challenges and
    deliverables without going into details of a specific lab, technology or an IETF
    Working Group (WG). After this draft matures and gains traction within the IETF
    community, we foresee more and more Internet drafts for the specific labs.</p>"
