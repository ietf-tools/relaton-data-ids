abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocols that rely on Classic DNS have to account for considerations
    that only apply to UDP, such as message fragmentation. However, DNS implementations
    are already required to support both TCP and UDP, and using TCP would alleviate
    these considerations. This document specifies that new protocols with a dependency
    on Classic DNS do not need to account for the limitations of Classic DNS over
    UDP and can instead expect implementations to use Classic DNS over TCP.</p>"
