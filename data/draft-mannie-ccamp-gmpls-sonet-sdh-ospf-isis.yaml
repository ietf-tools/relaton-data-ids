abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces some of the extensions required in existing
    IGP routing protocols to support sub-sequent signalling for dynamically established
    SONET/SDH circuits using GMPLS-based control plane architecture [GMPLS-ARCH].
    In particular, it specifies the GMPLS routing extensions to OSPF and IS-IS routing
    protocols for SONET/SDH networks using [GMPLS-RTG] as guideline. The current document
    is based on the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions defined in [OSPF-TE] and [ISIS-TE].
    It supports link bundling (aka TE Links) as defined in [MPLS-BDL]. This document
    proposes several new sub-TLVs for SONET/SDH network control which complement those
    proposed in [GMPLS-OSPF] and [GMPLS-ISIS]. The proposed encoding does not preclude
    any further integration in these documents that the current one intends to complement.</p>"
