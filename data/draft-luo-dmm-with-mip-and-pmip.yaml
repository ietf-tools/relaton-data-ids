abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on the analysis of current centralized mobility management approaches,
    three main functions of current centralized mobility anchor are identified, which
    are Mobility Routing (MR), Home Address Allocation (HAA), and Location Management
    (LM), in this draft. Based on the proposal of decoupling those functions, this
    draft provides a concept of architecture for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM)
    with some key approaches for DMM. Those approaches are compatible with both current
    MIP and PMIP protocols.</p>"
