abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Wave and Equation Based Rate Control (WEBRC),
    which provides rate and congestion control for data delivery. WEBRC is specifically
    designed to support protocols using IP multicast. It provides multiple-rate, congestion-controlled
    delivery to receivers, i.e., different receivers joined to the same session may
    be receiving packets at different rates depending on the bandwidths of their individual
    connections to the sender and on competing traffic along these connections. WEBRC
    requires no feedback from receivers to the sender, i.e., it is a completely receiver-driven
    congestion control protocol. Thus, it is designed to scale to potentially massive
    numbers of receivers attached to a session from a single sender. Furthermore,
    because each individual receiver adjusts to the available bandwidth between the
    sender and that receiver, there is the potential to deliver data to each individual
    receiver at the fastest possible rate for that receiver, even in a highly heterogeneous
    network architecture, using a single sender. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
