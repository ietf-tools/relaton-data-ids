abstract:
- content: "<p>LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP based transport for control plane to
    establish the data session and user plane for actual data delivery. In existing
    architecture, IP transport used in user plane is not optimized for data transport,
    which leads to an inefficient data delivery. IP unicast routing from server to
    clients is used for delivery of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE), where
    each user gets a separate stream. From bandwidth and routing perspective this
    approach is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast technologies have emerged recently
    for mobile networks, but their deployments are very limited or at an experimental
    stage due to complex architecture and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly
    emerging technology with built-in features for efficient multimedia data delivery,
    however majority of the work is focused on fixed networks. The main focus of this
    draft is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks by using ICN
    in 3GPP protocol stack. ICN has an inherent capability for multicast, anchorless
    mobility, security and it is optimized for data delivery using local caching at
    the edge. The proposed approaches in this draft allow ICN to be enabled natively
    over the current LTE stack comprising of PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY or in a dual stack mode
    (along with IP) help optimize the mobile networks by leveraging the inherent benefits
    of ICN.</p>"
