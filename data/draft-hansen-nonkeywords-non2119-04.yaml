abstract:
- content: "<p>Specifications in RFCs contain normative keywords, as defined in RFC
    2119, to signify requirements, permission or prohibitions. These include MUST,
    SHOULD and MAY, which are commonly recorded in all CAPITALS (but need not be).
    The RFC 2119 words are sometimes also used with non-normative meaning; this non-normative
    usage can be confusing and it is better to restrict the RFC 2119 words to be used
    solely as normative directives. Happily, natural languages permit variation in
    phrasing, so that meaning can be retained without use of this otherwise-normative
    vocabulary. For such situations, this document provides some alternatives to the
    normative vocabulary of RFC 2119.</p>"
