abstract:
- content: "<p>The rapid increase in the amount and type of traffic makes it significantly
    more challenging for operational and management applications to maintain the network
    and deploy new services. This is the root cause of one of the major challenges
    that network operators (service providers, SME, etc) are facing today. The operators
    are obliged to create a simplified view of their network infrastructure that can
    help network engineers to use such a simplified model rather than manipulating
    individual devices. In this context, providing network operators with a set of
    standard generic YANG-based data models that enable management and automation
    of services on their network is essential. This document describes what has to
    be addressed in order to equip service providers with the means to quickly and
    dynamically create/query/scale/update/delete the services they want to offer.
    This may include a variety of different service enabling scenarios and in particular
    VPN management from an individual to a data center, within a data center or among
    a set of physical or virtualized data centers that belong to an organization or
    different organizations.</p>"
