abstract:
- content: "<p>Signaling layer protocols in the NSIS working group may rely on GIST
    to handle authorization. Still, the signaling layer protocol itself may require
    separate authorization to be performed when a node receives a request for a certain
    kind of service or resources. This draft presents a generic model and object formats
    for session authorization within the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols. The goal
    of session authorization is to allow the exchange of information between network
    elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a service and to coordinate
    actions between the signaling and transport planes.</p>"
