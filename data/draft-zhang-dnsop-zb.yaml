abstract:
- content: "<p>A DNS lookup usually requires the recursive server to start an iterative
    query process from the DNS root server to the bottom authoritative server. Attacks
    may occur at any level when querying authoritative servers. If the DNS recursive
    resolver operator can obtain the IP addresses of the authoritative servers for
    the queried domain, they may want to query the authoritative server directly on
    the recursive server. In such a way, the resolver can start the iterative query
    process from the designated authoritative server, greatly decreasing the round-trip
    time, avoiding the attacks on the upper-level and preventing snooping by third
    parties of requests sent to upper-level authoritative servers. This document shows
    a technique for querying the designated authoritative server directly on the recursive
    server at the enterprise level, at the cost of adding some operational fragility
    for the operator.</p>"
