abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for Fast Notification for Traffic
    Engineering and Load Balancing (FaNTEL), a mechanism designed to deliver near
    real-time network status updates. FaNTEL enables fast failure and congestion notifications,
    supporting rapid protection switching and dynamic load balancing. By providing
    low- latency alerts, it helps networks respond quickly to link failures and congestion
    events, improving service reliability and performance.</p>"
