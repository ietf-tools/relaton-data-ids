abstract:
- content: <p>This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to
    meet the requirements presented in draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req- 04.txt, "Requirements
    for Accounting, Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting
    Services". In this framework a user sends a request for multicast data to a network
    service provider. The network service provider selects the appropriate content
    provider to which it then sends on the request transparently in a way so that
    the network service provider and content provider do not need to know the corresponding
    user id for the same user in the other provider's domain. The content provider
    then responds with an indication of "success" or "failure" to the network provider
    and in the case of "success", the network provider may delivery the requested
    data to the user. The network service may base its decision to deliver such data
    to the user based on its bandwidth management policy. The framework is designed
    to be flexible and extendible, so it will be possible to implement partially enabled
    versions as well as fully enabled versions of the model. Also an additional entity
    may provide transit of requests between network service providers and content
    providers, either through relaying or tunneling.</p>
