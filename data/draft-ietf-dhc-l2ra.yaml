abstract:
- content: "<p>In some networks, DHCP servers rely on Relay Agent Information option
    appended by Relay Agents for IP address and other parameter assignment policies.
    This works fine when end hosts are directly connected to Relay Agents. In some
    network configurations, one or more Layer 2 devices may reside between DHCP clients
    and Relay agent. In these network scenarios, it is difficult to use the Relay
    Agent Information option for IP address and other parameter assignment policies
    effectively. So there is a need for the device that is closest to the end hosts
    to append a Relay Agent Information option in DHCP messages. These devices are
    typically known as Layer 2 Relay Agents. This document aims to describe the network
    scenarios where a Layer 2 Relay Agent is in use and also how it handles DHCP messages.</p>"
