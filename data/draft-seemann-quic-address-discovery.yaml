abstract:
- content: "<p>Unless they have out-of-band knowledge, QUIC endpoints have no information
    about their network situation. They neither know their external IP address and
    port, nor do they know if they are directly connected to the internet or if they
    are behind a NAT. This QUIC extension allows nodes to determine their public IP
    address and port for any QUIC path.</p>"
