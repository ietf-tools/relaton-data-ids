abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines three new RADIUS attributes. For device that
    implementing IP port ranges, these attributes are used to communicate with a RADIUS
    server in order to configure and report TCP/UDP ports and ICMP identifiers, as
    well as mapping behavior for specific hosts. This mechanism can be used in various
    deployment scenarios such as CGN, NAT64, Provider WiFi Gateway, etc. This document
    does not make any assumption about the deployment context.</p>"
