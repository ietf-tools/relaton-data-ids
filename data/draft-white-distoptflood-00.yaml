abstract:
- content: "<p>Dense topologies, such as data center fabrics based on the Clos and
    butterfly fabric topologies. Flooding mechanisms designed for sparse topologies,
    when used in these dense topologies, can result in slower convergence times and
    higher resource utilization. The modifications to the flooding mechanism in the
    Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) link state protocol described
    in this document reduce resource utilization to a minimum, while increaseing convergence
    performance in dense topologies. Note that a Clos fabric is used as the primary
    example of a desne flooding topology throughout this document. However, the flooding
    optimizations described in this document apply to any dense topology.</p>"
