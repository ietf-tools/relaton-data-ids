abstract:
- content: <p>The RFC Editor publishes the Internet's archival series of technical
    and informational documents. RFC 5620 defines RFC Editor Model Version 1, whose
    implementation began in January 2010. Model 1 divides RFC Editor activities into
    a number of components, including the RFC Series Editor (RSE). During 2010, a
    "Transitional RFC Series Editor" performed and evaluated the RSE role. Based on
    direct experience, extensive discussions with the community, and research, the
    TRSE provides this updated version of RFC 5620. This draft revises the RSE job
    description, and makes recommendations for the search and selection process for
    a permanent RSE. This memo also clarifies RFC Editor and RSE activities using
    established approaches of management and oversight of a publication service, tailored
    for the style of the Internet technical community. Careful attention is paid to
    ensuring stable operations. This document observes that RSE responsibilities demand
    a very high level of editorial and managerial expertise.</p>
