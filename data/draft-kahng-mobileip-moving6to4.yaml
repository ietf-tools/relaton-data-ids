abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new mechanism to solve mobility problems
    over IPv6 transition networks which IPv6 sites are interconnected over a wide
    area network which has no native IPv6 support[4]. This draft defines an extended
    mechanism of 6to4 mechanism[4] and Mobile IPv6[2] to support mobility over 6to4.
    It also describes scenarios for using the proposed mechanism during the co-existence
    period.</p>"
