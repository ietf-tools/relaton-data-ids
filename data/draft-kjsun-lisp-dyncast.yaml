abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic Anycast (Dyncast) is a new routing approach to support equivalent
    services running in distributed geolocations and connect to them by considering
    both network-related metric and service- related metric. In LISP, it is possible
    to support anycast EIDs and/ or anycast RLOCs without any modification, so it
    is suitable for providing dyncast routing. In this document, it describes the
    LISP- based dyncast architecture and related standard works to meet dyncast requirements.</p>"
