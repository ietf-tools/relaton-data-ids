abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a simple and efficient mechanism that can be
    used to detect data plane failures in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs). There are two parts to this document: information carried
    in an MPLS "echo request" and "echo reply" for the purposes of fault detection
    and isolation, and mechanisms for reliably sending the echo reply. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
