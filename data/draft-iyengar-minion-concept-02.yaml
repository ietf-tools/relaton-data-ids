abstract:
- content: "<p>Minion uses TCP-format packets on-the-wire, to provide full compatibility
    with existing NATs, Firewalls, and similar middleboxes, but provides a richer
    set of facilities to the application. Minion's richer facilities include a message-oriented
    API rather than TCP's unstructured byte-stream service model, multiplexing of
    multiple messages (or message streams) on a single connection, interleaving of
    multiplexed messages (to eliminate head-of-line blocking), message cancellation,
    request/reply support, ordered and unordered messages, superseding messages, chained
    messages, multiple priority levels with byte-granularity preemption, and DTLS
    Security. Minion can be implemented entirely as a user-level library, without
    waiting for any special support from OS vendors, and provides immediate benefits
    to application developers. Additionally, Minion is able to take advantage of some
    simple kernel extensions to provide enhanced services that go beyond what is possible
    with traditional TCP. These kernel extensions are optional, and even without them,
    Minion offers worthwhile benefits to application developers.</p>"
