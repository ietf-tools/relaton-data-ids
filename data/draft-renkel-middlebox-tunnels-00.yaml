abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft compares Network Address Translation (NAT) and
    Realm Specific IP (RSIP) tunnels, and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    It then shows how the advantages can be combined by implementing NAT as a tunnel
    in hosts, while minimizing the disadvantages. Based on the advantages of middlebox
    tunnels in general and implementing NAT as a middlebox tunnel in particular, it
    then recommends that the Middlebox Communications architecture protocol (MIDCOM)
    be amended to support tunnels between hosts and middleboxes. This .txt version
    of this internet draft is identical to the PostScript version (draft-renkel-middlebox-tunnels-00.ps)
    except that the figures from the PostScript version have been deleted. Please
    refer to the PostScript version for these figures.</p>"
