abstract:
- content: "<p>Vendors of consumer electronics and network gear have produced and
    sold hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts with globally routable Internet Protocol
    addresses embedded within their products' firmware. These products are now in
    operation world-wide and primarily include, but are not necessarily limited to,
    low-cost routers and middleboxes for personal or residential use. This 'hard-coding'
    of globally routable IP addresses within the host's firmware presents significant
    problems to the operation of the Internet and to the management of its address
    space. This document means to clarify best current practices in the Internet community.
    It denouces the practice of embedding references to unique, globally routable
    IP addresses in Internet hosts, describes some of the resulting problems, and
    considers selected alternatives. It is also intended to remind the Internet community
    of the ephemeral nature of unique, globally routable IP addresses and that the
    assignment and use of such addresses is temporary and therefore should not be
    used in fixed configurations.</p>"
