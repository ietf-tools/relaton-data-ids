abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a SIP extension for CC/PP (Composite Capability/Preference
    Profiles) exchange. CC/PPex, proposed by W3C, is only usable for client-pull service
    like HTTP. It is not suitable for server initiated push services. Since traditional
    SIP already has a method to convey the limited terminal capabilities for multimedia
    calls, SIP naturally extends to support CC/PP. This extension allows various types
    of push services to know the terminal capabilities before delivering the contents
    to the push clients. This is accomplished by introducing some additional headers
    in the REGISTER/OPTIONS message that carry the same information as CC/PPex does.</p>"
