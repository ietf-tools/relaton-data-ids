abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol which allows to authenticate systems
    and establish Security Associations in networks with different domains of security.
    The protocol is not only end-to-end, but it involves all participating systems
    in a single exchange. Further it allows security gateways to derive sub-policies
    for crossing (encrypted) IPSec-traffic from 'conventional' packet filtering rules
    in a trusted manner.</p>"
