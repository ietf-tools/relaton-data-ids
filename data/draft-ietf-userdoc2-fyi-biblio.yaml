abstract:
- content: "<p>This bibliography offers a list of recent publications which summarize
    the Internet, including its associated networks, resources, protocols, and history.
    This FYI RFC includes references to free sources of information available on-line
    as well as traditional publications. The books and on-line sources are designed
    as a starting point, rather than as a comprehensive list of all materials about
    the Internet. The emphasis is on recently printed books (1991-94), many of which
    are excellent overviews of the Internet. The list includes references to both
    introductory and more advanced materials. It is intended to compliment FYI 19
    which is a short bibliography primarily designed for novice network users.</p>"
