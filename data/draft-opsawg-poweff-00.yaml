abstract:
- content: '<p>This document motivates and specifies a data model to report power
    and energy efficiency of an asset. As highlighted during the IAB workshop on environmental
    impacts (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-iab-ws-environmental- impacts-report-00),
    visibility is a very important first step (paraphrasing Peter Drucker''s mantra
    of "You cannot improve what you don''t measure"). During the workshop the need
    for standardized metrics was established, to avoid proprietary, double counting
    and even contradictory metrics across vendors. This Power and Energy Efficiency
    Telemetry Specification (POWEFF) is required to promote consistency across vendors
    and consumers, based on: 1. The definition of datasets and attributes defining
    a common data model utilized by the standard calculation to yield power and energy
    efficiency value for any asset or network element. 2. The standard calculations
    utilizing the specified datasets and attributes which will yield energy consumption
    and energy efficiency value for any asset or network element. The model provides
    information and data requirements for calculating the Power and Energy Efficiency
    for specific assets. Assets can include hardware (physical or virtual), software,
    applications, or services.</p>'
