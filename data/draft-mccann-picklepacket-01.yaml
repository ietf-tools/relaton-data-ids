abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Pickle Packet, a message that can be used
    to coordinate the opening of a transport connection with various middleboxes that
    may lie on the path. It contains the DNS names of both the initiator and the responder
    of the connection and some authentication data. Because the authentication data
    uses public key cryptography, any middlebox can independently authenticate the
    initiator and make a policy decision whether to allow or deny the flow based on
    the DNS names. The Pickle Packet allows for middleboxes to establish state such
    as firewall pinholes or security associations that can be used to filter out unwanted
    traffic.</p>"
