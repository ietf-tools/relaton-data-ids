abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an encoding of PCN marks based on the ECN field
    of the Voice-Admit DSCP. It has global meaning and ECN semantics are not applied
    to that field. The PCN codepoints are the same as those for packet-specific dual
    marking (PSDM) within a single PCN domain, but the general concept can also be
    applied to other encodings requiring only a single PCN-enabled DSCP.</p>"
