abstract:
- content: "<p>Management of name servers for the Domain Name Service (DNS) has traditionally
    been done using vendor-specific monitoring, configuration and control methods.
    Although some service monitoring platforms can test the functionality of the DNS
    itself there is not a interoperable way to manage (monitor, control and configure)
    the internal aspects of a name server itself. This document discusses the requirements
    of a management system for DNS name servers. A management solution that is designed
    to manage the DNS can use this document as a shopping list of needed features.</p>"
