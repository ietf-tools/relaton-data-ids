abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a reference architecture that may be used to
    tightly integrate CE-CE [IPSec] encryption with the any-to-any connectivity model
    of [RFC2547]. Using this mechanism, a Service Provider is able to provide an IP
    VPN service with data encryption between customer edge routers, but without the
    need of direct routing protocol exchange, or IP-based tunnels such as provided
    by [GRE].</p>"
