abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTML format for RFCs, described in [I-D.hildebrand-html-rfc] assigns
    style guidance to an RFC Editor-defined Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). The embedded,
    default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility
    needs and be built along a responsive design model. This document describes the
    requirements for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor. The class names are based
    on the classes defined in draft-hildebrand-html-rfc. Discussion of this draft
    takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which
    has its home page at https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.</p>"
