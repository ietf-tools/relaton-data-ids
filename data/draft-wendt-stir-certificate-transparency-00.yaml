abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the use of the Certificate
    Transparency (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of Secure Telephone
    Identity (STI) certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows
    anyone to audit STI certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance
    of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves. The
    intent is establish a level of trust in the STI eco-system that verification of
    calls would required and refuse to honor STI certificates that do not appear in
    a log, effectively forcing STI CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs,
    establishing trust that STI certificates are unique to the authorized provider
    or assignee of a telephone number resource. The primary role of certificate transparency
    in the STI ecosystem is the avoidance of issuance of unauthorized or duplicate
    provider level certificates or, of particular importance, telephone number level
    delegate certificates. This provides a robust mechanism for the detection of unauthorized
    creation of certificate credentials for illegitimate spoofing of telephone numbers.</p>"
