abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the candidate protocol mechanisms which may
    be used to meet the requirements of enhanced virtual private networks (VPN+).
    The gaps and limitations of existing mechanisms are analyzed, then a proposed
    mechanism is briefly described. The proposed mechanism can be used to achieve
    network slicing to meet the stringent requirement of emerging 5G services, but
    it can also be useful in other general network scenarios.</p>"
