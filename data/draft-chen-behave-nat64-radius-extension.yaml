abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes new radius attributes for stateful NAT64. The
    extensions are used to provide geo-location services with an exact IPv6 soruce
    address. The message flow to deliver the NAT64 binding information between radius
    clients and servers is also described. Therefore, accurate location could be traced
    out depending on the radius method.</p>"
