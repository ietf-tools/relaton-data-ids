abstract:
- content: <p>Overhead due to the movement of user data in the end-system network
    I/O processing path at high speeds is significant, and has limited the use of
    Internet protocols in interconnection networks, and the Internet itself -- especially
    where high bandwidth, low latency, and/or low overhead are required by the hosted
    application. This document examines this overhead, and addresses an architectural,
    IP-based "copy avoidance" solution for its elimination, by enabling Remote Direct
    Memory Access (RDMA). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
