abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) provides a cryptographic mechanism
    for domains to assert responsibility for the messages they handle. A related mechanism
    will allow an administrator to publish various statements about their DKIM signing
    practices. This document defines requirements for this mechanism, distinguishing
    between those that must be satisfied (MUST), and those that are highly desirable
    (SHOULD). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
