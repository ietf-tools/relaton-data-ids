abstract:
- content: "<p>The Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is currently
    defined as an intra-domain multicast protocol. Although in PIM-SM more than one
    Candidate Rendezvous Point (C-RP) may exist, only one can be active at a given
    time, and this will be the one to which receivers will send Join messages or sources
    will send Register messages. The method used in PIM-SM to make public the set
    of C-RPs for a multicast group is to flood all over the domain packets with the
    list of C-RPs using the so-called Bootstrap method. This approach may scale in
    domains with few routers but does not scale if the protocol would have to be applied
    to provide multicast throughout the whole internet. In this draft we specify the
    modifications needed in PIM-SM in order to support more than one active RP simultaneously,
    and also show how Static Multicast can be used to make public in an scalable way
    the information regarding RPs as well as the IP multicast address for the multicast
    group. In the presence of more than one source, having more than one RP and placing
    them according to sources and receivers' distribution on the internet will reduce
    the average number of hops from sources to receivers, and will also improve the
    multicast protocol's fault tolerance.</p>"
