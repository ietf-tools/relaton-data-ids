- content: "<p>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is a profile of the
    Real-time Transport Protocol that can provide confidentiality, message authentication,
    and replay protection to the RTP traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the
    Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP). This document describes a method
    of using DTLS key management for SRTP by using a new extension that indicates
    that SRTP is to be used for data protection, and which establishes SRTP keys.</p>"
