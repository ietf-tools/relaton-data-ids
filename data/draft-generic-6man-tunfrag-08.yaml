abstract:
- content: '<p>IP fragmentation has long been subject for scrutiny since the publication
    of "Fragmentation Considered Harmful" in 1987. This work cast fragmentation in
    a negative light that has persisted to the present day. However, the tone of the
    work failed to honor two principles of creative thinking: never say "always" and
    never say "never". This document discusses uses for fragmentation that apply both
    to the present day and moving forward into the future.</p>'
