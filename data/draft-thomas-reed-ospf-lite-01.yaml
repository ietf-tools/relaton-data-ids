abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents what needs to be removed and added to OSPF [RFC2328]
    to create a working implementation of the experimental protocol ospf- lite. ospf-lite
    runs over TCP and UDP ports 8899. ospf-lite has been designed to provide a simpler
    version of the OSPF protocol. A router running ospf-lite requires little configuration.
    Many of the Protocol complexities have been removed. Areas are not implemented
    and Designated Router functionality has been removed from the protocol. In almost
    every case with these removals the protocol is made more scalable. ospf-lite will
    run over non fully meshed NBMA clouds without explicit configuration. ospf-lite
    contains support for External LSA's and opaque LSA's. The protocol removes the
    support of LSA's type 2,3,4,7 and the DR function. Promiscuous hellos are introduced
    and a unified interface link type replaces existing link types. This work is intended
    to keep pace with the vast increases in processor performance, memory size and
    link capacity since OSPF was originally conceived. Where further details are required
    the authors refer the reader to [RFC 2328]. Please send comments to mrthom@essex.ac.uk</p>"
