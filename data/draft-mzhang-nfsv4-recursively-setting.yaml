abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years, the concept of near-data computing has been widely
    recognized in storage architectures. The core idea is to process data nearby,
    reduce the overhead of network transmission, and utilize the computing capability
    of smart devices (such as intelligent NICs, smart SSDs, and DPUs). This reduces
    CPU and memory usage of clients (computing nodes) and improves data processing
    efficiency. This design idea is applied in NFSv4.2 or future NFS verions, such
    as Server-Side Copy, in which client sends the control command and the storage
    server copies data without passing through the data between the client and storage
    server. Compared with traditional copy operations, data is read from the source
    storage server and then written to the target storage server after two network
    transmissions. Data transmission on the network is reduced, and bandwidth resources
    are greatly released. In addition, the client changes from an original data copy
    executor to a data copy controller, and a specific execution action is executed
    by the storage server. Therefore, a large amount of computing resources and memory
    resources are saved on the client side.</p>"
