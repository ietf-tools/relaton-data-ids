abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a software defined networking (SDN) based unified
    IPv6 transition framework. This framework makes use of the flow-based packet forwarding
    technology, which can simplify the implementation of both control plane and data
    plane operations of transition mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to provide
    an integrated and flexible framework to implement and deploy transition mechanisms,
    such as MAP-E, Lightweight 4over6, etc.</p>"
