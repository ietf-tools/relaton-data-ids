abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol (BWTP) is an application- level
    protocol that can be used to upgrade a HTTP/1.1 connection, as defined by [RFC2616]
    to a bidirectional channel capable of exchanging messages. It is intended that
    BWTP can be used as a transport protocol for the HTML 5 Websocket API, as well
    as for other uses.</p>"
