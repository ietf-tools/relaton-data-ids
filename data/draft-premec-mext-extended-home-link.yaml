abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility for the
    mobile node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 home address, irrespective
    of the IP version supported on the link that the mobile node is attached to. The
    home agent maintains binding cache entries for the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses
    assigned to the mobile node when the mobile node is connected via a foreign link.
    The binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile node attaches to its
    home link. This document addresses an issue related to the de-registration procedure
    and the continued connectivity for the IPv4 home address when the mobile node
    attaches to its IPv6-only home link.</p>"
