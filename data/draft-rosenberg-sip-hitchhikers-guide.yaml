abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the subject of numerous specifications
    that have been produced by the IETF. It can be difficult to locate the right document,
    or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SIP. Don't Panic!
    This specification serves as a guide to the SIP RFC series. It lists the specifications
    under the SIP umbrella, briefly summarizes each, and groups them into categories.</p>"
