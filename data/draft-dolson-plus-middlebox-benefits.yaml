abstract:
- content: <p>At IETF97, at a meeting regarding the Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS)
    protocol, a request was made for documentation about the benefits that might be
    provided by permitting middleboxes to have some visibility to transport-layer
    information. This document summarizes benefits provided to the Internet by intermediary
    devices that provide functions apart from normal IP forwarding. Such intermediary
    devices are often called "middleboxes". RFC3234 defines a taxonomy of middleboxes
    and issues in the Internet. Most of those middleboxes utilize or modify application-layer
    data. This document primarily focuses on devices that observe and act on information
    carried in the transport layer, and especially information carried in TCP packets.
    A primary goal of this document is to provide information to working groups developing
    new transport protocols, in particular the PLUS and QUIC working groups, to aid
    understanding of what might be gained or lost by design decisions that may affect
    (or be affected by) middlebox operation.</p>
