abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the significant concepts and research challenges described
    in RFC7927, we think that the multi-service tag technology is a effective name
    mechanism for video contents in ICN. Because the video traffic is the primary
    traffic transferred in the Internet, it will tremendously promote the current
    Internet architecture to the ICN architecture that the name mechanism for the
    video contents is established. This document discusses the consideration for the
    design of multi-service tag in ICN and how to use the multi-service tag technology
    to establish the name mechanism for the video contents. This document also gives
    the typical cases which use the above name mechanism to improve the content distribution
    efficiency and cache system efficiency.</p>"
