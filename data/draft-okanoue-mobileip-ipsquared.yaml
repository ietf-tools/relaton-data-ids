abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an encapsulation method for mobile-IP which
    enables intermediate systems to initiate routing optimization process. Key mechanism
    is to concatenation IP header as an outer IP header instead of IP tunneling specified
    as protocol number 4 in [1]. This datagram is called IP2 (IP squared) datagram.
    In order to handle the datagram, it is required for every mobility supporting
    node to have two functionalities, which discriminate whether received datagram
    is IP or IP2 datagrams and decide which datagram format should be used as transmitting
    datagram IP or IP2. These functionalities enable an intermediate mobility support
    node to initiate routing optimization process in [2] and routing paths between
    mobile and conventional stationary nodes can be optimized in the result.</p>"
