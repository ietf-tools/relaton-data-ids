abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) RSVP-TE signaling
    may be used and extended to satisfy the requirements of the Automatically Switched
    Optical Network (ASON) architecture specified by the ITU-T. The requirements are
    in a companion document 'Requirements for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Usage and Extensions
    for Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).' In particular, this document
    details the mechanisms for setting up Soft Permanent Connections (SPC), the necessary
    extensions in delivering full and logical call/connection separation support,
    the extended restart capabilities during control plane failures, extended label
    usage and crankback signalling capability. The mechanisms proposed in the present
    document are applicable to any environment (including multi-area) and for any
    type of interface: packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda or fiber
    switching.</p>"
