abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new internetworking
    architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer packets within outer
    network layer headers using a non-broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface
    model. IRON suggests a third-party global deployment of servers and relays to
    achieve a Provider- Independent (PI) routing and addressing framework, but there
    may be instances in which an Internet Service Provider (ISP) wishes to manage
    its own IRON deployment. This document presents a Provider- Managed IRON framework
    that offers a fast path alternative for deployment of a long term solution.</p>"
