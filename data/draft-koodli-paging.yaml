abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports IP dormancy
    for hosts and Mobile Nodes. The concept specifies a generic model that can be
    applied to several mobility mechanisms (including Mobile IPv6, Localized Mobility
    Managament) and is independent of the layer-2 access technology and paging capabilities.
    The model allows for optimizations of the benefits of layer-2 paging when present,
    while minimizing the impact on layer-2 paging.</p>"
