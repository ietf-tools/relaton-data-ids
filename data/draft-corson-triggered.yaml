abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 2 interfaces fundamentally operate as either broadcast or point-to-point.
    From these primitives, additional layer 3 interface constructs such as non-broadcast
    multiple access and point-to- multipoint are created as necessary. This approach
    has served the wired Internet well. However this memo argues that a third type
    of layer 2 interface is necessary to seamlessly extend IP over dynamic networks,
    principally wireless. This interface, here termed a 'triggered' interface, combines
    traditional broadcast interface addressing semantics (i.e. support for unicast,
    multicast and broadcast link layer addresses) with layer 2 trigger support for
    the dynamic creation of peer-to-peer interface associations within an otherwise
    broadcast interface. Its intended domain of applicability covers cellular, WLAN,
    MANET, etc; in short all currently envisioned forms of dynamic wireless networking.</p>"
