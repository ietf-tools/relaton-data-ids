abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
    managing the Internet Security Protocol (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
    protocols and associated policies. Some of the policy-based packet filtering and
    the corresponding execution of actions is of a more general nature than for IPsec
    configuration only. This MIB module is designed with future extensibility in mind.
    It is thus possible to externally add other packet filters and actions to the
    policy-based packet filtering system defined in this document.</p>"
