abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIMPLE working group has been debating the issue of the IM session
    model for quite some time. The primary issue is what transport to use for the
    IMs once the session is established with SIP. Proposals have included the SIP
    MESSAGE request itself, IMSX, and a SIP spin-off, called IMTP. The usage of SIP
    MESSAGE, the very first proposal, had been rejected by the group because of several
    technical issues. This document revists that decision, based on the recent enhancements
    made to SIP itself. We believe that SIP MESSAGE now represents the ideal transport
    choice for the IM session model.</p>"
