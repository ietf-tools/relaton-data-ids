abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests two extensions of the recommendations for remote
    packet capture given in [RemPCAP]. The extensions concern the suggested captured
    packet encapsulation header and the configuration of packet capturing devices.
    The captured packet encapsulation header is extended by flags indicating simple
    steps of pre-processing captured packet headers. Most indicated pre-processing
    actions are merging actions of headers with common properties. For configuration
    of packet capturing devices, a configuration record is suggested.</p>"
