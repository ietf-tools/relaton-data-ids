abstract:
- content: "<p>The pseudowire switching [6] draft describes how a Pseudowire can span
    across multiple PSN domains. This multi-segment PW (MS-PW) threads through one
    or more PEs that are not the endpoints of the PW and are called switching PE (S-PE).
    The switching PE at each hop is configured a-priori with two single hops PW information
    that enables it to conduct splicing between the two. The configuration of such
    information at each S-PE for possibly thousands of MS-PWs is cumbersome. We describe
    a mechanism whereby a S-PE can identify and process the PW control signaling with
    the information present in the signaling message in a manner that eliminates the
    requirement to configure PW splicing information. In this mechanism source PE
    inserts information about the destination PE and the PW endpoint that is recognized
    by the receiving PE to identify his role as a switching PE and engage in propagating
    the PW signal towards the destination PE.</p>"
