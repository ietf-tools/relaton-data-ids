abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows User Agents to register
    for inbound requests. However, the existence of firewalls and Network Address
    Translators (NATs) prevent servers from reaching the User Agents unless the User
    Agents keep connections to the server alive. To keep such connections alive User
    Agents employ various methods, most of which require constant uptime resulting
    in high energy cost. This is especially a problem on mobile platforms that operate
    entirely on battery power. To resolve these issues many mobile manufacturers have
    provided a cost effective way of pushing messages to their devices. This specification
    defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow a User
    Agent to provide a Push Notification Configuration to its Registrar.</p>"
