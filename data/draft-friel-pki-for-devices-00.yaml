abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard Subject field identifier format for
    certificates issued to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This will allow applications
    to easily and uniquely identify certificates issued to devices as opposed to certificates
    issue to services or users. The certificates will adhere to standard Web PKI specifications
    thus ensuring interoperability with existing Certificate Authorities processes
    and workflows, and standard client and service libraries and applications.</p>"
