abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a suggested enhancement to HTTP, in which a
    user-agent and a server can use a single connection to exchange requests/responses
    for multiple requested hostnames for which the server is authorized to serve.
    This enhancement suggests that user- agents will prefer to re-use an existing
    connection if it can be used to other hosts, and presents methods for a server
    to announce hosts that are served by it, as well as a mechanism for the user-agent
    to validate that the server is indeed trusted to serve this hosts. This is highly
    relevant when the server is actually a surrogate (like in a case of a CDN server),
    or in multi-hosts hosting environments, where the same server serves multiple
    hostnames/domains and can improve performance by the reuse of established and
    already optimized connections.</p>"
