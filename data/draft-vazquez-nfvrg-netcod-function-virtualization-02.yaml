abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes network coding as a network function. It also
    describes how a network coding function can be virtualized and integrated with
    virtual network functions architectures. The network coding function is not a
    traditionally implemented network function in dedicated hardware as those that
    have triggered network function virtualization. It refers to a novel network functionality
    that generalizes classic packet-level end-to-end coding. Classic packet- level
    end-to-end coding helps in the provision of quality of service by trading off
    delay and reliability. Network coding goes beyond that by enabling in-network
    optimized re-encoding, which can provide both throughput gains and diverse network-controlled
    degrees of reliability. Consequently, a virtualized network coding function can
    serve as a flow engineering tool over virtualized networks (e.g. over network
    slices).</p>"
