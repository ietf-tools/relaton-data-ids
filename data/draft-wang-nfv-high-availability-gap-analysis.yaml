abstract:
- content: "<p>High-Availability (HA) is a very important requirement throughout the
    history of carrier network, many technologies have emerged for it. With the trend
    of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network function are migrated from dedicated
    hardware to software running over COTS servers, the same SLA of HA should be provided
    depending on network service itself. But some new challenges are brought by NFV,
    one example is Virtualized Network Function (VNF) cluster caused by the HA and
    performance limitation of individual VNF instance. For the VNF cluster, some gaps
    exist between with the available HA technologies on issues of multi-homing, state
    synchronization, share- risk prevention and HA role election, especially in the
    network which has a large scale deployment of NFV. This document firstly identifies
    the challenges emerged within NFV deployed networks. Then, available HA technologies
    are reviewed and the detailed gap analysis between them with the new challenges
    is discussed in depth. At last, the summary of these gaps is presented.</p>"
