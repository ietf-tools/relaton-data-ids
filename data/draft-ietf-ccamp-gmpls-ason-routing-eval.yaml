abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to
    control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These
    include support for requesting TDM connections including Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous
    Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document
    provides an evaluation of the IETF Routing Protocols against the routing requirements
    for an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
