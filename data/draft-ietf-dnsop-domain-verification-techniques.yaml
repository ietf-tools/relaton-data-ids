abstract:
- content: <p>Many application services on the Internet need to verify ownership or
    control of a domain in the Domain Name System (DNS). The general term for this
    process is "Domain Control Validation", and can be done using a variety of methods
    such as email, HTTP/HTTPS, or the DNS itself. This document focuses only on DNS-based
    methods, which typically involve the application service provider requesting a
    DNS record with a specific format and content to be visible in the requester's
    domain. There is wide variation in the details of these methods today. This document
    proposes some best practices to avoid known problems.</p>
