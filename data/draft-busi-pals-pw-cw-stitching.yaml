abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the behavior of a new type of Multi-Segment Pseudowire
    (MS-PW) Switching PE (S-PE) which enhances the S-PE functions defined in [RFC
    6073], with the capability to switch an Ethernet pseudowire (PW) segment that
    uses the PW Control Word (CW) [RFC 4385] with an Ethernet PW segment that does
    not use the CW. This new type of S-PE can be deployed in the network one hop away,
    at the MPLS layer, from a Terminating PE (T-PE) which does not support CW for
    Ethernet PW encapsulation [RFC 4448]. In this way, all the Ethernet PW packets
    sent though the MPLS network will have the CW and be protected against incorrect
    equal-cost-multi-path (ECMP) behavior as described in [I-D ETH-CW].</p>"
