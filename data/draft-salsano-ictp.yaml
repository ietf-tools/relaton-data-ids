abstract:
- content: <p>Let us consider an Information Centric Networking (ICN) solution, in
    which an End Node requests for a content sending "content requests" (or "interest
    packets"). The content is provided back to the requestor by the "origin" node
    or by an intermediate node that had cached the content. The content is usually
    divided into "chunks" that can be individually requested, sent back to the requester,
    cached into intermediate nodes. The sending rate of content requests can be adjusted
    in order to perform congestion control, implementing a receiver driven transport
    protocol. As it can be useful to have large chunks (significantly larger than
    the Maximum Tranfer Unit across the network), the transport protocol should also
    be used to further segment the chunks rather than relying to IP fragmentation.
    In this memo we define ICTP (Information Centric Transport Protocol), a receiver
    driven transport protocol for ICN, which relies on the CONET ICN solution described
    in a companion draft.</p>
