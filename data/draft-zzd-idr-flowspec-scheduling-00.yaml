abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flow Specification allows conveying flow specifications and traffic
    Action/Rules associated to perform different actions based on the traffic features.
    One of the applications is to steer one specific flow into its specific path.
    However, in some scenarios, the traffic forwarding paths are not constant and
    change over time. This document extends BGP Flow Specification with scheduling
    time information to identify the packets arrived at different time slot. Based
    on that, the headend can perform different actions at different time for the same
    traffic.</p>"
