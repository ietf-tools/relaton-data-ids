abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses privacy properties of the SCONEPRO metadata
    or network-to-host signals. This covers questions that were raised during the
    IETF 119 BoF and subsequent discussions. It is not intended to be published as
    a separate RFC but might be incorporated as a part of the security considerations
    or other content within eventual SCONEPRO RFCs together with other documents covering
    security considerations. Other documents will address additional aspects of the
    security considerations for SCONEPRO metadata.</p>"
