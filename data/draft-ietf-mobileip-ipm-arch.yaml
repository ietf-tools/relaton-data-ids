abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, the wireless network arena is made up of different types of
    access (TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc) and core network technologies (IS-41 and MAP over
    SS7, etc). The heterogeneous nature of today's wireless and wireline packet data
    networks limits the scope of mobility between these heterogeneous networks. However,
    as these heterogeneous networks evolve, the mobility management provided by them
    must evolve to insure seamless roaming between the networks. With the convergence
    of voice and data, networks of the future will be built on IP packet switched
    technology, mostly due to inherent advantages offered by the technology. This
    document identifies several drivers that provide input for an IP Mobility based
    network and also describes a high level IP Mobility architecture that extends
    the current third generation IMT2000 wireless architecture and builds on Mobile
    IP concepts.</p>"
