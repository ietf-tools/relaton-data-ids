- content: "<p>This document serves as a framework for the creation of standards in
    the IP based storage working group of the IETF. The environment surrounding IP
    based storage is explained and an overview of the applicable standards and protocols
    is provided. References to current and expected IP based storage standards in
    this area are provided. This document provides a background for participants who
    are experienced in either the storage industry or the networking industry but
    needs to understand the applicable standards and conventions used in the other
    respective industry</p>"
