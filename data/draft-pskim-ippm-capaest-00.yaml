abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, a mechanism for available capacity estimation of an
    end-to-end path is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy compared with the
    existing IGI(Initial Gap Increasing)/PTR(Packet Transmission Rate) mechanism.
    The proposed mechanism defines three cases of the difference between the average
    output gap and the input gap, and then reflects fully them, while the existing
    mechanism reflected only two cases. Since three cases are handled respectively
    by appropriate corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can be expected to
    reduce the detection error for the turning point. Therefore, the end-to-end available
    capacity can be estimated more accurate than the existing mechanism.</p>"
