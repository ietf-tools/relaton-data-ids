- content: "<p>This document presents a high-level technical description of the xvc
    video codec. The xvc video codec is a novel video codec that was released in its
    first version in September 2017. This document provides some technical information
    as well as a discussion section around how the xvc codec meets the objectives
    of the NETVC Working Group. The document also includes results comparing the second
    version of xvc with AV1 and HM for three different test cases; All- Intra, single
    pass Random-Access, and multi-pass Random-Access. Results are also presented for
    the full xvc codec relative to the royalty-free baseline profile of xvc.</p>"
