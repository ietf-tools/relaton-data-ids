abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks require communication between an interior and exterior
    portion of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or through a concatenation of such
    networks resulting in a nested VPN, but have sensitivities about what information
    is communicated across the boundary, especially while providing quality of service
    to communications with different precedence. This note seeks to outline the issues
    and the nature of the proposed solutions based on the framework for Integrated
    Services operation over Diffserv networks as described in RFC 2998. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
