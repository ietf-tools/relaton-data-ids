abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Alternative Services has become the primary mechanism for HTTP/3
    upgrade, but overlaps with and disagrees with other developing standards, such
    as the HTTPS resource record in DNS. This document explores a set of potential
    fixes and/or additional features for Alt- Svc. It is used to record and share
    thoughts, and is not expected to progress on its own.</p>"
