abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) policy-based management
    framework defines base YANG data models to encode policy. These models point to
    device-, technology-, and service-specific YANG data models developed elsewhere.
    Policy rules within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level,
    possibly network-wide, policies to a network management function (within a controller,
    an orchestrator, or a network element). The network management function can then
    control the configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services.
    This document describes the SUPA basic framework, its elements, and interfaces.</p>"
