abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 clients to
    provide additional certificate-based credentials after the TLS handshake has completed,
    using TLS Exported Authenticators. Unlike traditional client authentication during
    the TLS handshake, this mechanism allows clients to present multiple certificates
    over the lifetime of a session.</p>"
