abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents edge-assisted marked flow termination (EMFT)
    for PCN. It assumes packet-size independent excess marking, i.e. packets exceeding
    the supportable rate (SR) of a link are marked as "excess-traffic" (ET). EMFT
    terminates only flows with at least one ET-marked packet. The problem is to avoid
    that all flows with ET- marked packets are terminated. This draft proposes two
    solutions. Flow-based EMFT (F-EMFT) considers single flows separately and terminates
    them when sufficiently many packets of them have been received by the PCN egress
    node with an ET-mark. Aggregate-based EMFT (A-EMFT) considers ingress-egress-aggregates
    and terminates flows thereof sufficiently many ET-marked packets have been received
    for that aggregate.</p>
