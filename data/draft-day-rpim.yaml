abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an alternative approach to defining the requirements
    for a presence information protocol. It may be usefully compared and contrasted
    with ''Presence Information Protocol Requirements'' by Lisa Dusseault, draft-dusseault-pipr-00.txt.
    Although worthy in many respects, that document includes numerous desiderata,
    design considerations, and implementation concerns. This document attempts to
    define only requirements, and a minimal set of requirements at that. In addition,
    this document treats ''presence'' and ''instant messaging'' as distinct entities
    for the purpose of defining requirements. We leave open the possibility of a single
    protocol fulfilling both sets of requirements, without requiring it.</p>"
