abstract:
- content: "<p>The session initiation protocol (SIP) [2] allows users' end systems
    to decline calls for many reasons. 6xx response codes communicate global failures
    generated by callee's end system. It defines 6xx class response codes in the spirit
    of parallel forking scenarios only. There're scenarios where, authoritative server
    performs parallel forking of the call to callee's own set of endpoints, and then
    serially move on to fork call to alternate set of endpoints (callee's voice mail
    and/or team call). This draft clarifies behavior for existing 603 response code
    and proposes new 605 response code to handle complete rejection of the call, which
    halts any further processing of the call.</p>"
