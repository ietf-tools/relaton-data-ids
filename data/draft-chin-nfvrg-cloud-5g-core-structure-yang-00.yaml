abstract:
- content: "<p>In 5G core network, all network functions are componentized, virtualized
    and grouped into VNF. Network management system will manage the functions based
    on VNF. This document presents YANG model proposal on overall structure of cloud
    native 5G core network. The structure is itself represented as an example YANG
    model, with all of the related component models logically organized in a way that
    is operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented.
    The identified component modules are expected to be defined and implemented.</p>"
