- content: "<p>This note describes how Source Address Validation might be applied
    in an IPv6 environment. Local systems should be able to ensure that their peers
    are using the IPv6 source addresses that the routing system uses to deliver data
    to them. Remote systems should be able to ensure that traffic they forward has
    reasonable source addresses.</p>"
