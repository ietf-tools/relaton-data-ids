abstract:
- content: "<p>Tapping technologies provide traffic visibility to network analysis
    tools such as monitors, traffic recorders and security systems. Current tapping
    architectures and protocols are vendor specific and adapted to legacy networks.
    Emerging networking such as large scale datacenters for cloud applications and
    Mobile backhaul networks demand accurate and fast network traffic visibility.
    These networks are built on Layer 2 technologies and infrastructure to support
    virtual machines mobility, growing number of devices including mobile users. SmarTap
    architecture is designed to support emerging network requirements allowing network
    analysis tools to gain full visibility of network traffic. SmarTap technology
    monitors each link and each component of the network. It captures packets, classifies
    them and sends them to tools with relevant packet attributes. SmarTap can provide
    attributes such as flow-ID, tapping-location, tapping-time and statistics.</p>"
