abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper defines the changes as would be required for the Domain
    Name System (DNS) to support the Network(s) IP Addresses assigned and listed using
    the Globalnet's Backbone, which are defined by the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol
    Family Specification. Furthermore, notwithstanding the requirements necessitated
    by change, this presentation retains the current Communications Protocol Specifications,
    which are currently used for the DNS Query in the IPv4 Specification. And while
    the DNS Service for the IPt1 Specification is identical to the IPv4 Specification.
    However, because the other IP Addressing Protocols define within the IPtX Protocol
    Specification requires the use of Prefixes, which change the Header Size Specification.
    The implementation of these IP Addressing Systems, while using the same Communications
    Protocol Specifications, nevertheless, redefines the Structure for the Naming
    Convention used in the DNS Hierarchy. Even still, asides from the clarity, referencing
    the RFC's governing the DNS Service Specifications will be somewhat limited. This
    is because the overall functions, and their respective Definitions for the IPv4
    DNS Specification will not change in the IPtX DNS Specification. Hence, the objective
    this paper specifically maintains concerns only the presentation of the Subject-Matter
    relating to the change in the DNS Service(s), resulting from the implementation
    of the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Specification. In other words, the paper does
    not represent a replacement for any of RFCs,which implemented the DNS Services.
    It should nonetheless, be considered an extension, which focuses upon the changes
    in the DNS Services resulting from the implementation of the IPtX IP Protocol
    Specification.</p>"
