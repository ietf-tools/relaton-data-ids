abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mapping of IETF Integrated Services[3] over
    Diff-Serv Networks built from network elements having diff-serv defined Per Hop
    Behaviours (PHBs)[11]. In many ways, this document should look like an ISSLL document
    assuming that a differentiated service network looks like an instance of _media_
    within a integrated services network. It describes parameter mappings for supporting
    Controlled Load [6] and Guaranteed Service [7] using the capabilities of diff-serv
    networks in routers and switches. These mappings fit within an overall Framework
    for Integrated and Differentiated Services[to be submitted].</p>"
