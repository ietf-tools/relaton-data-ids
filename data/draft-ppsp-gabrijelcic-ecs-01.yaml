abstract:
- content: "<p>The Enhanced Closed Swarm (ECS) protocol is a distributed access control
    mechanism suitable for usage in Peer-to-Peer content delivery systems. The protocol
    provides coarse or fine grained authorization of peers participating in content
    distribution. As a result, only authorized peers are allowed to communicate in
    a swarm. The protocol also provides data confidentiality, integrity and origin
    authentication for application data exchanged among peers. The protocol is simple
    but flexible enough to enable a range of usage scenarios. In addition to the ECS
    protocol, this document also describes its application in the IETF PPSPP.</p>"
