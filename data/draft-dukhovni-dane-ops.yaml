- content: "<p>This memo provides operational guidance to server operators to help
    ensure that clients will be able to authenticate a server's certificate chain
    via published TLSA records. Guidance is also provided to clients for selecting
    reliable TLSA record parameters to use for server authentication. Finally, guidance
    is given to protocol designers who wish to make use of TLSA records to secure
    protocols using a TLS and TLSA combination.</p>"
