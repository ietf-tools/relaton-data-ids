abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for the GMPLS control plane. It
    studies the GMPLS control plane from three different perspectives: functional
    partitioning, computational layering and network partitioning. First, it studies
    the functional building blocks of a generic GMPLS control plane and illustrates
    that, in order to be generalized for different technologies and their specific
    application environment, what each functional component could assume, what it
    'should' (instead of 'how') accomplish, what are the generic procedures and possible
    options.</p>"
