abstract:
- content: "<p>Many proposals have been presented for preventing IP spoofing from
    occurring in network. An outstanding of them is the SAVI (Source Address Validation
    Improvement) proposal which was advocated by IETF SAVI workgroup for solving this
    problem from user access switch. SAVI Working Group is developing standardize
    mechanisms that prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each
    other's IP addresses, and achieve IP source address validation at a finer granularity.
    However, up to now, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has focused on
    the scenarios of 4over6 transition, that is, IPv4 packets transit IPv6 network
    and arrive at other edge IPv4 network(s). With the boom of IPv6 networks, this
    issue becomes more and more urgent. In addition, since 4over6 plans are plenty
    and various, one solution cannot meet all requirements of these plans. This document
    describes a framework of IP source address validation and traceback for 4over6
    transition scenarios, which extract out the essential and mutual properties from
    these plans and form corresponding sub-solution for each property. When one 4over6
    plan is combined by some of them, the solution of IP source address validation
    and traceback for this plan are directly comprised of the combination of corresponding
    sub- solution. Thus, the most exciting advantage of this framework is that it
    is a once for all solution no matter how 4over6 plans changes.</p>"
