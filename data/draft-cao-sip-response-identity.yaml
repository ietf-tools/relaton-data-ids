abstract:
- content: "<p>The mechanism for securely providing responder's identity in response
    message is missing in the current Session Initiation Protocol. Due to different
    call scenarios, the exact response identity is hard to guess through the existing
    response message. This draft describes some extensions for providing SIP response
    identity and two security mechanisms for verifying the integrity of response identity.
    It does so by defining new header fields as well as one new response code. Furthermore,
    the issue of how to require the presence of response identity in one SIP dialog
    is also discussed with one solution.</p>"
