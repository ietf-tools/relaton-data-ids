abstract:
- content: "<p>Metering is typically performed at the edge of a Diffserv-aware network
    where customer traffic is checked for conformance or else where networks interconnect
    using shaping/policing as a practical matter in IP networks. This document describes
    the importance of the consistent metering in Diffserv traffic conditioning. This
    document also proposes the concepts and the associated details to be adapted by
    Diffserv informal model [DIFFSERV-MODEL] to achieve the desired consistency.</p>"
