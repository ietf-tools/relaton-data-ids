abstract:
- content: <p>The Multipart/Report MIME content-type is a general "family" or "container"
    type for electronic mail reports of any kind. Although this memo defines only
    the use of the Multipart/Report content-type with respect to delivery status reports,
    mail processing programs will benefit if a single content-type is used to for
    all kinds of reports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
