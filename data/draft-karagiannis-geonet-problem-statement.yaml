abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need of intertwining of IP networking with
    geographical addressing. As used today, IP routing and addressing are completely
    unaware of geographic parameters such as coordinates or postal addresses. Possible
    applications of future Internet-wide geo-networking mechanisms include, but are
    not limited to, dissemination of IP packets to geographical areas, or precise
    tracking of package positions during a shipping process, with more use-cases under
    discussion.</p>"
