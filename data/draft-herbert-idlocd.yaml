abstract:
- content: "<p>Identifier-locator protocols rely on a mapping system that is able
    to map identifiers to locators. Such a mapping system is a type of key/value store.
    This draft proposes a design and implementation for an Identifier-Locator control
    daemon (idlocd). The intent is to provide an open source implementation that would
    be a basis for experimentation, development, and eventual deployment of identifier-
    locator solutions at large scale.</p>"
