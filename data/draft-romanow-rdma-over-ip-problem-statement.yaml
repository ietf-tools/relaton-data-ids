abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses an IP-based solution to the problem of high system
    costs due to network I/O copying in end-hosts at high speeds. The problem is due
    to the high cost of memory bandwidth, and it can be substantially improved using
    'copy avoidance.' The high overhead has prevented TCP/IP from being used as an
    interconnection network.</p>"
