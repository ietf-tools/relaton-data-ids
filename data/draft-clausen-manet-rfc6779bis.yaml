abstract:
- content: "<p>This document revises, extends, and replaces RFC 6779. It defines a
    portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
    protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes objects for configuring
    parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) process on a router.
    The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports state,
    performance information, and notifications about NHDP. This additional state and
    performance information is useful to troubleshoot problems and performance issues
    during neighbor discovery.</p>"
