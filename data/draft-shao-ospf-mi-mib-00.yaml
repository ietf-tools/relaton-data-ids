abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSPF MIB defined by the IETF (RFC 1850) was designed to work with
    only one OSPF process/instance on a given router. It currently doesn't offer a
    mechanism to access ospf mib obejects of different instances. For example, there
    is only a single ospfRouterId object, not a table of them. In order to handle
    multiple instances, RFC 4750 suggests that you use SNMPv3 contexts to provide
    per-instance views. This document introduces a way for OSPF MIB to support multiple
    instance, no mater in SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 contexts, by adding the object ospfProcId
    into every OSPF MIB group. According to the specified ospfProcId, other obejects
    in this OSPF instance can be accessed.</p>"
