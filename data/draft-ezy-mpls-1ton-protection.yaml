abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS-TP) there is a requirement to support 1:n linear protection for transport
    paths. This requirement is elaborated on in the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework
    document [SurvivFwk]. The basic protocol for linear protection was specified in
    the MPLS-TP Linear Protection document [LinProt] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1
    protection. This document extends the protocol defined there to address the additional
    functionality necessary to support scenarios of a single protection path preconfigured
    to provide protection of multiple transport paths between two joint endpoints.
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) /
    International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
