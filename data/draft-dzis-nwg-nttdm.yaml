abstract:
- content: "<p>Handling multiple sets of network trouble tickets (TTs) originating
    from different participants' inter-connected network environments poses a series
    of challenges for the involved institutions. A Grid is a good example of such
    a multi-domain project. Each of the participants follows different procedures
    for handling trouble in its domain, according to the local technical and linguistic
    profile. The TT systems of the participants collect, represent, and disseminate
    TT information in different formats. As a result, management of the daily workload
    by a central Network Operation Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own. Normalization
    of TTs to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation, storing, and
    handling of the TTs. In the present document, we provide a model for automating
    the collection and normalization of the TT received by multiple networks forming
    the Grid. Each of the participants is using its home TT system within its domain
    for handling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering the tickets
    in the normalized format for repository and handling. XML is used as the common
    representation language. The model was defined and used as part of the networking
    support activity of the EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) project. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
