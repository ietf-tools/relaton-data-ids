abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents some problems forseen in transitioning from a IPv4-only
    DNS hierarchy via a long period of mixture to an IPv6-mostly situation sometime
    in the future. The mixture period is expected to be very long, and hence design
    choices should very much take this into account, rather than just regard the transition
    as a relatively short period of pain.</p>"
