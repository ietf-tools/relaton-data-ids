abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains additions to the R. Perlman's draft Understanding
    IKEv2: Tutorial, and rationale for decisions. Its purpose is to request for comments
    and to incorporate it into draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01. This document describes
    some of controversial issues discussed on the IPsec mailing list and described
    in various IETF documents that were written after the publication of draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01.
    Its additional purpose is to explain some of IKEv2 protocol parts that were not
    described in draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01. It follows the original R. Perlman
    draft's concept to be both a tutorial for understanding IKEv2 and a summary of
    IKEv2 issues.</p>"
