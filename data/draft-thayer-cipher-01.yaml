abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need in the Internet community for an encryption algorithm
    that provides interoperable operation with existing deployed commercial cryptographic
    applications. This interoperability will allow for a smoother transition to protocols
    that have been developed through the IETF standards process. This document describes
    an existing algorithm that satisifies this requirement.</p>"
