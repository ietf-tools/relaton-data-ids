abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) is a protocol framework
    designed to provide reliable multicast data and file delivery ser- vices on top
    of the generic UDP/IP multicast transport [1]. MDP is well suited for reliable
    multicast bulk transfer of data across a heterogeneous internetwork. Further enhancements
    made to the pro- tocol are suitable for a range of network environments, including
    wireless internetwork environments. At its core, MDP is an effi- cient negative
    acknowledgement (NACK) based reliable multicast pro- tocol that leverages erasure-based
    coding in ways to improve pro- tocol efficiency and robustness. MDP also includes
    an optional adaptive end-to-end rate-based congestion control mode that is to
    operate with competing flows (e.g., TCP sessions or other conges- tion aware flows).
    This document describes the protocol messages, building blocks, general operation,
    and optional modes of the pre- sent MDP instantiation and implementation.</p>"
