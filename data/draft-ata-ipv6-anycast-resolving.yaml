abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the route of packets to the same anycast adddress may change
    according to the network/node condition, it is not suitable to use anycast addresses
    directry for stateful communications (such as TCP). The more preferable use of
    the anycast addresses is to discover (the unicast address of) service node. The
    approach intended to describe in this document is to resolve (i.e., obtain) the
    corresponding unicast address for the anycast address prior to establishing the
    communication. We call this process as Anycast Address Resolving (AARP). The objevtive
    of the AARP is to enable the use of anycast addresses to all existing applications
    without any modifications.</p>"
