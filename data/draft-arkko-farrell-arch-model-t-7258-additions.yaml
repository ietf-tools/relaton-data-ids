abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. RFC 7258 is the IETF guidance on taking
    into account pervasive monitoring threats in Internet technology development work.
    This memo suggests additions to RFC 7258 to cater for the evolving threats. For
    instance, it may be necessary to also worry about information collected by a legitimate
    protocol participant being misused for pervasive monitoring purposes.</p>"
