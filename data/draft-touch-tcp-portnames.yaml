abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new TCP option that specifies services by
    a string name. This option separates the use of port numbers for connection demultiplexing
    from their use as a service identifier. The option allows a larger number of concurrent
    connections for a particular service, as well as potentially enabling more explicitly
    coordination of services behind NATs and firewalls. This option should be supported
    in new TCP implementations.</p>"
