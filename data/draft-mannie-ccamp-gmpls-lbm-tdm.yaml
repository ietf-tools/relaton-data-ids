abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) can be used to dynamically
    modify the bandwidth of a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) Label Switched Path
    (LSP). It focuses first on Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET)/Synchronous Digital
    Hierarchy (SDH) and intends to cover other switching technologies in a further
    release. This document also defines how to use multiple differently routed LSPs
    to build a single SONET/SDH virtually concatenated circuit where each component
    LSP can be subsequently recovered (i.e. protected or restored) individually.</p>"
