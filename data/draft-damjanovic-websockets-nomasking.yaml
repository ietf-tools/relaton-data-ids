abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebSocket protocol specifies that all frames sent from the client
    to the server must be masked. This was introduced as a protection against a possible
    attack on the infrastructure. With careful consideration, the masking could be
    omitted when intermediaries do not have access to the unencrypted traffic. This
    specification introduces a WebSocket extension that disables the mandatory masking
    of frames sent from the client to the server. The extension is allowed only under
    special circumstances where masking is known to be unnecessary.</p>"
