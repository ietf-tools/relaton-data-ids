abstract:
- content: "<p>The expansion of the IP address space provided by IPv6 makes it both
    possible and reasonable to allocate entire subnets to environments that had been
    previously limited to a few individual IP addresses. Other protocols such as Neighbor
    Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration allow hosts within those subnets
    to be automatically configured. The router between this subnet and the upstream
    world requires just one more piece to make this process automatic, a network prefix.
    This document describes a mechanism for the automated delegation of an IPv6 network
    prefix. It allows routers to request either a specific prefix or any prefix. Upon
    authorizing the request the delegating router then returns a prefix and a lifetime
    for the use of the prefix. Optionally, the delegating and requesting routers can
    exchange routing protocol information.</p>"
