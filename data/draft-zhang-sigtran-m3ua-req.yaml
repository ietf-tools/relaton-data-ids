abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7
    MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services
    of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. M3UA is designed for SEP-(TDM)-SG-(IP)-IPSEP
    and IPSEP-(IP)-IPSEP applications, so the network level management function isn't
    required. SSNM(SS7 Signalling Network Management) messages defined in M3UA are
    only used for interworking with SS7. RFC 4666 doesn't define IPSEP- IPSTP-IPSEP
    application of M3UA. The signalling network management function for this application
    needs to be extended. Some parts of the specification are unclear,which may lead
    to misinterpretations and may weaken interoperability. This document provides
    extensions and clarifications to RFC 4666.</p>"
