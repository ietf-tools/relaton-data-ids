abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address
    Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier Grade NAT
    (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT). CGN is a concept also described in [I-D.ietf-behave-lsn-requirements]
    and describes the model as a dual layer translation model. Although operators
    may wish to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near term needs
    may not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone. This document provides a practical
    integration model which allows CGN to be integrated into the network meeting the
    connectivity needs of the customer while being mindful of not disrupting existing
    services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings. The model includes
    the use of BGP/MPLS IP VPNs defined in [RFC4364] as a tool to achieve this goal.
    This document does not intend to defend the merits of CGN.</p>"
