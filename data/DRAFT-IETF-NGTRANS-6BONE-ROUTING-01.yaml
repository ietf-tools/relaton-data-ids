abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This memo identifies guidelines on how 6Bone sites might operate,
    so that the 6Bone can remain a quality experimentation environment and to avoid
    pathological situations that have been encountered in the past.  It defines the
    'best current practice' acceptable in the 6Bone for the configuration of both
    Interior Gateway Protocols and Exterior Gateway Protocols.  This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.\n\t </p>\n      "
