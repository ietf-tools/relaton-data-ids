abstract:
- content: "<p>Shared secrets are common in IETF protocols. Setting these shared secrets
    is typically defined as out of scope of those protocols. The upshot of this approach
    is poor security practices in setting these secrets and, through the life of the
    implementation, changing these secrets. The Shared Secret Provisioning Protocol
    (SSPP) provides a mechanism for both setting and changing shared secrets that
    are provably strong.</p>"
