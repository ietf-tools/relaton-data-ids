abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP signaling can be used to make end-to-end resource reservations
    in an IP network in order to guarantee the QoS required by certain flows. With
    RSVP, both the data sender and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling.
    Yet, there are many use cases where resource reservation is required, but the
    receiver, the sender, or both, is not RSVP-capable. This document defines RSVP
    Proxy behaviors allowing RSVP routers to perform RSVP signaling on behalf of a
    receiver or a sender that is not RSVP-capable. This allows resource reservations
    to be established on parts of the end-to-end path.</p>"
