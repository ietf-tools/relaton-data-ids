abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies a set of requirements for the mechanisms used
    to dynamically reallocate the resources of a partitionable network element (NE).
    These requirements are particularly critical in the case of an operator creating
    a virtual NE (by partitioning a physical NE) and then leasing control of that
    virtual NE to a third party.</p>"
