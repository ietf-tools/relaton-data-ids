abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for user-centric Quality of Service
    (QoS) management in heterogeneous Internet environments (considering fixed, mobile
    and broadcast networks). The framework is based on dynamic business level QoS
    policy specification by different actors (such as users, operators and administrators),
    as well as hierarchical policy refinement and translation, supporting the automated
    configuration of QoS mechanisms at heterogeneous network and transport entities.
    The hierarchical policy approach involves abstractions and mapping of policies
    described at business, unified, operational and configuration level considering
    networks with different capabilities and QoS requirements of different actors.
    The policy specification is dependent on the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of
    the particular actors. This allows controlled and restricted usage of the network
    resources by the actors according to the actor dependencies and corresponding
    SLA rules. The policy management framework includes components for dynamic actor-based
    QoS policy specification, policy consistency check and dependency analysis regarding
    SLAs, automated policy provisioning and configuration at heterogeneous transport
    and network entities, policy monitoring and performance assessment, as well as
    automated adaptation of QoS mechanisms at operational level. Policy enforcement
    combined with policy monitoring and performance assessment is considered, as well
    as automated adaptation of policy parameters (e.g. operational policies) based
    on policy performance analysis. Interactions of components for policy specification
    and automated provisioning are based on policy repository storing the unified
    (intermediate) policy representations describing policy parameters, conditions
    and actions.</p>"
