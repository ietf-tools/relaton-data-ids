abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between
    SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS [RFC3207], DANE [RFC6698], and SMTP
    MTA STS (TODO: Add ref). These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or active
    attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated
    channels. This document describes a reporting mechanism and format by which sending
    systems can share statistics and specific information about potential failures
    with recipient domains. Recipient domains can then use this information to both
    detect potential attackers and diagnose unintentional misconfigurations.</p>"
