abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used
    in Internet protocol design. More than sixteen years have passed since RFC3552
    was written and the structure and topology of the Internet has changed. With those
    changes comes a question: has the Internet Threat Model really changed? Or, is
    the model described in RFC3552 still largely accurate? This draft attempts to
    describe an non-exhaustive list of changes in the current threat environment.
    It suggests that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences from
    the environment described in RFC3552 and is intended as input to the IAB program
    on the Internet threat model started in 2020.</p>"
