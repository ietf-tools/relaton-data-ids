abstract:
- content: "<p>The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist in typical
    networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in popular Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) products, may inadvertently result in VPN traffic leaks. That is,
    traffic meant to be transferred over a VPN connection may leak out of such connection
    and be transferred in the clear on the local network. This document discusses
    some scenarios in which such VPN leakages may occur, either as a side effect of
    enabling IPv6 on a local network, or as a result of a deliberate attack from a
    local attacker. Additionally, it discusses possible mitigations for the aforementioned
    issue.</p>"
