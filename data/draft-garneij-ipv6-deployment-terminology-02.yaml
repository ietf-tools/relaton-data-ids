abstract:
- content: "<p>When discussing deployment matters related to IPv6, a first hurdle
    which is encountered is the lack of common terminology or at least basic terms
    used in various fora. As a contribution in this area, this document identifies
    and proposes a set of terms and their definitions.</p>"
