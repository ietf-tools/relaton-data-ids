abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network File System v4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to cache directory
    entries (dirents) for files. By caching dirents, the client avoids querying the
    server to refresh information. One issue with this caching is that under Access
    Based Enumeration, the client can not determine if the user has permission to
    view the dirent's attributes. We introduce a new file attribute called uncacheable
    which indicates that the client MUST NOT cache the attributes for that dirent.
    This document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7863).</p>"
