abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment for the IETF
    RFC publication process. The experiment is limited in scope and duration. The
    specific experiment has been chosen because (a) it has potential to provide a
    significant process improvement, (b) it can be executed at a low cost, (c) it
    addresses a widely recognized problem in the IETF process, and (d) tool support
    can be (and has been) built for it. The experiment relates to the copyediting
    and other manual tasks in the publication process. Specifically, the amount of
    work these manual tasks require differs widely between drafts, and for a certain
    subset of drafts there are either very minor editorial changes or no changes needed
    at all, if we discount the different formatting requirements between RFCs and
    drafts. The experiment involves identification of this subset of drafts and processing
    them separately with a "fast path" process that uses almost entirely automated
    processes. For the drafts that belong to this subset, it is expected that the
    RFC Editor queuing time is reduced from months or years to weeks or less.</p>
