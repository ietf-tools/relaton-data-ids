abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet technical specifications often need to define a format syntax
    and are free to employ whatever notation their authors deem useful. Over the years,
    a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has
    been popular among many Internet specifications. It balances compactness and simplicity,
    with reasonable representational power. In the early days of the Arpanet, each
    specification contained its own definition of ABNF. This included the email specifications,
    RFC733 and then RFC822 which have come to be the common citations for defining
    ABNF. The current document separates out that definition, to permit selective
    reference. Predictably, it also provides some modifications and enhancements.
    The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition,
    alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. Appendix A (Core) supplies
    rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to
    several Internet specifications. It is provided as a convenience and is otherwise
    separate from the meta language defined in the body of this document, and separate
    from its formal status.</p>"
