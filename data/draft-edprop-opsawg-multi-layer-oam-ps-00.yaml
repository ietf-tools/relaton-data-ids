abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms are critical
    building blocks in network operations. They used for service fulfillment assurance,
    and for service diagnosis, troubleshooting, and repair. The current practice is
    that many technologies rely on their own OAM protocols and procedures that are
    exclusive to a given layer. At present, there is little consolidation of OAM in
    the management plane or well-documented inter-layer OAM operation. Vendors and
    operators dedicate significant resources and effort through the whole OAM life-cycle
    each time a new technology is introduced. This is exacerbated when dealing with
    integration of OAM into overlay networks, which require better OAM visibility
    since there is no method to exchange OAM information between overlay and underlay.
    This document analyzes the problem space for multi-layer OAM in the management
    plane with a focus on layer and technology independent OAM management considerations.
    It concludes that an attempt to define an architecture for consolidated management
    should be undertaken, and if this attempt satisfies key objectives, a gap analysis
    and a program of standardization should follow.</p>"
