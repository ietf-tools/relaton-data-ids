abstract:
- content: "<p>As an extension to the address allocation process for DSTM, this document
    defines the ports option for DSTM. A DSTM server may also provide a range of port
    numbers to be used by the client. This would allow the use of the same IPv4 address
    by several DSTM nodes at the same time, reducing the size of the required IPv4
    address pool.</p>"
