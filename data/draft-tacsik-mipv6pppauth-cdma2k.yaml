abstract:
- content: "<p>Network access authentication is performed via various protocols. It
    is in most cases a function of the link layer protocol. Packet data network access
    authentication in cdma2000 networks is currently performed either by PPP or using
    Mobile IPv4). Support for Mobile IPv6 is planned for Revision D of 'cdma2000 Wireless
    IP Network Standard [1]. This document proposes that the access authentication
    for Mobile IPv6 service in cdma2000 networks be performed using PPP.</p>"
