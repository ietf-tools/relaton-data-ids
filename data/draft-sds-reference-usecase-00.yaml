abstract:
- content: "<p>In IoT, IoE era, the cloud needs to accommodate enormous requests,
    and also the cloud has to provide unlimited scalability, real-time analysis, and
    workload integration. Thus, inter-cloud storages integration is required and a
    standard for complete integration between cloud and legacy system is compulsory.
    Physical host and storage integration from the perspective of bare metal provisioning
    are also under the spotlight. The SDS is a proper technique to fulfil this issue.
    According to the increasing demand for software defined storage, it is required
    to develop software defined storage reference model.</p>"
