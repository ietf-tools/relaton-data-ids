abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) enables
    communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two
    PCEs. RFC 5440 defines the Include Route Object (IRO) to specify network elements
    to be traversed in the computed path. The specification does not specify if the
    IRO contains an ordered or unordered list of subobjects. During recent discussions,
    it was determined that there was a need to define a standard representation to
    ensure interoperability. It was also noted that there is a benefit in the handling
    of an attribute of the IRO's subobject, the L bit. This document updates RFC 5440
    regarding the IRO specification.</p>"
