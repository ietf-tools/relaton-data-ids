abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this document is to define an interface through which an
    Autonomous System (AS) can disseminate information about forwarding of packets
    to the next hop outside the AS, to devices within its network. This information
    can be used to make path aware routing decisions, either by being aware of the
    default route packets will take when traversing the AS, or by using other mechanisms
    to control the path packets which is out of the scope of this document.</p>"
