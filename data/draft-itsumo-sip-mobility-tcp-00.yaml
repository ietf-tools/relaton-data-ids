abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an approach for using SIP to support mobility
    for TCP-based applications in a mobile Internet. The proposed approach utilizes
    a TCP tracking agent, dubbed as SIP_EYE, in mobile stations as well as SIP INFO
    method to spoof constant endpoints for mobile TCP connections and supports mobile
    TCP applications in a SIP environment without any changes to TCP.</p>"
