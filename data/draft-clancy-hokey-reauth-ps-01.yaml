abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) problem statement.
    The current EAP keying framework is not designed to support re-authentication
    and handovers. This often cause unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless
    environments. HOKEY plans to address these HOKEY plans to address these problems
    by implementing a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for hand-off.</p>"
