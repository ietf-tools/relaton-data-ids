abstract:
- content: <p>The SHREQ specification describes how the JSON Web Signature (JWS) specification
    combined with the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), can be utilized to support
    HTTP based applications needing digitally signed requests. SHREQ is specifically
    tailored for Web applications using JSON as data interchange format. However,
    there is also a SHREQ scheme for HTTP requests that do not have a body ("payload")
    like GET. SHREQ was designed to be agnostic with respect to REST concepts versus
    traditional GET/POST schemes. The intended audiences of this document are Web
    tool vendors, as well as designers of secure Web applications.</p>
