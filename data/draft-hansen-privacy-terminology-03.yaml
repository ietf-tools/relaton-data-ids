abstract:
- content: '<p>Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout the
    last few millennia by all manner of people. Its most striking feature is that
    nobody seems able to agree upon a precise definition of what it actually is. In
    order to discuss privacy in any meaningful way a tightly defined context needs
    to be elucidated. The specific context of privacy used within this document is
    that of "personal data", information about an individual stored and/or transmitted
    electronically in Internet protocols. This context is highly relevant since a
    lot of work within the IETF involves defining protocols that can potentially transport
    (either explicitly or implicitly) personal data. This document aims to establish
    a basic lexicon around privacy so that IETF contributors who wish to discuss privacy
    considerations within their work can do so using terminology consistent across
    the area. Note: This document is discussed at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ietf-privacy</p>'
