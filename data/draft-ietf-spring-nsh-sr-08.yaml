abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the integration of Network Service Header (NSH)
    and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to support Service
    Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while maintaining separation of
    the service and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.
    Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for steering packets between
    Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given Service Function Path (SFP) while
    NSH has the responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the service plane,
    the SFC instance context, and any associated metadata. This integration demonstrates
    that NSH and SR can work cooperatively and provide the network operator with the
    flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes sense in specific areas
    of their network infrastructure while still maintaining an end-to-end service
    plane using NSH.</p>"
