abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for Reed-
    Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m &lt;= 16, that can be used to protect
    arbitrary media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework. Reed-Solomon
    codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means
    they offer optimal protection against packet erasures. They are also systematic
    codes, which means that the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols. The
    price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number
    of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of LDPC codes
    for instance.</p>"
