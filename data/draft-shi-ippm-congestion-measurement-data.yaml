abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion Measurement collects the congestion information in the packet
    while the packet traverses a path. The sender sets the congestion measurement
    command in the packet header indicating the network device along the path to update
    the congestion information field in the packet. When the packet arrives at the
    receiver, the congestion information field will reflect the degree of congestion
    across network path. Congestion Measurement can enable precise congestion control,
    aids in effective load balancing, and simplifies network debugging. This document
    defines data fields for Congestion Measurement. Congestion Measurement Data-Fields
    can be encapsulated into a variety of protocols, such as Network Service Header
    (NSH), Segment Routing, Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve),
    or IPv6.</p>"
