abstract:
- content: "<p>Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast ReRoute
    (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic (and MPLS LDP traffic
    by extension). Following first deployment experiences, this document provides
    operational feedback on LFA, highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of
    refinements to address those limitations. It also proposes required management
    specifications. This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.</p>"
