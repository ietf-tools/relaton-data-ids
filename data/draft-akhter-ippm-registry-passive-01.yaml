abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo defines the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry of the
    Performance Metric Registry. This sub-registry will contain Passive Performance
    Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly applicable to other IETF metrics.
    IPPM Passive metric registration is meant to allow wider adoption of common metrics
    in an inter-operable way. There are challenges with metric interoperability and
    adoption (to name a few) due to flexible input parameters, confusion between many
    similar metrics, and varying output formats. This memo proposes a way to organize
    registry entries into columns that are well-defined, permitting consistent development
    of entries over time (a column may be marked NA if it is not applicable for that
    metric). The design is intended to foster development of registry entries based
    on existing reference RFCs, whilst each column serves as a check-list item to
    avoid omissions during the registration process. Every entry in the registry,
    before IANA action, requires Expert review as defined by concurrent IETF work
    in progress "Registry for Performance Metrics" (draft-manyfolks-ippm-metric- registry).
    The document contains example entries for the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry:
    a registry entry for a passive metric based on octetTotalCount as defined in RFC5102
    and a protocol specific passive metric based on RTP packets lost as defined in
    RFC3550. The examples are for Informational purposes and do not create any entry
    in the IANA registry.</p>'
