abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes LEDBAT++, a set of enhancements to the LEDBAT (Low
    Extra Delay Background Transport) congestion control algorithm for background
    traffic. The LEDBAT congestion control algorithm has several shortcomings that
    prevent it from working effectively in practice. LEDBAT++ extends LEDBAT by adding
    a set of improvements, including reduced congestion window gain, modified slow-start,
    multiplicative decrease and periodic slowdowns. This set of improvement mitigates
    the known issues with the LEDBAT algorithm, such as latency drift, latecomer advantage
    and inter-LEDBAT fairness. LEDBAT++ has been implemented as a TCP congestion control
    algorithm in the Windows operating system. LEDBAT++ has been deployed in production
    at scale on a variety of networks and been experimentally verified to achieve
    the original stated goals of LEDBAT. This document is a product of the Internet
    Congestion Control Research Group (ICCRG) of the Internet Research Task Force
    (IRTF).</p>"
