abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server
    even package for SIP server farm using the SIP event framework. The SIP server
    event package allows clients to subscribe to the servers for server information
    in the server farm, and serves to communicate information with each other. Based
    on this, an overall view of the SIP server farm is built and delivered to the
    entity (including SIP phone proxy or other SIP servers) which subscribes and receives
    the event packages. The view would help failover and load balancing in the server
    farm. The event notification mechanism of SIP event framework guarantees its adaption
    to the dynamic changes of server state. We instantiate the usage of SIP server
    event package in three scenarios: client based failover, DNS based failover, load
    balancer based load balancing. To be added, we introduce some specific usage in
    Peer-to-Peer SIP(P2PSIP) and service discovery to expand and explore the potential
    usage space. Compared with the failover and load balancing mechanisms in traditional
    SIP, the new SIP event package would apply its explicit and dynamic notification
    mechanism to improve the efficiency and service availability of SIP server farm.
    This mechanism using server event package can also be a complementary way for
    the DNS functionality defined in RFC 3263[RFC 3263] to locate SIP servers.</p>"
