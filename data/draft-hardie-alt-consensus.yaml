abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an experimental set of alternative decision-making
    processes for use in IETF working groups. There are a small number of cases in
    IETF working groups in which the group has come to consensus that a particular
    decision must be made but cannot agree on the decision itself. This document describes
    alternative mechanisms for reaching a decision in those cases. This is not meant
    to provide an exhaustive list, but to provide a known set of tools that can be
    used when needed. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
