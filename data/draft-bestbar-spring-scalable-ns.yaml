abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple network slices can be realized on top of a single shared network.
    A router that requires forwarding of a packet that belongs to a slice aggregate
    may have to decide on the forwarding action to take based on selected next-hop(s),
    and the forwarding treatment (e.g., scheduling and drop policy) to enforce based
    on the slice aggregate per-hop behavior. Segment Routing is a technology that
    enables the steering of packets in a network by encoding pre- established segments
    within the network into the packet header. This document introduces mechanisms
    to enable forwarding of packets over a specific slice aggregate along a Segment
    Routing (SR) path.</p>"
