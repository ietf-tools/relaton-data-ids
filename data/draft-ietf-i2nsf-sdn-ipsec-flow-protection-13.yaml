abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to provide IPsec-based flow protection
    (integrity and confidentiality) by means of an Interface to Network Security Function
    (I2NSF) controller. It considers two main well- known scenarios in IPsec: (i)
    gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to- host. The service described in this document
    allows the configuration and monitoring of IPsec Security Associations (IPsec
    SAs) from a I2NSF Controller to one or several flow-based Network Security Functions
    (NSFs) that rely on IPsec to protect data traffic. The document focuses on the
    I2NSF NSF-facing Interface by providing YANG data models for configuring the IPsec
    databases, namely Security Policy Database (SPD), Security Association Database
    (SAD), Peer Authorization Database (PAD), and IKEv2. This allows IPsec SA establishment
    with minimal intervention by the network administrator. It defines three YANG
    modules but it does not define any new protocol.</p>"
