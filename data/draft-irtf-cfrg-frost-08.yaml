abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we present the two-round signing variant of FROST, a
    Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme. FROST signatures
    can be issued after a threshold number of entities cooperate to issue a signature,
    allowing for improved distribution of trust and redundancy with respect to a secret
    key. Further, this draft specifies signatures that are compatible with [RFC8032].
    However, unlike [RFC8032], the protocol for producing signatures in this draft
    is not deterministic, so as to ensure protection against a key-recovery attack
    that is possible when even only one participant is malicious.</p>"
