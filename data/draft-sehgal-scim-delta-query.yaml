abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the System for Cross-domain Identity
    Management (SCIM) standard RFC7643 [RFC7644] to enable incremental retrieval of
    resources that have been updated or deleted in a SCIM service provider. This allows
    for more efficient interactions between SCIM clients and service providers and
    addresses problems that have inhibited large-scale implementation of use cases
    such as synchronization, entropy detection, and identity reconciliation.</p>"
