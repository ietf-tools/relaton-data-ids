abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network deployments",
    and a set of definitions and shared properties. It also discusses the technologies
    employed in these network deployments, and their differing architectural characteristics.
    The term "Alternative Network Deployments" includes a set of network access models
    that have emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity
    to people, using topological, architectural and business models different from
    the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys or leases the network
    infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be connected
    and make use of it. Several initiatives throughout the world have built large
    scale alternative Networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including
    long distance) due to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum. Wired
    technologies such as fiber are also used in some of these alternate networks.
    There are several types of alternate networks: community networks, which are self-organized
    and decentralized networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned by individuals
    who act as wireless internet service providers (WISPs); networks owned by individuals
    but leased out to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach
    the underserved population, and finally there are networks that provide connectivity
    by sharing wireless resources of the users. The emergence of these networks can
    be motivated by different causes such as the reluctance, or the impossibility,
    of network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote
    areas. In these cases, the networks have self sustainable business models that
    provide more localized communication services as well as Internet backhaul support
    through peering agreements with traditional network operators. Some other times,
    networks are built as a complement and an alternative to commercial Internet access
    provided by "traditional" network operators. The present classification considers
    different existing network models such as Community Networks, open wireless services,
    user- extensible services, traditional local Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
    new global ISPs, etc. Different criteria are used in order to build a classification
    as e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
    participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company
    or a local stakeholder (public or private), etc. According to the developed taxonomy,
    a characterization of each kind of network is presented in terms of specific network
    characteristics related to architecture, organization, etc.</p>'
