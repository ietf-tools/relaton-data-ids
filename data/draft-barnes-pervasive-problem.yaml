abstract:
- content: <p>Documents published in 2013 have revealed several classes of "pervasive"
    attack on Internet communications. In this document, we review the main attacks
    that have been published, and develop a threat model that describes these pervasive
    attacks. Based on this threat model, we discuss the techniques that can be employed
    in Internet protocol design to increase the protocols robustness to pervasive
    attacks.</p>
