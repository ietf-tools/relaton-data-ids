abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an arrangement of fields in the IPv4 TOS byte [RFC795,
    RFC1349], and in the IPv6 Traffic Class byte [IPv6], and proposes a definition
    for their associated semantics. The intention is to enable the preservation of
    currently useful differential class- based queueing behavior on existing network
    devices, while simultaneously enabling new methods of bandwidth allocation and
    policing via drop preference, all within the context of flows which may be encrypted
    at the IP layer using IPSEC. (Note: the IPv6 Class field has recently been expanded
    to eight bits, but this in not yet available in any version of the specification).</p>"
