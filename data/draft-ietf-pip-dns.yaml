abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version
    4. Pip is a general purpose internet protocol, designed to handle all forseeable
    internet protocol requirements. This specification describes the use of DNS to
    support Pip. Because Pip carries IDs and addresses separately, and because Pip
    Addresses are variable length, DNS must be modified to support Pip. Also, Pip
    addresses are more likely to change than IP addresses. To enable DNS to still
    cache aggressively in the presence of address changes, we propose adding functionality
    to DNS to allow resolvers to ask for later versions of information when previously
    returned information is found to be out-of-date. In addition to these necessary
    modifications, we have chosen to add new information to DNS to support transition
    and to support Pip features, such as policy routing, mobile hosts and routing
    through Public Data Networks. Later multicast support will be added as well.</p>"
