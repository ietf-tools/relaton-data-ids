abstract:
- content: "<p>A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints for
    delivering presence information to devices with low data processing capabilities,
    small display, and limited battery power. Other limitations can be caused by the
    interface between the terminal and the network, i.e. if presence information is
    delivered over radio links with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo presents
    requirements for a solution that can aid to reduce the impacts of these constrains
    and helps to increase efficiency.</p>"
