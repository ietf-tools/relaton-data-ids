abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo utilizes IPPM metrics that are applicable to both complete
    paths and sub-paths, and defines relationships to compose a complete path metric
    from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy w.r.t. the actual metrics. This is
    called Spatial Composition in RFC 2330. The current version of the memo gives
    some background and proposes wording for a Scope and Application section to define
    this new work. The description of several example metrics and statistics follow.</p>"
