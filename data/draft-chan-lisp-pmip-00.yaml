abstract:
- content: "<p>PMIP and LISP are both network-based. Integration of PMIP with a hierarchical
    design into the LISP network provides network-based fast-mobility support to enable
    a mobile node to perform handover in both LISP and non-LISP networks, and non-optimal
    PMIP routes in the LISP network are avoided.</p>"
