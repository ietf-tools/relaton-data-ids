abstract:
- content: <p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol's schema
    RFC RFC7643 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643) defines the complex
    core schema attributes "roles" and "entitlements". For both of these concepts,
    frequently only a predetermined set of values are accepted by a SCIM service provider.
    The values that are accepted may vary per customer or tenant based on customizable
    configuration in the service provider's application or based on other criteria
    such as what services have been purchased. This document defines an extension
    to the SCIM 2.0 standard to allow SCIM service providers to represent available
    data pertaining to roles and entitlements so that SCIM clients can consume this
    information and provide easier management of role and entitlement assignments.</p>
