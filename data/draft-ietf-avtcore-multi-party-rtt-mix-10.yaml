abstract:
- content: <p>Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the
    source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be presented by
    endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the same source, while new
    text from other sources is also presented in readable grouping as received interleaved
    in real-time. Regional regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time
    text in multi-party calls. RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use traditional
    RTP functions for source identification, but the mixer source switching performance
    is limited when using the default transmission characteristics with redundancy.
    Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided in this document,
    suitable for a centralized conference model that enables source identification
    and source switching. The intended use is for real-time text mixers and multi-party-aware
    participant endpoints. The specified mechanism build on the standard use of the
    CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification. The method makes use of
    the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two-party sessions. A capability
    exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a participant can handle
    the multi-party coded real-time text stream. The capability is indicated by use
    of a media attribute "rtt-mixer". The document updates RFC 4103[RFC4103] A specifications
    of how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multi-party
    aware is also provided.</p>
