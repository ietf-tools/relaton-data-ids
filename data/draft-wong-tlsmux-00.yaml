abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a multiplexing protocol that allows remote
    machines to access local services in a secure manner. All clients must connect
    to the multiplexer using TLS, allowing encrypted network communications to normally
    cleartext protocols. TLSMUX is an application level protocol that does not require
    a kernel upgrade or extensions to existing protocols in order to operate. By offering
    a TLS connection to a multiplexer, current servers and protocols do not need to
    be modified to benefit from the encryption features of TLSMUX. Some clients may
    need to be updated to support TLSMUX, although it is possible for some clients
    to use a TLSMUX proxy without modification.</p>"
