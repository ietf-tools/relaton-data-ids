abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended as clarification of LDP behaviour in link-
    down scenarios. Base LDP RFC5036 lacks sufficient clarity on what an LDP enabled
    node should be doing when a link down event is received, and the only LDP adjacency
    for an LDP peer is over this link. Different vendors have handled this scenario
    differently, with some immediately resetting tcp session with neighbor and some
    waiting for igp recovergence instead of reacting directly to link events. With
    this document we intend to clarify the expected behaviour explicitly so that any
    interop issues can be avoided.</p>"
