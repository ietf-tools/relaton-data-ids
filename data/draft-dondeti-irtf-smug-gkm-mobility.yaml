- content: "<p>In this document we consider the problem of key management in a mobile
    wireless networking environment, such as a dynamic, dis- tributed setting in which
    command and control nodes move along with individual users. In this scenario,
    data must be securely multicast from one source to many users, requiring that
    users be properly keyed.</p>"
