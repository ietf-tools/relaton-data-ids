abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to focus discussion and work on security
    models for the Internet SNMP, and to define conventions promoting experimentation
    with various potential methods of solution. These conventions are based on the
    concepts of authentication service and authentication schemes as defined in RFC
    1157. These conventions promote such experimentation in a transparent way without
    changing the formats of messages exchanged by SNMP protocol entities, and without
    changing the elements of procedure for SNMP entities. In fact, most currently
    deployed SNMP implementations could be classified as one of the compliance definitions
    defined in this memo. These conventions rely on the consistent configuration of
    the peer SNMP protocol entities, and on non-null authentication service transforms
    of the SNMP 'Message.data' field (trivial authentication is considered an implementation
    of a null authentication service transform). It is hoped that this memo, along
    with complementary memos written by other interested parties, will result in a
    better understanding of SNMP security models, interoperable experimental security
    models, and eventually the adoption of standards.</p>"
