abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM (RFC6376) is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to
    authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of messages during
    transit. Section 8.6 defines a vulnerability called DKIM Replay as a spam message
    sent through a SMTP MTA DKIM signer, that then is sent to many more recipients,
    leveraging the reputation of the signer. We propose two Replay Resistant cryptographic
    domain based protocols that leverage ARC (RFC8617). The first technique discloses
    all SMTP recipients as signed RFC822 headers by the sender which allows a receiver
    to verify this. The second technique defines a SMTP extension that allows both
    the sender and receiver to participate in signing the message signature. It includes
    a path building technique that accurately defines the SMTP forwarding path of
    the message. Both techniques permit a receiver to detect DKIM and ARC replay attacks
    and other attacks. This specification also defines a relay flow identifier to
    prevent spammers from using relay forwarding, We do this by having relays categorize
    their authenticated traffic flows and publish to receivers identifiers associated
    with those flows. Receivers can use this identifier to help categorize traffic
    through the relay and use that identifier to apply fine-grain anti-abuse policies
    instead of on the entire traffic through the relay.</p>"
