abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, Information-Centric networking (ICN) becomes the hot spot
    to meet the new requirements accessing a large amount information through networks.
    ICN exists congestion which isn't well solved. The congestion control protocols
    in IP network aren't suitable for ICN transport, so we provide a new congestion
    control protocol-RRCP. RRCP based on XCP and ICN transport characteristics raises
    a receiver-driven, router-feedback, multi-request windows and timeout mechanisms.
    RRCP shows efficient, fair and stable via simulation results.</p>"
