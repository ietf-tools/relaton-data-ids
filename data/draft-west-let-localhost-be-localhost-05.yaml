abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6761 with the goal of ensuring that "localhost"
    can be safely relied upon as a name for the local host's loopback interface. To
    that end, stub resolvers are required to resolve localhost names to loopback addresses.
    Recursive DNS servers are required to return "NXDOMAIN" when queried for localhost
    names, which will cause non-conformant stub resolvers to fail safely closed. Together,
    these requirements would allow applications and specifications to join regular
    users in drawing the common-sense conclusions that "localhost" means "localhost",
    and doesn't resolve to somewhere else on the network.</p>
