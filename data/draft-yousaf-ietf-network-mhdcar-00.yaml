abstract:
- content: "<p>The Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol specified in
    [1] is aimed to enable seamless IP layer handover by aiding seamless Layer 3 (L3)
    mobility management protocols like Fast Mobile IP (FMIP) by providing identity
    and capabilities information of the candidate access routers (CARs) to the mobile
    node (MN) prior to the initiation of handover while the MN is still connected
    to its current AR. The specifications as laid down in [1], however, specifies
    a very generic mechanism of the CARD protocol effective only in specific network
    architecture scenarios and it doesn't take into account the stringent requirements
    of a fast moving MN and real time communication sessions, especially when it comes
    to resolving candidate access routers that my be adjacent geographically but not
    topologically. This draft addresses the expected shortcomings of the base CARD
    protocol with respect to fast moving MNs and real time communication sessions
    by proposing extensions that is expected to improve and/or enhance the performance
    of the generic CARD protocol as specified in [1].</p>"
