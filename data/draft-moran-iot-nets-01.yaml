abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has developed security technologies that help to secure the
    Internet of Things even over constrained networks and when targetting constrained
    nodes. These technologies can be used independenly or can be composed into larger
    systems to mitigate a variety of threats. This documents illustrates an overview
    over these technologies and highlights their relationships. Ultimately, a threat
    model is presented as a basis to derive requirements that interconnect existing
    and emerging solution technologies.</p>"
