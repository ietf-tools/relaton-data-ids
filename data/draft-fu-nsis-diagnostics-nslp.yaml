abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling protocol suite aims to provide a way to
    communicate with network intermediaries. As such, it is desirable to offer generic
    diagnostics function for NSIS users and system administrators to make the functionality
    provided by the network more transparent (e.g., to identify particular NSLPs,
    to determine to which degree the network supports NSIS, GIST state or specific
    NSLP session information along a given path). Instead of suggesting one specific
    solution we highlight the different design options of some simple, stateless diagnostics
    functions from a querying node to a responding node. These preliminary thoughts
    should help the working group to have a more structure discussion in this problem
    space.</p>"
