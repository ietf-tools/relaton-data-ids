abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several issues relevant to the design of a
    network mobility support solution that relies on the bi-directional tunnel between
    Mobile Router and Home Agent, with Mobile IP. Examples of issues are: conflicting
    Mobile IP and RIPng/OSPF requirements on link-local addresses, HA/BR co-location,
    and 'cross-over' tunnels.</p>"
