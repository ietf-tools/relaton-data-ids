abstract:
- content: "<p>For certain types or models of devices it should be clear and obvious
    that, by default, they should not be reachable from the global IPv6 Internet,
    or able to reach the global IPv6 Internet, even though the network they are attached
    to provides global IPv6 Internet connectivity. This memo proposes that these types
    of devices refuse to configure and use global IPv6 Internet addresses by default.</p>"
