abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of the lack of important TCP extensions, e.g., Multipath TCP
    support at the server side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted
    model that relies upon the activation of a dedicated function called Transport
    Converters. For example, network-assisted Multipath TCP deployment models are
    designed to facilitate the adoption of Multipath TCP for the establishment of
    multi-path communications without making any assumption about the support of Multipath
    TCP by the remote servers. Transport Converters located in the network are responsible
    for establishing multi-path communications on behalf of endpoints, thereby taking
    advantage of Multipath TCP capabilities to achieve different goals that include
    (but are not limited to) optimization of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth aggregation),
    of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup communication paths), and traffic offload
    management. This document focuses on the explicit deployment scheme where the
    identity of the Transport Converters is explicitly configured on connected hosts.
    This document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure hosts with Converters
    parameters.</p>"
