abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an adaptive Non-Congestion Robustness (aNCR)
    mechanism for TCP. In the absence of explicit congestion notification from the
    network, TCP uses only packet loss as an indication of congestion. One of the
    signals TCP uses to determine loss is the arrival of three duplicate acknowledgments.
    However, this heuristic is not always correct, notably in the case when paths
    reorder packets. This results in degraded performance. TCP-aNCR is designed to
    mitigate this performance degradation by adaptively increasing the number of duplicate
    acknowledgments required to trigger loss recovery, based on the current state
    of the connection, in an effort to better disambiguate true segment loss from
    segment reordering. This document specifies the changes to TCP and TCP-NCR (on
    which this specification is build on) and discusses the costs and benefits of
    these modifications.</p>"
