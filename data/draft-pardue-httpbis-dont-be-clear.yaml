abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) are identified by a tuple of Application-Protocol
    Layer Negotiation (ALPN) protocol identifier, a host and a port. The wire format
    for Alt-Svc is defined in ABNF and encodes this tuple or the keyword "clear",
    which has a special meaning. This memo reserves the ALPN protocol identifier "clear"
    to reduce the chances of accidental aliasing with the "clear" keyword.</p>
