abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2]) to
    support an Optical User Network Interface (UNI). This effort is in part driven
    by work in the OIF as well as the recent draft on signaling requirements for the
    optical UNI ([3]), and is consistent with recent work on Generalized MPLS (see
    [4], [5], [6], and [7]) in IETF. The main function of this draft is to identify
    the relevant mechanisms in RSVP-TE (including further extensions) to satisfy functional
    requirements for an Optical UNI.</p>"
