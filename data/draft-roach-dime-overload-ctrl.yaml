abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
    able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce or
    stop sending traffic for some period of time. Otherwise, it must continue to expend
    resources parsing and responding to Diameter messages. This document proposes
    a concrete, application-independent mechanism to address the challenge of communicating
    load and overload state among Diameter peers, and specifies an algorithm for load
    abatement to address such overload conditions as they occur. The load abatement
    algorithm is extensible, allowing for future documents to define additional load
    abatement approaches.</p>"
