abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes version 2 of RSRR, a routing interface for RSVP.
    By using this interface, RSVP may obtain forwarding information from routers and
    use it to place reservation state within the network. Version 1 of this interface
    was designed primarily for RSVP interaction with IPv4 multicast routing protocols.
    Version 2 adds support for IPv4 unicast as well as IPv6 unicast and multicast
    routing. A backwards compatibility mechanism is provided.</p>"
