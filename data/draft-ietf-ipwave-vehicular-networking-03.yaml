abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses problem statement and use cases on IP-based
    vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation
    Systems (ITS). The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networking.
    First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking. Second,
    this document analyzes current protocols for vehicular networking and general
    problems on those current protocols. Third, this document does problem exploration
    for key aspects in IP- based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 over IEEE 802.11-OCB,
    IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, Vehicle Identities Management, Multihop
    V2X Communications, Multicast, DNS Naming Services, Service Discovery, IPv6 over
    Cellular Networks, Security and Privacy. For each key aspect, this document discusses
    problem statement to analyze the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and
    requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.</p>"
