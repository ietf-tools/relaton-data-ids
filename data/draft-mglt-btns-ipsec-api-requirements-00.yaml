abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec suite has been designed to secure communication between two nodes.
    Security is performed at the network layer, and there are almost no interactions
    between applications and the IPsec layer. The main motivation of this API is to
    enable any applications to interact with the IPsec layer and to take advantage
    of the security deployed in IPsec suite. This draft lists applications requirements
    with regard to the IPsec suite, and we tried not to limit the requirements to
    today's application requirements, but also to consider future applications' requirements.
    Applications are associated to different privileges, and IPsec layer MUST be protected
    from nasty IPsec manipulations. This draft is not considering applications privileges
    management. This draft lists any possible requirements on the IPsec layer an application
    might require.</p>"
