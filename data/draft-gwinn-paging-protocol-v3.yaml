abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a simple way for delivering wireless messages,
    both one and two-way, to appropriate receiving devices. In its simplest form,
    SNPP provides a simple way to implement a 'shim' between the Internet and a TAP/IXO
    paging terminal. In its level 3 form, it provides an easy-to-use (and build) method
    for communicating and receiving end-to-end acknowledgments and replies from two-way
    messaging devices (such as ReFLEX units). Gateways supporting this protocol, as
    well as SMTP, have been in use for well over a year at several commercial paging
    companies, and private businesses. Client software supporting this protocol has
    become widespread, and is being integrated into many of the new paging and messaging
    products being built. In addition to commercial software, email filters and SNPP
    client software for Unix and Windows (WikiPage) are available at no cost. Please
    contact the author for more information. Earlier versions of this specification
    were reviewed by IESG members and the '822 Extensions' Working Group. They preferred
    an alternate strategy, as discussed under 'Relationship to Other IETF Work', below.</p>"
