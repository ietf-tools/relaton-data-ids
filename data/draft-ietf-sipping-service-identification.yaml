abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the problem of service identification in the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Service identification is the process of determining
    the user-level use case that is driving the signaling being utilized by the user
    agent (UA). This document discusses the uses of service identification, and outlines
    several architectural principles behind the process. It identifies perils when
    service identification is not done properly -- including fraud, interoperability
    failures, and stifling of innovation. It then outlines a set of recommended practices
    for service identification. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
