abstract:
- content: <p>The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains a field that identifies the address
    of a "root node". Intermediate nodes are expected to be able to look up that address
    in their routing tables. However, this is not possible if the route to the root
    node is a BGP route and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core. This
    document specifies procedures that enable an MP LSP to be constructed through
    a BGP-free core. In these procedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced
    by an address that is known to the intermediate nodes and is on the path to the
    true root node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
