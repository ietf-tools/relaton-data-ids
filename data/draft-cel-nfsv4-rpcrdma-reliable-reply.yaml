abstract:
- content: "<p>RPC transports such as RPC-over-RDMA version 1 require reply buffers
    to be in place before an RPC Call is sent. However, RPC consumers sometimes have
    difficulty estimating the expected maximum size of a particular RPC reply. This
    introduces the risk that an RPC Reply message can overrun reply resources provided
    by the requester, preventing delivery of the message, through no fault of the
    requester. This document describes a mechanism that eliminates the need for pre-allocation
    of reply resources for unpredictably large replies.</p>"
