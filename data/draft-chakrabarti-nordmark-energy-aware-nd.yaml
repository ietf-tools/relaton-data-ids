abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for neighbor's
    address resolution, unreachability detection, address autoconfiguration, router
    advertisement and solicitation. With the progress of Internet adoption on various
    industries including home, wireless and machine-to-machine communications, there
    is a desire for optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol to be more
    efficient in terms of number of signaling messages in the network. Efficient IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery is useful for energy-efficient networks and as well for overlay
    networks such as VLANs with large number of nodes. This document describes a method
    of optimizations by reducing periodic multicast messages, frequent Neighbor Solicitation
    messages and discusses interoperability with legacy IPv6 nodes. It also addresses
    the ND denial of service issues by introducing node Registration procedure.</p>"
