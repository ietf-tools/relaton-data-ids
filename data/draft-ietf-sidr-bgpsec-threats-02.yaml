abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a threat model for BGP path security (BGPSEC).
    It assumes the context established by the SIDR WG charter, as of April 19, 2011.
    The charter established two goals for the SIDR work: o Enabling an AS to verify
    the authorization of an origin AS to originate a specified set of prefixes o Enabling
    an AS to verify that the AS-PATH represented in a route matches the path travelled
    by the NLRI for the route The charter further mandates that SIDR build upon the
    Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), the first product of the WG. Consistent
    with the charter, this threat model includes an analysis of the RPKI, and focuses
    on the ability of an AS to verify the authenticity of the AS path info received
    in a BGP update. The model assumes that BGP path security is achieved through
    the application of digital signatures to AS_Path Info. The document characterizes
    classes of potential adversaries that are considered to be threats, and examines
    classes of attacks that might be launched against BGPSEC. It concludes with brief
    discussion of residual vulnerabilities.</p>"
