abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an architecture for BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering
    for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER). BIER-TE shares part of its architecture
    with BIER as described in [I-D.wijnands-bier-architecture]. It also proposes to
    share the packet format with BIER. BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets like
    BIER based on a BitString in the packet header but it does not require an IGP.
    It does support traffic engineering by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding and loose
    hop forwarding of packets. It does support Fast ReRoute (FRR) for link and node
    protection and incremental deployment. Because BIER-TE like BIER operates without
    explicit in-network tree- building but also supports traffic engineering, it is
    more similar to SR than RSVP-TE.</p>"
