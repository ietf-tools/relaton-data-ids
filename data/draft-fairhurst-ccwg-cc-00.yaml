abstract:
- content: <p>When published as an RFC, this document provides guidance on the design
    of methods to avoid congestion collapse and how an endpoint needs to react to
    congestion. The IETF provides recommendations and requirements on this topic that
    is distributed across many documents in the RFC series. This document therefore
    gathers and consolidates these recommendations. Based on these, and Internet engineering
    experience, the document provides best current practice for the design of new
    congestion control methods in Internet protocols. When published, the document
    will update or replace the Best Current Practice in BCP 41, which currently includes
    "Congestion Control Principles" provided in RFC2914.</p>
