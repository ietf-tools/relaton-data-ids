abstract:
- content: "<p>This document present an overview of the project to map engineering
    concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion and protection
    of the freedom of expression and association. This first draft is intended to
    provide the framework for reporting on the study, initial results and basic considerations.
    At a later stage it will fold in the work being done in the Methodology and Glossary
    drafts as well as the work being done in the case studies. It also folds in some
    of the text included in the original proposal for the HRPC. Discussion on this
    draft at: hrpc@irtf.org // https://www.irtf.org/mailman/admindb/hrpc</p>"
