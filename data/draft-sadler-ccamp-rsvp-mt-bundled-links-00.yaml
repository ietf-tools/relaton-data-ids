abstract:
- content: "<p>When operating a multi-domain network, it is quite common for a domain
    to have a number of border-nodes that end up with a large number of connections
    between them using the same path. While support for LSP stitching has removed
    the need to maintain the data associated with each end-to-end session (e.g. Sender
    Template and Session object data) within the domain, the mechanisms used by GMPLS
    RSVP-TE to support out-of-band signaling still force individual sessions to be
    used between the border nodes for each connection. This has a negative impact
    on intermediate nodes, as it increases the amount of RSVP processing and memory
    required. This document details a method for GMPLS RSVP-TE to use a common session
    for an edge-to-edge LSP supporting multiple data-plane connections between border
    nodes.</p>"
