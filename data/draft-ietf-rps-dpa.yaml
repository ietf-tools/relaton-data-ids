abstract:
- content: "<p>Ripe-181 [2] is a language to specify routing policy constraints for
    inter-domain routing in the Internet. Ripe-181 allows the specification of both
    import policy constraints (by specifying as-in and interas-in attributes) and
    export policy constraints (by specifying as-out and interas-out attributes). The
    Destination Preference Attribute (DPA) [3] is recently added to the BGP [4] routing
    protocol. This attribute can be used by an autonomous system (AS) to specify a
    globally transitive preference in its routing announcement via BGP so that the
    upstream BGP speakers can use this preference to favor certain path for return
    traffic. This document extends Ripe-181 to enable the setting of the DPA attribute
    during route announcements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with BGP,
    DPA and Ripe-181.</p>"
