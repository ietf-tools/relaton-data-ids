abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a network-based Virtual Private Network (VPN)
    architecture using the virtual router (VR) concept. Multiple VRs can exist in
    a single physical device. A VR emulates all the functionality of a physical router,
    and therefore inherits all existing mechanisms and tools for configuration, operation,
    accounting, and maintenance. Any routing protocol can be used to distribute VPN
    reachability information among VRs, and no VPN- related modifications or extensions
    are needed to the routing protocol for achieving VPN reachability. Direct VR-to-VR
    connectivity may be configured through layer-2 links or through IP- or MPLS-based
    tunnels. Traffic from VRs belonging to different VPNs may be aggregated over a
    "backbone VR" network, which greatly simplifies VPN provisioning. This architecture
    accommodates various backbone deployment scenarios, both where the VPN service
    provider owns the backbone, and where the VPN service provider obtains backbone
    service from one or more other service providers.</p>
