abstract:
- content: <p>DKIM (RFC6376) is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to
    authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of messages during
    transit. Section 8.6 defines a vulnerability called DKIM Replay as a spam message
    sent through a SMTP MTA DKIM signer, that then is sent to many more recipients,
    leveraging the reputation of the signer. We propose a replay resistant cryptographic
    based protocol that discloses all SMTP recipients and signs them, allowing a receiver
    or any third party to verify that the message went to the intended recipient.
    If not then then potentially the message is replayed. Moreover it leverages ARC
    (RFC8617) and sender defined forwarding path to build a "chain of custody" that
    accurately defines the SMTP forwarding path of the message. This also allows the
    protocol to detect DKIM and ARC replay attacks and other attacks.</p>
