abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol for obtaining cross-realm Kerberos
    tickets using existing, related protocols: kerberized certification authorities
    (kx509) and public key cryptography initial authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT).
    The resulting protocol has a number of desirable security properties, including
    privacy protection for the user relative to their home realm's infrastructure,
    as well a support for leap-of-faith trust establishment, and automated cross-
    realm keying. This protocol allows Kerberos to scale to large numbers of realms.</p>"
