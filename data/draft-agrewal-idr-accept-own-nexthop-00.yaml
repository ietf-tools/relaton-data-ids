abstract:
- content: "<p>Various Service chain techniques utilize a Controller to inject Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP) Virtual Private Network (VPN) routes to help steer traffic
    through a given path. The Controller does so by controlling how these VPN routes
    are imported into various Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables at routers
    along the desired path. A couple of such approaches are specified in [I-D.ietf-bess-service-chaining].
    These approaches rely on the Controller modifying the Route Target (RT) list and
    next-hop of a VPN route received from a downstream router and redistributing these
    modified routes to upstream routers. This is done such that - o routes originated
    by an ingress VRF at the downstream router are imported into the egress VRF at
    the immediately preceding upstream router and o next-hop advertised to the upstream
    router is the address of the immediately succeeding downstream router. This forces
    the traffic to flow through a sequence of network functions creating a service
    chain. This works fine as long as the VRF importing the route received from the
    Controller is on a different router than the VRF that originally exported the
    route to the Controller. This is because BGP protocol [RFC4271] specifies that
    a router reject routes received with its own next-hop. This document proposes
    a new community the reception of which relaxes this particular rule in the BGP
    protocol standard and describes at least one way of how next-hops of such routes
    could be resolved.</p>"
