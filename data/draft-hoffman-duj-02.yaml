abstract:
- content: <p>It is common for service providers such as certificate authorities and
    social media providers to want users to update the users' zones to prove that
    they control those zones, or to add other features. Currently, service providers
    tell users to do this using human language describing the resource record type
    and data values to enter into the zone. This document describes a text format,
    called "DNS update with JSON" or "DUJ", for such a service provider to give to
    a user, with the expectation that the user would copy and paste the text to their
    DNS operator to update the user's zone. DNS operators who know how to handle DUJ
    strings will make the update process easier and more predictable for their users.</p>
