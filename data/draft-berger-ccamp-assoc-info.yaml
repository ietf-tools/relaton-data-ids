abstract:
- content: "<p>The RSVP ASSOCIATION object was defined in the context of GMPLS (Generalized
    Multi-Protocol Label Switching) controlled label switched paths (LSPs). In this
    context, the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.
    This object also has broader applicability as a mechanism to associate RSVP state,
    and this document defines how the ASSOCIATION object can be more generally applied.
    The document also reviews how the association is to be provided in the context
    of GMPLS recovery. No new new procedures or mechanisms are defined with respect
    to GMPLS recovery.</p>"
