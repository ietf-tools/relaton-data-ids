abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3rd party call control draft [2] demonstrates a usage of SIP [3]
    with some of the enhancements of RFC2543bis [4]. This usage requires that a 3pcc
    controller remain in the signaling path and maintain state for the duration of
    the call. While this is necessary in certain situations (ex: protocol translation:
    H.323 [5] to SIP, SIP to RTSP [6], HTTP [7] to SIP), it is sub-optimal in pure
    SIP environments. This draft demonstrates a usage of the REFER method [8] and
    SIP for presence [9] to allow authorized peers to participate in call control.</p>"
