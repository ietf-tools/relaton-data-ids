abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the capabilities of the DHCPv4 Relay Agent
    Information Option in RFC 3046 and the corresponding RADIUS- Attributes Sub-option
    to DHCPv6. In particular, the document describes a new DHCPv6 option called the
    Relay agent RADIUS Attributes Option (RRAO) which extends the set of DHCPv6 options
    as defined in RFC 3315 and 3376. Following its DHCPv4 counterpart, the new option
    is inserted by the DHCPv6 relay agent when forwarding client-originated DHCPv6
    packets to a DHCPv6 server. Servers recognizing the RRAO may use the information
    to implement IP address or other parameter assignment policies. The DHCP Server
    echoes the option back verbatim to the relay agent in server-to-client replies,
    and the relay agent strips the option before forwarding the reply to the client.</p>"
