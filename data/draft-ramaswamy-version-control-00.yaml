abstract:
- content: "<p>Version control has a wide range applications starting from a simple
    ASCII text file management to a complex software source management. This document
    discusses the basic requirement and framework for an open interface for Version
    Control System. Such an open interface would bring platform independence as well
    as flexibility and extensibility.</p>"
