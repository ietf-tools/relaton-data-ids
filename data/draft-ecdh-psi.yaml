abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set Intersection
    (ECDH-PSI). It instantiates the classical Meadows match-making protocol with standard
    elliptic curves and hash-to-curve methods. In ECDH-PSI, data items are encoded
    to points on an elliptic curve, and masked by the private keys of both parties.
    After collecting the mutually masked datasets from both parties, a participant
    computes their intersection and outputs the corresponding original data items
    as result.</p>"
