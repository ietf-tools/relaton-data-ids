abstract:
- content: "<p>The forwarding performance of an IP router is highly dependent on the
    information in its forwarding information base. This document describes the methodology
    to be used to determine the IP packet forwarding performance of an IP router as
    a function of the routers ability to properly form and optimize its forwarding
    information base.</p>"
