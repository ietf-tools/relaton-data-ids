abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location
    Delivery (HELD) protocol. It allows a Target to manage their location information
    on a Location Information Server (LIS) through the application of constraints
    invoked by accessing a location URI. Constraints are described that allow control
    over how long the URI is valid for and the access policy used when a location
    URI is accessed.</p>"
