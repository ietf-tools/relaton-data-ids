abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the specification of Dynamic Service Negotiation
    Protocol (DSNP). DSNP is a protocol to negotiate the SLS (Service Level Specification)
    in IP layer. It can be used for service negotiation from host to network, network
    to host, and network to network. The automated negotiation makes service negotiation
    efficient in terms of time, cost, and correctness, etc. The dynamic negotiation
    not only allows users to adapt their needs dynamically, but also let providers
    better utilize the network. The DSNP messages and packet formats are detailed.
    DSNP can be used in both wireline and wireless networks. It is, however, particularly
    useful in mobile environment. To demonstrate the usefulness of DSNP, a reference
    wireless QoS architecture is presented. Exemplary applications are illustrated.</p>"
