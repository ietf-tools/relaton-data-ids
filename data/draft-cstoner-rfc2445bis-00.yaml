abstract:
- content: "<p>Calendar systems export, transport and sometimes even store calendar
    information in a standard, interoperable format. This memo defines the common
    format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the
    Internet, known as the iCalendar object format. An iCalendar object may represent
    an event, to-do or task, or journal entry (note). Comments are solicited and should
    be addressed to the working group's mailing list at ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org
    and/or the editor.</p>"
