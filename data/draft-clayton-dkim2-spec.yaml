abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Identified Mail v2 (DKIM2) permits a person, role, or organization
    that owns a signing domain to document that it has handled an email message by
    associating their domain with the message. This is achieved by applying a cryptographic
    signature to the message. Verification is performed by querying an entry within
    the signing domain's DNS space to retrieve an appropriate public key. As a message
    is transferred from author to recipient further signatures will be added to provide
    a validatable "chain". This permits validators to identify when messages have
    been unexpectedly "replayed" and can ensure that delivery status notifications
    are only sent to entities that were involved in the transmission of a message.</p>
