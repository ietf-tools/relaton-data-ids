abstract:
- content: "<p>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses which
    are not globally unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC1918 for
    private use within individual sites. Hosts should never normally send reverse
    DNS queries for those addresses on the public Internet. However, such queries
    are frequently observed. Authority servers are deployed to provide authoritative
    answers to such queries as part of a loosely- coordinated effort known as the
    AS112 project. Since queries sent to AS112 servers are usually not intentional,
    the replies received back from those servers are typically unexpected. Unexpected
    inbound traffic can trigger alarms on intrusion detection systems and firewalls,
    and operators of such systems often mistakenly believe that they are being attacked.
    This document provides background information and technical advice to those firewall
    operators.</p>"
