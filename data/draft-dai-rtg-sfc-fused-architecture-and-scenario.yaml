abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the architecture and application scenarios
    of fused service function chain. Fused service function chain means that two or
    more service function chains are fused to become a single service function chain
    from the view of data plane, control plane and management plane. Fused service
    function chain is an expansion for general service function chain.Anyhow, some
    mechanism or methods need to be used when two or more service function chains
    are fused to be a single service function chain based on architecture described
    in this memo.</p>"
