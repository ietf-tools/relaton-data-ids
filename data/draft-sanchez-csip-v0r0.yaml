abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes CSIP, a protocol architecture that provides
    the support of TCAP user applications over an IP network. The core part of the
    CSIP architecture is the specification of the CSIP (Connectionless SCCP over IP)
    adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between the SCCP layer already defined
    in [2] and the IP family protocols IP, UDP, TCP and ICMP. UDP is used when SCCP
    class 0 is used, TCP is used when SCCP class 1 is used. CSIP provides the primitives
    and parameters to SCCP than MTP, and provides backward compatibility that guarantees
    the seamless connection between nodes implementing CSIP and classical SS7 nodes
    by means of a CSIP gateway. The design of CSIP is oriented to fulfill the requirements
    of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.</p>"
