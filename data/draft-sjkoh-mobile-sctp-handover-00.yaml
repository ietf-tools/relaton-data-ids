abstract:
- content: "<p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new reliable transport
    protocol that provides the multihoming feature. Without support of routers in
    the networks, the SCTP with the ADDIP extension (called mobile SCTP) can be used
    to provide seamless handover for the mobile host that is changing its IP subnetworks
    during the session. In the present form, the use of mobile SCTP is targeted for
    handover of the mobile sessions that are originated from the mobile clients (located
    in mobile networks) toward the fixed servers (located in the fixed networks).
    The support for the opposite directional session (initiated by fixed node to mobile
    node) requires an additional location management scheme such as Mobile IP. In
    this document, we discuss the generic procedures for seamless handover of mobile
    SCTP and the concerned implementation issues.</p>"
