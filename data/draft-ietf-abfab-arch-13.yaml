abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last decade, a substantial amount of work has occurred in
    the space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two
    use cases: network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these
    use cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few building blocks
    in common. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to
    the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access
    management, including the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS),
    the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP), and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).
    The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily
    non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of Identity
    Providers, Relying Parties, and federations.</p>"
