abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes terminology to standardize the description
    of benchmarking methodology for measuring eBGP convergence in the control plane
    of a single BGP device. Future documents will address iBGP convergence, the initiation
    of forwarding based on converged control plane information and multiple interacting
    BGP devices.This terminology is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6. Illustrative
    examples of each version are included where relevant. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
