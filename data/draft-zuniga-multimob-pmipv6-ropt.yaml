abstract:
- content: "<p>The MULTIMOB group has specified a base solution to support IP multicasting
    in a PMIPv6 domain [RFC6224]. In this document, some enhancements are proposed
    to the base solution. These enhancements include the use of a multicast tree mobility
    anchor as the topological anchor point for multicast traffic, as well as a direct
    routing option where the MAG can provide access to multicast content in the local
    network. These enhancements provide benefits such as reducing multicast traffic
    replication and supporting different PMIPv6 deployments scenarios.</p>"
