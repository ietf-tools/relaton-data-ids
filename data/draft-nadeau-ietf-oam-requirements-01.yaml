abstract:
- content: "<p>As transport of diverse traffic types such as voice, frame relay, and
    ATM over MPLS become more common, the ability to detect, handle and diagnose control
    and data plane defects becomes critical. Detection and specification of how to
    handle those defects is not only important because such defects may not only affect
    the fundamental operation of an MPLS network, but also because they may impact
    SLA commitments for customers of that network. This Internet draft describes requirements
    for user and data plane operations and management (OAM) for Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (MPLS). These requirements have been gathered from network operators
    who have extensive experience deploying MPLS networks, similarly some of these
    requirements have appeared in other documents [Y1710]. This draft specifies OAM
    requirements for MPLS, as well as for applications of MPLS such as pseudowire
    voice and VPN services. Those interested in specific issues relating to instrumenting
    MPLS for OAM purposes are directed to [FRAMEWORK]</p>"
