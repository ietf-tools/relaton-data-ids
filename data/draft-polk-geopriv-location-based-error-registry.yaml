abstract:
- content: "<p>This document IANA registers a list of GEOPRIV location-specific error
    response indications, to be used by signaling protocols describing a location-based
    error experienced by an intermediary or recipient endsystem. For example, the
    registered values here can be placed in a SIP Reason header contained within a
    424 (Bad Location Information) response, or in a Location-to-Service Translation
    (LoST) query failure, giving specific meaning to the reason for the error. This
    additional information is to provide the location transmitter more granular information
    about what was wrong with the supplied location in the original request message.</p>"
