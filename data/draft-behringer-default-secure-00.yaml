abstract:
- content: "<p>Pervasive monitoring on the Internet is enabled by the lack of general,
    fundamental security. In his presentation at the 88th IETF Bruce Schneier called
    for ubiquitous use of security technologies to make pervasive monitoring too expensive
    and thus impractical. However, today security is too operationally expensive,
    and thus only used where strictly required. In this position paper we argue that
    all network transactions can be secure by default, with minimal or no operator
    involvement. This requires an autonomic approach where all devices in a domain
    enrol automatically in a trust domain. Once they share a common trust anchor they
    can secure communications between themselves, following a domain policy which
    is by default secure. The focus of this proposal is the network itself, with all
    protocols between network elements, including control plane protocols (e.g., routing
    protocols) and management plane protocols (e.g., SSH, netconf, etc). The proposal
    is evolutionary and allows a smooth migration from today's Internet technology,
    device by device.</p>"
