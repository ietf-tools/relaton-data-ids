abstract:
- content: "<p>Network survivability is the network's ability to restore traffic following
    failure or attack; it plays a critical factor in the delivery of reliable services
    in transport networks. Guaranteed services in the form of Service Level Agreements
    (SLAs) require a resilient network that detects facility or node failures very
    rapidly, and immediately starts to restore network operations in accordance with
    the terms of the SLA. The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP)
    is a packet transport technology that combines the packet experience of MPLS with
    the operational experience of transport networks like SONET/SDH. It provides survivability
    mechanisms such as protection and restoration, with similar function levels to
    those found in established transport networks such as in SONET/SDH networks. Some
    of the MPLS-TP survivability mechanisms are data plane-driven and are based on
    MPLS-TP OAM fault management functions which are used to trigger protection switching
    in the absence of a control plane. Other survivability mechanisms utilize the
    MPLS-TP control plane. This document provides a framework for MPLS-TP survivability.</p>"
