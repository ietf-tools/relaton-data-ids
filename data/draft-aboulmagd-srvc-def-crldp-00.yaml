abstract:
- content: "<p>Label-distribution protocol (LDP) is defined in [1] for the distribution
    of labels inside one MPLS domain. CR-LDP is defined in [2] to work in conjunction
    with the LDP for establishing label switched paths with prescribed QoS requirements.
    The establishment of those paths is called constraint-based routing (CR) and it
    offers the opportunity to extend the information used to setup paths beyond what
    is available for the routing protocol. To facilitate the establishment of CR paths,
    the CR-LDP specification include the essential entries (TLVs) to allow the characterization
    of the traffic requirements and service expectations. The objectives of this draft
    are to establish a general framework for service definition using the mechanisms
    specified in [2] and to illustrate how service interworking could be achieved
    between an MPLS domain using CR-LDP and other domains that might employ similar
    or different networking technologies.</p>"
