abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC4895 if approved. This document describes
    a new chunk type, several parameters, and procedures for the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP). This new chunk type can be used to authenticate SCTP chunks by
    using shared keys between the sender and receiver. The new parameters are used
    to establish the shared keys. This document describes the limitations with the
    current SCTP AUTH RFC4895 and thus enhances the document to resolve such ambiguities
    and thus strengthen the overall AUTH procedure.</p>"
