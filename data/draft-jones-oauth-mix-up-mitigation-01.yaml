abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines an extension to The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
    Framework that enables the authorization server to dynamically provide the client
    using it with additional information about the current protocol interaction that
    can be validated by the client and that enables the client to dynamically provide
    the authorization server with additional information about the current protocol
    interaction that can be validated by the authorization server. This additional
    information can be used by the client and the authorization server to prevent
    classes of attacks in which the client might otherwise be tricked into using inconsistent
    sets of metadata from multiple authorization servers, including potentially using
    a token endpoint that does not belong to the same authorization server as the
    authorization endpoint used. Recent research publications refer to these as "IdP
    Mix-Up" and "Malicious Endpoint" attacks.</p>
