- content: "<p>With the wide deployment of 4G and beyond mobile networks, a great
    number of cells need high precision frequency and/or time synchronization for
    their normal operation. It is crucial to manage the synchronization network in
    a scalable way and simplify the monitoring and operation for synchronization networks.
    This document analyzes the use cases and requirements in synchronization networks,
    and provides a problem statement for scalable synchronization networks.</p>"
