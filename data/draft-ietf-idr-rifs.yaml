abstract:
- content: "<p>Under certain circumstances[4, 5] it is desirable for an entity that
    participates in inter-domain routing (either via BGP or IDRP) to specify the routing
    information it wishes to receive from its peer. This document proposes a mechanism
    that provides this functionality. Unless stated otherwise, for the rest of the
    document we do not distinguish between a BGP and an IDRP speaker.</p>"
