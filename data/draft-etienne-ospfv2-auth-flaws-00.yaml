abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is the Interior Gateway Protocol currently supported by the IETF
    and is widely deployed across the internet. The current strongest authentication
    method for OSPFv2 is the cryptographic authentication (RFC2328.D [4]) which uses
    shared secret key to authenticate the packets. This memo explains the different
    security flaws we found in the anti-replay and the MACs calculation. The second
    part presents practical exploitations of these weaknesses: an attacker directly
    connected to a link, can (i) replay LSAs, (ii) break neighborhood and (iii) flap
    routes.</p>"
