abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies architectural guidelines for dynamically stacking
    and routing SCHC processes in constrained networks. It details how independent
    SCHC modules can be composed into processing chains that adapt to PDU attributes.
    For instance, SCHC Compression may trigger SCHC Fragmentation when the compressed
    PDU exceeds the L2 MTU, or alternatively, trigger SCHC Aggregation. For traffic
    that is not delay tolerant, a direct routing from SCHC Compression to SCHC Reliability
    Fragmentation is provided. Subsequent processing by SCHC FEC Fragmentation modules
    ensures robust error correction. This modular approach promotes scalability and
    flexibility within the SCHC framework.</p>"
