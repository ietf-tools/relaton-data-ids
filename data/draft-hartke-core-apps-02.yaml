abstract:
- content: "<p>The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications consist of
    reusable, self-descriptive components such as Internet media types and link relation
    types. This document defines a template that application designers can use to
    describe their application's interface in a structured way so that other parties
    can develop interoperable clients and servers or reuse the components in their
    own applications. Note to Readers This Internet-Draft should be discussed on the
    Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) mailing list &lt;t2trg@irtf.org&gt;.</p>"
