    documents grant the community "incoming" rights for copying and using the text.
    It also specifies the "outgoing" rights the community grants to readers and users
    of those documents, and it requests that the IETF Trust manage the outgoing rights
    to effect this result. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
