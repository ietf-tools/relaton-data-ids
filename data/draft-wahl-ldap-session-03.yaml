abstract:
- content: "<p>Many network devices, application servers, and middleware components
    of a enterprise software infrastructure generate some form of session tracking
    identifiers, which are useful when analyzing activity and accounting logs to group
    activity relating to a particular session. This document discusses how Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAP) clients can include session tracking
    identifiers with their LDAP requests. This information is provided through controls
    in the requests the clients send to LDAP servers. The LDAP server receiving these
    controls can include the session tracking identifiers in the log messages it writes,
    enabling LDAP requests in the LDAP server's logs to be correlated with activity
    in logs of other components in the infrastructure. The control also enables session
    tracking information to be generated by LDAP servers and returned to clients and
    other servers. Three formats of session tracking identifiers are defined in this
    document.</p>"
