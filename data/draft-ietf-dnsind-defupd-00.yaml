abstract:
- content: "<p>Not all applications that perform dynamic updates using the protocol
    specified in [UPDATE] want their updates applied immediately. A case in point
    is [DHCP], wherein the DHCP lease time should control the lifetime of associated
    DNS data even if the DHCP client or server is not available at the time the DHCP
    lease expires. The essence of this proposal is that DNS Dynamic Updates should
    be deferrable for some time delay period, after which they will be executed normally.
    Furthermore, RRs added or updated by a deferred update can have expiration times
    specified for them, as enforced by the automatic Dynamic Updates. Automatic serial
    number changes (as in [UPDATE]), dynamic zone slave notification (see [NOTIFY])
    and incremental zone transfer (see [IXFR]) will jointly see to it that the zone
    changes are propagated with expedience.</p>"
