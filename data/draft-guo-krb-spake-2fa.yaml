abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new two-factor authentication mechanism for
    the Kerberos SPAKE pre-authentication. The mechanism uses the time- based one-time
    password (TOTP) as a second factor, and combines it with the password factor in
    a more secure way, which can prevent attackers from both impersonating Kerberos
    clients and obtaining TGTs' session keys in case of any factor leakage.</p>"
