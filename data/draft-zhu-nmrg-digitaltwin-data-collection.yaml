abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Twin Network is a network system with Physical Network and
    Twin Network, which can be mapped interactively in real time. The construction
    of Digital Twin Network requires real-time data of Physical Network to update
    the state of Twin Network. However the existing method collects the full amount
    of data from the Physical Network for modeling, and does not consider the problems
    such as time-lag, insufficient storage resources, low computational efficiency
    and waste of bandwidth resources. This document introduces an efficient data collection,
    aggregation and correlation method in which the Twin Network sends instructions
    to the Physical Network to collect data on demand, and then the Physical Network
    completes instructions such as knowledge representation, Telemetry Streaming Element
    of Physical Network completes data aggregation and correlation. Finally Telemetry
    Streaming Element sends the processed data to the Twin Network.</p>"
