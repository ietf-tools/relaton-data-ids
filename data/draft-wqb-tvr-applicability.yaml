abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides an applicability statement on how the Time- Variant
    Routing (TVR) data model may be used for scheduling in specific time variant network
    cases, to meet the requirements of a set of representative use cases described
    in the "TVR (Time-Variant Routing) Requirements" (I-D.ietf-tvr-requirements).
    It also presents a framework that elucidates various scheduling scenarios and
    identifies the entities involved in requesting scheduled changes of network resources.</p>
