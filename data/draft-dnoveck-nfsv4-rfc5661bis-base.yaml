abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor
    version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor
    version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.
    The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0,
    and is considered a separate protocol. This document obsoletes RFC 5661. It substantially
    revises the treatment of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding
    the description of those features appearing in RFC 5661. The content of this document
    reflects that of RFC8881, presented in the form of an I-D. This is intended to
    provide a helpful point of comparision for drafts leading to an eventual rfc5661bis
    document suite. This document can serve as a baseline to enable use of rfcdiff
    when reviewing such drafts.</p>"
