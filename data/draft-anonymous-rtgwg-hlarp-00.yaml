abstract:
- content: "<p>This internet-draft describes a protocol with an addressing scheme
    where members of the internet are addressed by their physical addresses and by
    an implementing internet router that can contact them. The packets sent by the
    protocol include handshake messages, client data, and the status of the data being
    sent. A routing procedure is suggested according to special addresses that carry
    information about the region of a router.</p>"
