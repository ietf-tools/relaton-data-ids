abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexi-grid networks overcomes the fixed grid channel of Wavelength
    Switched Optical Network(WSON) by flexible spectrum to allow non- uniform and
    dynamic allocation of spectrum based on the demand of the incoming services' LSP.
    Flexi-grid networks is an effective solution to solve the problem of efficient
    spectrum utilization. Because the client LSP needs to be assigned contiguous spectrum
    in flexi-grid networks, there will be two problems that would affect spectrum
    utilization, i.e. RSA and fragmentation. We introduce two kinds of methods which
    can improve the spectrum utilization further, and some related PCEP extensions
    are defined in this document.</p>"
