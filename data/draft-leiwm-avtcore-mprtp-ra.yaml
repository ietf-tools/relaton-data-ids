abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the framework of multipath transmission of real-time
    media based on relay. The framework allows participants to use multiple paths,including
    the default IP path and relay paths, to transport media in a RTP session. A relay
    path may via one or more RTP relay nodes which provide relay services for media
    data. This framework describes function blocks and behaviors of MPRTP-RA-capable
    RTP agent and RTP relay. The framework also defines multipath transport protocol
    by extending RTP, and relay control protocol named OpenPath.</p>"
