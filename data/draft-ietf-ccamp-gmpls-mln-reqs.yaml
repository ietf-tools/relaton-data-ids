abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the initial efforts to utilize Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have
    been related to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability.
    The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen
    in classical IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching
    technologies, GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi-layered
    network of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies.
    In GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple
    switching types is referred to in this document as a multi-region network (MRN).
    When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either single
    or multiple regions, this document uses the term multi-layer network (MLN). This
    document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region / multi-layer networks
    and lists a set of functional requirements. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
