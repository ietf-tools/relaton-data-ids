abstract:
- content: "<p>The datagram exchanged between two Internet endpoints have to go through
    a series of physical and virtual links that may have different limits on the upper
    size of the datagram they can transmit without fragmentation. Because fragmentation
    is considered harmful, most transports and protocols are designed with a mechanism
    that permits dynamic measurement of the maximum size of a datagram. This mechanism
    is called Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (PLPMTUD). But the UDP transport
    and some of the protocols that use UDP were designed without that feature. The
    Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Usage described in this document permits
    retrofitting an existing UDP-based protocol with such a feature. Similarly, a
    new UDP-based protocol could simply reuse the mechanism described in this document.</p>"
