abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet transport infrastructure is moving towards a model of
    high-speed routers interconnected by optical core networks. A consensus is emerging
    in the industry on utilizing IP-centric protocols for the optical control plane
    [9, 10], as well as for dynamic bandwidth provisioning for IP services. Also,
    there has recently been significant activity in defining models for IP transport
    over optical networks, specifically, the routing and signaling aspects [2,6,7].
    This draft attempts to define a framework for IP over Optical networks, considering
    both the IP control plane for optical networks as well as IP transport over optical
    networks (together referred to as 'IP over optical networks'). Within this framework,
    we develop a common set of terms and concepts which allows to discuss these IP
    over optical technologies in a consistent fashion. Additionally, this draft surveys
    some architectural frameworks that might be useful and appropriate for the deployment
    of IP over hybrid optical networks that contain IP routers, WDM multiplexers,
    and optical cross-connects (OXCs). This document is complementary to the framework
    of Multiprotocol Lambda Switching proposed in [2].</p>"
