abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client
    running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in
    to communications from that code. The security model used for this is the origin-based
    security model commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening
    handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this
    technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need
    two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP
    connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).
