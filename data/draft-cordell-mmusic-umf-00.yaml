abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of methods and tools are available for defining the format
    of messages used for signalling protocols. However, many of these methods and
    tools have been designed for purposes other than message definition, and have
    been adopted on the basis that they are readily available rather than being ideally
    suited to the task. This often means that the methods make it difficult to get
    definitions correct, or result in unnecessary verbosity both in the definition
    and on the wire. UMF - the Universal Message Format - has been custom designed
    for the purpose of message definition. It is thus easy to specify messages in
    a compact, extensible format that is readily machine manipulated to produce a
    compact encoding on the wire.</p>"
