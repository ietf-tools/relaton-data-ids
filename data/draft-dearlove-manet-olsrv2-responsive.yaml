abstract:
- content: <p>This specification describes an optional Topology Control (TC) message
    that can be sent by an OLSRv2 router. This is permitted, but not suggested, by
    the existing protocol, but is here recommended for use in some networks. The original
    motivation for this message came from the circumstances of a mostly stable network,
    in the most extreme case updated only by messages responding to the arrival and
    departure of routers, in which case the additional TC message is not just recommended
    but required. However, the additional message could be useful in reducing the
    routing convergence time in any network in which messages are sent at lengthy
    intervals. This specification updates RFC 7181 "The Optimized Link State Routing
    Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)".</p>
