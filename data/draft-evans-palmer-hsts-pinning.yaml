abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes an extension to the HTTP Strict Transport Security
    specification allowing web host operators to instruct UAs to remember ("pin")
    hosts' cryptographic identities for a given period of time. During that time,
    UAs will require that the host present a certificate chain including at least
    one public key whose fingerprint matches one or more of the pinned fingerprints
    for that host. By effectively reducing the scope of authorities who can authenticate
    the domain during the lifetime of the pin, we hope pinning reduces the incidence
    of man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised Certification Authorities and
    other authentication errors and attacks.</p>
