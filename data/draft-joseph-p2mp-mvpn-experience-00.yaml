abstract:
- content: <p>Multicast based VPNs have been deployed for a while now, based on the
    Draft Rosen solution. In today's scenario, network deployments are moving towards
    a choice Label Switched Multicast, primarily to garner some of the advantages
    that a Label Switched Network can offer. In short, the requirement is to achieve
    more optimal multicast replication and in other words achieve better and effective
    bandwidth savings. This document describes some of the experiences gained from
    the implementation and deployment of Label Switched multicast using the RSVP-TE
    P2MP Label Switched Path approach, and such is information only. The intent is
    to translate the experiences gained into valuable practices for the Service Provider
    and Enterprise community who intend to deploy this class of mVPNs. Information
    based on "Hierarchical Multicast Trees" and "Aggregated P Tunnels" have not been
    included, and will follow in the next version of this draft.</p>
