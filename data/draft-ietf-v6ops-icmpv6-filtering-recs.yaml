abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks supporting IPv6, the Internet Control Message Protocol
    version 6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of functions,
    and a correspondingly large number of message types and options. ICMPv6 is essential
    to the functioning of IPv6, but there are a number of security risks associated
    with uncontrolled forwarding of ICMPv6 messages. Filtering strategies designed
    for the corresponding protocol, ICMP, in IPv4 networks are not directly applicable,
    because these strategies are intended to accommodate a useful auxiliary protocol
    that may not be required for correct functioning. This document provides some
    recommendations for ICMPv6 firewall filter configuration that will allow propagation
    of ICMPv6 messages that are needed to maintain the functioning of the network
    but drop messages that are potential security risks. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
