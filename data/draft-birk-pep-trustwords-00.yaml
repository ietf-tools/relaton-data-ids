abstract:
- content: "<p>In public-key cryptography comparing the public keys' fingerprints
    of the communication partners involved is vital to ensure that there is no man-in-the-middle
    (MITM) attack on the communication channel. Fingerprints normally consist of a
    chain of hexadecimal chars. However, comparing hexadecimal strings is often impractical
    for regular users and prone to misunderstandings. To mitigate these challenges,
    this memo proposes the comparision of trustwords as opposed to hexadecimal strings.
    Trustwords are common words in a natural language (e.g., English) to which the
    hexidecimal strings are mapped to. This makes the verification process more natural.</p>"
