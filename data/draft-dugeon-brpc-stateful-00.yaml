abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced
    a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element as a
    tool to help MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels and Segment Routing paths placement. This
    also include the ability to compute inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing path
    following a distributed or hierarchical approach. In complement to the original
    stateless mode, a stateful mode has been added. In particular, the new PCInitiate
    message allows a PCE to directly ask a PCC to setup an MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels
    or a Segment Routing path. However, once computed, the inter-domain LSPs or Segment
    Routing path are hard to setup in the underlying network. Especially, in operational
    network, RSVP-TE signaling is not enable between BGP border routers. But, such
    RSVP- TE signaling is mandatory to setup contiguous LSP tunnels or to stitch or
    nest independent LSP tunnels to form the end-to-end inter- domain LSP tunnels.
    This draft propose to combine a Backward Recursive method with PCInitiate message
    to setup independent LSP tunnels per domain and stitch or nest the different LSP
    tunnels to setup end-to-end inter-domain LSP tunnels without the need of inter-
    domain signaling between BGP border routers. A new Stitching Label definition
    and new LSP-TYPE code points are proposed for that purpose.</p>"
