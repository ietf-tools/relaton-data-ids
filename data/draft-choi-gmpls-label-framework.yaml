abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends the MPLS
    control plane to encompass packet switching, time-division, lambda and fiber switching.
    The new forms of label which used in GMPLS to deal with the widening scope of
    MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred to as a 'Generalized
    Label'. In this draft for extending MPLS label specification [5], we describe
    the concept and characteristics of Generalized Label for GMPLS. We also discuss
    the format and considerations for label encoding. Particularly we present the
    necessity of mapping rule at ingress and egress switching interface where data
    flows with label of a different granularity are merged into the aggregated data
    flow of large bandwidth.</p>"
