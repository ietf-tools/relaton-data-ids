abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for multihoming support in application
    layer. We extend the basic socket API(Application Programming Interface) and propose
    some new interfaces for multihoming. Multihoming nodes are expected to have multiple
    addresses. The existing socket APIs, however, are not designed to manipulate multiple
    addresses in a connection. Proposed APIs help an application to handle multiple
    addresses, to avoid connection failure and to do load-balancing possibly. Right
    now, the proposed APIs are for LIN6 nodes, one of the mobile protocols. This is
    because LIN6's addressing architecture, which is called '8+8', is very friendly
    and consistent with multihoming. In this document, we propose a host- based multihoming
    solution and which is called end-to-end multihoming. In end-to-end multihoming,
    a fault-tolerant connection can be achieved relying not on routers but on the
    pair of end-nodes only.</p>"
