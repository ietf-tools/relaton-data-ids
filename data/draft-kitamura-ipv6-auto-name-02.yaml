abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses notion and actual mechanisms of "Corresponding
    Auto Names" for IPv6 Addresses. With this mechanism, all IPv6 addresses (even
    if they are link-local scoped addresses) can obtain their own Names, and it will
    be able to use Names anywhere instead of IPv6 Addresses. IPv6 address is too long
    and complicated to remember, and it is very nuisance to type a literal IPv6 address
    manually as an argument of applications. Also, it is very difficult for human
    beings to tell which IPv6 address is set to which actual IPv6 node. In this sense,
    literal IPv6 address information can be called meaningless information for human
    beings. In order to solve above problems and to provide annotated meaningful information
    to IPv6 addresses, mechanisms called Corresponding Auto Names for IPv6 addresses
    is introduced. They will become human friendly information. By applying a simple
    naming rule to the Auto Names (e.g., use the same Auto Name Suffix for IPv6 addresses
    that are set to the same interface (node)), this will contribute to help people
    to understand which IPv6 address / Name indicates which actual IPv6 node and provide
    meaningful information.</p>
