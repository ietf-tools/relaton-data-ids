abstract:
- content: "<p>This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a state where
    RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI Validation will use
    the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) [RFC8182] as the only mandatory to implement
    access protocol. In short this plan consists of the following phases. In phase
    0, today's deployment, RRDP is supported by most, but not all Repositories, and
    most but not all RP software. In the proposed phase 1 RRDP will become mandatory
    to implement for Repositories, in addition to rsync. This phase can start as soon
    as this document is published. Once the proposed updates are implemented by all
    Repositories phase 2 will start. In this phase RRDP will become mandatory to implement
    for all RP software, and rsync must no longer be used. Measurements will need
    to be done to help determine when it will be safe to transition to the final phase
    of this plan. During this phase Repositories will no longer be required to provide
    rsync access for RPKI validation purposes. However, they may still provide rsync
    access for direct access to files for other purposes, if desired, at a best effort
    basis. Although this document currently includes descriptions and updates to RFCs
    for each of these phases, we may find that it will be beneficial to have separate
    documents for the plan, and each phase, so that it might be more clear to all
    when the updates to RFCs take effect.</p>"
