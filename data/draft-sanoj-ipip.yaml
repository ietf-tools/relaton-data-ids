- content: "<p>With an exponential increase in the number of devices being connected
    to the internet, it is clear that the available address range of 2^128 in IPv6
    Protocol would not be sufficient to identify and exchange information with all
    the devices in the universe. This document describes how Internet Protocol addressing
    standards can be further enhanced to accommodate a wider scale of network devices.</p>"
