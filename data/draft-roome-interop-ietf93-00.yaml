abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such
    information to applications that need to choose one or more endpoints to connect
    to among large sets of logically equivalent ones. This document defines a data
    set that may be used to test the functionality and interoperability of ALTO clients
    and servers.</p>"
