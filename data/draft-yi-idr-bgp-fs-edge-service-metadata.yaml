abstract:
- content: "<p>In edge computing, a service may be deployed on multiple instances
    within one or more sites, called edge service. The edge service is associated
    with an ANYCAST IP address. Its routes along with service metadata can be collected
    by a central controller. The controller may process the metadata and distribute
    the result to ingress routers using BGP FlowSpec. The service metadata can be
    used by ingress routers to make path selections not only based on the routing
    cost but also on the running environment of the edge services. This document describes
    a mechanism to distribute the information of the service routes and related service
    metadata using BGP FlowSpec.</p>"
