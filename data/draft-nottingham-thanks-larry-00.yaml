abstract:
- content: <p>[RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was
    abused; one such abuse was the definition of the application-specific 418 (I'm
    a Teapot) status code. In the intervening years, this status code has been widely
    implemented as an "easter egg", and therefore is effectively consumed by this
    use. This document changes 418 to the status of "Reserved" in the IANA HTTP Status
    Code registry to reflect that.</p>
