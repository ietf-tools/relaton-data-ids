abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) are often envisaged to also be
    on the media path, rather than just intercepting signalling. This means that B2BUAs
    often implement an RTP/RTCP stack as well, whether to act as media transcoders
    or to just passthrough the media themselves, thus leading to separate media legs
    that the B2BUA correlates and bridges together. If not disciplined, though, this
    behaviour can severely impact the communication experience, especially when statistics
    and feedback information contained in RTCP packets get lost because of mismatches
    in the reported data. This document defines the proper behaviour B2BUAs should
    follow when also acting on the media plane in order to preserve the end-to-end
    functionality of RTCP.</p>"
