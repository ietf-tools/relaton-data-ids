abstract:
- content: "<p>This document first analyzes the critical issues of bottlenecks in
    existing tunneling and translation technologies, which can be solved by proper
    load balancing mechanisms(e,g., scalability, availability, and single point of
    failure). Then, several key factors in designing a valid load balancing mechanism
    are described. Solutions to specific load balancing requirements can be drawn
    out by considering these factors. At last, current efforts about load balancing
    are introduced.</p>"
