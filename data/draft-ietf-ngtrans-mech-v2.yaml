abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies IPv4 compatibility mechanisms that can be implemented
    by IPv6 hosts and routers. These mechanisms include providing complete implementations
    of both versions of the Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), and tunneling IPv6
    packets over IPv4 routing infrastructures. They are designed to allow IPv6 nodes
    to maintain complete compatibility with IPv4, which should greatly simplify the
    deployment of IPv6 in the Internet, and facilitate the eventual transition of
    the entire Internet to IPv6.</p>"
