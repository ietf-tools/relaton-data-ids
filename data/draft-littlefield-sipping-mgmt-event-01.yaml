abstract:
- content: <p>In many environments, firewall, NAT and IP addressing issues make remote
    management of devices containing SIP user agents difficult. This document defines
    a SIP event package for notifying a user agent that it should initiate a session
    with a management entity for management operations. This type of "call-home" management
    avoids the need to maintain persistent TCP connections, or generate additional
    STUN traffic, with the management entity. This event package is intended not to
    tunnel management protocols or otherwise provide management itself, but instead
    to provide a means for signaling a SIP UA that a management session is desired.</p>
