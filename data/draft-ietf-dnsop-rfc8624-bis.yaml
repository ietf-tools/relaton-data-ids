abstract:
- content: "<p>&lt;EDITOR NOTE: This document does not change the status (MUST, MAY,
    RECOMMENDED, etc) of any of the algorithms listed in [RFC8624]; that is the work
    of future documents. Instead, this document moves the canonical list of algorithms
    from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry. This is done for two reasons: 1) to allow
    the list to be updated more easily, and, much more importantly, 2) to allow the
    list to be more easily referenced.&gt; The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various
    cryptographic algorithms to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence.
    To ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers,
    it is necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements
    and usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations
    support. This document updates RFC8624 by moving the canonical source of algorithm
    implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC from [RFC8624] to an
    IANA registry. Future extensions to this registry can be made under new, incremental
    update RFCs.</p>"
