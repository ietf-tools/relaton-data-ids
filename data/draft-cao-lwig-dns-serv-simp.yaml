abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses a lightweight service simplification method via
    DNS. Instead of storing the information on the Web infrastructure, the service
    provider can store them on the DNS servers. By expressing these information in
    the DNS Resource Records, the requester can get these information directly during
    the DNS name resolution, without the need of accessing any web resource. This
    way eliminates the overhead caused by TCP handshake and HTTP get/ response, and
    can be served as a lightweight information provisioning method.</p>"
