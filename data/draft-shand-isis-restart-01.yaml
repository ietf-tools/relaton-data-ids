abstract:
- content: "<p>The IS-IS routing protocol (RFC 1142 [2], ISO/IEC 10589 [3]) is a link
    state intra-domain routing protocol. Normally, when an IS-IS router is re-started,
    the neighboring routers detect the restart event and cycle their adjacencies with
    the restarting router through the down state. This is necessary in order to invoke
    the protocol mechanisms to ensure correct re-synchronization of the LSP database.
    However, the cycling of the adjacency state causes the neighbors to regenerate
    their LSPs describing the adjacency concerned. This in turn causes temporary disruption
    of routes passing through the restarting router.</p>"
