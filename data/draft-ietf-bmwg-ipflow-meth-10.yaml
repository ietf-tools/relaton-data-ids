abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a methodology and framework for quantifying the
    performance impact of the monitoring of IP flows on a network device and the export
    of this information to a Collector. It identifies the rate at which the IP flows
    are created, expired, and successfully exported as a new performance metric in
    combination with traditional throughput. The metric is only applicable to the
    devices compliant with RFC 5470, "Architecture for IP Flow Information Export".
    The methodology quantifies the impact of the IP flow monitoring process on the
    network equipment. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>
