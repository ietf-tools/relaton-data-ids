abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Virtual Presence Protocol (VPP) protocol is to enable
    the exchange of document based virtual presence information. Virtual presence
    information is the foundation for virtual neighborhood services which provide
    users with information about virtual neighbors, i.e. other users who are close
    within the virtual document space. VPP enables the creation of dynamic vicinities
    based on hypertext references. It is not meant to replace or supersede presence
    notification protocols, but it augments online presence with location information.
    The protocol described in this document is based on 2 years of experience with
    location based virtual presence and presence notification. The purpose of presence
    notification protocols such as the drafted [RVP] is to tell whether another individual
    is online or arrives online, etc. As opposed to such real online presence, the
    presence on documents in the World Wide Web is a virtual one. The authors recognize
    that VPP shares methods, mechanisms, and formats with HTTP, and drafted presence
    notification protocols (e.g. RVP, IMPP), however the functionality is significantly
    different. Changes since draft-wolf-vpp-00.txt: Added event types, IANA assigned
    port 677, extended service URL lookup to simplify VPP hosting, added SELECT update
    method, adapted to latest XML name space spec, maxdata and more-tag.</p>"
