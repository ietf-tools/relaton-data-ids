abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by
    Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over
    a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant
    security concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of
    a challenge response authentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately,
    the HTTP Digest challenge response mechanism presently on the standards track
    failed widespread deployment, and have had success only in limited use. This specification
    describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge
    Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses the security concerns
    and meets the deployability requirements. When used in combination with TLS or
    an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could improve the status-quo
    for application protocol authentication.</p>"
