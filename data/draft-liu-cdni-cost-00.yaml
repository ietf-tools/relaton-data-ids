abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several potential price and charge issues in
    CDN interconnection. It discusses some optional charge models when CDNs are interconnected
    and presents a need from Content Service Providers (CSP) or CDNs to optimize their
    cost locally and guarantee their performance. It finally shows how can CDNI frameworks
    and protocols support price, charge and policy information exchanging.</p>"
