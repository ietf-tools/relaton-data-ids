abstract:
- content: "<p>As emerging real-time services on the Internet, such as Voice over
    IP (VoIP), increase their visibility, a security framework has to be provided.
    In particular, confidentiality is a main concern in the multimedia scenario. To
    support full flexibility of the services, a solution with IP all the way (to the
    terminal) is believed to offer advantages, if technically and economically feasible.
    Therefore, new requirements have to be met on cellular access networks, and this
    has an impact on the security solutions.</p>"
