abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights considerations,
    similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973].
    This is achieved by providing a proposal for a vocabulary to discuss the relation
    between human rights and Internet protocols, an overview of the discussion in
    technical and academic literature and communities, a proposal for the mapping
    of the relation between human rights and technical concepts, as well as guidelines.
    If you want to see how to apply this work to your own, you can directly go to
    Section 6. The rest of the document explains the background of the guidelines
    and how they were developed. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes. This document is a
    product of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). The IRTF publishes the results
    of Internet-related research and development activities. This documents aims to
    be a consensus document of the Human Rights Protocol Consideration Research Group
    of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org
