abstract:
- content: "<p>The interior gateway routing protocols Open Shortest Path First version
    2 (OSPFv2) [RFC2328], Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [ISO]
    [RFC1195] and Routing Information Protocol (RIP) [RFC2453] currently define Clear
    Text and Message Digest 5 (MD5) [RFC1321] algorithms for authenticating their
    protocol packets. There have recently been documents adding support of the Secure
    Hash Algorithm (SHA) family of hash functions for authenticating routing protocol
    packets for RIP [RFC4822], IS-IS [ISIS-HMAC] and OSPF [OSPF- HMAC]. To ensure
    interoperability between disparate implementations, it is imperative that we specify
    a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms thereby ensuring that there is at least
    one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document defines
    the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to be used for the cryptographic
    authentication of these routing protocols as well as specifying the algorithms
    that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future
    time.</p>"
