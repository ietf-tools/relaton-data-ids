abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
    of selecting paths through a traffic engineering (TE) network. These paths may
    be supplied in response to requests for computation or may be unsolicited requests
    issued by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication
    Protocol (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may
    be categorized and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC 8955 defines the
    Flow Specification and describes how Flow Specification components are used to
    describe traffic flows. RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed
    in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. This document
    specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications.
    This allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that
    it is aware of. The extensions defined in this document include the creation,
    update, and withdrawal of Flow Specifications via PCEP and can be applied to tunnels
    initiated by the PCE or to tunnels where control is delegated to the PCE by the
    Path Computation Client (PCC). Furthermore, a PCC requesting a new path can include
    Flow Specifications in the request to indicate the purpose of the tunnel allowing
    the PCE to factor this into the path computation.</p>
