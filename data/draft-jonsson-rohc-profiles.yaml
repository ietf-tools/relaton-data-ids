abstract:
- content: "<p>The RObust Header Compression WG (ROHC) is developing compression schemes
    initially for IP/UDP/RTP header compression [ROHC]. The group is also chartered
    to develop compression for IP/TCP and after re- chartering it is possible (probable)
    that also compression of other protocols will follow. Compression and decompression
    must always follow well defined rules but there exist a number of variables that
    will affect details in the way compression should be carried out and how these
    rules are set. The purpose of this document is to identify such variables and
    outline a way to make ROHC both adaptable to various conditions and possible to
    extend for future needs.</p>"
