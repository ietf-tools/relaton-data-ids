abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM [RFC6376] is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to
    sign and authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of messages
    during transit. In particular this enables DKIM to be able authenticate email
    through email forwarding. Section 8.6 of [RFC6376] defines a vulnerability called
    DKIM Replay as a spam message sent through a SMTP MTA DKIM signer, that then is
    sent to many more recipients, leveraging the reputation of the signer. This document
    defines the damage this causes to email delivery and interoperability, and the
    impacted mail flows. Part of the reason why this is such a difficult problem is
    that receivers have a hard time differentiating between legitimate forwarding
    flows and DKIM replay.</p>"
