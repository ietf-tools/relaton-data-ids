abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security mechanisms
    in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or transport layer. In
    the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax has provided a binary secure object
    format based on ASN.1. Over time, the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1
    has been overtaken by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object Notation.
    This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a secure object
    format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation, drawn from a variety of application
    security mechanisms currently in development.</p>"
