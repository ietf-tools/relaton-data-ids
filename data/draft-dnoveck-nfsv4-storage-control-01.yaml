abstract:
- content: "<p>Developments in storage systems have made it important for applications
    to have control over the characteristics of the storage that will be used for
    their particular files. The development of pNFS has added to the usefulness of
    such control mechanisms as it has created the opportunity for the hierarchical
    organization of file names to be separated from the control of storage characteristics
    for individual files, including the assignment to storage locations to reflect
    the performance or other needs of those specific files. This document proposes
    extensions to NFS version 4 to allow storage requirements to be communicated to
    the NFS version 4 server.</p>"
