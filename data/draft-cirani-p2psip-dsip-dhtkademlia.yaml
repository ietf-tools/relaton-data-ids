abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a Kademlia-based protocol for Resource Lookup
    in P2PSIP. The proposed protocol is based on dSIP, a SIP-based protocol proposed
    by other authors as generic framework for a distributed SIP Location Service.
    Although the dSIP authors have obsoleted the draft by a newer approach based on
    a binary protocol named RELOAD, we are still considering this SIP-based approach,
    due to implementation simplicity, possibility of reuse of already available SIP
    stack implementations, easy integration into existing UAs, minimization of the
    number of required protocols for a P2P UA, and widespread support for (and relative
    maturity of) the SIP standard.</p>"
