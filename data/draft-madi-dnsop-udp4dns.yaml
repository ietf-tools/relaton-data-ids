abstract:
- content: "<p>The classic 512-bytes UDP payload for transporting DNS messages is
    an embedded dependence on IPv4. As the Internet infrastructure is evolving to
    IPv6, the very constraint stemming from IPv4 can be removed by the virtue of that
    IPv6 mandates a MTU of 1280 bytes. This document specifies a new minimum size
    of UDP packet to carry DNS message, making DNS implementations going forward more
    adaptive to both applications based on the Internet and infrastructures supporting
    the Internet.</p>"
