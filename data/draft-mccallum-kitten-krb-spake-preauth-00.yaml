abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new password authenticated key exchange based
    pre-authentication mechanism for performing Kerberos authentication. This mechanism
    has three goals. First, it makes Kerberos pre- authentication more resilient against
    time synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp.
    Second, it increases the security of the Kerberos pre-authentication exchange
    by making offline brute-force attacks impossible. Third, it enables the use of
    secure second factor authentication without FAST by utilizing the existing trust
    relationship established by the shared first factor.</p>"
