abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows a user to communicate
    with a local SIP proxy and registrar, primarily for registration services and
    the execution of certain features. Currently, SIP allows for discovery of these
    servers through multicast or through static configuration. In many cases, it may
    be more useful for a SIP client to discover local SIP servers based on features
    supported by those servers. In this document, an alternate technique is specified
    based on Service Location Protocol (SLP). The document contains a short description
    of how to use SLP for service discovery, and a SIP service type template. The
    service type template defines the attributes and service URL for a SIP server
    advertisement, suitable for SIP clients to discover.</p>"
