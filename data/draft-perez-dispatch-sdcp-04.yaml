abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes SDCP, a protocol to control multimedia streaming
    in cases where streaming generation should be distributed to improve performance.
    This is especially useful for Human-Things streams. Usually, real-time applications
    such as virtual reality generate a user-controlled multimedia streaming. This
    is a time- continuous data flux that could be divided spatially or temporally
    to distribute processing, memory or network resources. This protocol does not
    describe streaming communication, but the control of each single streaming generation
    in a best-effort by many nodes or things.</p>"
