abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the results of an ADD-PATH implementation survey.
    The survey had 22 questions about implementations' support for advertising multiple
    paths in BGP. After a brief summary of the results, each response is listed. This
    document contains responses from three implementers who completed the survey (Cumulus
    Networks, Cisco Systems and Exa Networks). The editor did not use external means
    to verify the accuracy of the information submitted by the respondents. The respondents
    are considered experts on the products they reported on.</p>"
