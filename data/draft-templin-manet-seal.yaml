- content: "<p>SEAL is related to problem spaces currently under investigation in
    the IRTF Routing Research Group, as well as the IETF INTAREA general area and
    IETF AUTOCONF and MANET working groups. SEAL addresses packet size issues for
    IP-in-IP tunnels, with improved duplicate packet detection as an additional benefit.
    This document is currently under construction as an individual submission, to
    be followed by determination of an appropriate working group (or remain as individual
    sub).</p>"
