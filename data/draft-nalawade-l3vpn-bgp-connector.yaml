abstract:
- content: "<p>In the case of BGP AFIs such as IPv6 unicast or VPNv4 unicast, it is
    possible for the data traffic intended for the NLRIs of that AFI/SAFI, to be forwarded
    over an underlying tunnel. The tunnel may be to a PE or to a Tunnel Concentrator
    or a Tunnel Broker. Both will be referred to as Tunnel endpoints. In this document
    an egress router refers to the egress point of the Tunnel and an ingress router
    refers to the ingress point of the tunnel. The discovery of the Tunnel endpoint
    and the corresponding tunnel encapsulation information may be done out of band,
    either by static configuration, or through a number of different mechanisms. There
    is a need to be able to indicate with the BGP update for a given NLRI, the Tunnel
    endpoint to be used for forwarding data traffic to that NLRI destination. This
    document defines a new BGP attribute called the 'Connector Attribute' which would
    convey the information about the Tunnel endpoint - the Tunnel Identifier, the
    Tunnel endpoint address.</p>"
