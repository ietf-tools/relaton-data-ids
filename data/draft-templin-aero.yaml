abstract:
- content: "<p>Nodes attached to common multi-access link types (e.g., multicast-
    capable, shared media, non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA), etc.) can exchange
    packets as neighbors on the link, but they may not always be provisioned with
    sufficient routing information for optimal neighbor selection. Such nodes should
    therefore be able to discover a trusted intermediate router on the link that provides
    both forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services
    to inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is closer to the final destination.
    This redirection can provide a useful route optimization, since the triangular
    path from the ingress link neighbor, to the intermediate router, and finally to
    the egress link neighbor may be considerably longer than the direct path from
    ingress to egress. However, ordinary redirection may lead to operational issues
    on certain link types and/or in certain deployment scenarios. This document therefore
    introduces an Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) capability that addresses
    the issues. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
