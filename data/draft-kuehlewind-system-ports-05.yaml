abstract:
- content: "<p>In the IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry,
    a large number of System Ports are currently assigned to individuals or companies
    who have registered the port for the use with a certain protocol before RFC6335
    was published. For some of these ports, RFCs exist that describe the respective
    protocol; for others, RFCs are under development that define, re-define, or assign
    the protocol used for the respective port, such as in case of so-far unused UDP
    ports that have been registered together with the respective TCP port. In these
    cases the IESG has the change control about the protocol used on the port (as
    described in the corresponding RFC) but change control for the port allocation
    iis designated to others. Under existing operational procedures, this means the
    original assignee needs to be involved in chnage to the port assignment. As it
    is not always possible to get in touch with the original assignee, particularly
    because of out-dated contact information, this current practice of handling historical
    allocation of System Ports does not scale well on a case-by-case basis. To address
    this, this document instructs IANA to perform actions with the goal to reassign
    System Ports to the IESG that were assigned to individuals prior to the publication
    of RFC6335, where appropriate.</p>"
