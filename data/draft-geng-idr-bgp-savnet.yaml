abstract:
- content: "<p>Many source address validation (SAV) mechanisms have been proposed
    for preventing source address spoofing. However, existing SAV mechanisms are faced
    with the problems of inaccurate validation or high operational overhead in some
    cases. This paper proposes BGP SAVNET by extending BGP protocol for SAV. This
    protocol can propagate SAV-related information through BGP messages. The propagated
    information will help routers automatically generate accurate SAV rules which
    are for checking the validity of data packets.</p>"
