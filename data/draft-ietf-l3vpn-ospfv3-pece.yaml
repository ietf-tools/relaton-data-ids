abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Service Providers (SPs) offer Virtual Private Network (VPN) services
    to their customers using a technique in which Customer Edge (CE) routers are routing
    peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used
    to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network,
    and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across
    the provider's backbone. Support currently exists for both IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs;
    however, only Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) as PE-CE protocol is
    specified. This document extends those specifications to support OSPF version
    3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing protocol. The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical
    to that of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
