abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of 'content peering' is to logically connect content-based
    networks together to allow content providers increased control of content presentation
    in remote networks and to receive detailed information on the utilization of their
    content. The Origin/Access Content Peering (OACP) implementation provides a scalable
    mechanism for content providers to originate this control and also to receive
    utilization data.</p>"
