abstract:
- content: "<p>DRKey is a pragmatic Internet-scale key-establishment system that allows
    any host to locally obtain a symmetric key to enable a remote service to perform
    source-address authentication, and enables first- packet authentication. The remote
    service can itself locally derive the same key with efficient cryptographic operations.
    DRKey was developed with path aware networks in mind, but it is also applicable
    to today's Internet. It can be incrementally deployed and it offers incentives
    to the parties using it independently of its dissemination in the network.</p>"
