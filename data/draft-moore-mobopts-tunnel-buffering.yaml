abstract:
- content: "<p>Tunnel Buffering (TB) is an interoperable enhancement to Mobile IPv6
    to reduce packet loss during movement, and to avoid retransmission when movement
    is complete. TB does this by 'pausing' the packets which are to be send over a
    MobileIPv6 or HMIPv6 tunnel until movement is complete.</p>"
