abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a format for security advisories. An advisory is
    a document describing a vulnerability of a program, an operating system or, more
    generally, a software or hardware component of the information system. This specification
    tries to minimize changes in issuer and readers current practices (messages style),
    and by trying to help a program re-read the advisory tries also to keep advisories
    easily and friendly readable by humans. It focuses on structure of documents.
    This specification is primarily useful for advisories issuers such as CSIRTs [RFC2350]
    and users and is linked with intrusion detection.</p>"
