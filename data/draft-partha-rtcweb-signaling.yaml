abstract:
- content: "<p>The standardization of Real time communication between browsers is
    to provide the infrastructure for audio, video, text communication using standard
    interface so that interoperable communication can be established between any compatible
    browsers. RTCWeb specific Javascript API will be provided by browsers for developing
    real-time web application. It is possible to develop signaling protocol like Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) or Jingle or websocket extension or custom-made signaling
    protocol in Javascript. There are lots of issues in Javascript based signaling
    protocol. This document list the need for standard signaling protocol between
    RTCWeb client (browser) and RTCWeb server and possible signaling protocol for
    the same.</p>"
