abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses semantics of communication with IPv6 addresses.
    This model introduces three address scope classes, node-local, site-local, and
    global, for both IPv6 unicast and multicast addresses. For a given packet, all
    addresses in the packet including those in the routing header must be in the same
    address scope class. Since the sockaddr_in6 address data structure is extended
    to be able to hold an interface index number, a kernel and applications can exchange
    interface information. A source address is uniquely determined with the destination
    address and the outgoing interface. This memo also clarifies packet processing
    mechanism for the input, forward, and output function.</p>"
