abstract:
- content: "<p>[Note: This draft is preliminary and is believed to contain errors
    and omissions.] This memo describes an RTP payload format (KS) which transports
    cryptographic key information for encrypted media streams. The media streams themselves
    are transported independently, and may or may not be carried by RTP. The KS payload
    format makes particular provision for media carried by SRTP [4]. The payload carried
    over KS contains the information necessary for seamlessly applying new decryption
    keys during an active session, by means of byte-granularity pointers referencing
    into the protected stream. The KS payload is based on CMS [2] and is scalable
    to a wide variety of streaming media</p>"
