abstract:
- content: "<p>Overlay applications, like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing and video
    streaming, attract a lot of users and generate a huge amount of data. Most overlay
    applications do not take into account the underlying network topology in their
    routing decisions and connection establishment in general. Due to this fact and
    the large amount of P2P traffic, overlay applications waste network resources,
    cause problems in network management, and result in high costs for ISPs, especially
    because of the expensive interconnection links between ISPs. Therefore, the objective
    of the ALTO Working Group Charter [ALTO-charter] is to design and specify an Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service that will assist P2P applications in their
    peer selection process in order to achieve a more efficient usage of network resources,
    to reduce operational costs of ISPs, and to increase the overlay application performance
    at the same time. This draft proposes a possible ALTO service that uses BGP routing
    information in order to calculate a rating value for peers providing a certain
    resource (resource providers). The service is operated by the ISP. Since BGP routing
    information is available in any ISP network and the service accesses the routing
    information from the local ISP network, the deployment of the service does not
    require changes in the network and the ALTO server can retrieve routing information
    automatically.</p>"
