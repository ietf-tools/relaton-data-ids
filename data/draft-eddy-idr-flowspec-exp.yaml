abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses new extensions beyond the existing BGP mechanisms
    that support mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The new
    extensions are focused on enabling an increase in collaborative inter-domain defenses
    involving multiple network providers, and enhancing the ability to describe desired
    filtering rules and actions. This document is primarily intended for discussion,
    and later on some ideas contained within it may be exported into other documents
    or specifications. In some cases, simple examples and proof-of-concept protocol
    mechanisms are described, but this document is not intended to become a standard
    or final protocol specification.</p>"
