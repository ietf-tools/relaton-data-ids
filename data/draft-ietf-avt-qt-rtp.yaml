abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the payload format for encapsulating QuickTime
    media streams in the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). This specification is
    intended for QuickTime media/codec types that are not already handled by other
    RTP payload specifications. Each QuickTime media track within a movie is sent
    over a separate RTP session and synchronized using standard RTP techniques. A
    static QuickTime payload type (if assigned) or a dynamic payload type may be used.
    A QuickTime header within the RTP payload is defined to carry the media type and
    other media specific information. A packetization scheme is defined for the media
    data. This specification is intended for streaming stored QuickTime movies as
    well as live QuickTime content.</p>"
