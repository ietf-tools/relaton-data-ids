abstract:
- content: "<p>At present, tunneling technology has been widely applied in VPN, mobile
    communication network, IPv6 over IPv4, Mobile IP, multi-point delivery, and other
    fields. In the E2E link, there may already have been an effective congestion control
    mechanism, but we SHOULD also do traffic management in the tunnel to improve the
    performance of the entire network. Because of the particularity of the scenario
    of the tunnel, the existing E2E traffic management mechanism cannot be directly
    be deployed (e.g. VPN, IPv6 over IPv4 etc). In these cases, this document focuses
    on how to expose the congestion while the feedback mechanism is left for later
    study. This document describes the problem of identifying congestion in a tunnel
    segment of an end-to-end flow. A basic tunnel congestion exposure model is then
    described, followed by three example scenarios which use the basic model to derive
    tunnel congestion. Finally, a general solution that can be applied to IP-in-IP
    tunnels is described.</p>"
