abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure anycast tunneling protocol (SATP) defines a protocol used
    for communication between any combination of unicast and anycast tunnel endpoints.
    It allows tunneling of every ETHER TYPE protocol (ethernet, ip ...). SATP directly
    includes cryptography and message authentication based on the methods used by
    the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol(SRTP) [1]. It can be used as an encrypted
    alternative to IP Encapsulation within IP [3] and Generic Routing Encapsulation
    (GRE) [4]. Both anycast receivers and senders are supported.</p>"
