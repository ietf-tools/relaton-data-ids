abstract:
- content: "<p>Private Information Queries (PIQ) is an Internet protocol that allows
    making a phone number query directly to the target cell phone. The target user
    can decide whether or not a phone number should be returned; in real-time and
    on a case-by-case basis. PIQ may also be used for bootstrapping IKEv2 (Internet
    Key Exchange). Along with a phone number, the querier can securely obtain a fixed
    IP address e.g., a Mobile IPv6 home address, exchange certificates and initiate
    IKEv2 with the target host.</p>"
