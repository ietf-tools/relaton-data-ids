abstract:
- content: "<p>Delegation information (i.e. the NS RRset, possible glue, possible
    DS records) should always be kept in sync between child zone and parent zone.
    However, in practice that is not always the case. When the delegation information
    is not in sync the child zone is usually working fine, but without the amount
    of redundancy that the zone owner likely expects to have. Hence, should any further
    problems ensue it could have catastropic consequences. The DNS name space has
    lived with this problem for decades and it never goes away. Or, rather, it will
    never go away until a fully automated mechanism for how to keep the information
    in sync automatically is deployed. This document proposes such a mechanism. TO
    BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt-via-
    ddns (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-dnsop-delegation-mgmt- via-ddns).
    The most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc, should all
    be available there. The author (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>"
