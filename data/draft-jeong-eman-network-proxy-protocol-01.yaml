abstract:
- content: "<p>In the current Internet, it is implicitly assumed that a network node
    is always active so that it can receive the incoming packets at any time. Current
    networking services and applications are commonly designed to be fully available
    at all times with minimal response times. This assumption keeps network nodes
    from entering sleeping mode in order to reduce energy consumption. Further, during
    sleeping mode, network nodes may not immediately respond to the incoming packets
    or even lose them. If network nodes are allowed to go into a sleeping mode, they
    can effectively reduce energy consumption during idle period. Network proxy allows
    to delegate network node's traffic processing to an external system within a network,
    so that the nodes maintain network presence during their sleep. This document
    describes communication mechanism between network nodes and proxy in order to
    accelerate the wider deployment of network proxy mechanism.</p>"
