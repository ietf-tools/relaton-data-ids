abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses mechanisms for dynamic establishment of bidirectional
    link layer connectivity of mobile nodes with unidirectional links in Mobile Ipv6
    (MIPv6) environment. Requirements are derived from the need to support services
    in mobile Ipv6 based on unidirectional technologies, for instance Digital Video
    Broadcasting, using multicast protocols, such as Protocol Independent Multicast
    Routing – Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLDv2).</p>"
