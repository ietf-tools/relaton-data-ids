abstract:
- content: "<p>The pace of research on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the last five
    years warrants a critical survey. P2P has the makings of a disruptive technology
    -- it can aggregate enormous storage and processing resources while minimizing
    entry and scaling costs. Failures are common amongst massive numbers of distributed
    peers, though the impact of individual failures may be less than in conventional
    architectures. Thus, the key to realizing P2P's potential in applications other
    than casual file sharing is robustness. P2P search methods are first couched within
    an overall P2P taxonomy. P2P indexes for simple key lookup are assessed, including
    those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de Bruijn graphs, and
    skip graphs. Similarly, P2P indexes for keyword lookup, information retrieval
    and data management are explored. Finally, early efforts to optimize range, multi-attribute,
    join, and aggregation queries over P2P indexes are reviewed. Insofar as they are
    available in the primary literature, robustness mechanisms and metrics are highlighted
    throughout. However, the low-level mechanisms that most affect robustness are
    not well isolated in the literature. Recommendations are given for future research.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
