abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is a targeted at the Macintosh Internet users to adopt the
    MacBinary II form of Macintosh file encoding for use on FTP sites as an alternative
    to BinHexing Macintosh files. The current standard file encoding method for Macintosh
    files placed on Internet FTP sites is BinHexing. The process converts binary data
    into a coded-text based format. While very popular and widely used this process
    increases the files size dramatically. For example a self-extracting archive that
    is 389,089 byte in size will swell to 535,944 bytes after being BinHexed. The
    resulting file is nearly 30% larger than its original version. This process is
    completely wasteful and totally unnecessary for FTP transfers.</p>"
