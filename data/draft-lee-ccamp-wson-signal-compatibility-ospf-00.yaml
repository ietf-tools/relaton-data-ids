abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to support signal
    compatibility constraints associated with WSON network elements. These routing
    enhancements are required in common optical or hybrid electro-optical networks
    where not all of the optical signals in the network are compatible with all network
    elements participating in the network. This compatibility constraint model is
    applicable to common optical or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches,
    regenerators, and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited to processing
    only certain types of WSON signals. Conventions used in this document The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</p>
