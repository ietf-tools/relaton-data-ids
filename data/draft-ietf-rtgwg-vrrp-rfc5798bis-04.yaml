abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol
    (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6. It is based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined
    in RFC 3768 and in "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6”, and obsoletes
    the prevision specification of this version documented in RFC 5798. VRRP specifies
    an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router
    to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP router controlling the IPv4 or IPv6
    address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the VRRP Active Router,
    and it forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. VRRP Active Routers
    are configured with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup Routers infer
    the address family of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the IP protocol
    version. Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6
    address families are independent of one another and always treated as separate
    virtual router instances. The election process provides dynamic failover in the
    forwarding responsibility should the Active Router become unavailable. For IPv4,
    the advantage gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without
    requiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every
    end-host. For IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
    switchover to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery mechanisms. The VRRP terminology has been updated conform to inclusive
    language guidelines for IETF technologies. The IETF has designated National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) "Guidance for NIST Staff on Using Inclusive
    Language in Documentary Standards" for its inclusive language guidelines.</p>
