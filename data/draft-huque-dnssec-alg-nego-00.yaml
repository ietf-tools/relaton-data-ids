abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a DNS extension that allows a DNS client to
    specify a list of DNSSEC algorithms, in preference order, that the client desires
    to use. A DNS server upon receipt of this extension can choose to selectively
    respond with DNSSEC signatures using the most preferred algorithm they support.
    This mechanism may make it easier for DNS zone operators to support signing zone
    data simultaneously with multiple DNSSEC algorithms, without significantly increasing
    the size of DNS responses. It will also allow an easier way to transition to new
    algorithms while still retaining support for older DNS validators that do not
    yet support the new algorithms.</p>"
