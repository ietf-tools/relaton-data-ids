abstract:
- content: "<p>Describing numbering tiers has been informal to date. This document
    proposes a simple recognition principle for tiers in terms of the protocol mapping
    of an E.164 numbering resource to a DNS domain name, as described for ENUM in
    RFC 2916. Tier value is a formal attribute of the digit string for an arbitrary
    E.164 resource, and it applies also to the resulting domain name. No assumptions
    about assignment, existence, or delegation are involved.</p>"
