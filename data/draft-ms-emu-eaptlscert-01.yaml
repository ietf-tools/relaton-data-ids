abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. EAP-Transport Layer Security (EAP- TLS) provides means
    for key derivation and strong mutual authentication with certificates. However,
    certificates can often be relatively large in size. The certificate chain to the
    root-of-trust can also be long when multiple intermediate Certification Authorities
    (CAs) are involved. This implies that EAP-TLS authentication needs to be fragmented
    into many smaller packets for transportation over the lower-layer. Such fragmentation
    can not only negatively affect the latency, but also results in implementation
    challenges. For example, many authenticator (access point) implementations will
    drop an EAP session if it hasn't finished after 40 - 50 packets. This can result
    in failed authentication even when the two communicating parties have the correct
    credentials for mutual authentication. Moreover, there are no mechanisms available
    to easily recover from such situations. This memo looks at the problem in detail
    and discusses the solutions available to overcome these deployment challenges.</p>"
