abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two improvements to unicast based rapid acquisition
    of multicast RTP sessions (RAMS) described in [I- D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp].
    One improved method allows a receiver to simultaneously request a unicast burst
    stream and join the multicast group, and then select one of the two streams to
    be first processed. Another method proposes to optionally convey a parameter called
    unicast backspace in the RAMS-I message. This parameter can be used by RR to determine
    when to join the primary multicast session.</p>"
