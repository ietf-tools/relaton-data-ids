abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents the use of MCoA (Multiple Care-of Address) method
    defined in [4] in order to facilitate a Make Before Break within the Mobile IPv6
    protocol [1]. This draft is intended to document the usage of MCoA for achieving
    Make Before Break behavior. The current base Mobile IPv6 specification [1] doesn't
    include MCoA. With that draft currently under consideration it is possible to
    use these extensions for MBB.</p>"
