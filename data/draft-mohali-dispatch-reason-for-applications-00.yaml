abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new protocol value "Application" for the Reason
    Header field and a new IANA Registry for registering application types. This new
    value enables signaling that a request or response has been issued as a result
    of a decision made by a particular type of application or that an initial request
    has been retargeted as a result of an application decision.</p>
