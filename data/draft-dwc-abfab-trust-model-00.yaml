abstract:
- content: "<p>Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure for
    determining routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership. Since
    it is inherent in their name that they are to be trusted, this Internet Draft
    specifies a trust model for their operation, so that IdPs and RPs can rely on
    them to perform the tasks that they are trusted to perform. These tasks are: -
    form a trusted route between an IdP and RP - ensure that a community of interest
    (CoI)only has the members that it should have</p>"
