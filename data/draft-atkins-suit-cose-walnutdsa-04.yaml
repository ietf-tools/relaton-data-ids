abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital
    Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing
    and Encryption (COSE) syntax. WalnutDSA is a lightweight, quantum-resistant signature
    scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography with implementation and computational
    efficiency of signature verification in constrained16807 environments, even on
    8- and 16-bit platforms. The goal of this publication is to document a way to
    use the lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature algorithm in COSE in
    a way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible implementations.
    As of this publication, WalnutDSA has not been endorsed by the IETF.</p>"
