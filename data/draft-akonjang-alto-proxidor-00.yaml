abstract:
- content: '<p>Several applications, such as peer-to-peer (P2P), content distribution
    and realtime services rely on selection mechanisms in order to select the peer
    or server from which to request the service. Examples of such services are: file
    sharing, media streaming and voice gateways. Application-layer selection algorithms
    do not typically take into account network-layer topology information; either
    that information is unavailable to them, or when such information is available
    (e.g., from BGP Looking Glass servers), it does not include sufficient information
    about the local topology in the neighbourhood of the application client(s). Therefore,
    most applications today make their selection decisions based on performance measurements
    (combined with some amount of random selection) and largely ignore network layer
    routing. It has been demonstrated that by keeping the traffic local (e.g., within
    the same Autonomous System) both infrastructure utilization and application performance
    may be improved. By enhancing selection algorithms through the use of accurate
    network-layer topology, applications may improve performance while network operators
    are also able to reduce the utilization of infrastructure resources by application
    traffic. At the same time, exchange of information between the application and
    the network should not be allowed to compromise confidentiality for either party.
    Detailed routing information owned by the service provider should not be made
    publicly available, while detailed information about the application should also
    not be made known to the service provider. This draft introduces a signaling protocol
    which we call "PROXIDOR". The PROXIDOR protocol is a request-response protocol
    in which a PROXIDOR Client (PxC) issues requests to and receives responses from
    a PROXIDOR Server (PxS). The questions of how a PxC discovers a PxS and how a
    PxS acquires network-layer topology information are beyond the scope of this document.</p>'
