abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method for a DNS client resolver to discover
    the IP addresses of the upstream recursive DNS resolvers and hence bypass the
    local DNS proxy. It also directs IANA to reserve the "LOCAL.ARPA" domain name
    and to create a registry for well known sub-domains of that domain name, such
    sub-domains being reserved for use within any network's administrative boundary.</p>
