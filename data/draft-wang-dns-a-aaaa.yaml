abstract:
- content: "<p>Many existing DNS clients (resolvers) and applications that support
    IPv6 first search for AAAA Resource Records (RR) of a target host name, and if
    no data, then for A RR of the same name. This memo proposes adding A RR in the
    additional section for the no data answer of AAAA RR, which can save a request
    for A RR.</p>"
