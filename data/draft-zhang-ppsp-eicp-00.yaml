abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes three ways to extend the existing ICP protocol
    in order to support today's content-based Internet environment. Since the newly
    created PPSP protocol is especially designed for today's network condition, we
    will take its advantages here. The three proposals are: (1) Embedding PPSP in
    ICP; (2) PPSP and ICP Co-existing in caches communication; (3) Using PPSP to replace
    ICP.</p>"
