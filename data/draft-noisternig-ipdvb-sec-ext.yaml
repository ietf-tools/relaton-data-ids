abstract:
- content: "<p>The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol provides
    an efficient mechanism for transporting IP and other network layer protocol data
    over MPEG-2 networks. Such networks, widely used especially for providing digital
    TV services, often use broadcast wireless transmission media, and are hence vulnerable
    to various types of security attacks. This document describes a new mandatory
    ULE extension to protect ULE traffic using security features such as data confidentiality,
    data integrity, data origin authentication, and prevention against replay attacks.
    Additionally, destination addresses may be hidden from unauthorized receiver devices
    using the identity protection feature. The format of the security extension header
    as well as the processing at receivers and transmitters are described in detail.
    The extension aims to be lightweight and flexible such that it may be implemented
    in low-cost, resource-scarce transceivers, and different levels of security may
    be selected. The security extension may be easily adapted to the Generic Stream
    Encapsulation (GSE) protocol, which uses a similar extension header mechanism.</p>"
