abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing
    multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their outputs to derive
    a single shared secret. This document defines the KEM combiner KDF( H(ss1) ||
    H(ss2) ) which is considered to be a dual PRF in practice, even though not provably
    secure. This mechanism simplifies to KDF( ss1 || ss2 ) when used with a KEM which
    internally uses a KDF to produce its shared secret. RSA-KEM, ECDH, Edwards curve
    DH, and CRYSTALS-Kyber are shown to meet this criteria and therefore be safe to
    use with the simplified KEM combiner.</p>"
