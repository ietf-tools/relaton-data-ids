abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in [RFC3748].
    This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network to provide IP
    connectivity modes hints to an EAP peer -- the end of the link that responds to
    the authenticator. The purpose is to allow the EAP peer in executing in a reliable
    and efficient manner the IP connectivity step as soon as the authentication phase
    completes. This is useful in situations where a peer and the networks it visits
    support various IP connectivity modes. Without the hint, such a peer might fail
    or take some time to select a valid IP connectivity mode on the visited network.
    With the help of the hint, a visited network provides the peer with a list of
    supported IP connectivity modes and allows it to execute successfully the convenient
    IP connectivity as soon as the authentication is complete. The hint is particularly
    useful when users are performing vertical handovers through different network
    technologies such as wireless ones.</p>"
