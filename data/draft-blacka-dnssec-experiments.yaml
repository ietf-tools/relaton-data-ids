abstract:
- content: "<p>In the long history of the development of the DNS security [1] extensions,
    a number of alternate methodologies and modifications have been proposed and rejected
    for practical, rather than strictly technical, reasons. There is a desire to be
    able to experiment with these alternate methods in the public DNS. This document
    describes a methodology for deploying alternate, non-backwards-compatible, DNSSEC
    methodologies in an experimental fashion without disrupting the deployment of
    standard DNSSEC.</p>"
