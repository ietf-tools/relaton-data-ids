abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Architecture [ARCH] discusses the way in which ATM switches
    may be used as Label Switching Routers. The MPLS ATM VC switching document [ATMVC]
    details the way in which ATM-LSRs are used, specifically in the presence of non-merge
    and VC-merge capable switches. This document is a companion document to [ATMVC];
    it extends the ATM procedures for the support of VP- switching on ATM-LSRs. It
    is assumed the reader is familiar with the contents of [ATMVC].</p>"
