abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a Service-Oriented Mechanism for Fault Detection
    and Localization (SOMFDL). This mechanism brings up the concepts of "Chord supplementary"
    and "QoS Trigger". By monitoring the real-time QoS level of the forward path,
    network can launch the mechanism when the QoS level cannot satisfy the requirement
    of service transmission, so that fault detection and localization can be realized.
    By designing related protocols, the manipuility of this mechanism can be guaranteed.
    Utilizing this mechanism, network can accomplish fault detection and localization
    in a time scale of milliseconds with a few datagram sent.</p>
