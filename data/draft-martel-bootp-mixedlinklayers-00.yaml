abstract:
- content: "<p>RFCs 951 [1], 1541 [2], and 1542 [3] describe the interactions of BOOTP
    [1] and DHCP [2] client, server, and relay agents. However, further experience
    with these protocols has revealed the existence of an interoperability issue.
    The issue occurs when a given IP subnet is constructed over one link-layer network
    inter-connected by translational bridges to other dissimilar link-layer networks.
    The following information attempts to address this problem. It is impossible for
    a BOOTP or DHCP client, server, or relay agent to know in advance whether or not
    it will be operating in a mixed media link-layer network environment. Given this
    fact, all BOOTP and DHCP client, server, and relay agents SHOULD adopt the recommendations
    defined in this memo.</p>"
