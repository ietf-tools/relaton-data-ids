abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as pieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in several equivalent
    replicas on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide guidance to these applications, which have to select one
    or several hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired
    resource. The protocol is under specification in the ALTO working group. This
    memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO for peer-to-peer and CDNs, some
    preliminary security considerations, and also initial guidance for application
    designers using ALTO.</p>"
