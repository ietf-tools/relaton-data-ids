abstract:
- content: "<p>The Rich Presence Information Data Format for the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) (RPIDS) adds elements to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF)
    that provide additional information about the presentity and its contacts. This
    information can be translated into call routing behavior or be delivered to watchers.
    The information is designed so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g.,
    from calendar files or user activity.</p>"
