abstract:
- content: "<p>SPKI structures are defined for public keys, hash values, access control
    list (ACL) entries and certificates. This document gives examples of such structures
    for real world applications. The examples here are not tied to any specific application
    and should be taken as informative examples rather than standard formats. However,
    once applications are fielded using such structures and we have experience with
    them, we can consider publishing those formats as proposed standards. That effort
    is considered out of scope for this document.</p>"
