abstract:
- content: "<p>The basic design of the Domain Name System was completed almost 30
    years ago. The last half of that period has been characterized by significant
    changes in requirements and expectations, some of which either require changes
    to how the DNS is used or can be accommodated only poorly or not at all. This
    document asks the question of whether it is time to either redesign and replace
    the DNS to match contemporary requirements and expectations (rather than continuing
    to try to design and implement incremental patches that are not fully satisfactory)
    or draw some clear lines about functionality that is not really needed or that
    should be performed in some other way.</p>"
