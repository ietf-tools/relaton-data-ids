abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT is a stateful network device, providing routing transparency for
    hosts in disparate address realms to communicate with each other. External agents
    such as Application Level Gateways (ALGs), Realm Specific IP (RSIP) clients and
    Management applications may need to interact with NAT to influence its operation.</p>"
