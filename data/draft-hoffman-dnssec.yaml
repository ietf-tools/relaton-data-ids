abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the DNS security extensions (commonly called
    "DNSSEC") that are specified RFCs 4033, 4034, 4035, and a handful of others. The
    purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in one place so that the reader can understand
    the many aspects of DNSSEC. This document does not update any of those RFCs. This
    document is currently maintained at https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-hoffman-dnssec.
    Issues and pull requests are welcomed. If the document is later adopted by a working
    group, a new repository will likely be created.</p>
