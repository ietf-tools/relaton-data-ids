abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP-AO technology was proposed to obsolete the TCP-MD5 option which
    was developed to protect the BGP sessions between routers. Besides of allowing
    users to choose which cryptographic algorithm(s) they want to use to meet their
    security needs, TCP-AO provides key coordination mechanism giving the ability
    to move from one key to another within the same connection with zero segment loss
    by using two ID fields i.e. KeyID and RNextKeyID. The sender uses the RNextKeyID
    to indicate the receiver using the preferred MKT which will authenticate the next
    incoming segments. However, if the sender finds its MKT which is used to authenticate
    the outgoing segments has been attacked and should be changed into a new one,
    it can do nothing but wait for receiver to send a segment which carries a different
    RNextKeyID. In this case, the communication becomes dangerous probably because
    the sender always authenticates outgoing segments by an attacked key before the
    receiver wants to change the incoming key. This document provides a method giving
    the sender ability to inform the other part change the RNextKeyID when the sender
    finds the key used in outgoing segment is not safe any longer.</p>"
