abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    [2] omits a state machine description. This omission has led to ambiguity in the
    specification and potential security problems in EAP implementations. This document
    outlines a state machine to be integrated into the next revision of the EAP RFC.</p>"
