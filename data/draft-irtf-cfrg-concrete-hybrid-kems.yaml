abstract:
- content: <p>PQ/T Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) combine "post- quantum"
    cryptographic algorithms, which are safe from attack by a quantum computer, with
    "traditional" algorithms, which are not. CFRG has developed a general framework
    for creating hybrid KEMs. In this document, we define concrete instantiations
    of this framework to illustrate certain properties of the framework and simplify
    implementors' choices.</p>
