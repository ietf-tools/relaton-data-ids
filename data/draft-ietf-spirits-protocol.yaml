abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Services in PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
    Network) requesting Internet Services (SPIRITS) protocol. The purpose of the SPIRITS
    protocol is to support services that originate in the cellular or wireline PSTN
    and necessitate interactions between the PSTN and the Internet. On the PSTN side,
    the SPIRITS services are most often initiated from the Intelligent Network (IN)
    entities. Internet Call Waiting and Internet Caller-ID Delivery are examples of
    SPIRITS services, as are location-based services on the cellular network. The
    protocol defines the building blocks from which many other services can be built.
