abstract:
- content: "<p>Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to shared
    resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment. Thereby, floor control complements
    other functions -- such as conference and media session setup, conference policy
    manipulation, and media control -- that are realized by other protocols. This
    document specifies the Binary Floor Control Protocol (BFCP). BFCP is used between
    floor participants and floor control servers, and between floor chairs (i.e.,
    moderators) and floor control servers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
