abstract:
- content: "<p>The RSVP [RFC2205] model for communicating requests to network devices
    along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of appli- cations beyond what
    the protocol designers envisioned, and while the architectural model generalizes
    well the protocol itself has a number of features that limit its applicability
    to applications other than IntServ [RFC1633]. The NSIS working group is developing
    a modernized version that, among other things, is based on a 'two- layer' architecture
    that divides protocol function into transport and application. This document describes
    the transport protocol.</p>"
