abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to exchange instant messages and presence information provides
    users with a powerful mechanism for communicating in real-time. This document
    outlines an architecture for interoperability among Instant Messaging Systems
    which allows disparate systems to exchange messages and presence information while
    being relatively easy to implement and maintaining a high standard of security
    and scalability.</p>"
