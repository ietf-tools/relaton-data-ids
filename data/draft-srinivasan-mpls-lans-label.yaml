abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) refers to a forwarding paradigm
    for routed networks which combines the speed and simplicity of link layer switching
    with the scalability and control of network layer forwarding. Routers which support
    MPLS are referred to as Label Switching Routers (LSRs). MPLS requires the distribution
    labels between peer LSRs based on routing and traffic information. These labels
    are then carried in packets and are used for making high speed forwarding decisions
    at the routers by eliminating the need for conventional network layer header processing.
    This note discusses the format and encapsulation of labels when using MPLS on
    LAN media.</p>"
