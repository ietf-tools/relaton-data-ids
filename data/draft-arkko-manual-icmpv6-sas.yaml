abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational document discusses the use of manually configured
    IPsec security associations to protect IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) messages.
    IPsec security associations are generally identified by the triple (security parameters
    index, destination address, protocol). In the case of Neighbor Discovery, configuring
    these associations requires some effort, however. There are multiple known destination
    addresses plus a number of addresses that depend on the physical link addresses.
    This document describes the security implications of protecting or not protecting
    the Neighbor Discovery messages and lists the security associations that must
    be configured manually. The presented method is applicable only in small networks,
    but some approaches for reducing the configuration effort are discussed.</p>"
