abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a multi-layer protection scheme for IPSEC that
    applies separate encryption/authentication with different keys on different parts
    of an IP datagram. It allows certain intermediate routers to have limited and
    controllable access to part of IP datagram (usually headers) but not the user
    data.</p>"
