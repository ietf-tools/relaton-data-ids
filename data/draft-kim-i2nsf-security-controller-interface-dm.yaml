abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an information model and a YANG data model for
    the Security Controller-Facing Interface between two security controllers in an
    Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework located in different
    Domains. This interface is used for the exchange of IPsec flow protection to protect
    the IP Communication between two Network Security Functions (NSFs) in cross-domain
    environments. The YANG data model in this document is built on the basis of the
    YANG data model for IPsec flow protection based on Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN).</p>"
