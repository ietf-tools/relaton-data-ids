abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of Network Function Virtualization (NFV), a service
    chain refers to a group of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) deployed in a virtual
    infrastructure manager (VIM) environment, such as OpenStack, to apply a set of
    networking services to users' traffic passing through it. Depending on the service
    requirements, the service chain may consist of a single VNF or multiple VNFs deployed
    serially, or in parallel, and the Virtual Network Forwarding Graph (VNF-G) describes
    the topologies of how these VNFs are interconnected together via virtual links
    to provide different networking services. After a service chain is deployed, its
    user may require to modify the VNF-G from time to time, and on-demand, to meet
    changing service requirements. Therefore, operators may require to support a high
    degree of flexibility to orchestrate the provisioning and dynamic modifications
    of VNFs in service chains. This document presents a hierarchical model based approach
    to allow the NFV Orchestrator (NFV-O) and the VNF Manager (VNF-M) to support the
    dynamic provisioning and on-demand modifications of VNFs in service chains.</p>"
