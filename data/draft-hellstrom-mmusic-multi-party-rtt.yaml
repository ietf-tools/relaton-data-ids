abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media handling
    in multi-party calls. The main RTT transport is to carry Real-Time text by the
    RTP protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103 RFC 4103 [RFC4103] .
    The mechanisms enable the receiving application to present the received real-time
    text medium separated per source, in different ways according to user preferences.
    Some presentation related features are also described explaining suitable variations
    of transmission and presentation of text. Call control features are described
    for the SIP environment. A number of alternative methods for providing the multi-party
    negotiation, transmission and presentation are discussed and a recommendation
    for the main one is provided. The main solution for centralized multi-party handling
    of real-time text is achieved through a media control unit coordinating multiple
    RTP text streams into one RTP stream. Alternative methods using a single RTP stream
    and source identification inline in the text stream are also described, one of
    them being provided as a lower functionality fallback method for endpoints with
    no multi-party awareness for RTT. Bridging methods where the text stream is carried
    untouched by the bridge are also discussed. Brief information is also provided
    for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC environment.</p>"
