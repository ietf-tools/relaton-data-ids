abstract:
- content: <p>This document analyzes issues involved in the transition of "unmanaged
    networks" from IPv4 to IPv6. Unmanaged networks typically correspond to home networks
    or small office networks. A companion paper analyzes out the requirements for
    mechanisms needed in various transition scenarios of these networks to IPv6. Starting
    from this analysis, we evaluate the suitability of mechanisms that have already
    been specified, proposed, or deployed. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>
