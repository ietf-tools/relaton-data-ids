    to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) specification use COSE algorithm identifiers.
    This specification registers algorithms in the IANA "COSE Algorithms" registry
    that are used by WebAuthn and CTAP implementations that are not already registered.
    Also, they are registered in the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms"
    registry, when not already registered there.</p>
