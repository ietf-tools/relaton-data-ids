abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the P2PSIP Peer Protocol that is used between
    the peers in P2PSIP networks. The described Peer Protocol is not an entirely new
    protocol, it is a combination of the new SIP method, LOCSER, and the well-defined,
    XML-based body. Note: At the current moment, the purpose of this document is just
    to present a relatively high level abstraction from the Peer Protocol, rather
    than give a very detailed description.</p>"
