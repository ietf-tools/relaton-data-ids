abstract:
- content: "<p>SMTP was designed simply to deliver email messages without authenticating
    sources or senders of email messages. In an affort to reduce spam on the Internet,
    Challenge/Response ('C/R') email systems were developed to provide a method for
    validating message origination for an intended recipient. This document defines
    a Challenge / Response Interworking ('CRI') protocol by proposing the use of SMTP
    extensions and MIME headers for interoperability of C/R systems. This document
    also defines a set of guidelines for continued use with existing non-CRI mail
    systems and clients.</p>"
