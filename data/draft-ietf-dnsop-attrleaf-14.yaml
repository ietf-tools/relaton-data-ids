abstract:
- content: <p>Formally, any DNS resource record may occur under any domain name. However
    some services use an operational convention for defining specific interpretations
    of an RRset, by locating the records in a DNS branch, under the parent domain
    to which the RRset actually applies. The top of this subordinate branch is defined
    by a naming convention that uses a reserved node name, which begins with an _underscore.
    The underscored naming construct defines a semantic scope for DNS record types
    that are associated with the parent domain, above the underscored branch. This
    specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "DNS Global
    Underscore Scoped Entry Registry" with IANA. The purpose of the Underscore registry
    is to avoid collisions resulting from the use of the same underscore-based name,
    for different services.</p>
