abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF has proposed MIPv6 based Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support
    protocol that handles the mobility management of IPv6 based mobile networks. However
    the NEMO protocol has severe performance limitations and does not specify the
    route optimization method for mobile networks and does not take into account the
    operational and functional complexities involving nested mobile networks. In this
    draft we present NEst Route Optimization for NEMO (NERON) protocol, a light weight,
    efficient and scalable approach that aims at enabling nodes behind nested mobile
    networks to use optimized communication paths with zero tunneling overhead and
    minimum end-to- end delay, irrespective of the depth of the nest, with minimum
    but manageable changes to the base MIPv6 and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocols
    and without introducing any new network entities.</p>"
