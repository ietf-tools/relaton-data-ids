abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a companion to the GMPLS extensions to control SONET/SDH
    networks as defined in [GMPLS-SONET-SDH], [GMPLS-SONET- SDH-EXT] and [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-RTG].
    They define the SONET and SDH technology specific information needed when using
    GMPLS signaling. This informational memo details the GMPLS signalling and some
    routing specific considerations to control the interworking between SONET and
    SDH networks. It results from this, that interworking issues from the control
    plane viewpoint are well covered by the current definition of the Sonet/SDH extensions
    to the GMPLS protocol suite.</p>"
