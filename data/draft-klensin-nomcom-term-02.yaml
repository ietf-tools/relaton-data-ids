abstract:
- content: "<p>A consensus is emerging in the IETF that very long tenure in leadership
    roles is not in the best interests of the community. While, in theory, that advice
    could simply be given to the Nomcom, there is reason to believe that a different
    model for consideration of renewal or replacement for members of the leadership
    would be more efficient for the Nomcom and would impose less hardship on incumbents
    and the community. This document outlines that alternate method.</p>"
