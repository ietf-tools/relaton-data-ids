abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides requirements for security services based on
    software-defined networking (SDN) with two representative use cases: (i) centralized
    firewall system for intra-domain networks and (ii) centralized DDoS-attack mitigation
    system between inter-domain networks. For the centralized firewall system, this
    document raises challenging issues in existing firewalls and a use case of centralized
    firewall system based on SDN. For the centralized DDoS- attack mitigation system,
    this document also raises challenging issues in existing DDoS-attack mitigation
    techniques and a use case of centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system based on
    SDN.</p>"
