abstract:
- content: "<p>Realizing the important role that photonic switches can play in data-centric
    networks, work has been going on within the IETF to combine the control plane
    of MPLS (more specifically traffic engineering) with the point-and-click provisioning
    capabilities of photonic switches [1]. This document outlines a proposal to expand
    this initiative to include DWDM, OADM and ATM systems. It also proposes to expand
    the work beyond simple establishment of optical paths and include optical performance
    monitoring and management. The combined path routing and performance information
    that will be carried and shared between these network elements will allow the
    elements or element management system (EMS) to adequately assess the 'health'
    of an optical path (which can be a wavelength or fiber strand). The routers and/or
    ATM switches at the edges of the photonic network will then use this information
    to dynamically manage the millions of wavelengths available in the photonic layer.</p>"
