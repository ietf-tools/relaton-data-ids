abstract:
- content: "<p>The document lists requirements for optimizations of SIP/SIMPLE. These
    optimizations should reduce the load on the network and the presence servers due
    to inter-domain presence subscriptions. The need for the requirements is based
    on a separate document that provides scaling analysis for inter-domain presence
    over SIP/SIMPLE.</p>"
