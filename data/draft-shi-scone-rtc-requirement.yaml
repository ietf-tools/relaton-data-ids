abstract:
- content: "<p>In real-time communication (RTC) applications, low latency is essential,
    but unstable network conditions make it challenging. Traditional control loop
    reacts slowly and inaccurately to network changes. A new approach is proposed,
    communicating bandwidth and queue information from the bottleneck to the end-host
    for more accurate control.</p>"
