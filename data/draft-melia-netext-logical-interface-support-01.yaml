abstract:
- content: "<p>A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host operating
    system. This semantic is available in all popular operating systems and is used
    in various protocol implementations. The Logical Interface support is desirable
    on the mobile node operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various
    network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology handoffs,
    multihoming and flow mobility support. This document explains the operational
    details of Logical Interface construct and the specifics on how the link-layer
    implementations hide the physical interfaces from the IP stack and from the network
    nodes. Furthermore, this document identifies the applicability of this approach
    to various link-layer technologies and analyses the issues around it when used
    in context with various mobility management features.</p>"
