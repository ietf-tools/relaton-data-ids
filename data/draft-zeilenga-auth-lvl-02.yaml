abstract:
- content: "<p>Numerous authentication mechanisms are in use today on the Internet.
    It is desirable to give administrators the choice of which mechanisms to support
    in their deployments and to give users the choice which mechanisms to use. This
    document offers terminology designed to be easily understandable by users and
    administrators of Internet services, while being meaningful to designers and developers
    of these services and associated Internet protocols.</p>"
