abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS recursive resolvers do not always have access to the authoritative
    resolvers from which they need to get information. For example, when the DNS root
    servers are under DDoS attack, a recursive resolver may not be able to get an
    answer from any of the root servers. This document describes how resolvers can
    populate their caches with zone information, and keep their cache populated, using
    out-of-band mechanisms that do not rely on the DNS protocol. The protocol is primarily
    designed for the root zone, but can apply to any zone that wants to participate
    by publishing values to be cached.</p>"
