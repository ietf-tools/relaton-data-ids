abstract:
- content: "<p>EVN6 is a mechanism designed to carry Ethernet virtual networks, providing
    Ethernet connectivity to customer sites dispersed on public IPv6 networks. At
    the data layer, EVN6 directly places the Ethernet frames in the payload of IPv6
    packet, and dynamically generates the IPv6 addresses of the IPv6 header using
    host MAC addresses and other information, then sends them into IPv6 network for
    transmission. This document proposes extensions to EVPN for EVN6, including two
    new route types and related procedures.</p>"
