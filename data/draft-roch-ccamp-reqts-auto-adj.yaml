abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of requirements and a proposed solution for the control of hierarchical
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) is found in [HIER]. However, support of multiple client
    layer networks and address separation as allowed by the Automatically Switched
    Optical Network (ASON) architecture [G.8080] are not covered by [HIER]. This internet
    draft describes additional requirements to consider for the use of LSP hierarchy
    in ASON networks.</p>"
