abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that allows
    a client to request that a particular protocol extension be used to process the
    request. The server declines the request if it does not support the extension.
    However, there is currently no way for a server to determine which extensions
    are supported by the client. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows
    the server to tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define
    a way for a client to query a server about the extensions it supports. This document
    defines a SIP extension that allows clients to indicate, in a request, the set
    of extensions supported. We also define a mechanism that allows clients, through
    an OPTIONS request, to determine the extensions supported by a server.</p>"
