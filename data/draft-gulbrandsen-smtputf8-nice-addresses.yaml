abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible
    enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while avoiding confusing
    or risky elements. NOTE: The term ''nice'' is not ideal here, and must be reconsidered
    or replaced before this is issued as an RFC. "Well-formed" is a candidate. "Nice"
    will do for now: better to argue about substance than wording.</p>'
