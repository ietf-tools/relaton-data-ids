abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines multicast VPN extensions and procedures that
    allow fast failover for upstream failures, by allowing downstream PEs to take
    into account the status of Provider-Tunnels (P-tunnels) when selecting the upstream
    PE for a VPN multicast flow, and extending BGP MVPN routing so that a C-multicast
    route can be advertized toward a standby upstream PE.</p>"
