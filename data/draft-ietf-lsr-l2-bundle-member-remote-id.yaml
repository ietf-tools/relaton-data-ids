abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks where Layer 2 (L2) interface bundles (such as a Link Aggregation
    Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX]) are deployed, a controller may need to collect the
    connectivity relationships between bundle members for traffic engineering (TE)
    purposes. For example, when performing topology management and bidirectional path
    computation for TE, it is essential to know the connectivity relationships among
    bundle members. This document describes how OSPF and IS-IS would advertise the
    remote interface identifiers for Layer 2 bundle members. The corresponding extension
    of BGP-LS is also specified.</p>"
