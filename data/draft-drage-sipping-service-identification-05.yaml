abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the service
    of authenticated users. The use of these extensions is only applicable inside
    an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for generation,
    transport, and usage of such information. This document does NOT offer a general
    service identification model suitable for use between different trust domains
    or for use in the Internet at large. The document also defines a URN to identify
    both services and User Agent (UA) applications. This URN can be used within the
    SIP header fields defined in this document to identify services, and also within
    the framework defined for caller preferences and callee capabilities to identify
    usage of both services and applications between end UAs. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
