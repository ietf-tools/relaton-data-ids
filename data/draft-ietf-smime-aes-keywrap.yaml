abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to make the AES Key Wrap algorithm
    conveniently available to the Internet community. The United States of America
    has adopted AES as the new encryption standard. The AES Key Wrap algorithm will
    probably be adopted by the USA for encryption of AES keys. The authors took most
    of the text in this document from the draft AES Key Wrap posted by NIST.</p>"
