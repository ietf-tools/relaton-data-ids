abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a metric, based on the minimal longest ascending
    subsequence (MLAS), which can be used to measure the level of reorderedness of
    a given single sequence of packets transmitted by one host and received by a second.
    This metric enables reordering between similar packet flows to be compared across
    differing network topologies. The draft goes on to provide a set of recommended
    parameters which can be used when attempting to consistently compare reordering,
    and highlights potential issues which should be taken into account during measurement.</p>"
