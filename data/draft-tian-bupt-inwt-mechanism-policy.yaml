abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes INT-path, a cost-effective network-wide telemetry
    framework based on INT (In-band Network Telemetry), by decoupling the network
    monitoring system into a routing mechanism and a routing path generation policy.
    INT-path embeds SR (Source Routing) into INT probes to allow specifying the route
    that the probe packet takes through the network. Above this probing path control
    mechanism, an Euler trail-based path planning policy is developed to generate
    non-overlapped INT paths that cover the entire network with a minimum path number,
    reducing the overall telemetry overhead. INT- path is very suitable for deployment
    in data center networks thanks to their symmetric topologies.</p>"
