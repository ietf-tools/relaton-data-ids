abstract:
- content: <p>Path MTU Discovery between end-host-devices/Virtual-Machines/servers/
    workloads connected over an EVPN-Overlay Network in Datacenter/Campus/enterprise
    deployment, is a problem, yet to be resolved in the standards forums. It needs
    a converged solution to ensure optimal usage of network and computational resources
    of the networking elements, including underlay routers/switches, constituting
    the overlay network. This documents takes leads from the guidelines presented
    in [RFC4459]. The overlay connectivity can pan across various sites (geographically
    seperated or collocated) for realizing a Datacenter Interconnect or intersite
    VPNs between campus sites (buildings, branch offices etc). This literature intends
    to solve problem of icmp error propagation from an underlay routing/switching
    device to an end-host (hooked to EVPN overlay), thus facilitating "accurate MTU"
    learnings. This document also leverages the icmp multipart message extension,
    mentioned in [RFC4884] to carry the original packet in the icmp PDU.</p>
