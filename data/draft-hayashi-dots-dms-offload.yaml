abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a deployment scenario to assess the applicability
    of DOTS protocols together with a discussion on DOTS deployment considerations
    of such scenario. This scenario assumes that a DMS (DDoS Mitigation System) whose
    utilization rate is high sends its blocked traffic information to an orchestrator
    using DOTS protocols, then the orchestrator requests forwarding nodes such as
    routers to filter the traffic. Doing so enables service providers to mitigate
    the DDoS attack traffic automatically while ensuring interoperability and distributed
    filter enforcement.</p>"
