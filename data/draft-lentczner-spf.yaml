abstract:
- content: "<p>Mail on the Internet can be forged in a number of ways. In particular,
    existing protocols place no restriction in what a sending host can use as the
    reverse-path of a message. This document describes a protocol whereby a domain
    can explicitly authorize the hosts that are allowed to use its domain name in
    a reverse-path, and a way for receiving hosts to check such authorization.</p>"
