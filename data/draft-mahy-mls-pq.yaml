abstract:
- content: <p>This document registers new cipher suites for Messaging Layer Security
    (MLS) based on "post-quantum" algorithms, which are intended to be resilient to
    attack by quantum computers. These cipher suites are constructed using the new
    Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), optionally in combination
    with traditional elliptic curve KEMs, together with appropriate authenticated
    encryption, hash, and signature algorithms.</p>
