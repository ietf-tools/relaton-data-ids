abstract:
- content: "<p>In order for virtual assets to be traded or exchanged within online
    transactions, the parties involved in the transaction must have share a common
    definition of what constitute the virtual asset. Parties transacting on a DLT
    system must have the unambiguous means to refer to a common definition of an virtual
    asset, independent of the implementation of the virtual asset in question. This
    specification defines a JSON representation of a number of common information
    fields within asset profiles.</p>"
