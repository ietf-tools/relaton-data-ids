abstract:
- content: "<p>Most MIME syntax and semantics can usually be processed in a single
    pass through the data. For example, the MIME boundary parameter always appears
    before it is used. This is not the case with multipart/alternative MIME entities.
    The processor of the data cannot know the MIME types of the altnernatives present
    until all alternatives have been processed. Thus, it is not possible for a one
    pass processor to consider more than the first and most limited representation,
    because a subsequent part may be something that cannot be handled.</p>"
