abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new DHCP option number to allow iSCSI and
    iFCP devices using DHCP to discover the location of the iSNS server. iSNS provides
    discovery and management capabilities for iSCSI and Fibre Channel (FCP) storage
    devices in an enterprise-scale IP storage network. iSNS provides intelligent storage
    management services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel networks, allowing
    a commodity IP network to function in a similar capacity as a storage area network.</p>"
