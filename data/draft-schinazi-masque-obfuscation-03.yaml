abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes MASQUE Obfuscation. MASQUE Obfuscation is a
    mechanism that allows co-locating and obfuscating networking applications behind
    an HTTPS web server. The currently prevalent use-case is to allow running a proxy
    or VPN server that is indistinguishable from an HTTPS server to any unauthenticated
    observer. We do not expect major providers and CDNs to deploy this behind their
    main TLS certificate, as they are not willing to take the risk of getting blocked,
    as shown when domain fronting was blocked. An expected use would be for individuals
    to enable this behind their personal websites via easy to configure open-source
    software. This document is a straw-man proposal. It does not contain enough details
    to implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark discussions on the
    approach it is taking. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the
    MASQUE IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains
    the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts.</p>"
