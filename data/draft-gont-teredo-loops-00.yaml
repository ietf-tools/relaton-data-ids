abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, a number of routing loop vulnerabilities were discovered
    in the Teredo mechanism, which typically result in a Denial of Service of the
    involved systems, possibly also affecting the intervening networks. This document
    describes a number of security checks that can be performed by Teredo hosts and
    Teredo servers such that these vulnerabilities are eliminated.</p>"
