abstract:
- content: <p>This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes
    of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 source prefix and a destination prefix.
    This implies not simply routing "to a destination", but "traffic going to that
    destination AND coming from a specified source". It may be combined with other
    qualifying attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a
    specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix". The obvious application
    is egress routing, as required for a multihomed entity with a provider-allocated
    prefix from each of several upstream networks. Traffic within the network could
    be source/destination routed as well, or could be routed from "any prefix", ::/0.
    If traffic is routed from the relevant PA prefixes but in fact has a source address
    that is in none of them, the traffic in effect has no route.</p>
