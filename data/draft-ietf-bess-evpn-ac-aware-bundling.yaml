abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution
    over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant Systems and
    End Devices that can be physical or virtual. EVPN multihoming with IRB is one
    of the common deployment scenarios. There are deployments which requires capability
    to have multiple subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single Broadcast
    Domain. EVPN technology defines three different types of service interface which
    serve different requirements but none of them address the requirement of supporting
    multiple subnets within single Broadcast Domain. In this draft we define new service
    interface type to support multiple subnets in single Broadcast Domain. Service
    interface proposed in this draft will be applicable to multihoming case only.</p>"
