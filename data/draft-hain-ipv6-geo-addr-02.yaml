abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an IPv6 Geographic global unicast address format
    for use in the Internet. The address format defined in this document is consistent
    with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [2]. It is designed
    to facilitate scalable Internet routing when sites attach to multiple service
    providers, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference to the site. A natural
    byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is that all addresses are fixed
    allowing sites to change providers at will without requiring their network to
    renumber.</p>
