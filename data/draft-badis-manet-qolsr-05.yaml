abstract:
- content: "<p>The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc
    networks provides shortest routes in terms of number of hops using Dijkstra's
    shortest path algorithm. In order to support multiple- metric routing criteria,
    a quality of service (QoS) extension can be added to OLSR functioning. No additional
    control traffic is generated (only augmented HELLO and TC messages). QOLSR protocol
    uses standard multipoint relays (MPRs) to ensure that the overhead is as low as
    possible for forwarding control traffic. Local QoS metrics information on links
    are used to calculate quality of service MPRs (QMPRS) and then flooded in the
    network by TC messages to calculate routing tables. QOLSR can find optimal paths
    on the known partial topology having the same performances that those on the whole
    network. These paths contain only QMPRs as intermediate nodes between a source
    destination pair. This memo describes the QOLSR protocol, which is an enhancement
    of OLSR to support multiple-metric QoS routing.</p>"
