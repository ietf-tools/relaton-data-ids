abstract:
- content: "<p>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a request,
    they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral port. The SIP protocol
    includes mechanisms which insure that responses to a request, and new requests
    sent in the original direction reuse an existing connection. However, new requests
    sent in the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing connection.
    This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one connection for requests
    sent in each direction, and can result in potential scaling and performance problems.
    This document proposes requirements and a mechanism which address this deficiency.</p>"
