abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP is utilised as a key intra- and inter-autonomous system routing
    protocol in modern IP networks. The failure modes, as defined by the original
    protocol standards, are based on a number of assumptions around the impact of
    session failure. Numerous incidents both in the global Internet routing table
    and within service provider networks have been caused by strict handling of a
    single invalid UPDATE message causing large-scale failures in one or more autonomous
    systems. This memo describes the current use of BGP within service provider networks,
    and outlines a set of requirements for further work to enhance the mechanisms
    available to a BGP implementation when erroneous data is detected. Whilst this
    document does not provide specification of any standard, it is intended as an
    overview of a set of enhancements to BGP to improve the protocol's robustness
    to suit its current deployment.</p>"
