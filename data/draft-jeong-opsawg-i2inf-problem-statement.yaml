abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the problem statement for the Interface to
    In-Network Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network- level and
    application-level. In-Network Functions (INF) include In- Network Computing Functions
    (INCF) which are defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)
    and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). INF also includes In-Network Application
    Functions (INAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices,
    Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Intent-Based
    Networking (IBN) can be used to compose user services and consist of a combination
    of INFs in a target network. This document investigates the need for a standard
    framework with the interfaces for INFs, in terms of applications with the need
    to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network and interoperability among
    multi-vendor INFs.</p>"
