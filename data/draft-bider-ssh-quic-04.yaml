abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for purposes
    including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP and SCP, and
    encrypted tunneling of TCP connections. Because it is based on TCP, SSH suffers
    similar problems as motivate the HTTP protocol to transition to UDP-based QUIC
    [QUIC]. These include: unauthenticated network intermediaries can trivially disconnect
    SSH sessions; SSH connections are lost when mobile clients change IP addresses;
    performance limitations in OS-based TCP stacks; many round-trips to establish
    a connection; duplicate flow control on the level of the connection as well as
    channels. This memo specifies SSH key exchange over UDP and leverages QUIC to
    provide a UDP-based transport.</p>"
