abstract:
- content: "<p>The proliferating convolution of Internet and society increases the
    impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals. Because of this, the design
    and development of the architecture of the Internet also has a growing impact
    on society. This has led to an broad recognition that human rights [UDHR] [ICCPR]
    [ICESCR] have a role in the development and management of the Internet [HRC2012]
    [UNGA2013] [NETmundial]. It has also been argued that the Internet should be strengthened
    as a human rights enabling environment [Brown]. This document provides a proposal
    for a vocabulary to discuss the relation between human rights and Internet protocols,
    an overview of the discussion in technical and academic literature and communities,
    a proposal for the mapping of the relation between human rights and technical
    concepts, and a proposal for guidelines for human rights considerations, similar
    to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations [RFC6973]. Discussion
