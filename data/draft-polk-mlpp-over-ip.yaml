abstract:
- content: "<p>The intent of this document is to introduce an Architecture for Multi-
    Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) into the IP realm. MLPP was originally
    written to create 'a prioritized call handling service' [1] in combination with
    ISDN supplementary services. MLPP has two very simple concepts for voice (Real-Time)
    communications: A) setting or marking every session at inception with a Precedence
    level relative to others within a known network domain; and B) the end-stations
    or internetworking devices preempting lower relative priority sessions in order
    for higher relative level sessions to pass or occur during times of congestion
    at any point in that known, managed domain, including to the end-station (phone).</p>"
