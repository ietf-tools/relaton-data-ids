abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL
    protocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state routing protocol technology
    and encapsulation with a hop-count. As RBridges are deployed in real-world situations,
    operators will need tools for debugging problems that arise. This document specifies
    a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance purposes
    in RBridge campuses. The features specified in this document include tools for
    traceroute, ping, and error reporting.</p>"
