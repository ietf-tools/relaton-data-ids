abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) was designed to allow
    simple and efficient protection of RTP. To provide this, encryption and authentication
    of media and control signaling are tightly coupled to the RTP session, and the
    information in the RTP header. Hence, in general, it is not possible to perform
    store-and-forward of protected media using SRTP. This document gives, based on
    a use case analysis, requirements that SRTP and new SRTP transforms need to satisfy
    in order to allow secure store-and-forward operation. A first outline on how to
    introduce the needed new functionality and transforms in SRTP is also presented.</p>"
