abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on many live deployments, including the Sochi Winter Olympics
    2014 network and multiple interoperability events, this document has been created
    to provide advice to network operators about best practices when implementing
    IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) networks. It is principally addressed
    to system integrators, network operators and solution providers, including those
    that do not yet support SPB. Some advice to protocol implementers is also provided.
    The intention of the advice is to facilitate multi vendor network deployments
    as well as provide guidance for new installations.</p>"
