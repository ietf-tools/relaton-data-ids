abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication algorithm in addition
    to the already documented authentication schemes, described in the base specification.
    Although this document has been written specifically to introduce two new Authentication
    types it describes how BFD can use National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) Secure Hash Standard family of algorithms (SHS) to authenticate the control
    packets, the method described in this document is generic and can be used to extend
    BFD to support any cryptographic hash function in the future.</p>"
