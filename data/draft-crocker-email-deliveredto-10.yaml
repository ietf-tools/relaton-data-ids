abstract:
- content: '<p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the email''s author. For example, the address used by the email transport service
    is provided separately, such as through SMTP''s "RCPT TO" command, and might not
    match any address in the To: or cc: fields. In addition, before final delivery,
    handling can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using a sequence
    of different destination addresses that (eventually) lead to the recipient. As
    well, a receiving system''s delivery process can produce local address transformations.
    It can be helpful for a message to have a common way to record each delivery in
    such a sequence, noting each address used in the sequence to that recipient, such
    as for (1) analyzing the path a message has taken, (2) loop detection, or (3)
    formulating the author''s address in a reply message. This document defines a
    header field for this information. Email handling information discloses details
    about the email infrastructure, as well as about a particular recipient; this
    can raise privacy concerns. A header field such as this is not automatically assured
    of widespread use. Therefore, this document is being published as an Experimental
    RFC, looking for constituency and for operational utility. This document was produced
    through the Independent Submission Stream and was not subject to the IETF''s approval
    process.</p>'
