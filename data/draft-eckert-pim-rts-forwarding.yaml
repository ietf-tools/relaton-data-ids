abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER provides stateless multicast in BIER domains using bitstrings
    to indicate receivers. BIER-TE extends BIER with tree engineering capabilities.
    Both suffer from scalability problems in large networks as bitsrings are of limited
    size so the BIER domains need to be subdivided using set identifiers so that possibly
    many packets need to be sent to reach all receivers of a multicast group within
    a subdomain. This problem can be mitigated by encoding explicit multicast trees
    in packet headers with bitstrings that have only node-local significance. A drawback
    of this method is that any hop on the path needs to be encoded so that long paths
    consume lots of header space. This document presents the idea of Segment Routed
    Recursive Tree Structures (RTS), a unifying approach to use either bitstrings
    with local node-local significance or SIDs with local or domain-wide significance
    to encode multicast trees in packet headers. RTS, like RBS is intended to expand
    the applicability of deployment for stateless multicast replication beyond what
    BIER and BIER-TE support and expect: larger networks, less operational complexity,
    and utilization of more modern forwarding planes as those expected to be possible
    when BIER was designed (ca. 2010). This document only specifies the forwarding
    plane but discusses possible architectural options, which are primarily determined
    through the future definition/mapping to encapsulation headers and controller-plane
    functions.</p>"
