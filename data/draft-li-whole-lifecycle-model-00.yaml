abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic composing Web Services provides an efficient mechanism to offer
    complex large systems. Substantial progress has already been made towards composing
    Web Services. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot build a model of the whole
    life cycle of composed Web Services. In order to solve this problem, this draft
    designed a whole life cycle model named Service-Cloud model based on the forming
    picture of clouds in nature. Service-Cloud model can describe the whole life cycle
    of the composed web Services: discovery, compose, publish, and terminate.</p>"
