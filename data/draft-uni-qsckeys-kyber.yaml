abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe
    Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm CRYSTALS-Kyber which has been selected for standardization
    by the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process. This includes key identification,
    key serialization, and key compression. The purpose is to provide guidance such
    that the adoption of quantum safe algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented
    evolution of necessary key management standards. Early definition of key material
    standards will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms and at
    the same time as improving interoperability between implementations and minimizing
    divergence across standards.</p>"
