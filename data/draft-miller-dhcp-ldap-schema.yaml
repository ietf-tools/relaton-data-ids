abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a schema for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP). This schema makes it possible to integrate DHCP servers with an LDAP-based
    directory service, allowing an organization to maintain a single store of IP addresses
    and other configuration data provided to clients using the DHCP protocol. Integration
    of DHCP into LDAP directories is desirable since it reduces administrative overhead
    and eliminates the need to maintain multiple server centric configuration databases.
    It is anticipated that this schema will be useful for providing a standardized
    format for the representation of attributes needed by DHCP implementations within
    LDAP-based directory services.</p>"
