abstract:
- content: <p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the author. The address used by the mail transport service is provided separately,
    through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO" command. Before final delivery, handling can
    entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using different destination addresses,
    that lead to the recipient. It can be helpful for a message to have a common way
    to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to include each address used for
    that recipient. This specification defines a header field for this information.
    Email handling information is a matter of modifying the email infrastructure and
    possibly creating privacy concerns. A header field such as this is not automatically
    assured of adoption or use. Therefore it is being published as an Experiment,
    looking for constituency and for operational utility.</p>
