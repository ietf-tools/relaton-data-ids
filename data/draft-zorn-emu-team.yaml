abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the Tunneled Extensible Authentication
    Method (TEAM), which provides an encrypted and authenticated tunnel based on transport
    layer security (TLS) that encapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms. TEAM uses
    TLS to protect against rogue authenticators, protect against various attacks on
    the confidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange and provide
    EAP peer identity privacy. TEAM also provides support for chaining multiple EAP
    mechanisms, cryptographic binding between authentications performed by inner EAP
    mechanisms and the tunnel, exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs), and fragmentation
    and reassembly.</p>"
