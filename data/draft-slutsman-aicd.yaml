abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Call Waiting (ICW) has recently become a standard 'check-list'
    service offered by many Telecommunications providers such as Nortel and Lucent.
    While differing in many details, all these schemes rely on the LEC provider ability
    to detect and signal the 'busy-line' state. This signal triggers the execution
    of the service logic that provides the desirable effect. As a result, the Internet
    Call Waiting is most meaningful when offered by LEC [6] but of limited interest
    for long-distance providers, such as AT&amp;T, MCI, etc. In the broader prospective,
    ICW may be considered a member of the class of services that manage incoming calls
    by making use of an Internet connection. Of special interest the Long Distance
    Providers is a specific subclass of services that 'by-passes' LEC; the purpose
    of this paper is to begin the discussion of what can be implemented when LEC services
    are either not available or not desirable. To this end we introduce a service--Advance
    Internet Caller-ID Delivery Service--that comes 'close' to ICW and yet, does not
    rely on the terminating LEC. In addition, this service related to the PINT 'click-to-dial'
    service and could make use of the PINT protocol. The rest of this document is
    as follows: Section 2 describes the service offered to the end Subscriber. Section
    3 describes the architecture requirements to support the Advance Intenet Calle-ID
    Delivery Service. Section 4 descibes the call flows for typical scenarios. Sections
    5 and 6 respectively supply referneces and provide the author address.</p>"
