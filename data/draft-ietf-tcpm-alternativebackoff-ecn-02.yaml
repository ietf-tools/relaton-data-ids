abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms instantiate shallow
    buffers with burst tolerance to minimise the time that packets spend enqueued
    at a bottleneck. However, shallow buffering can cause noticeable performance degradation
    when TCP is used over a network path with a large bandwidth-delay-product. Traditional
    methods rely on detecting network congestion through reported loss of transport
    packets. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) instead allows a router to directly
    signal incipient congestion. A sending endpoint can distinguish when congestion
    is signalled via ECN, rather than by packet loss. An ECN signal indicates that
    an AQM mechanism has done its job, and therefore the bottleneck network queue
    is likely to be shallow. This document therefore proposes an update to the TCP
    sender-side ECN reaction in congestion avoidance to reduce the Congestion Window
    (cwnd) by a smaller amount than the congestion control algorithm's reaction to
    loss. This document also recommends this approach to be adopted by any other transport
    protocol that implements a congestion control reduction to an ECN congestion signal.</p>"
