abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (L7
    LCP) and describes the use of HTTP and HTTP/TLS as transports for the L7 LCP.
    The L7 LCP is used for retrieving location information from a server within an
    access network. It includes options for retrieving location information in two
    forms: by value and by reference. The protocol is an extensible application-layer
    protocol that is independent of the session layer. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
