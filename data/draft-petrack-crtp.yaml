abstract:
- content: "<p>We analyze the requirement to compress the headers of RTP data streams.
    It is argued that there is a need to define two different compression schemes:
    an 'interim solution' in which only RTP headers are compressed, and a 'complete
    solution' which compresses the RTP/UDP/IP headers only across serial links. It
    is argued that the complete solution must include a new 'guaranteed header compression
    service,' if it is to be useful. The two solutions are described, along with a
    transition strategy which ensures that only the complete solution will be used
    when this is possible.</p>"
