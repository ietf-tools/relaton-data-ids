abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in
    RFCs specifies ten well-known registration policies. Since it was published in
    2017, the IETF's focus for many registries has evolved away from the notion of
    strong IETF review and consensus toward trying to be sure names are registered
    to prevent conflicts. Several of the policies that were heavily used in the past
    appear to present too high a barrier to getting names into registries to prevent
    accidental reuse of the same strings. This specifies an eleventh well-known policy
    that avoids the implied tension, essentially combining two of the existing policies.</p>"
