abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper is an introduction to terms and principles of policy-based
    network configuration management that is based on work in the IETF. A generic
    model for the realization of policy-based network configuration management is
    presented based on these terms. The last portion, and focus of the paper, examines
    the current work of the SNMP Configuration Working Group in the IETF and maps
    that work to the previously defined terms and model.</p>"
