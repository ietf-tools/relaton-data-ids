abstract:
- content: "<p>The BBS Signatures scheme describes a multi-message digital signature,
    that supports selectively disclosing the messages through unlinkable presentations,
    build using zero-knowledge proofs. Each BBS proof reveals no information other
    than the signed messages that the Prover chooses to disclose in that specific
    instance. As such, the Verifier (i.e., the recipient) of the BBS proof, may not
    be able to track those presentations over time. Although in many applications
    this is desirable, there are use cases where that require from the Verifier, to
    be able to track the BBS proofs they receive from the same entity. Examples include
    monitoring the use of access credentials for abnormal activity, monetization etc..
    This document presents the use of pseudonyms with BBS proofs. A pseudonym, is
    a value that will remain constant each time a Prover presents a BBS proof to the
    same Verifier, but will be different (and unlinkable), when the Prover interacts
    with different parties. This provides a way for a recipient to track the presentations
    intended for them, while also hindering them from tracking the Prover's interactions
    with other Verifiers.</p>"
