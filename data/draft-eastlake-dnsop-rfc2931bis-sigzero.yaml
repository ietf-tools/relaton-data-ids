abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies use of the Domain Name System (DNS) SIG Resource
    Record (RR) to provide a public key based method to authenticate DNS requests
    and transactions. Such a resource record, because it has a "type covered" field
    of zero, is frequently called a "SIG(0)". This document obsoletes RFC 2931.</p>
