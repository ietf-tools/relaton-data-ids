abstract:
- content: "<p>The Route Constrain address family can be used by a BGP speaker to
    signal a neighbor its interest in receiving only the routes with a matching route
    target (RT) extended community. This signaling is afi-safi agnostic; the sender
    of a route constrain NLRI with an RT expresses its interest in receiving routes
    with that RT for all afi- safi. The ability to further scope a given RT to a list
    of afi-safi would simplify network operations; then optimal route filtering would
    no longer require that the set of RTs used for different afi-safi be disjoint.
    This document proposes a simple extended community based backward compatible method
    to associate the list of afi-safi of interest to a route constrain NLRI and discusses
    the operational procedure.</p>"
