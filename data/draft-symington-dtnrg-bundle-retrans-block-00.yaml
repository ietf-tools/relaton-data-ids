abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an optional extension block, called a Retransmission
    Block, that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [2] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant
    Network architecture [4]. The Retransmission Block (RB) is designed to be inserted
    by a custodian when re-forwarding a bundle, so as to mark the bundle as a legitimate
    custody-based retransmission rather than an unauthorized bundle duplicate. By
    providing a way for nodes that receive the re- forwarded bundle to distinguish
    it from an unauthorized duplicate, the RB enables those nodes whose local security
    policies do not permit them to forward replayed bundles to detect and delete unauthorized
    bundle replays but forward authorized custody-based bundle retransmissions. This
    document defines the format and processing of this new Retransmission Block.</p>"
