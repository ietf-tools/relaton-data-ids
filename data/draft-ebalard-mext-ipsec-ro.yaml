abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies an improved alternate route optimization procedure
    for Mobile IPv6 designed specifically for environments where IPsec is used between
    peers (most probably with IKE). The replacement of the complex Return Routability
    procedure for a simple mechanism and the removal of HAO and RH2 extensions from
    exchanged packets result in performance and security improvements.</p>"
