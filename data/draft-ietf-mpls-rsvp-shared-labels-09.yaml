abstract:
- content: "<p>As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE networks has grown, the number of Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) supported by individual network elements has increased.
    Various implementation recommendations have been proposed to manage the resulting
    increase in the amount of control-plane state information. However, those changes
    have had no effect on the number of labels that a transit Label Switching Router
    (LSR) has to support in the forwarding plane. That number is governed by the number
    of LSPs transiting or terminated at the LSR and is directly related to the total
    LSP state in the control plane. This document defines a mechanism to prevent the
    maximum size of the label space limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control-plane
    scaling on that node. It introduces the notion of preinstalled 'per-TE link labels'
    that can be shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these TE links. This approach
    significantly reduces the forwarding-plane state required to support a large number
    of LSPs. This couples the feature benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane with the
    simplicity of the Segment Routing (SR) MPLS forwarding plane.</p>"
