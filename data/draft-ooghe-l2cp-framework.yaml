abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to define a framework for a Layer 2
    Control Protocol (L2CP) mechanism between a service-oriented layer 3 edge device
    (e.g. a BRAS) and a layer 2 Access Node (e.g. a DSLAM) in a multi-service architecture.
    This mechanism allows to perform QoS- related, service-related and subscriber-related
    operations. The Layer 2 Control mechanism ensures the transmission of the information
    does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather using a direct
    device-device communication. This document does not specify design requirements
    for network elements.</p>"
