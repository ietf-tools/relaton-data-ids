abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new mode for IPsec ESP, known as Bound End-
    to-End Tunnel (BEET) mode. This mode complements the existing ESP tunnel and transport
    modes, while enhancing end-to-end IPsec usage. It offers the characteristics of
    the tunnel mode but without its usual overhead. The BEET mode is designed to accommodate
    evolving applications of ESP, such as minimalist end-to-end tunnel, mobility and
    multi-address multi-homing. Additionally, this document proposes a new Notify
    Message, USE_BEET_MODE, for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
    specified in [RFC7296], to facilitate BEET mode Security Association negotiation.</p>"
