abstract:
- content: "<p>While using SIGComp [4] based compression in SIP/SDP [5] [6], it is
    imperative to have access to a static dictionary to be used on the first SIP message
    that the compressor sends out. The session set up time can be reduced significantly
    if the compression rate of the first SIP message is considerably high. The existing
    static dictionary for SIP and SDP [2], however, does not include some wireless
    specific data elements. This document introduces these new data elements that
    are specific to various wireless access technologies. These new data elements
    are part of the first SIP message (i.e., originating SIP Invite) used to initiate
    a session.</p>"
