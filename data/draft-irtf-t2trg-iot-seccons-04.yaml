abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard
    Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.
    The security needs for IoT are well-recognized and many standardization steps
    for providing security have been taken, for example, the specification of Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). However,
    security challenges still exist and there are some use cases that lack a suitable
    solution. In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle
    of a thing. Next, we document the various security threats to a thing and the
    challenges that one might face to protect against these threats. Lastly, we discuss
    the next steps needed to ensure roll out of secure IoT services. This document
    is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG).</p>"
