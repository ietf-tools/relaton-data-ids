abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for dynamically determining CE/FE
    element bindings discovery and inter-FE topology discovery and maintenance. Such
    a mechanism is needed for all these elements in the set to behave as a single
    network element, as required by the ForCES architecture. The discovery protocol
    operates during both the pre-association and post-association phases of ForCES
    protocol.</p>"
