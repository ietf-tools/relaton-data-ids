- content: "<p>The National Emergency Number Association (NENA)'s mission is to foster
    the technological advancement, availability, and implementation of a universal
    emergency telephone number system in North America. NENA has an active effort
    to develop a new architecture for emergency call handling known as 'i3' being
    developed in its Long Term Definition working group. The following requirements
    are a subset of the requirements of the i3 work which relate to ecrit work. NENA
    understands the global nature of the Internet, and is eager to work with the IETF
    to ensure that emergency call processing meets the needs of users in North America.</p>"
