abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet draft enhances cellular-IP mobility protocol with a Context
    Transfer mechanism aiming to further optimise the handoff operation in mobile
    networks. Within a cellular-IP domain, during the handoff from one cellular-IP
    base station to another, cellular-IP packets could be used to initiate and transfer
    authorised context from the previous cellular-IP base station via the cellular-IP
    gateway to the new cellular-IP base station. This draft presents how the context
    transfer extension introduced could facilitate in reducing latency and packet
    loss by avoiding the signalling required between the mobile node and the new base
    station in re-establishing the desired state information.</p>"
