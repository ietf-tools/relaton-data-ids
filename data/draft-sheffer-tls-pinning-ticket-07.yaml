abstract:
- content: "<p>Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from appropriately
    authenticating the TLS server. Several alternatives have been proposed to detect
    this situation and prevent a client from establishing a TLS session with a TLS
    end point authenticated with an illegitimate public-key certificate, but none
    is currently in wide use. This document proposes to extend TLS with opaque pinning
    tickets as a way to pin the server's identity. During an initial TLS session,
    the server provides an original encrypted pinning ticket. In subsequent TLS session
    establishment, upon receipt of the pinning ticket, the server proves its ability
    to decrypt the pinning ticket and thus the ownership if the pinning protection
    key. The client can now safely conclude that the TLS session is established with
    the same TLS server as the original TLS session. One of the important properties
    of this proposal is that no manual management actions are required.</p>"
