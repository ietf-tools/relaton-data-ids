abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use
    its packet switched backbone to provide Virtual Private Network services for its
    ISO/CLNS customers. These customers may be islands of ISO/CLNS networks which
    are part of the Service Provider network itself and are interconnected by the
    Service Provider's IP core. This method reuses the 2547 style BGP-MPLS VPN model.
    This document defines an ISO/CLNS VPN address family and describes the corresponding
    ISO/CLNS VPN route distribution mechanism using "Multiprotocol BGP".</p>
