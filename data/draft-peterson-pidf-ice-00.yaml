abstract:
- content: <p>Many presence applications use availability information about a presentity
    to show a watcher their readiness to communicate. In the case of real-time multimedia
    communications, the readiness of the presentity to communicate does not entail
    that the network topography will permit communication to occur. Accordingly, this
    document specifies a means to integrate Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) with presence. Presentities employing the Presence Information Data Format
    (PIDF) can use the extensions in this draft to advertise their ability to undergo
    a preliminary ICE check, and thus allow watchers to instigate ICE tests to ascertain
    whether or not the intervening network is friendly to real-time multimedia communication.
    In a presence application, the results of this test could be displayed to watchers
    as the relative "connectivity status" of the presentity.</p>
