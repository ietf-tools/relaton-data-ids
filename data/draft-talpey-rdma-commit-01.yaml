abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)
    protocols to provide capabilities in support of enhanced remotely-directed data
    placement on persistent memory-addressable devices. The extensions include new
    operations supporting remote commitment to persistence of remotely-managed buffers,
    which can provide enhanced guarantees and improve performance for low-latency
    storage applications. In addition to, and in support of these, extensions to local
    behaviors are described, which may be used to guide implementation, and to ease
    adoption. This document updates RFC5040 (Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol
    (RDMAP)) and updates RFC7306 (RDMA Protocol Extensions).</p>"
