abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a working definition of 'absolute scalability'
    and 'weak scalability' of a method of an ad hoc network, and also a way of comparing
    the scalability of two different methods. A method may be a protocol, an algorithm,
    or a scheme whose scalability needs to be evaluated. For example, it may be a
    routing protocol or a MAC protocol. 'Absolute scalability' emphasizes the asymptotic
    behavior of a set of metrics, which define the efficiency of the network as a
    network parameter tends to infinity. 'Weak scalability' refers to the comparison
    of the metrics over a given range. Finally, fairness in the comparison of these
    metrics is discussed.</p>"
