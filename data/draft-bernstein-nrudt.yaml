abstract:
- content: "<p>The UNIX sendmail program has for many years supported a Return-Receipt-To
    (RRT) header field that requests a notice of successful final delivery. Notice-Requested-Upon-Delivery-To
    (NRUDT) has the same basic function. The big difference is that RRT lists the
    sender's address, while NRUDT lists the recipient's address. This change is critical.
    RRT works poorly for messages to multiple recipients, because it requests a notice
    from every recipient. RRT in a message to a large mailing list produces a giant,
    usually unintentional, flood of mail. This problem is so severe that RRT has been
    disabled in recent versions of sendmail. NRUDT is designed to be adopted immediately,
    with minimal disruption, as a solution to the problems of RRT. Note that NRUDT
    is merely a request for notification; unlike the link-level Delivery Status Notification
    SMTP extension, NRUDT does not provide a guarantee of notification.</p>"
