abstract:
- content: "<p>It is a common practice to install a (soft or hard) loopback on a circuit
    interface for various purposes (e.g. circuit turn-up test). However, this practice
    results in disabling IPv6 on an interface even after the loopback is removed,
    due to the way IPv6 duplicate address detection is performed. This document describes
    a mechanism to allow IPv6 to self-heal after such a loopback is placed &amp; removed.</p>"
