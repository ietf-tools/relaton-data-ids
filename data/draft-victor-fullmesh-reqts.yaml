abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo enumerates requirements to realize full-mesh multiparty conferencing
    using baseline Session Initiation Protocol. Primary requirement is to advertise
    conference members’ addresses to new participants by concatenating multiple SDP
    session descriptions together. This particular requirement can solve several well-known

    full-mesh conferencing for a while now.</p>"
