abstract:
- content: "<p>GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Bonding as an L3 overlay
    tunneling mechanism is used for Hybrid Access (HA) bonding between HCPE (Hybrid
    Customer Premises Equipment) and HAG (Hybrid Access Gateway). The bonding performance
    depends upon the performance for each individual link. This document specifies
    a trying overflow mechanism to avoid the bonding performance downgrading due to
    the situation that an individual link is disrupted or its quality downgrages too
    much so that the bonding is no longer applicable.</p>"
