abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an innovative frame, called PLIC,("Performance
    Layer Inboard Computing") able to support active, passive or hybrid performance
    measurements on any kind of unicast and multicast service passing through a network.
    It is based on an algorithm which, through a distributed computation, floods the
    performance measurements of each node to the rest of the network, without necessity
    of any external topology database or operation support system. It has been invented
    and engineered in the Telecom Italia Core Network.</p>
