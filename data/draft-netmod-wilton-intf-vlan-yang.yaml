abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines YANG models to add support for classifying traffic
    received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to sub-interfaces based
    on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN frame headers. Primarily the classification
    is based on VLAN identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but the model also has support
    for matching on some other layer 2 frame header fields and is designed to be easily
    extensible to match on other arbitrary header fields. The model differs from an
    IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in that the configuration is interface/sub-interface
    based as opposed to being based on membership of a 802.1Q VLAN bridge.</p>"
