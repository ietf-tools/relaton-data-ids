abstract:
- content: "<p>The P4 research community has published a paper to show how to split
    a P4 program into sub-programs which run on heterogeneous network nodes in a network.
    Examples for nodes are a network switch, a smartNIC, or a host machine. The paper
    has developed artifacts to split program based on latency, data rate, cost, etc.
    However, the paper does not mention any requirements. To provide guidance, this
    document covers requirements for splitting P4 programs for heterogeneous network
    nodes.</p>"
