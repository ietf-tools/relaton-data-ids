abstract:
- content: "<p>Regional Registration provides a mechanism for MIPv4 to localise registrations.
    The Mobile Node (MN) initially registers to the HA via the Gateway Foreign Agent
    (GFA) so that the HA can learn the GFA Care of Address (CoA). The MN can then
    subsequently use a Regional Registration to maintain the binding in the GFA as
    the MN moves and changes its Foreign Agent (FA) CoA or Collocated CoA (CCoA).
    It can continue to do so whilst a MN remains under the GFA through which the MN
    sent the Home Registration. The GFA performs CoA switching between the GFA CoA
    and that used by the MN (CCoA or FA CoA). Whilst the regional registration provides
    localisation, it does not at the same time provide registration aggregation for
    MNs employing multiple HoAs. The ability to concurrently support multiple MN addresses
    from arbitrary addressing domains is a 3GPP commercial and technical requirement
    and therefore of interest to operators seeking to move to an all-IP solution based
    on MIP. In addition, the GFA is a very stateful element in the core of the Internet
    that cannot be bypassed on failure through routing updates. This draft describes
    a complementary, less stateful model for localisation that in addition supports
    aggregation both for regional-like registration and hand-offs. The model re-uses
    as much as possible from the home registration signalling model of [RegTun] but
    requires a new form of aggregated regional registration.</p>"
