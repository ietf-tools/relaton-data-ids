abstract:
- content: "<p>While there is substantial community interest in next-generation multipath-capable
    Internet transports, evolutionary pressures have gradually eroded the simplicity
    of the Internet's original transport architecture to a point where it is no longer
    realistically applicable to new tranports. This document proposes a new architectural
    framework for next-generation multipath-capable transport protocols, focusing
    immediately on multipath TCP but taking care to allow for generalization to other
    multipath-capable transports. The architecture places emphasis on enabling new
    multipath features in a safe, TCP-friendly, and backward-compatible fashion, retaining
    full interoperability with both existing applications and existing network infrastructure,
    and enabling reuse of existing protocols as much as possible while providing incremental
    deployment paths to new, more powerful and/or more efficient protocols. The architecture
    re-establishes the long-lost principles of end-to-end reliability and fate sharing,
    in the presence of existing and future network middleboxes, and enables the deployment
    of transport-neutral end-to-end protection without interfering with these policy-enforcing
    or performance-enhancing middleboxes. This document describes architecture goals,
    a layering model supporting these goals, abstract properties of the interfaces
    between the architecture's new layers, general approaches to multipath congestion
    control and how they fit into the architecture, realistic protocol design and
    incremental deployment paths, and ways in which this document complements and
    relates to ongoing protocol design activities in the IETF.</p>"
