abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an authentication protocol based on TLS pre shared
    key (TLS-PSK), RFC 4279. Identity and psk attributes, defined in TLS-PSK are extracted
    from EMV chips, which are widely deployed for payments transactions. The goal
    of this protocol is to provide a strong mutual authentication transparent for
    the end users and guarantying the confidentiality and the integrity of exchanged
    data over Internet network. This is a new step avoiding the use of static passwords
    for on-line services, such as electronic banking or electronic payment.</p>"
