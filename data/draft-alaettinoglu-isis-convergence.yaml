abstract:
- content: "<p>It is possible for link-state routing protocols to converge in link
    propagation time scales, that is, in tens of milliseconds. However, current deployments
    of ISIS[ISIS-ISO][ISIS-IP], a link-state routing protocol, are not anywhere near
    this point. In this paper, we present some analyses of ISIS convergence by showing
    its behavior upon link/router failures and repairs, and its scaling properties
    to large networks, both in terms of number of nodes and links. We then explore
    changes needed in the ISIS specification and implementations to reach IGP convergence
    in milliseconds. Our results are based on experimentation done with ISIS, but
    some of the findings may apply to OSPF as well.</p>"
