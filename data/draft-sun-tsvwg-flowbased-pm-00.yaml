abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance measurements of service flow are becoming significant
    important for administrators monitoring the fitness of the network. This memo
    defines an end-to-end application-based performance measurement method, which
    is achieved by generating synthetic measurement packets, injecting them to the
    network and analyzing the statistics carried in the measurement packets.</p>"
