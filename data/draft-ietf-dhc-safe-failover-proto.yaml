abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHCP protocol [RFC 2131] [1] allows multiple DHCP servers. A recent
    draft, the DHCP Failover Protocol [3], has been distributed which is designed
    to provide a redundant DHCP solution. While clearly a work in progress, it is
    equally clear that it can be made to work and meet the goals that the authors
    have set for it. One of the goals of the Failover protocol is that it should avoid
    duplicate IP address allocations, except under some rare circumstances. While
    this approach may be quite reasonable in a wide variety of environ- ments, some
    environments require a DHCP redundancy solution which can (optionally) ensure
    that no possibility of duplicate IP address allo- cation exists. The Safe Failover
    protocol is designed to build on top of the Failover protocol, and add to it certain
    protocol exchanges, prac- tices and algorithms which will create a DHCP redundancy
    solution which avoids duplicate IP address allocation.</p>"
