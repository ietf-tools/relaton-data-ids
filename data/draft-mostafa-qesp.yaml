abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new IPSec protocol called QoS-friendly Encapsulating
    Security Payload (Q-ESP). Q-ESP provides confidentiality, data origin authentication,
    anti-reply, connection less integrity, and facilitates QoS active admission control.
    The currently implemented IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) protocol
    is not QoS friendly as it encrypts the upper layer transmission protocol and prevents
    network control devices such as routers and switches from utilizing this information
    in performing classification appropriately. In this document we provide the specification
    of Q-ESP which gives the same security services provided by ESP, in addition to
    strong source and destination addresses authentication and its ability to facilitate
    QoS classification.</p>"
