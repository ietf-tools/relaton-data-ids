abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an overview of SNMPv3 compliance with the AAA
    protocol requirements for network access as stipulated in the 'Network Access
    AAA Evaluation Criteria' Internet Draft dated April 26, 2000 [1]. SNMPv3 protocol
    features and capabilities directly support many of the AAA requirements. In addition,
    the more sophisticated management model (see Section 5, below) now underlying
    SNMP -- which has evolved from the original model introduced in the late 1980s
    under the guidance of extensive use in the field -- enables the design, development,
    and deployment of more sophisticated management applications geared to the overall
    body of AAA protocol requirements (or sub-sets thereof).</p>"
