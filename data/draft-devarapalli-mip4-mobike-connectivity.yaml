abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise users require mobility and secure connectivity when they
    roam and connect to the services offered in the enterprise. Secure connectivity
    is required when the user connects to the enterprise from an untrusted network.
    Mobility is beneficial when the user moves, either inside or outside the enterprise
    network, and acquires a new IP address. This document describes a solution using
    Mobile IPv4 and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure connectivity
    and mobility.</p>"
