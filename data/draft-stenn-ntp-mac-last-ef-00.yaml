abstract:
- content: <p>NTPv4 is defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and it and earlier versions
    of the NTP Protocol have supported symmetric private key Message Authentication
    Code (MAC) authentication. MACs were first described in Appendix C of RFC 1305
    [RFC1305] and are further described in RFC 5905 [RFC5905]. As the number of Extension
    Fields grows there is an increasing chance of a parsing ambiguity when deciding
    if the "next" set of data is an Extension Field or a legacy MAC. This proposal
    defines two new Extension Fields to avoid this ambiguity. One is used to signifiy
    that it is the last Extension Field in the packet. If present, any subsequent
    data MUST be considered to be a legacy MAC. The other allows one or more MACs
    to be encapsulated in an Extension Field. If all parties in an association support
    MAC-EF, the use of a legacy MAC may be avoided.</p>
