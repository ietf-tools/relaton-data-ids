abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version
    4. The Pip header defines source and destination ID fields whose primary function
    it is to identify the source and destination of a Pip packet. While Pip systems
    treat the IDs as flat for the purpose of identification, it is useful to have
    hierarchical structure in the ID for other purposes, such as for doing a reverse
    DNS lookup on the ID. This internet-draft defines the structure of Pip IDs.</p>"
