abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an
    interface on a network device. Routing protocols were developed based on the assumption
    that a destination address had this semantic. Over time, routing decisions were
    enhanced to route packets according to additional information carried within the
    packets and dependent on policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers.
    Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP addresses. The intent is
    usually to facilitate routing decisions based solely on the address and without
    the need to find and process information carried in other fields within the packets.
    This document presents a brief survey of technologies related to IP semantic addressing
    and routing proposals. Inclusion of a proposal or technique in this document does
    not imply any level of support. A partner document examines the challenges for
    routing in this context.</p>"
