abstract:
- content: "<p>Voice messaging evolved as telephone answering service into a full
    send, receive, and forward messaging paradigm with unique message features, semantics
    and usage patterns. Voice messaging was introduced on special purpose computers
    that interface to a telephone switch and provide call answering and voice messaging
    services. Traditionally, messages sent from one voice messaging system to another
    were transported using analog networking protocols based on DTMF signaling and
    analog voice playback. As the demand for networking increases, there was a need
    for a standard high-quality digital protocol to connect these machines. VPIM has
    successfully demonstrated its usefulness as this new standard. VPIM is widely
    implemented and is seeing deployment in early adopter customer networks. This
    document clarifies ambiguities found in the earlier specification and is consistent
    with implementation practice. The profile is referred to as VPIM (Voice Profile
    for Internet Mail) in this document. This second revision of the version 2 of
    obsoletes RFC 2421 which less precisely describes version 2 of the profile.</p>"
