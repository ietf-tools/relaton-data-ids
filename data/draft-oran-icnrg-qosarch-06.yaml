abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a position paper. It documents the author's personal views
    on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in Information-Centric
    Networking (ICN) protocols like Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) or Named Data
    Networking (NDN), which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop
    forwarding state as their fundamental machinery. It argues that such protocols
    demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP and
    proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated
    QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect
    of caches in addition to memory, CPU, and link bandwidth as resources that should
    be subject to explicitly unfair resource allocation. The proposed methods are
    intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed
    to achieve transport- and higher-layer QoS objectives. It explicitly excludes
    any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE), which can only be assessed and
    controlled at the application layer or above. This document is not a product of
    the IRTF Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG) but has been through
    formal Last Call and has the support of the participants in the research group
    for publication as an individual submission.</p>"
