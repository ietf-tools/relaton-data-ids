abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of countermeasures for attacks against service provider backbone
    network infrastructure have been specified or proposed, each of them usually targeting
    a subset of the problem space. There has never been a more generic analysis of
    the actual problems, and which countermeasures are even necessary (and where).
    This document tries to provide that higher-level view.</p>"
