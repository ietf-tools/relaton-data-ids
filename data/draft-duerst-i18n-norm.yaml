abstract:
- content: "<p>The Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646, Unicode] covers a very
    wide repertoire of characters. The IETF, in [RFC 2277], requires that future IETF
    protocols support UTF-8 [RFC 2279], an ASCII-compatible encoding of UCS. The wide
    range of characters included in the UCS has lead to some cases of duplicate encodings.
    This document proposes that in IETF protocols, the class of duplicates called
    canonical equivalents be dealt with by using Early Uniform Normalization according
    to Unicode Normalization Form C, Canonical Composition (NFC) [UTR15]. This document
    describes both Early Uniform Normalization and Normalization Form C.</p>"
