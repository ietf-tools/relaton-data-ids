abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of metrics for networking services with
    performance requirements expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLO). These metrics,
    referred to as Precision Availability Metrics (PAM), are useful for defining and
    monitoring of SLOs. Specifically, PAM can be used by providers and/or users of
    the Network Slice service to assess whether the service is provided in compliance
    with its specified quality, i.e., in accordance with its defined SLOs.</p>"
