abstract:
- content: "<p>The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes an XML-
    based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or civic location
    information to service contact Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). LoST servers
    can be located anywhere but a placement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access
    network, is desireable. Such a LoST server placement provides benefits in disaster
    situations with intermittent network connectivity regarding the resiliency of
    emergency service communication. This document describes how a LoST client can
    discover a LoST server using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).</p>"
