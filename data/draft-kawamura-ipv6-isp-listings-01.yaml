abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many web sites that list IPv6 enabled service providers,
    or attempt to categorize the IPv6 capability of ISPs. While these opinions are
    helpful, there is no standard criteria used by the sites, so it is difficult to
    compare the results. This document surveys current listings, and proposes a set
    of guidelines that could be taken into consideration by theses sites, or by anyone
    looking to evaluate an ISP's IPv6 capability. This guideline can also be used
    as a checklist by ISPs planning activation of IPv6 in their network.</p>"
