abstract:
- content: <p>This short memo outlines the author's thoughts of current status and
    future development questions around IETF's financing mechanisms. This memo is
    also input for discussion that the IETF community should have. The memo is the
    first part of the author's goal to document the status and various challenges
    and opportunities associated with the IETF Administrative Activity (IASA), in
    the context of the so called "IASA 2.0" project. The memo has no particular official
    standing, nor does it claim to represent more than the authors' thinking at the
    time of writing.</p>
