abstract:
- content: "<p>In some use cases, an SRv6 policy's SID list ends with the policy endpoint's
    node SID, and the traffic steered (over policy) already ensures that it is taken
    to the policy endpoint. In such cases, the SID list can be optimized by excluding
    the endpoint Node SID when installing the policy. This draft specifies a PCEP
    extension to indicate whether the endpoint's node SID needs to be included or
    excluded when installing the SRv6 Policy.</p>"
