abstract:
- content: "<p>Network equipment are often configured by a variety of network management
    systems (NMS), protocols, and teams. If a network issue arises (e.g., because
    of a wrong configuration change), it is important to quickly identify the root
    cause and obtain the reason for pushing that modification. Another potential network
    issue can stem from concurrent NMSes with overlapping intents, each having their
    own tasks to perform. In such a case, it is important to map the respective modifications
    to its originating NMS. This document specifies a NETCONF mechanism to automatically
    map the configuration modifications to their source, up to a specific NMS change
    request. Such a mechanism is required, in particular, for autonomous networks
    to trace the source of a particular configuration change that led to an anomaly
    detection. This mechanism facilitates the troubleshooting, the post mortem analysis,
    and in the end the closed loop automation required for self-healing networks.
    The specification also includes a YANG module that is meant to map a local configuration
    change to the corresponding change transaction, up to the controller or even the
    orchestrator.</p>"
