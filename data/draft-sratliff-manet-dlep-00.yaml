abstract:
- content: "<p>When routing devices rely on modems to effect communications over wireless
    links, they need timely and accurate knowledge of the characteristics of the link
    (speed, state, etc.) in order to make forwarding decisions. In mobile or other
    environments where these characteristics change frequently, manual configurations
    or the inference of state through routing or transport protocols does not allow
    the router to make the best decisions. A bidirectional, event- driven communication
    channel between the router and the modem is necessary.</p>"
