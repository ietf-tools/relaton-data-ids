abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is an increasing
    need for simplified mechanisms for IPv4 address allocation within multi- segment
    networks connected by a single router. This issue can arise, for example, in the
    case of a home network supporting 802.11 wireless as well as Ethernet. In multi-segment
    small networks connected by a single router, it may be desirable to provide for
    consistent IPv4 addressing in the case where the small network has not been assigned
    a routable IPv4 address prefix. This draft describes how this problem may be solved
    through implementation of a mini-DHCP server within the router. The router may
    either be disconnected from the Internet, in which case the hosts on the multiple
    segments will only be able to reach other, or the router may offer Internet connectivity
    via Network Address Translation (NAT), or another suitable mechanism, such as
    RSIP.</p>"
