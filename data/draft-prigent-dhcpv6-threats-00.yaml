abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses numerous security problems which DHCPv6 could
    be a victim of. We believe DHCPv6 will be the configuration method of choice.
    Despite of this fact, we think we have to describe a number of security issues
    one must be aware of in case of using DHCPv6 in an open environment.</p>"
