abstract:
- content: "<p>A SAID (Self-Addressing IDentifier) is a special type of content- addressable
    identifier based on encoded cryptographic digest that is self-referential. The
    SAID derivation protocol defined herein enables verification that a given SAID
    is uniquely cryptographically bound to a serialization that includes the SAID
    as a field in that serialization. Embedding a SAID as a field in the associated
    serialization indicates a preferred content-addressable identifier for that serialization
    that facilitates greater interoperability, reduced ambiguity, and enhanced security
    when reasoning about the serialization. Moreover, given sufficient cryptographic
    strength, a cryptographic commitment such as a signature, digest, or another SAID,
    to a given SAID is essentially equivalent to a commitment to its associated serialization.
    Any change to the serialization invalidates its SAID thereby ensuring secure immutability
    evident reasoning with SAIDs about serializations or equivalently their SAIDs.
    Thus SAIDs better facilitate immutably referenced data serializations for applications
    such as Verifiable Credentials or Ricardian Contracts. SAIDs are encoded with
    CESR (Composable Event Streaming Representation) [CESR] which includes a pre-pended
    derivation code that encodes the cryptographic suite or algorithm used to generate
    the digest. A CESR primitive's primary expression (alone or in combination ) is
    textual using Base64 URL-safe characters. CESR primitives may be round-tripped
    (alone or in combination) to a compact binary representation without loss. The
    CESR derivation code enables cryptographic digest algorithm agility in systems
    that use SAIDs as content addresses. Each serialization may use a different cryptographic
    digest algorithm as indicated by its derivation code. This provides interoperable
    future proofing. CESR was developed for the [KERI] protocol.</p>"
