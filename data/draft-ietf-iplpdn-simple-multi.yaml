abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method for splitting and recombining datagrams
    across multiple logical data links. Such facilities are desirable to exploit the
    potential for increased bandwidth offered by multiple bearer channels in ISDN,
    yet to do so in such away that minimizes reordering of packets. This is accomplished
    by means of new PPP options and protocols. This draft incorporates comments arising
    at the 27th IETF meeting in Amsterdam.</p>"
