abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.
    Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via Hello subprotocol. Hello
    OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-way connectivity within time. When a
    router restarts its OSPF software, it may not know its neighbors. If such a router
    sends a hello packet on an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency,
    which may not be desirable in certain conditions. This memo provides a mechanism
    that allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors about the restart process.
    Note that this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.</p>"
