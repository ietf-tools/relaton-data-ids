abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification attempts to synthesize experience garnered over
    the years in the deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP and IPv4 Link- Local
    addresses. Given this experience, this document suggests optimizations for IPv4
    network attachment detection as well as heuristics for determining when assignment
    of an IPv4 Link-Local address is appropriate.</p>"
