abstract:
- content: "<p>AI Agents are software applications that utilize Large Language Models
    (LLM)s to interact with humans (or other AI Agents) for purposes of performing
    tasks. AI Agents can make use of resources - including APIs and documents - to
    perform those tasks, and are capable of reasoning about which resources to use.
    To facilitate AI agent operation, AI agents need to communicate with users, and
    then interact with other resources over the Internet, including APIs and other
    AI agents. This document describes a framework for AI Agent communications on
    the Internet, identifying the various protocols that come into play. It introduces
    use cases that motivate features and functions that need to be present in those
    protocols. It also provides a brief survey of existing work in standardizing AI
    agent protocols, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the Agent to Agent
    Protocol (A2A) and the Agntcy Framework, and describes how those works fit into
    this framework. The primary objective of this document is to set the stage for
    possible standards activity at the IETF in this space.</p>"
