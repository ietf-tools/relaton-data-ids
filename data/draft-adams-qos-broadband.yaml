abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal which deals with congestion conditions
    that may arise when a home or SME customer requests too many simultaneous flows
    to be forwarded down a DSL link or other access technology. It provides a solution
    to guaranteeing certain flows while making others (typically the latest or another
    flow selected for policy reasons) the subject of focused packet discards. It has
    a number of significant benefits over other possible solutions, such as classical
    RSVP, and these are also listed in the document.</p>"
