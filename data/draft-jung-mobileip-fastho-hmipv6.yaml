abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. The MIPv6
    mobility could be more enhanced by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6, in which MIPv6
    is benefited from all the advantages of the respective schemes. An additional
    benefit by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6 is that the overall handover latency in
    FMIPv6 will be more reduced since in HMIPv6 the MN sends a location update with
    the local MAP, rather than the HA and CN that are typically further way. This
    document describes how to use FMIPv6 for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6). The F-HMIPv6 is designed
    to be friendly with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6, the tunnel
    for fast handover is established between MAP and NAR, rather than between PAR
    and NAR. For this purpose, the MN exchanges the FMIPv6 messages with MAP, not
    PAR. The F-HMIPv6 utilizes the FMIPv6 messages for handover support without further
    defining any new messages.</p>"
