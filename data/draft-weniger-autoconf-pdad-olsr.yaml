abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes PDAD-OLSR, a solution for configured address uniqueness
    maintenance in MANETs running the OLSR protocol. It utilizes the Passive Duplicate
    Address Detection (PDAD) concept, which enables nodes to passively detect duplicate
    addresses in the network (e.g., occurring after network merging) by analyzing
    received routing protocol messages. Due to its passive nature, PDAD-OLSR is very
    efficient in terms of bandwidth consumption. Moreover, it can prevent the contamination
    of routing tables with wrong routing information resulting from address conflicts.</p>"
