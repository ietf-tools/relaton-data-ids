abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a set of Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service attributes
    which have been widely used in different types of fixed networks though they don't
    appear as standard attributes. Each of these attributes has for long been part
    of many vendor dictionnaries, thus presented in different approaches and different
    syntaxes. This document try to solve this in an effort to present them in a standard,
    common way, based on approaches found in multiple dictionnaries.</p>"
