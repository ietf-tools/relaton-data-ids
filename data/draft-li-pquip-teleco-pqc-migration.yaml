abstract:
- content: "<p>Telecommunications (Telecom) networks are important infrastructure.
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provides security specifications for
    telecom networks, including network devices and user terminals. Meanwhile, the
    security protocols from IETF widely used in telecom systems. In the docuemnt,
    we present some post- quantum risks and assessments that exist in current telecom
    network based on the sepcifiction. From the perspective of RFC, this document
    analyzes possible post-quantum migration cases and potential strategy in typical
    telecom network scenarios. The strategy includes the suggestion of related IETF
    protocols and profiles, which can also provide guidance for other similar communication
    systems.</p>"
