abstract:
- content: "<p>When a connection request comes in a mesh optical network, the routers
    automatically choose the suitable routing paths and wavelength to it according
    to the network topology and link state information saved in its global link state
    database. Because some of these wavelengths may be released or occupied at any
    time, the global state database is always out of date and needed by update by
    some an update policy. A suitable link state update policy is critical, since
    that a high frequency update polity imposes heavy burden on network, while a low
    frequency one would increase the inaccurate of the global link state database.
    In this paper, we propose a link state update policy, named EA-HD policy, which
    considers two index of a link, one is the Hamming distance between the local link
    state database and the global link state database, and another is the used ratio
    of its wavelengths. The proposed update policy gets a trade-off between the accurate
    of link state information and its update cost. Simulation proves that our scheme
    achieve a good performance in traffic blocking probability while maintaining moderate
    volume of update traffic.</p>"
