abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards
    track within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the level of vendor
    support and deployment has been relatively slow, despite the desire of many to
    deploy technology to deliver services with different levels of quality of service
    (QoS) to their customers. The reasons for this are arguably well-understood and
    documented and are not the focus of this memo. This memo seeks to initiate a dialog
    about the design of a new version of RSVPv1, which we call RSVPv2. The RSVPv2
    framework could use the combination of two concepts. The concept of ALSP (Application
    Layer Signaling Protocol) and the concept of Common Signaling Transport Protocol
    (CSTP). This memo outlines the motivation for doing this work and provides design
    guidelines and specifications for the development of the RSVPv2 ALSP. RSVPv2 ALSP
    is an ALSP type that can be a part of the RSVPv2 framework.</p>"
