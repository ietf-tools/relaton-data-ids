abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) technology grows with the development
    of wireless communication and sensors, many people are interested in Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), which is the representative protocol of the IoT.
    In addition, attempts have been made to apply CoAP to sensors that support existing
    real-time streaming services. However, the CoAP is not suitable for services to
    support streaming services such as smart band and CCTV. To overcome this drawback,
    there is an extension called CoAP Observe, but streaming services using CoAP Observe
    imposes a load on the server, which is not suitable for environments where low
    power devices act as servers, such as data transfer between sensors and gateways.
    In this specification, we are considering the situation in which the sensor acts
    as a server, and in this environment, we define one mechanism to provide efficient
    streaming service.</p>"
