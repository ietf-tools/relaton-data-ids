abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally data retrieval from SNMP entities has been done using
    GET, GETNEXT and the GETBULK PDU's. These mechanisms have worked well for some
    instances. However, there are many cases where they are inefficient in retrieving
    data that the management application needs to access. The EOS (Evolution of SNMP)
    Working Group is investigating new PDU's to be used to gather information from
    SNMP entities. This memo proposes a select PDU that will operate in much the same
    way as SQL Select.</p>"
