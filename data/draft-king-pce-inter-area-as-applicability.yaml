abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) may be used for computing services
    that traverse multi-area and multi-AS Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered (TE) networks. This document examines
    the applicability of the PCE architecture, protocols, and protocol extensions
    for computing multi-area and multi-AS paths in MPLS and GMPLS networks.</p>"
