abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version three (SNMPv3)
    requires that an application know the identifier (snmpEngineID) of the remote
    SNMP protocol engine in order to retrieve or manipulate objects maintained on
    the remote SNMP entity. This document introduces a well-known localEngineID and
    a discovery mechanism that can be used to learn the snmpEngineID of a remote SNMP
    protocol engine. The proposed mechanism is independent of the features provided
    by SNMP security models and may also be used by other protocol interfaces providing
    access to managed objects. This document updates RFC 3411. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
