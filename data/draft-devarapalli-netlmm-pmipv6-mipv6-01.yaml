    developed in the IETF. Mobile IPv6 is a host-based mobility management protocol
    that has no restrictions in terms of applicability in a domain. This document
    captures some of the scenarios where Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv6 are used
    together. It also describes how the two protocols can work together.</p>"
