    applicable to a range of on-demand ad hoc networking protocols that allow an ad
    hoc node to distribute its active flows across multiple routing paths. These extensions
    are based on the filter structure defined in NOMAD to enable a filtering behavior
    at the originator and the destination nodes.</p>"
