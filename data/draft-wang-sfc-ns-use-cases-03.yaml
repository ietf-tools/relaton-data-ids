abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise networks deploy a variety of security devices to protect
    the network, hosts and endpoints. Network security devices, both hardware and
    virtual, operate at all OSI layers with scanning and analysis capabilities for
    application content. Multiple specific devices are often deployed together for
    breadth and depth of defense. This document describes use cases of Service Function
    Chaining (SFC) when deploying network security devices in the manner described
    above and also puts forth requirements for their effective operation.</p>"
