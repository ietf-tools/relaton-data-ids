abstract:
- content: "<p>I In current multipath load balancing network scenario, all path detection
    mechanisms have a defect. A typical load balancing route selection mechanism cannot
    cover all forwarding paths, which will cause missing detection.This document describes
    how to extend a new path detection mechanism to instruct intermediate devices
    to send probe packets to all downstream paths. This new mechanism is named load-sharing
    multipath replication forwarding (LMRF).</p>"
