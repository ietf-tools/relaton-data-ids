abstract:
- content: "<p>Inclusion is a stated goal of the IETF but obtaining a just and equitable
    inclusive result that guarantees proportional representation from marginalized
    groups requires intersectionality. The use of badge dots are IETF can signify
    one's intersectionality status and be used to ensure more inclusion and further
    social justice.</p>"
