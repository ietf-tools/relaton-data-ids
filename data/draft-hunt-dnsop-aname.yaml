abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the "ANAME" DNS RR type, to provide similar functionality
    to CNAME, but only redirects type A and AAAA queries. Unlike CNAME, an ANAME can
    coexist with other record types. The ANAME RR allows zone owners to redirect queries
    for apex domain names in a standards compliant manner.</p>
