abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Address Settlement by Peer-to-Peer (ASP), a peer-to-peer
    (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol
    provides its clients with an abstract hash table service between a set of cooperating
    peers that form the P2P network. ASP is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be utilized by other applications with similar
    requirements. ASP introduces the notion of usages, which are a collection of data
    types that are required for a particular application. For SIP, these types include
    location, STUN and TURN servers. ASP defines a security model based on a certificate
    enrollment service that provides peers with unique identities. ASP also provides
    protocol extensibility and defines a migration methodology, allowing for major
    upgrades of the P2P network without service disruption.</p>"
