abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
    consumption of the Internet using a collaborative approach between Autonomous
    Systems (AS). We identify the low-power paths among the AS and then use Traffic
    Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets along the paths. Such low-power
    paths can be identified by using the available power-to-bandwidth (PWR) ratio
    as an additional constraint in the Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm.
    For re- routing the data traffic through these low-power paths, the Inter-AS Traffic
    Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans multiple AS can be used. Extensions
    to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) can be used to disseminate the PWR ratio
    metric among the AS thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power
    consumption. Since calculating the low-power paths can be computationally intensive,
    a graph-labeling heuristic is also proposed. This heuristic reduces the computational
    complexity but may provide a sub- optimal low-power path. The feasibility of our
    approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to a subset of the Internet.
    The techniques proposed in this paper for the Inter-AS power reduction require
    minimal modifications to the existing features of the Internet. The proposed techniques
    can be extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Intra-AS paths,
    through suitable modifications.</p>"
