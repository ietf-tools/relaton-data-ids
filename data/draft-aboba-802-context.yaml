abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE 802 Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP), under development
    within the IEEE 802.11 TgF working group, supports the transfer of context between
    access points implementing IEEE 802 technology. This document describes how IAPP
    can be used to support transfer of authentication, authorization and accounting
    (AAA) context between devices supporting IEEE 802.1X network port authentication.
    This specification is currently being developed within the IEEE 802.11 TgF working
    group and is being presented to the IETF for informational purposes.</p>"
