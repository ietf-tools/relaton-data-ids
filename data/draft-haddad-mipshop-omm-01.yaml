abstract:
- content: <p>Micromobility protocols address mobile nodes (MN) movements within a
    particular IP network domain. This document introduces a new protocol "Optimized
    Micromobility Management" (OMM), to manage Micromobility for active and dormant
    mobile nodes. The suggested solution is based on the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
    (HMIPv6) proposal and aims to increase the mobility performance by reducing the
    handover latency and the packet loss.</p>
