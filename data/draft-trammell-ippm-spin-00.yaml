abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an explicit per-flow transport-layer signal for
    hybrid measurement of end-to-end RTT. This signal consists of three bits: a spin
    bit, which oscillates once per end-to-end RTT, and a two-bit Valid Edge Counter
    (VEC), which compensates for loss and reordering of the spin bit to increase fidelity
    of the signal in less than ideal network conditions. It describes the algorithm
    for generating the signal, approaches for observing it to passively measure end-to-end
    latency, and proposes methods for adding it to a variety of IETF transport protocols.</p>"
