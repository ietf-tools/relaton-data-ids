abstract:
- content: <p>OpenPGP transferable public keys are composite certificates, made up
    of primary keys, direct key signatures, user IDs, identity certifications ("signature
    packets"), subkeys, and so on. They are often assembled by merging multiple certificates
    that all share the same primary key, and are distributed in public keystores.
    Unfortunately, since many keystores permit any third-party to add a certification
    with any content to any OpenPGP certificate, the assembled/merged form of a certificate
    can become unwieldy or undistributable. Furthermore, keystores that are searched
    by user ID or fingerprint can be made unusable for specific searches by public
    submission of bogus certificates. And finally, keystores open to public submission
    can also face simple resource exhaustion from flooding with bogus submissions,
    or legal or other risks from uploads of toxic data. This draft documents techniques
    that an archive of OpenPGP certificates can use to mitigate the impact of these
    various attacks, and the implications of these concerns and mitigations for the
    rest of the OpenPGP ecosystem.</p>
