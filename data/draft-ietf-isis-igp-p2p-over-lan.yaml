abstract:
- content: "<p>The two predominant circuit types used by link state routing protocols
    are point-to-point and broadcast. It is important to identify the correct circuit
    type when forming adjacencies, flooding link state database packets, and representing
    the circuit topologically. This document describes a simple mechanism to treat
    the broadcast network as a point-to-point connection from the standpoint of IP
    routing. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
