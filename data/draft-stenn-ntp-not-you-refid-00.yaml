abstract:
- content: '<p>NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest
    being RFC 5905 [RFC5905]. A core component of the protocol and the algoritms is
    the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify the source of time used
    for synchronization (aka the "system peer"). Traditionally, when the source of
    time was another system, the REFID was the IPv4 address of that other system.
    The purpose of the REFID is to prevent a one-degree "timing loop": where if A
    has several timing sources that include B, if B decides to get its time from A,
    then A should not then decide to get its time from B. The REFID is therefore a
    vital core-component of the base NTP packet. If a system''s REFID is the IPv4
    address of its time source, then with a simple query a remote attacker can learn
    the target''s REFID. The remote attacker can then try to use that information
    to send spoofed NTP packets to the target or the target''s time source, attempting
    to cause a disruption in time service [NDSS16]. Since the core purpose of the
    REFID is to prevent a one-degree timing loop, this proposal is a backward-compatible
    way to limit the amount of information that is leaked in the REFID. Specifically,
    it allows the prevention of one- degree timing loops by allowing a system A to
    reveal to a querying system B that B is not A''s time source, but without revealing
    the actual time source to which A is synchronized.</p>'
