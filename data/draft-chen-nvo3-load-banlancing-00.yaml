abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional ECMP can not balance loads well in the data center network
    because it splits loads at the granularity of flow. Packets belong to a single
    flow have to be delivered along the same path. Though it is able to avoid packet
    reordering, it may degrade the bandwidth utilization. This document describes
    method of splitting a single flow to across multiple parallel paths without causing
    packet reordering, which is more effective when large flows exist. The specific
    path selection algorithm is NOT discussed in this document.</p>"
