abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through
    a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants
    and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters. In particular,
    the IETF is supposed not to be run by a "majority rules" philosophy. This is why
    we engage in rituals like "humming" instead of voting. However, more and more
    of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting
    the majority win the day. This document is a collection of thoughts on what rough
    consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things we can do in order
    to really achieve rough consensus.</p>
