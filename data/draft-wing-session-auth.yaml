abstract:
- content: "<p>In many VoIP networks today, firewalls and session border controllers
    are used at the edge of an administrative domain to allow authorized UDP media
    flows to enter or leave the network. This document introduces a new mechanism
    to authorize a UDP media flow. This mechanism works with encrypted hop-by-hop
    signaling, end-to-end authenticated signaling, and multihomed networks. The media
    authorization is performed using an Interactive Connectivity Establishment-capable
    endpoint and a calling signaling device that authorizes a firewall to permit a
    flow.</p>"
