abstract:
- content: "<p>Proposed fast handover solutions for Mobile IPv4 depend on the presence
    of Foreign Agents (FA) in the networks between which the Mobile Node (MN) moves
    to ensure their operation. However, in many situations the MN moves into networks
    without FAs. This document proposes a solution that includes fast handover mechanisms
    involving a direct connection to the Home Agent (HA). This solution is not a full
    fledged fast handover proposal, but rather a complement to RFC 4881: Low-Latency
    Handovers in Mobile IPv4, and RFC 4988: Mobile IPv4 Fast Handover.</p>"
