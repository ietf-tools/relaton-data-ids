abstract:
- content: "<p>This document fixes a shortcoming in the specification language of
    the Codec Control Message Full Intra Request (FIR) as defined in RFC5104 when
    using with layered codecs. In particular, a Decoder Refresh Point needs to be
    sent by a media sender when a FIR is received on any layer of the layered bitstream,
    regardless on whether those layers are being sent in a single or in multiple RTP
    flows. The other payload-specific feedback messages defined in RFC 5104 and RFC
    4585 as updated by RFC 5506 have also been analyzed, and no corresponding shortcomings
    have been found.</p>"
