abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the existing issues for IPv6 site renumbering.
    It also analyzes the possible directions to solve these issues and gives recommendations.
    This document only takes the perspective of network and network protocols. Renumbering
    in IPv4 networks, in the dual-stack network or in the IPv4/IPv6 transition networks
    are out of scope. This document only takes the perspective of network and network
    protocols. According to the different stages, these issues are described in three
    categories: considerations during network design, considerations for routine network
    management, and considerations during renumbering operation. Recommended solutions
    or strategies are also described. Issues that still remain unsolvable are listed
    as the fourth category. Although we list a few non-network issues in this document,
    we consider them as issues that ISPs or network providers cannot affect. So, these
    issues are considered to be unsolvable and not explore further in these document,
    though they may be solved by OS implementations or application implementations.
    We summary the requests that need to extend current protocols as further works
    at the end of this document.</p>"
