abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increasing interest in the potential use of blockchain systems
    for virtual assets, there is a need for virtual assets to have mobility across
    blockchain systems. An interoperability architecture is needed to permit the flow
    of virtual assets between blockchain systems. The architecture must recognize
    that there are different blockchain systems, and that the interior constructs
    in these blockchains maybe incompatible with one another. Gateway nodes perform
    the transfer of virtual assets between blockchain systems while masking the complexity
    of the interior constructs of the blockchain that they represent.</p>"
