abstract:
- content: "<p>In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), as also in IEEE Bridged Networks,
    the switches simply flood multicast traffic on all ports in the LAN by default.
    IGMP Snooping is commonly deployed to ensure multicast traffic is not forwarded
    on ports without IGMP receivers. The procedures and recommendations for IGMP Snooping
    are defined in [IGMP-SNOOP]. But when any protocol other than IGMP is used, the
    common practice is to simply flood multicast traffic to all ports. PIM-SM, PIM-SSM,
    PIM-BIDIR are widely deployed routing protocols. PIM Snooping procedures are important
    to restrict multicast traffic to only the routers interested in receiving such
    traffic. While most of the PIM Snooping procedures defined here also apply to
    IEEE Bridged Networks, VPLS demands certain special procedures due to the split-horizon
    rules that require the Provider Edge (PE) devices to co-operate. This document
    describes the procedures and recommendations for PIM-Snooping in VPLS to facilitate
    replication to only those ports behind which there are interested PIM routers
    and/or IGMP hosts. This document also describes procedures for PIM Proxy. PIM
    Proxy is required on PEs for VPLS Multicast to work correctly when Join suppression
    is enabled in the VPLS. PIM Proxy also helps scale VPLS Multicast much better
    than just PIM Snooping.</p>"
