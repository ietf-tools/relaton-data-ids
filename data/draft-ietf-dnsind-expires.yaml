abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an additional RR type for the Domain Name System[7,8]
    which provides for scheduled expiration of RRs in the DNS. These RRs record the
    time at which a referenced set of RRs are to be removed from the DNS. This can
    be used to provide the information required to automatically support the reduced
    TTLs described in RFC1034[8] when anticipating a change, and by being in the zone
    data, will communicate that information to other servers that recognize the RR,
    in particular, secondary servers that recieve the data by Zone Transfer (AXFR
    or IXFR[2]).</p>"
