abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPEG-2 standard defined by ISO 13818-1 [ISO-MPEG2] supports a range
    of transmission methods for a range of services. This document provides a threat
    analysis and derives the security requirements when using the Transport Stream,
    TS, to support an Internet network-layer using Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation
    (ULE) [RFC4326]. The document also provides the motivation for link-level security
    for a ULE Stream. A ULE Stream may be used to send IPv4 packets, IPv6 packets,
    and other Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to an arbitrarily large number of Receivers
    supporting unicast and/or multicast transmission.</p>"
