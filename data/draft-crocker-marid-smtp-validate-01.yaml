abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail relies on exchanges between systems that have made no
    prior arrangement with each other. For reasons of history and expediency, the
    current service provides a level of accountability for participating hosts that
    is no longer adequate. This makes it impossible to vet MTAs or find recourse when
    their operation causes problems. Client SMTP Validation (CSV) provides an economical
    service that permits an SMTP server to decide whether messages sent by the client
    SMTP are likely to be well-behaved, or at least to decide whether the client is
    sufficiently accountable for its actions. CSV provides a small, simple and useful
    improvement to Internet mail service accountability. It builds upon the existing
    practise of service providers that accredit the networks from which sending systems
    are connecting.</p>"
