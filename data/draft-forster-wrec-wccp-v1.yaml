abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents the Web Cache Coordination Protocol (WCCP) V1.0.
    This protocol is used (a) to associate a single router with one or more web-caches
    for the purposes of transparent redirection of HTTP traffic, and (b) to allow
    one of the web-caches to dictate how the router distributes transparently-redirected
    traffic across the associated web-caches. This draft describes the interactions
    between a router and one or more web-caches. It does not describe the interactions
    between a group of associated web-caches or those between a web-cache and a web-server.</p>"
