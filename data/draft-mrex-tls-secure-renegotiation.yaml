abstract:
- content: "<p>A protocol design flaw in the TLS renegotiation handshake leaves all
    currently implemented protocol version of TLS (SSLv3 to TLSv1.2) vulnerable to
    Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where the attacker can establish a TLS session
    with a server, send crafted application data of his choice to the server and then
    proxy an unsuspecting client's TLS handshake into the TLS renegotiation handshake
    of the server. Many applications on top of TLS see the data injected by the attacker
    and the data sent by the client as a single data stream and assume that an authentication
    during the TLS renegotiation handshake or contained in the client's application
    data applies to the entire data stream received through the TLS-protected communication
    channel. This document describes a protocol change for all protocol versions of
    TLS and SSLv3 that will fix this vulnerability for all communication between updated
    TLS clients and updated TLS servers.</p>"
