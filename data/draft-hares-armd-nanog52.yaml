abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Centers are growing in number of physical and virtual machines.
    The scaling of broadcast domains impacts the scale of basic Address resolution
    protocols (ARP and ND). The ARMD working (http://tools.ietf.org/wg/armd/charters)
    has been charter to examine the details of this problem. Part of the examination
    was to ask operators of data centers and researchers to provide details on the
    scope of the problem. The ARMD chairs (Benson Schliesser (Cisco) and Linda Dunbar
    (Huawei) held a panel session at NANOG 52 to report initial findings. The researchers
    on the panel were: Manish Karir (Merit), and K.K. Ramakrishnan (AT&amp;T Research).
    The Operators on this panel were from Google (Scott Whyte), Yahoo (Igor Gashinsky),
    and Adhost (Michael K. Smith). This memo brings into IETF format notes taken at
    the panel session. Any errors in the summary are the author's. The presentations
    for the session are listed at the ARMD track at: http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog52/agenda.php
    However, an audio recording was not made. This document is an informational RFC
    whose intent is to record a moment in time.</p>"
