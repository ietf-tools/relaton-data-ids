abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an IPv6 network attachment detection mechanism
    in which access routers disseminate the identifiers of on- link access points
    reported by hosts. By caching the identifiers, hosts assess the likelihood of
    an L3 link change right after an access point change. The hosts are hence able
    to quickly determine whether an existing IP address configuration can be reused
    or a new one should be acquired. The mechanism aims to achieve fast L3 connectivity
    re-establishment with less signaling overhead.</p>"
