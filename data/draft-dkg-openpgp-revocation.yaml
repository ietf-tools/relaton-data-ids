abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographic revocation is a hard problem. OpenPGP's revocation mechanisms
    are imperfect, not fully understood, and not as widely implemented as they could
    be. Additionally, some historical OpenPGP revocation mechanisms simply do not
    work in certain contexts. This document provides clarifying guidance on how OpenPGP
    revocation works, documents outstanding problems, and introduces a new mechanism
    for delegated revocations that improves on previous mechanism.</p>"
