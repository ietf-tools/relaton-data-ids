abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the method for transporting PTP messages (PDUs)
    over an MPLS network to enable a proper handling of these packets (e.g. implementation
    of Transparent Clocks (TC)) in LSRs. The basic idea is to transport PTP messages
    inside dedicated MPLS LSPs. These LSPs only carry PTP messages and possibly Control
    and Management packets, but they do not carry customer traffic. Two methods for
    transporting 1588 over MPLS are defined. The first method is to transport PTP
    messages directly over the dedicated MPLS LSP via UDP/IP encapsulation, which
    is suitable for IP/MPLS networks. The second method is to transport PTP messages
    inside a PW via Ethernet encapsulation, which is more suitable for MPLS-TP networks.</p>"
