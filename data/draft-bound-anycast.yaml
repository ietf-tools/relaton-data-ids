abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a minimum set of requirements for IPv6 hosts
    in order to achieve communication with nodes providing services through IPv6 anycast
    addresses. We present a mechanism that aims to allow TCP and UDP communication
    between hosts where the packet exchange is initiated through the usage of an anycast
    address, without requiring modifications to the general definitions of the transport
    protocols.</p>"
