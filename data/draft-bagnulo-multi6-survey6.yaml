abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents proposed solutions and tools related to IPv6
    multi-homing. All presented proposals respect actual IPv6 routing architecture
    and current ISP address aggregation scheme, in particular, avoiding route injection
    to the DFZ. Besides, only network and transport level solutions are introduced,
    meaning that application level solutions are intentionally excluded.</p>"
