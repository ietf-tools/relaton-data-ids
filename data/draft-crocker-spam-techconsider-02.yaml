abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail has operated as an open and unfettered channel between
    originator and recipient. This invites some abuses, called spam, such as burdening
    recipients with unwanted commercial email. Spam has become an extremely serious
    problem, is getting much worse and is proving difficult (or impossible) to eliminate.
    The most practical goal is to bring spam under control; it will require an on-going,
    adaptive effort, with stochastic rather than complete results. This note discusses
    available points of control in the Internet mail architecture, considerations
    in using any of those points, and opportunities for creating Internet standards
    to aid in spam control efforts. It offers guidance about likely trade-offs, benefits
    and limitations.</p>"
