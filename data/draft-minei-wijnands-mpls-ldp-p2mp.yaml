abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) for the setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to- multipoint
    (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.
    The solution relies on LDP without requiring a multicast routing protocol in the
    network. Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for
    building such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner. There can be various applications
    for P2MP/MP2MP LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS
    L3VPNs. Specification of how such applications can use a LDP signaled P2MP/MP2MP
    LSP is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
