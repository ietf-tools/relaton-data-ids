abstract:
- content: "<p>It is common practice on the Internet to permit anonymous access to
    various services. Traditionally, this has been done with a plain text password
    mechanism using 'anonymous' as the user name and optional trace information, such
    as an email address, as the password. As plaintext login commands are not permitted
    in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the
    context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.</p>"
