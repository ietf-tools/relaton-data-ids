abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on incorporating the ECN - Explicit Congestion Notification [RFC3168]
    and the end-to-end Available Bandwidth Estimation, TCP for heterogeneous networks
    accommodates a way for TCP sender to be ability of distinguishing the wireless
    packet losses from the congestion packet losses, as well as estimating of the
    available bandwidth to adjust transmission rate when the neworks become congested.</p>"
