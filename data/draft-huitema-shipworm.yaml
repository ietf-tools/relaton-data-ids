abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose here a service that would enable nodes located behind one
    or several IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP;
    we call this the Shipworm service. The establishment of the tunnel is automatic,
    and does not require any configuration parameters on the client. Running the service
    requires the help of 'Shipworm servers' and 'Shipworm relays'; the Shipworm servers
    are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between
    Shipworm clients; the Shipworm relays act as IPv6 routers between the Shipworm
    service and the 'native' IPv6 Internet.</p>"
