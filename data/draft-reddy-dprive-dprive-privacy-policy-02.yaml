abstract:
- content: "<p>Users want to control how their DNS queries are handled by DNS servers
    so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that comply with their privacy
    and DNS filtering expectations. This document defines a mechanism for a DNS server
    to communicate its privacy statement URL and filtering policy to a DNS client.
    This communication is cryptographically signed to attest to its authenticity.
    By evaluating the DNS privacy statement, filtering policy and the signatory, the
    user can choose a DNS server that best supports their desired privacy and filtering
    policy. This token is particularly useful for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS
    servers that are either public resolvers or are discovered on the local network.</p>"
