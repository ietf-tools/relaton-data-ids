abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a contribution to the ongoing debate in the Megaco working
    group on the use of SDP or H.245 to describe Termination Descriptors. One of the
    stingy point in the debate has been the need, for some gate- ways, to provide
    H.323 compatible 'capability exchanges.' It has some- times been asserted that
    such exchanges would be hard to provide with an SDP syntax. This memo, on the
    contrary, provides a simple solution to the problem, based on the following ideas:
    * usage of SDP to describe termination parameters, * usage of the audit procedure
    to enquire about capabilities, * a syntax in the audit procedure allowing to return
    several termination descriptors, corresponding to alternative capability sets,
    * an algorithm for translating a set of SDP encoded capability sets into an H.245
    capability descriptor.</p>"
