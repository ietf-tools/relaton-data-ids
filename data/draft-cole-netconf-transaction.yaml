abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration
    management protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform sets of active
    tests (i.e., verification) against servers' running configuration to afford the
    client and server a more robust and resilient configuration management capability.
    Specifically, this document defines a transaction test module based upon the defined
    set of Uniform Resource Locators. The transaction tests in this module are executed
    by the NETCONF verify operation.</p>"
