abstract:
- content: "<p>{ Work in progress to update the OpenPGP specification from RFC4880
    } { This version is on the Git head with rfc4880bis-10 before the great refactoring.
    That refactoring, dubbed crypto-refresh, basically started from scratch with lots
    of re-formatting and switching to a Gitlab based approach with merge requests
    mainly prepared in advance by one of the chairs. This was done despite that -10
    was basically ready for last call after a long iterative process adding feature
    by feature with rough consent from the WG. Due to the IETF submission system the
    draft has a new name but nevertheless is the direct successor of draft-ietf-openpgp-
    rfc4880bis-10 } This document specifies the message formats used in OpenPGP. OpenPGP
    provides encryption with public-key or symmetric cryptographic algorithms, digital
    signatures, compression and key management. This document is maintained in order
    to publish all necessary information needed to develop interoperable applications
    based on the OpenPGP format. It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an
    application. It describes only the format and methods needed to read, check, generate,
    and write conforming packets crossing any network. It does not deal with storage
    and implementation questions. It does, however, discuss implementation issues
    necessary to avoid security flaws.</p>"
