abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extension (DNSSEC) as defined by [RFC9364] was developed
    to address significant security integrity flaws in DNS. Within certain circumstances,
    information leakage may be possible stemming from a known DNSSEC vulnerability
    that facilitates a process known as zone walking, which enables the efficient
    collection of all FQDNs from a given environment. This document describes the
    problem space as outlined in [IEEE-ZoneHopping] and offers a potential solution,
    called Zone-Hopping, to aid in addressing the domain information leakage capable
    via Zone-walking while preserving the integrity of the records for which DNSSEC
    was originally introduced.</p>"
