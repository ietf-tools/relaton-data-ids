abstract:
- content: "<p>Many applications for automated searching and selection of documents
    can benefit from a common notation for classifying documents. This memo describes
    one such notation. The notation is extensible to allow the description of many
    different properties on a given document. The notation can be employed by any
    application using RFC-822 headers, such as electronic mail and the HyperText Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). In addition, we define a new error code for HTTP to indicate
    a selection failure.</p>"
