abstract:
- content: "<p>A Military Message Handling System (MMHS) processes formal messages
    ensuring release, distribution, security, and timely delivery across national
    and international strategic and tactical networks. The MMHS Elements of Service
    are defined as a set of extensions to the ITU-T X.400 (1992) international standards
    and are specified in STANAG 4406 Edition 2 and ACP 123. This document specifies
    message header fields and associated processing for RFC 5322 (Internet Message
    Format) to provide a comparable messaging service. In addition, this document
    provides for a STANAG 4406 / Internet Email Gateway that supports message conversion.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
