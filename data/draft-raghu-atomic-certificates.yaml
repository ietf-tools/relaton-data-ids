abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing PKI has a few inherent limitations like: 1. It is implicitly
    assumed that the two trading parties have ONE mutually trusted third party that
    can attest ALL of each party's attributes. It provides no mechanism to separate
    out the fields in a certificate for attestation by different Certification Authorities.
    2. This standard in no way gives the flexibility to expose only certain fields
    of a certificate to the other party. This memo proposes a model which, while working
    well within the X.509v3 framework, overcomes these limitations by breaking up
    a certificate into pre-signed 'unit attestations' referred to as 'Atomic Certificates'
    and packaging them in the X.509v3 format only at the time of sending the certificate
    to the other party.</p>"
