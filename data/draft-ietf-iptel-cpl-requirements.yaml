abstract:
- content: "<p>A large number of the services we wish to make possible for Internet
    telephony require fairly elaborate combinations of signalling operations, often
    in network devices, to complete. We want a simple and standardized way to create
    such services to make them easier to implement and deploy. This document describes
    an architecture for such a method, which we call a call processing language. It
    also outlines requirements for such a language.</p>"
