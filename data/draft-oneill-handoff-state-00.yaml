abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft aims to document an issue raised in the Mobile IP working
    group related to fast handoff between Access Routers. The fast handoff work aims
    to rapidly enable IP service at the new access router. In Mobile IP this implies
    that Binding Updates at the network layer enable forwarding of packets to the
    new access router. However, it may also imply other network layer activities because
    the IP service given to the MN may depend on state which is presently located
    in the old access router. This draft aims to document the issue through examples
    so that the IETF can resolve how to approach this issue.</p>"
