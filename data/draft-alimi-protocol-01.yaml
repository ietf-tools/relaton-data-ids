abstract:
- content: "<p>Content distribution applications, such as those those employing peer-to-peer
    (P2P) technologies, are widely used on the Internet and make up a large portion
    of the traffic in many networks. Often, however, content distribution applications
    use network resources in a counter-productive manner. One way to improve efficiency
    is to introduce storage capabilities within the network and enable cooperation
    between end-host and in-network content distribution mechanisms. This is the capability
    provided by a DECADE-compatible system, which is introduced in this document.
    DECADE enables applications to take advantage of in-network storage when distributing
    data objects as opposed to using solely end-to-end resources. This document presents
    the underlying principles and key functionalities of such a system and illustrates
    operation through a set of examples.</p>"
