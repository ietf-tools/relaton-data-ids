abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes problem statements for realizing an end-to-
    end network slicing that is expected to provide service-oriented communications
    between users and applications. 3GPP introduced the network slicing concept in
    the 5G architecture (3GPP Release 15), however, it mainly focuses on mobile access
    and core domains. In order to reap the benefit of the concept, a network slicing
    needs to be designed across multiple domains of the network including non-3GPP
    parts. This document analyzes the current 3GPP 5G network slicing architecture
    and summarizes problem statements for the interworking between the 5G network
    slicing and the transport network.</p>"
