abstract:
- content: "<p>The application-centric deployment of 'Internet' services has increased
    over the past ten years with many millions of applications providing user-centric
    services, executed on increasingly more powerful smartphones that are supported
    by Internet-based cloud services in distributed data centres, the latter mainly
    provided by large scale players such as Google, Amazon and alike. This draft outlines
    a vision for evolving those data centres towards executing app-centric micro-services;
    we dub this evolved data centre as an AppCentre. Complemented with the proliferation
    of such AppCentres at the edge of the network, they will allow for such micro-services
    to be distributed across many places of execution, including mobile terminals
    themselves, while specific micro-service chains equal today's applications in
    existing smartphones. We outline the key enabling technologies that needs to be
    provided for such evolution to be realized, including references to ongoing standardization
    efforts in key areas.</p>"
