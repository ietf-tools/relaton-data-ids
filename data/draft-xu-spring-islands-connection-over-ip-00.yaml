abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) architecture [SR-ARCH] introduces a new MPLS paradigm
    in which a sender of a packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the
    route the packet takes through the network by using stacked MPLS labels. The current
    SR architecture requires an end-to-end MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) between
    any two SR-enabled routers (e.g., two adjacent hops of a given explicit path).
    In order to enable SR to be deployed even when there are non-MPLS routers along
    the path between two SR-enabled routers, it is desirable to have an alternative,
    which allows the use of IP-based tunnels (e.g., GRE tunnels) to connect two SR-enabled
    routers. This document describes a mechanism for such usage.</p>"
