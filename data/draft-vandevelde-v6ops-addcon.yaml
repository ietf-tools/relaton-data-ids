abstract:
- content: "<p>One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its
    addressing plan. With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the
    introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators
    need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing. Lack of guideliness
    on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the integration of IPv6.
    This draft aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to planning
    the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments. The draft also provides IPv6 addressing
    case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP network. In this first version
    of the draft we aim to provoke discussion on this important topic; more detailed
    case study texts will follow.</p>"
