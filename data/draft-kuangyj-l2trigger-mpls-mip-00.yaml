abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the integration of Mobile IP (MIP) and Multi-
    Protocol Label Switch (MPLS) with Layer2 Triggers (L2T) to expedite handoff and
    route optimization procedures. In the proposal, MPLS acts as only a fast second
    layer switch technique to setup a connection-oriented communication network, while
    MIP or IP acts as a signaling protocol to operate, administrate and manage MPLS
    network. L2Ts in this proposal are introduced to trigger signaling process of
    rerouting, extension and recovery of label switch paths (LSP) rather than to trigger
    registration or binding update of new care-of address (CoA), in traditional MIP.
    Moreover, in the proposed architecture, IP-in-IP tunneling is replaced by LSPs
    to support mobility, which reduces packet overhead thus mitigates network burden
    and makes it easy to support quality-of-service (QoS) or class-of-service (CoS).
    Therefore, the proposed scheme is well suited for time-constrained or delay-sensitive
    applications.</p>"
