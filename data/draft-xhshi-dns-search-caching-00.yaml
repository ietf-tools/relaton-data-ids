abstract:
- content: "<p>John Klensin proposed a multi-layered search-based access model for
    the DNS to address more human-friendly naming and navigation need of the modern
    Internet [DNSSEARCH]. When deploying the DNS search system in the global Internet,
    stability and scalability are two most important factors no matter what protocol
    we finally use. This draft demonstrates that caching is a significant objective
    for a stable and scalable DNS search system. Particularly, this document analyzes
    statistical operational data collected from our Keyword service. The collected
    data clearly demonstrates the potential high impact of caching in the resolution
    process. Based on deployment experience, the document describes alternative caching
    methods. From there, basic caching requirements for DNS Search systems are discussed.
    The goal of this document is not to propose some standard caching mechanisms or
    methods but to emphasize the necessity of caching for DNS Search systems. Furthermore,
    the authors believe that the proven high efficiency of caching should be an important
    consideration when designing the future lookup protocol for such systems.</p>"
