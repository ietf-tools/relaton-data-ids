abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF policies about intellectual property rights (IPR), such as
    patent rights, claimed relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed
    to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as complete information
    about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible. The policies are
    also intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while
    respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders. This memo details the IETF policies
    concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF. It also describes
    the objectives that the policies are designed to meet.</p>"
