abstract:
- content: <p>There are scenarios in which an IP multicast tree traverses an MPLS
    domain. In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP multicast tree
    "seamlessly" into an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP) when it enters
    the MPLS domain, and then to convert it back to an IP multicast tree when it exits
    the MPLS domain. Previous documents specify procedures that allow certain kinds
    of IP multicast trees (either Source-Specific Multicast trees or Bidirectional
    Multicast trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP).
    However, the previous documents do not specify procedures for attaching IP Any-Source
    Multicast trees to MP-LSPs, nor do they specify procedures for aggregating multiple
    IP multicast trees onto a single MP-LSP. This document specifies the procedures
    to support these functions. It does so by defining "wildcard" encodings that make
    it possible to specify, when setting up an MP- LSP, that a set of IP multicast
    trees, or a shared IP multicast tree, should be attached to that MP-LSP. Support
    for non-bidirectional IP Any-Source Multicast trees is subject to certain applicability
    restrictions that are discussed in this document. This document updates RFCs 6826
    and 7246.</p>
