abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated key exchange mechanisms instantiated with cryptosystems
    based on integer factorization, finite field discrete log, or elliptic curve discrete
    log, are believed to be secure now but are vulnerable to a harvest-then-decrypt
    attack where an attacker who cannot currently break the mechanism records the
    traffic anyway, then decrypts it at some point in the future when quantum computers
    become available. The Quantum-safe Hybrid approach is a modular design, allowing
    any authenticated key exchange mechanism to be protected against the harvest-then-decrypt
    attack by exchanging additional secret material protected with an ephemeral key
    for a quantum-safe public key cryptographic algorithm and including that secret
    material in the Key Derivation Function (KDF) run at the end of the key exchange.
    This approach has been proposed in TLS as the Quantum-safe Hybrid handshake mechanism
    for Transport Layer Security protocol (QSH_TLS). This document provides a guideline
    to criteria for selecting public key encryption algorithms approved for experimental
    use in the quantum safe hybrid setting.</p>"
