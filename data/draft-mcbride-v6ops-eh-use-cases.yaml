abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines IPv6 extension header use cases including those
    intended to be deployed in limited domains and those intended for the global Internet.
    We specify use cases are deployed today and those which may be of use in the future.
    The hope is that through understanding these various extension header use cases,
    we can then better understand how best to implement any necessary limits on their
    use.</p>"
