abstract:
- content: "<p>This ID will contain my analysis of the Core-Edge Elimination architecture
    (CEE) scalable routing proposals considered by the RRG in 2010, as well as some
    other CEE architectures. This ID is to support and document the IRTF Routing Research
    Group discussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010. It is not a formal
    product of the RRG. To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus
    can only be determined by the co-chairs.</p>"
