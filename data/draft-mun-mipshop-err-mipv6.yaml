abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF published Fast Handovers in Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) for efficient
    mobility management. FMIPv6 has no solutions to protect binding update messages.
    Previous researches have mainly concentrated on using AAA, public certificates
    or cryptographic algorithms for authentication of FMIPv6. However the approaches
    need a particular infrastructure or heavy processing cost to authenticate binding
    updates in FMIPv6. Extended Return Routability provides authentication for FMIPv6
    without infrastructure and costly cryptographic algorithms. Also it can be used
    for various existing handover protocol in MIPv6 network.</p>"
