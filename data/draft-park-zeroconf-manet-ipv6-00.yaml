abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SAA) lends
    itself easily to a mobile ad hoc network where no administrative configurations
    are available. However, the SAA designed to operate on a single link is not directly
    applicable to the mobile ad hoc network with multi-hop paths. In this document,
    we extend the current SAA to overcome this limitation by using the IPv6 site-
    local address.</p>"
