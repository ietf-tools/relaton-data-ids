abstract:
- content: "<p>The Peering API currently under discussion in the GROW Working Group
    does not provide a standardised mechanism to authenticate parties engaged in the
    Peering API. This document specifies a method to attest as to the identities of
    parties in an OpenID Connect (OIDC) exchange, binding the authentication flow
    to agents of ASNs. Discussion This note is to be removed before publishing as
    an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.molgen.mpg.de/q/rpki-peering-api-discovery.</p>"
