abstract:
- content: '<p>Gordian Envelope specifies a structured format for hierarchical binary
    data focused on the ability to transmit it in a privacy- focused way, offering
    support for privacy as described in RFC 6973 and human rights as described in
    RFC 8280. Envelopes are designed to facilitate "smart documents" and have a number
    of unique features including: easy representation of a variety of semantic structures,
    a built-in Merkle-like digest tree, deterministic representation using CBOR, and
    the ability for the holder of a document to selectively elide specific parts of
    a document without invalidating the digest tree structure. This document specifies
    the base Envelope format, which is designed to be extensible.</p>'
