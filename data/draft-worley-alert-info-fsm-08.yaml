abstract:
- content: <p>The "alert" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used in
    the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and
    responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the characteristics of the
    call that the user agent has originated or terminated. The user agent must resolve
    the URNs into a signal, that is, it must select the best available signal to present
    to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call. This document describes
    a method by which a user agent's designer can, based on the user agent's signals
    and their meanings, construct a finite state machine (FSM) to process the URNs
    to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in the definition
    of the "alert" URN namespace. In many situations, the resulting FSM is simpler
    to implement and faster than the selection algorithm described in [RFC7462].</p>
