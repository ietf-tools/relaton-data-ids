abstract:
- content: "<p>Most efforts to address emergency calling challenges over IP (and cellular
    technologies such as GSM, TDMA, CDMA, etc, for that matter) have focused on locating
    the calling user in order to route the emergency call set-up request to the appropriate
    Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Little or no effort to date has focused
    on informing the caller what dialstring sequence they may need to use to initiate
    a call for emergency help. This document describes how the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) REGISTER Request message is used to inform a user of which emergency
    dialstring (of the 60 known dialstring choices around the world) they should use,
    for where they are geographically.</p>"
