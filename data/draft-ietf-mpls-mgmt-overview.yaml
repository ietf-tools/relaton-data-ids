    to help model and manage the various aspects of Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus
    on the specific areas of responsibility of the modules that they describe. This
    document describes the management architecture for MPLS and indicates the interrelationships
    between the different MIB modules used for MPLS network management. This memo
