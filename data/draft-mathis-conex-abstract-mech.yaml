- content: "<p>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform
    the network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier in the same flow.
    Today, the network may signal congestion to the receiver by ECN markings or by
    dropping packets, and the receiver may pass this information back to the sender
    in transport-layer feedback. The mechanism to be developed by the ConEx WG will
    enable the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network
    in- band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion is visible to
    all IP devices along the path, from where it could, for example, be provided as
    input to traffic management.</p>"
