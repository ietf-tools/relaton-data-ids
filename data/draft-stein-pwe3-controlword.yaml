abstract:
- content: "<p>Control words are used by PWE3 service emulations to carry information
    needed by the PWE3 Encapsulation Layer and the PSN Convergence Layer. The generic
    PWE3 documents do not specify the format of this control word and hence contradictory
    control word formats have proliferated in the various service encapsulation documents.
    We present an analysis of these control words and a suggestion for a single unified
    control word family.</p>"
