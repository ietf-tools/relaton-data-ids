abstract:
- content: "<p>The cooperation between Internet application and network enhances not
    only the efficiency of network transportation but also the experiences of end
    users. To design the information exchanging protocol and architecture that facilitate
    such cooperation is the objective of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    working group. Currently, ALTO protocol adopts an efficient query/response message
    based on the prevalent http protocol. However, such protocol cannot support rapid
    dispatch of ALTO information. Noted that many scenarios require the updated network
    information to be dispatched to clients as soon as possible, such as when part
    of the network is congested, when a new policy is to be deployed urgently, or
    when unexpected network maintenance is required. To tackle such problem, this
    draft proposed a server notification extension to the original query/response
    mechanism.</p>"
