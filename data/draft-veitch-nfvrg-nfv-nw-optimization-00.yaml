abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a review of issues related to the optimized deployment of network
    services, aka service function chains, composed of virtual and physical network
    functions, where these functions may be instantiated in multiple distributed data
    centers. Criteria for optimization are introduced, and use cases are described
    and expanded, in order to establish the need for coordinated computation of NF
    deployment sites and the connectivity among them. Some methods for addressing
    optimization pain points are described, and potential new requirements of the
    PCE and PCEP are discussed. One point to make clear is that the exploration of
    specific algorithms for NF/VNF placement and path computation is outside the scope
    of this draft. We are not looking at computational or optimal greedy search algorithms.
    The goals for this draft are 1) to provide justification through use cases for
    more tightly integrating path and placement computation algorithms, and 2) looking
    at how some of the optimization requirements might be addressed, mostly through
    pre- computation and caching, and how these might affect management and orchestration
    functions and the protocols (e.g. PCEP) that are used.</p>"
