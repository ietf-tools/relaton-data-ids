abstract:
- content: <p>DNS resolvers are vulnerable to many attacks on their network communication,
    ranging from blind attacks to full men-in-the-middle. Although a full man-in-the-middle
    can only be countered with cryptography, there are many layers of defenses which
    apply to less powerful attackers. Of particular interest are defenses which only
    require changing the DNS resolvers, not the authoritative servers or the DNS protocols.
    This document begins with a taxonomy of attacker capabilities and desires, and
    then discusses defenses against classes of attackers, including detecting non-disruptive
    attacks, entropy budgeting, detecting entropy stripping, semantics of duplication,
    and cache policies to eliminate "race-until-win" conditions. Proposed defenses
    were evaluated with traces of network behavior.</p>
