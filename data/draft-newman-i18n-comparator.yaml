abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet application protocols include string-based lookup, searching,
    or sorting operations. However, the problem space for searching and sorting international
    strings is large, not fully explored, and is outside the area of expertise for
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Rather than attempt to solve such
    a large problem, this specification creates an abstraction framework so that application
    protocols can precisely identify a comparison function, and the repertoire of
    comparison functions can be extended in the future. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
