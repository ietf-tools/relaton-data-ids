abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) that extends SIP for the CONF method and the Participant header field. The
    extension provides that the identity of each participant in a multiparty conference
    is known by other participants all the time, from the initialization to the end
    of the conference. Examples of using this extension with different SIP conferencing
    models are also given.</p>"
