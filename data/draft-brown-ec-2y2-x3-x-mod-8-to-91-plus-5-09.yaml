abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-curve elliptic curve cryptography with curve 2y^2=x^3+x/GF(8^91+5)
    hedges a risk of new curve-specific attacks. This curve features: isomorphism
    to Miller's curve from 1985; low Kolmogorov complexity (little room for embedded
    weaknesses of Gordon, Young-Yung, or Teske); similarity to a Bitcoin curve; Montgomery
    form; complex multiplication by i (Gallant-Lambert-Vanstone); prime field; easy
    reduction, inversion, Legendre symbol, and square root; five 64-bit-word field
    arithmetic; string-as-point encoding; and 34-byte keys. This document aims to
    contribute to multi-curve Elliptic Curve Cryptography by describing how to use
    this curve for elliptic curve Diffie--Hellman. Reports of experience and experiments
    with this curve are encouraged to better understand its security and utility.
    This document was produced outside the IETF and is not an IETF standard. Publication
    of this document does not imply endorsement by the IETF of the curve described
    in this document.</p>"
