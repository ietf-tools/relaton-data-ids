abstract:
- content: "<p>Sigtran specifies association-level reliable transport for signaling
    using SCTP, but in some scenarios a single association failure's reliability mechanism
    is not sufficient to achieve telco reliability. This document specifies procedures
    for an SCTP association changeover solution which will enable applications to
    meet a higher degree of availability. Two generic changeover solutions are presented
    in this document. One is implemented inside the SCTP protocol stack and the other
    requires SCTP and ULP to work in collaboration.</p>"
