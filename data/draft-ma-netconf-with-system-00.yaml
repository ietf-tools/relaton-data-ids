abstract:
- content: <p>The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] defines ways to read configuration and
    state data from a NETCONF server. In some cases, a client-configured data item
    refers to a non-existent system generated data item (e.g.,the auto-create interfaces
    ("eth1") is not yet present). In many situations, the system configured data item
    doesn't need to be know to the client and client-configured data item will automatically
    be removed from the operational state datastore and thus only appear in the intended
    datastore if client-configured data item doesn't exist. In other situations system
    configured data item needs to be known and overriden by the client. Not all server
    implementations treat the system configuration data in the same way. This document
    defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows the NETCONF
    client to identify how system configuration are processed by the server, and also
    defines a new mechanism for client control of server processing of system configuration
    data.</p>
