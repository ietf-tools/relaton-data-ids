abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to- Multipoint
    (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths. The existing
    specification for this functionality assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors which
    support the P2MP/MP2MP capability are directly connected. However, the real deployment
    may not have all the nodes along the LSP path to be P2MP/MP2MP capable so that
    the CapEx of the deployment can be reduced or the deployment of the LDP P2MP/MP2MP
    can be in phases instead of updating the whole network. This document provides
    a solution for finding the first upstream node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP
    along the path from the current node to the root node.</p>"
