abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the applicability of the General Switch Management
    Protocol, GSMP, to network control protocols such as Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS). It discusses the need for this protocol to be standardized and discusses
    areas where development is still necessary. Finally, it recommends that the IETF
    establish a working group with the objective of furthering the protocol and working
    toward making it a standard. A PDF version of this draft can be found at: http://www.
