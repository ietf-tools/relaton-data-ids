abstract:
- content: "<p>A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real-
    time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Deterministic
    networks have been successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT)
    applications for some years (for example [ARINC664P7]). However, such networks
    are typically isolated from external access, and thus the security threat from
    external attackers is low. IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a
    set of technologies that enable creation of deterministic networks on IP-based
    networks of potentially wide area (on the scale of a corporate network) potentially
    bringing the OT network into contact with Information Technology (IT) traffic
    and security threats that lie outside of a tightly controlled and bounded area
    (such as the internals of an aircraft). These DetNet technologies have not previously
    been deployed together on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present security
    considerations that may be new to IP- based wide area network designers. This
    draft, intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these
    security considerations. In addition, this draft collects all security- related
    statements from the various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use Cases, etc) into
    a single location Section 7.</p>"
