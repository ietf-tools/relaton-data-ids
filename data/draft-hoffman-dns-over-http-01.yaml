abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to make DNS queries and get DNS responses
    over HTTPS. The main driver for this document is to allow clients who want to
    send DNS queries over HTTP transport to be able to do in a secure and interoperable
    fashion, regardless of the format of the responses. Comments on this draft can
    be sent to the dnsoverhttp mailing list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp
    .</p>"
