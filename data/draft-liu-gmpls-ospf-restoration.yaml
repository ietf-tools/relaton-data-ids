abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the OSPF-TE routing protocol
    in support of path computation for shared mesh restoration. New optional sub-TLVs
    are added to the link TLV of the Traffic Engineering (TE) LSA so that the sharing
    information of the restoration resource on the TE link reserved for shared mesh
    restoration is disseminated. The extensions supports both SRLG-disjoint and node-disjoint
    paths.</p>"
