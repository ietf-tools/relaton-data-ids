abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe distributed interactive simulation (DIS) scenarios from
    the vantage point of hardware and software vendors who would need to address the
    network implications and requirements to enable large scale networked multiplayer
    virtual worlds. This document is meant to migrate the knowledge of the traditional
    Department of Defense (DoD) modeling and simulation community into tangible design
    metrics for the commercial networking community [2]. [Note: The term 'DIS' is
    used here generically to describe the type of simulations used to implement these
    scenarios. It does not imply the use of IEEE 1278.1 protocols[1], frequently referred
    to as DIS protocols.]</p>"
