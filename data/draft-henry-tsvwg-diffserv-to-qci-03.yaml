abstract:
- content: "<p>As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices include
    more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries between telecommunication
    and other applications becomes less clear. Simultaneously, as the end-devices
    become more mobile, application traffic transits more often between enterprise
    networks, the Internet, and cellular telecommunication networks, sometimes using
    simultaneously more than one path and network type. In this context, it is crucial
    that quality of service be aligned between these different environments. However,
    this is not always the case by default, and cellular communication networks use
    a different QoS nomenclature from the Internet and enterprise networks. This document
    specifies a set of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Quality of Service
    (QoS) Class Identifiers (QCI) and 5G QoS Identifiers (5QI) to Differentiated Services
    Code Point (DSCP) mappings, to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by
    the 3GPP with the recommendations offered by the IETF, so as to maintain a consistent
    QoS treatment between cellular networks and the Internet. This mapping can be
    used by enterprises or implementers expecting traffic to flow through both types
    of network, and wishing to align the QoS treatment applied to one network under
    their control with the QoS treatment applied to the other network.</p>"
