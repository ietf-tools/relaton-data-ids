abstract:
- content: "<p>The MANET Working Group is developing management interfaces, i.e.,
    Management Information Base (MIB) modules, for its control protocols, e.g., Neighborhood
    Discovery Protocol (NHDP), Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF), etc. The NETMOD
    Working group is developing a set of standard YANG modules for the basic configuration
    management of standard IP capable devices. Future IP capable radio networks will
    rely upon these and other modules for their management. The convergence of these
    activities requires the development of a conceptual radio management model to
    help promote a consistent set of modules for the configuration, monitoring and
    notification management of typical wireless radio devices. This document provides
    such a framework.</p>"
