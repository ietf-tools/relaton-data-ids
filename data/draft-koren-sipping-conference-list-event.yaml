abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications related to conference lists. A new conference
    list event package is specified. This event package allows a user to subscribe
    to a single event (the conference-list) and receive notifications that contain
    the list of conferences to which the user belongs and the status of each conference.
    The notifications sent from the conference server can contain either the entire
    list of the user's conferences or a partial list with the updates since the previous
    notification.</p>"
