abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5176 defines Change of Authorization (CoA) and Disconnect Message
    (DM) behavior for RADIUS. Section 3.1 of that document suggests that proxying
    these messages is possible, but gives no guidance as to how that is done. This
    specification corrects that ommission.</p>"
