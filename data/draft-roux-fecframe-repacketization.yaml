abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the subject of FEC-based protection of multimedia
    streams. It is proposed to apply re-packetization on the application source stream
    data units in order to get a constant data unit size within each block. A reverse
    packetization operation should also be applied in the receiver in order to provide
    the application consumer with original application data units. By avoiding any
    padding in the process of repair packet production, this proposal brings a significant
    performance enhancement which is evaluated by simulation. The proposed re-packetization
    operations can be used without requiring change to the FEC framework.</p>"
