abstract:
- content: "<p>A switching fabric in a massive scale data center can comprise many
    10,000's of switches and 100,000's of IP hosts. To connect and configure a network
    of such size needs automation to avoid errors. Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) protocols
    exist. These can configure IP devices that are reachable by the ZTP agents. A
    method to combine BGP, DHCPv6 and SRv6 with ZTP that can be used to discover and
    configure an entire network of devices is described. It is designed to scale well,
    because each networked device is not required to know about more than its directly
    connected neighborhood.</p>"
