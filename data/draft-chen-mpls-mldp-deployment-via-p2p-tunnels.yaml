abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing specification for Multipoint Label Distribution Protocol
    (mLDP) functionality assumes that a pair of LDP speakers which support the P2MP/MP2MP
    capability are directly connected, or they can reach each other through targeted
    LDP session and transparent tunnel(s). However, the real deployment may not satisfy
    these assumptions, especially in the case where the targeted LDP session and the
    transparent tunnel(s) have to be pre-established. This document provides an automatic
    solution for finding the nearest upstream node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP
    along the path from the current node to the root node, and triggering the targeted
    LDP session and transparent tunnel(s) when needed.</p>"
