abstract:
- content: "<p>The home network naming architecture as described in [I-D.mglt-homenet-front-end-naming-delegation]
    requires a complex naming configuration on the CPE. This configuration MAY not
    be handled easily by the average end user. Furthermore, such misconfiguration
    MAY result in making home network unreachable. This document proposes a DHCP option
    that provides the CPE all necessary parameters to set up the home network naming
    architecture. First, this DHCP option provides automatic configuration and avoids
    most end users' misconfigurations. Most average end users may not require specific
    configuration, and their ISP default configuration MAY fully address their needs.
    In that case, the naming homenet architecture configuration will be completely
    transparent to the end users. Then, saving naming configuration outside the CPE,
    makes it resilient to change of CPE or CPE upgrades. Such configuration may also
    be configured by the end user, via the customer area of their ISP.</p>"
