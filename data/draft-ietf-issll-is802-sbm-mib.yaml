abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP/SBM server
    implementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC 2206
    and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control of the base signaling
    protocols themselves, as well as some of the admission control decisions. These
    definitions are not intended to be exhaustive but they have been identified as
    useful for practical implementations.</p>"
