abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses problems arising when ASCII based application
    signaling protocols are used over cellular access channels. The protocols discussed
    are SIP, RTSP and SDP. The problems are call setup delays and decreased system
    capacity due to inefficient signaling by these protocols. An outline of an algorithm
    for compression of these protocols is given</p>"
