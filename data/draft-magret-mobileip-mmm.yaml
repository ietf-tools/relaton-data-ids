abstract:
- content: "<p>The document proposes an extension to Mobile IP [RFC2002] to offer
    a support of micro-mobility. Micro-mobility refers to the part of a mobile protocol
    allowing a mobile node to move without having to notify its home agent. The mobile
    node's home agent's notification is a concept defined by Mobile IP [RFC2002].
    This protocol defines a service known as macro-mobility. The protocol defined
    in this Internet Draft specifies the messages and the operations required to extend
    Mobile IP.</p>"
