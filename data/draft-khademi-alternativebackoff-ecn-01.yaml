abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an experimental update to RFC3168. It updates the
    TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification received via Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN). ECN-marking can allow a network device to signal congestion
    at a point before a transport experiences congestion loss or additional queueing
    delay. The updated method is less conservative than the TCP reaction in response
    to loss. The intention is to achieve good throughput when the queue at the bottleneck
    is smaller than the bandwidth-delay-product of the connection. This is more likely
    when an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism has used ECN to CE-mark a packet,
    than when a packet was lost. Future versions of this document will discuss SCTP
    as well as other transports using ECN.</p>"
