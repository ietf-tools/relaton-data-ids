abstract:
- content: "<p>Hysteresis delays the effect of changes in link metric on parent selection.
    Such delay makes the topology stable despite jitters in link metrics. The Routing
    Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) allows the use of objective functions
    to construct routes that optimize or constrain a routing metric on the paths.
    This specification describes the Minimum Rank Objective Function with Hysteresis
    (MRHOF), an objective function that minimizes the node rank in terms of a given
    metric, while using hysteresis to prevent excessive rank churn. The use of MRHOF
    with RPL results in nodes selecting stable paths that minimize the given routing
    metric to the roots of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).</p>"
