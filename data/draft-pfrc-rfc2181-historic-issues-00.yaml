abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2181 is an amalgamation of eight independent components that were
    lumped together into a single document, ostensibly because none were of enough
    interest to create a standalone reference for each idea. After nearly two decades,
    and a number of RFCs that update portions of RFC 2181, it seems reasonable to
    move RFC 2181 to historic status and focus on each idea independentally. This
    document introduces eight standalone docuements, one for each of the ideas collected
    in RFC 2181 and allows for examination of each idea independently. In doing so,
    this document moves RFC 2181 to historic status.</p>"
