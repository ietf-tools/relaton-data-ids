- content: "<p>This memo defines a set of DNS (Domain Name System) extensions that
    have been created for the Internet MIB. When used in conjunction with the Structure
    of Management Information (RFC 1155), the Management Information Base for Network
    Management of TCP/IP-based internets (RFC 1213) and the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (RFC 1157), it will be possible to provide integrated network management
    of DNS resolver and server software in standard TCP/IP based environments. This
    document was produced by the DNS working group.</p>"
