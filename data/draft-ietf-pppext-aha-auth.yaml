abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method of encapsulating
    Network Layer protocol information over point-to-point links. PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an Authentication
    Protocol. This document describes a new authentication mechanism: the Arbitrary
    Handshake Authentication (AHA) protocol. AHA seeks to provide for arbitrary length
    authentication handshakes and an authentication abstraction that allows the PPP
    client and server implementations to provide authentication service while knowing
    as little as possible of the details of the authentication protocol. AHA is not
    an authentication protocol but rather is a carrier for authentication protocols.
    AHA adds an additional protocol negotiation phase in order to add the principal's
    declared identity into the decision of which authentication protocol to use.</p>"
