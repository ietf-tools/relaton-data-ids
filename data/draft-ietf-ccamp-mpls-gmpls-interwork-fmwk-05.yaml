abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS-TE control
    plane to a GMPLS control plane. An appropriate migration strategy will be selected
    based on various factors including the service provider's network deployment plan,
    customer demand, and operational policy. This document presents several migration
    models and strategies for migrating from MPLS-TE to GMPLS. In the course of migration,
    MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices, or networks, may coexist that may require interworking
    between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols. Aspects of the required interworking are
    discussed as it will influence the choice of a migration strategy. This framework
    document provides a migration toolkit to aid the operator in selection of an appropriate
    strategy. This framework document also lists a set of solutions that may aid in
    interworking, and highlights a set of potential issues. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
