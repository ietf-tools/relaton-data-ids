abstract:
- content: "<p>We study the performance of the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and the interpolated
    ON-OFF voice over the differentiated services Internet. Both the Premium and Assured
    services are tested, and their relative performance is investigated. Using these
    services, at the DS3 rate, the call handling capacity can be doubled, at the expense
    of packetization delay and a few milliseconds packet delay. Also, at a reasonable
    load level, if the Assured flows are smooth their playout delay could be limited
    to a few milliseconds. This is true even in the presence of the higher-priority
    Premium flows. The loss rate of the Assured packets at the RIO buffer is observed
    to be within the order of 10^(-06), where as the best effort packet loss rate
    is within the order of 10^(-02). Finally, shaping the Premium traffic reaches
    diminishing returns; shaping could often exceedingly increase the end-to-end delay
    and jitter of the Premium traffic. A pdf or ps version of this document is available
