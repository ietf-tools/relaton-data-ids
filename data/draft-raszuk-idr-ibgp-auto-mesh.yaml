abstract:
- content: "<p>The distribution of BGP routing information within an autonomous system
    requires all border routers to be fully meshed. This constitutes a significant
    operational problem in terms of configuration management. This has led to the
    wide-spread adoption of route reflection [RFC2796], primarily in order to reduce
    the number systems which configuration must be modified in order to introduce
    or remove a new internal BGP speaker. Route reflection, however, implies with
    it information reduction which is not always desired. This document defines a
    discovery mechanism that is designed to address the problem of introducing (or
    removing) a BGP speaker into an iBGP mesh without implying any other behavior
    change when compared to manual configuration.</p>"
