abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec ESP with AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-CCM or AES-GCM sends an IV in
    each IP packet, which represents 8 or 16 additional bytes. In some context, such
    as IoT, the cost of sending bytes over computing these bytes is generally in favor
    of the computation. As a result, it would be better to compute the IV on each
    party then to send it. The document describes how to the IV can be generated instead
    of being sent. This document limits the IV generation for AES-CBC, AES- CTR, AES-CCM
    and AES-GCM but can be used for additional cryptographic mode and suites.</p>"
