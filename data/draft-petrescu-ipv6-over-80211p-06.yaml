abstract:
- content: <p>In order to transmit IPv6 packets on IEEE 802.11 networks run outside
    the context of a basic service set (OCB, earlier "802.11p") there is a need to
    define a few parameters such as the recommended Maximum Transmission Unit size,
    the header format preceding the IPv6 header, the Type value within it, and others.
    This document describes these parameters for IPv6 and IEEE 802.11 OCB networks;
    it portrays the layering of IPv6 on 802.11 OCB similarly to other known 802.11
    and Ethernet layers - by using an Ethernet Adaptation Layer. In addition, the
    document attempts to list what is different in 802.11 OCB (802.11p) compared to
    more 'traditional' 802.11a/b/g/n layers, layers over which IPv6 protocols operates
    without issues. Most notably, the operation outside the context of a BSS (OCB)
    has impact on IPv6 handover behaviour and on IPv6 security. An example of an IPv6
    packet captured while transmitted over an IEEE 802.11 OCB link (802.11p) is given.</p>
