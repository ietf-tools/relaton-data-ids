abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin server to
    describe the secondary cache key ([RFC7234], section 4.1) for a resource, by conveying
    what is effectively a short algorithm that can be used upon later requests to
    determine if a stored response is reusable for a given request. Key has the advantage
    of avoiding an additional round trip for validation whenever a new request differs
    slightly, but not significantly, from prior requests. Key also informs user agents
    of the request characteristics that might result in different content, which can
    be useful if the user agent is not sending request header fields in order to reduce
    the risk of fingerprinting.</p>"
