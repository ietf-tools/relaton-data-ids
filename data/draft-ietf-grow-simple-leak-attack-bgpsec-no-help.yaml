abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates
    how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily circumvented
    in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via BGP. It is meant to serve
    as input to the IETF's Global Routing Operations Working group (GROW) during routing
    security requirements discussions and subsequent specification.</p>"
