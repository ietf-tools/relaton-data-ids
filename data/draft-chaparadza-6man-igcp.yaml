abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a proposal for a multi-purpose Generic Control
    Protocol (IGCP) for IPv6 based networks. There is a growing need for a generic
    control protocol framework that can be further customized to specific usage contexts
    in which certain types of control information exchange messages and behavior among
    some functional entities hosted by different nodes is desired. For example, the
    growing area of self-management, self-organization and autonomic networking introduces
    functional entities into the node and network architectures that need to exchange
    control information in order to implement self-adaptive behavior and dynamic network
    configuration and optimization. In this document, we capture a number of control
    message exchange types of contexts for which a generic control protocol would
    be desired. The extensibility of ICMPv6 offers the room for designing such a generic
    control protocol. In this document, we present our proposal for such a generic
    control protocol that is based on extending ICMPv6, whose message format is divided
    into two parts: a Common Part and a Generic Data Part that can be further structured
    according to some usage context of control messages further encapsulated by the
    Data Part that need to be parsed and used by entities meant to interpret the Data
    Part. We also give an example use case, where functional entities residing in
    different nodes exchange information using the IGCP generic messages.</p>"
