abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an extension to the naming mechanism of disruption
    tolerant networks (RFC4838) to support intentional naming. Intentional naming
    is a means by which a source node specifies the destination node(s) for a bundle
    in terms of predicates on attributes of the node(s), instead of by a canonical
    endpoint identifier (EID) of the node. Intentional naming is closely tied to the
    concept of binding, as described in RFC 4838. Since information required to route
    an intentionally named bundle may not be available at the source node, this information
    must be supplied at one or more subsequent nodes along the bundle's path toward
    its destination(s). The architecture required for an intentional naming capability
    in a DTN must support the notion that a bundle can make progress toward its destination(s)
    in the absence of complete binding information. In this document we describe a
    framework for intentional naming in a DTN, propose a syntax for intentional names,
    and describe a distributed procedure for late or partial binding. We also present
    sample use cases for late binding and a notional name binding algorithm, called
    GRAIN, that can deliver bundles to intentional names with geographic and role
    attributes, e.g. "first responders within a kilometer of a specified location."
    Finally, we discuss the limitations in our current ability to field an ideal intentional
    naming system (i.e., one that can support generic intentional names), and we suggest
    a somewhat restrictive framework that is both useful and feasible to deploy.</p>
