abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case for the SIP Identity document involving
    certificate management with the focus on enterprise environments. It provides
    a best current practice document for binding an identity to a certificate for
    the duration of a session. The certificate may then be used to bootstrap further
    security parameters, e.g., for securing media data. A discussion of possible enhancements
    is included in the appendix.</p>"
