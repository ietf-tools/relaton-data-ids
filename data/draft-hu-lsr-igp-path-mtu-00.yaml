abstract:
- content: <p>Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanism. It allows
    for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding
    paths as sequences of topological sub-paths which are called segments. These segments
    are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF). Unlike the
    MPLS, SR does not have the specific path construction signaling so that it cannot
    support the Path MTU. This draft provides the necessary IS-IS and OSPF extensions
    about the Path MTU that need to be used on SR. Here, the term "OSPF" means both
    OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</p>
