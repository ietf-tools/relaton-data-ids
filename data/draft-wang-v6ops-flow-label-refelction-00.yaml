abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to differentiate
    the various traffic flow session within network. Current related RFCs(RFC 6437
    and RFC 6438 etc.)describe the IPv6 Flow Label generation recommendation and usage
    in network traffic load balance. But all of these documents focus mainly how the
    packet source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder in-path treats
    it. None of the existing documents describes the relation between the flow label
    from source nodes and its corresponding value in return packet. This draft describes
    the requirements for flow label reflection between the upstream session and the
    corresponding downstream session, the benefit of this mirroring mechanism and
    its influence to the current proposed IPv6 flow label usage. This mechanism is
    unique to IPv6, and should be exploited to promote the deployment of IPv6 technology
    in more rapid pace.</p>"
