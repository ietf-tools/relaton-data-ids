abstract:
- content: <p>This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
    a mapping of IP address prefixes to simplified geolocation information, colloquially
    termed a geolocation "feed". Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds
    to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. This format
    intentionally only allows specifying coarse level location. Some technical organizations
    operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already
    experimentally published small geolocation feeds. This document describes a currently
    deployed format. At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated these feeds into
    a geolocation data pipeline, and a significant number of ISPs are using it to
    inform them where their prefixes should be geolocated.</p>
