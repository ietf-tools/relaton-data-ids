- content: "<p>This document describes MCM, a protocol for controlling a shared ATM
    multicast tree supporting Mutipoint-to-Multipoint communication. The protocol
    guarantees that there is no cell interleaving at any group receiver. No cell buffering
    inside the network is required, and all cell forwarding is performed at the ATM
    layer.</p>"
