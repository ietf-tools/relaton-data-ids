abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the DNSNR Resource Record (RR) for the Non-Repudiation
    (NR) of Existence service in the context of the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
    The DNSNR is an alternative to NSEC or "Authenticated Denial of Existence" Resource
    Records. A signed DNSNR RR protects security-aware DNS components against false
    denial of existence of RRsets by providing the RR types that exist for its ownername,
    which optionally includes a non-authoritative delegation point NS RR type. Labels
    in the ownername and the RDATA may be a hash-value as a defense against zone traversal.</p>
