abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a communication mechanism between
    relay agent and the server. This mechanism can help the centralized DHCPv6 server
    to select the right configuration for the client based on the authorization information
    received from a separate RADIUS server which is not located at the same place
    of DHCPv6 server in the cases where the NAS acts as DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS
    client simultaneously.</p>"
