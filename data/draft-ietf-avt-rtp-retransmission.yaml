abstract:
- content: "<p>RTP retransmission is an effective packet loss recovery technique for
    real-time applications with relaxed delay bounds. This document describes an RTP
    payload format for performing retransmissions. Retransmitted RTP packets are sent
    in a separate stream from the original RTP stream. It is assumed that feedback
    from receivers to senders is available. In particular, it is assumed that Real-time
    Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) feedback as defined in the extended RTP profile
    for RTCP-based feedback (denoted RTP/AVPF) is available in this memo. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
