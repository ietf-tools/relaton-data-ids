abstract:
- content: "<p>In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue may
    occur when pseudo-nickname mechanism in [TRILLPN] is used. This draft describes
    a solution to the RPF check failure issue through centralized replication for
    BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast, Mutlicast) traffic. The solution has all ingress
    RBs send BUM traffic to a centralized node via unicast TRILL encapsulation. When
    the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the traffic and
    forwards the BUM traffic to all destination RBs using a distribution tree established
    via the TRILL base protocol. To avoid RPF check failure on a RBridge sitting between
    the ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, some change of RPF calculation
    algorithm is required. RPF calculation on each RBridge should use the centralized
    node as ingress RB instead of the real ingress RBridge of RBv to perform the calculation.</p>"
