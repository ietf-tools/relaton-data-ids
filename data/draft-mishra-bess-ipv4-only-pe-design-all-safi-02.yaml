abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers try to decide whether or not to
    upgrade their brown field or green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol
    BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of their Provider (P)
    core network as well as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators
    must be able to continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge
    networks are IPv4-Only. [I-D.mishra-bess-ipv4-only-pe-design] details an important
    External BGP (eBGP) PE-CE Edge IPv4-Only peering design that leverages the MP-
    BGP capability exchange by using IPv4 peering as pure transport, allowing both
    IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP
    session. The design change provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that
    exists today with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today. With this
    design change from a control plane perspective a single IPv4 is required for both
    IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates and from a data plane forwarindg perspective an
    IPv4 address need only be configured on the PE and CE interface for both IPv4
    and IPv6 packet forwarding. [I-D.mishra-bess-ipv4-only-pe-design] provides a IPv4-Only
    PE design solution for use cases where operators are not yet ready to migrate
    to IPv6 or SRv6 core and would like to stay on IPv4-Only Core short to long term
    and maybe even indefinitely. With this design, operators can now remain with an
    IPv4-Only Core and do not have to migrate to an IPv6-Only Core. From a technical
    standpoint the underlay can remain IPv4 and still transport IPv6 NLRI to support
    IPv6 customers, and so does not need to be migrated to IPv6-Only underlay. With
    this IPv4-Only PE Design solution, IPv4 addressing only needs to be provisioned
    for the IPv4-Only PE-CE eBGP Edge peering design, thereby eliminating IPv6 provisioning
    at the Edge. This core and edge IPv4-Only peering design can apply to any eBGP
    peering, public internet or private, which can be either Core networks, Data Center
    networks, Access networks or can be any eBGP peering scenario. This document details
    an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS IPv6-Only peering design that
    leverages the MP-BGP capability exchange by using IPv6 peering as pure transport,
    allowing all and any IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) and IPv6
    Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same (Border
    Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session for all Address Family Identifiers (AFI) and
    Subsequent Address Family Identifiers(SAFI). The design change provides the same
    Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP
    sessions as we have today. With this IPv4-Only PE Design, IPv6 address MUST not
    be configured on the the Provider Edge (PE) - Customer Edge (CE), or Inter-AS
    ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) to ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router)
    PE-PE Provider Edge (PE) - Provider Edge (PE). From a control plane perspective
    a single IPv4-Only peer is required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates and
    from a data plane forwarindg perspective an IPv4 address need only be configured
    on the PE to PE Inter-AS peering interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding.
    This document defines the IPv4-Only PE Design as a new PE-CE Edge and ASBR-ASBR
    PE-PE Inter-AS BGP peering Standard which is described in the POC testing document
    [I-D.mishra-bess-ipv4-only-pe-design] which is now extended to support to all
    AFI/SAFI ubiquitously. As service providers migrate to Segment Routing architecture
    SR-MPLS and SRv6, VPN overlay exsits as well, and thus Inter-AS options Option-A,
    Option-B, Option-AB and Option-C are still applicable and thus this extension
    of IPv4-Only peering architecure extension to Inter-AS peering is very relevant
    to Segment Routing as well.</p>"
