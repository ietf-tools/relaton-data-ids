abstract:
- content: "<p>The Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Options Header
    (DOH) for IPv6 defines metrics which are critical for timely end-to-end problem
    resolution, without impacting an operational production network. These metrics
    and their derivations can be used for network diagnostics. The base metrics are:
    packet sequence number and packet timestamp. The timestamp fields require time
    synchronization at the two end points. This document provides implementation guidelines
    for implementing Network Time Protocol (NTP) to provide such synchronization.</p>"
