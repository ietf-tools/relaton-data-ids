abstract:
- content: "<p>An overview of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is provided in
    [FRAMEWORK] and a proposed architecture in [ARCH]. A fundamental concept in MPLS
    is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels
    used to forward traffic between and through them. This common understanding is
    achieved by using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) referenced in [FRAMEWORK]
    and [ARCH]. This document defines the LDP protocol.</p>"
