abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines means of identifying or naming users of telephony
    services within an enterprise. Numeric names (numbers) are used in traditional
    Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs) using QSIG as the network signalling
    protocol. They are also used for external communication, e.g., with a public Integrated
    Services Digital Network (ISDN). Names need not be numeric in Internet Protocol
    (IP) networks employing signalling protocols such as the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). This document therefore looks at naming schemes that are appropriate within
    enterprise IP networks, in particular enterprise IP networks employing SIP as
    the signalling protocol. It also investigates naming schemes that are appropriate
    in a mixed QSIG/SIP enterprise network and the treatment of names at an interworking
    point. It details the use of names not only for selecting a user to participate
    in a call, but also as a means of identifying a user in a call to other users
    in that call. ENUM and private ENUM-like services are also examined.</p>"
