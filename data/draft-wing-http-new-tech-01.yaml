abstract:
- content: <p>People like their computers to work quickly. During the transition to
    new technology, both old and new technologies have to peacefully co-exist. However,
    if users experience connection delays attributed to the new technology the new
    technology will be shunned. HTTP ("The Web") is one of the most visible and time-critical
    applications that is used by nearly every Internet user. It is critical that new
    technologies which improve HTTP not impair or delay the display of HTTP content.
    It is also important that users retain the ability to share URIs amongst friends
    and colleagues, even if the other users have not upgraded to the new technology.
    This draft makes several recommendations to ensure user satisfaction and a smooth
    transition from HTTP's pervasive IPv4 to IPv6 and from TCP to SCTP. The audience
    for this draft is application developers and content providers. This draft is
    discussed on the Applications Discuss mailing list, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.</p>
