abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) provides an essential service on the Internet,
    mapping structured names to a variety of data, usually IP addresses. These names
    appear in email addresses, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), and other application-layer
    identifiers that are often rendered to human users. Because of this, there has
    been a strong demand to acquire names that have significance to people, through
    equivalence to registered trademarks, company names, types of services, and so
    on. There is a danger in this trend; the humans and automata that consume and
    use such names will associate specific semantics with some names and thereby make
    assumptions about the services that are, or should be, provided by the hosts associated
    with the names. Those assumptions can often be false, resulting in a variety of
    failure conditions. This document discusses this problem in more detail and makes
    recommendations on how it can be avoided. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
