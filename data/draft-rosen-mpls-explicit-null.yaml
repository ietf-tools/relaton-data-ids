abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3032 defines a reserved label value known as 'IPv4 Explicit NULL'
    and a reserved label value known as 'IPv6 Explicit NULL'. It states that these
    label values are only legal at the bottom of the MPLS label stack. This restriction
    is now removed, so that those label values are legal anywhere in the stack.</p>"
