abstract:
- content: "<p>Mapping of addresses to names is a feature of DNS. Many sites implement
    it, many others do not. Some applications attempt to use it as a part of a security
    strategy. This document outlines what should be taken into account when deciding
    whether to implement reverse mappings of addresses to names, suggests that site
    administrators implement reverse mappings if there are no strong considerations
    against such mappings, and provides considerations to be taken into account when
    using reverse mappings.</p>"
