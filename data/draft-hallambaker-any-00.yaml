abstract:
- content: "<p>A proposal for use of DNS names to support universal account identifiers
    'handles' is described. Once registered, a handle may be used for authentication
    to any network service, to initiate communication with the holder or as the basis
    for IoT device management. This document is a whitepaper proposing the general
    approach. A strawman prototype supporting single account Web login across multiple
    sites, onboarding of IoT devices and end to end secure messaging, file-drop, voice
    and video and has been built using existing and proposed IETF work.</p>"
