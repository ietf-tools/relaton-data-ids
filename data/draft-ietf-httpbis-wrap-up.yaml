abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP intermediaries sometimes need to terminate long-lived request streams
    in order to facilitate load balancing or impose data limits. However, Web browsers
    commonly cannot retry failed proxied requests when they cannot ascertain whether
    an in-progress request was acted on. To avoid user-visible failures, it is best
    for the intermediary to inform the client of upcoming request stream terminations
    in advance of the actual termination so that the client can wrap up existing operations
    related to that stream and start sending new work to a different stream or connection.
    This document specifies a new "WRAP_UP" capsule that allows a proxy to instruct
    a client that it should not start new requests on a tunneled connection, while
    still allowing it to finish existing requests.</p>
