abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of MPLS TE Fast Reroute ([FAST-REROUTE]), the Merge
    Point (MP) address is required at the Point of Local Repair (PLR) in order to
    select a backup tunnel intersecting a protected Traffic Engineering LSP on a downstream
    LSR. However, existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to find MP address
    multi-areas or multi- domain routing network. Hence, the current MPLS Fast Reroute
    mechanism cannot be used to protect inter-area or inter-AS TE LSPs from a failure
    of an ABR (Area Border Router) or ASBR (Autonomous System Border Router) respectively.
    This document specifies the use of existing RRO IPv4 and IPv6 subobjects (with
    a new flag defined) to define the node- id subobject in order to solve this issue.</p>"
