abstract:
- content: "<p>The notional premise that different Autonomous Systems belong to different
    administrative authorities may not always hold. A single administrative authority
    may instantiate services on and across multiple ASes. A customer accessing those
    services can reasonably expect that attributes such as LOCAL_PREF that influence
    routing be applicable even across different ASes. This document describes a mechanism
    to do so.</p>"
