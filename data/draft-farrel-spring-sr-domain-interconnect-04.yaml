abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) is a forwarding paradigm for use in MPLS and IPv6
    networks. It is intended to be deployed in discrete domains that may be data centers,
    access networks, or other networks that are under the control of a single operator
    and that can easily be upgraded to support this new technology. Traffic originating
    in one SR domain often terminates in another SR domain, but must transit a backbone
    network that provides interconnection between those domains. This document describes
    a mechanism for providing connectivity between SR domains to enable end-to-end
    or domain-to-domain traffic engineering. The approach described allows connectivity
    between SR domains, utilizes traffic engineering mechanisms (RSVP-TE or Segment
    Routing) across the backbone network, makes heavy use of pre-existing technologies,
    and requires the specification of very few additional mechanisms. This document
    provides some background and a problem statement, explains the solution mechanism,
    gives references to other documents that define protocol mechanisms, and provides
    examples. It does not define any new protocol mechanisms.</p>"
