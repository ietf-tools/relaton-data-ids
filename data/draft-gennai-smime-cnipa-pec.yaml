abstract:
- content: <p>Since 1997, the Italian laws have recognized electronic delivery systems
    as legally usable. In 2005, after two years of technical tests, the characteristics
    of an official electronic delivery service, named certified electronic mail (in
    Italian "Posta Elettronica Certificata") were defined, giving the system legal
    standing. The design of the entire system was carried out by the National Center
    for Informatics in the Public Administration of Italy (DigitPA), followed by efforts
    for the implementation and testing of the service. The DigitPA has given the Italian
    National Research Council (CNR), and in particular the Institute of Information
    Science and Technologies at the CNR (ISTI), the task of running tests on providers
    of the service to guarantee the correct implementation and interoperability. This
    document describes the certified email system adopted in Italy. It represents
    the system as it is at the moment of writing, following the technical regulations
    that were written based upon the Italian Law DPR. November 2, 2005. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>
