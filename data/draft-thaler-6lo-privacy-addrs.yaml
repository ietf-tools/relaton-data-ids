abstract:
- content: "<p>It is commonly assumed today that 6LowPAN header compression is incompatible
    (or at least inefficient) with the notion of using addresses with sufficient entropy
    to mitigate various security and privacy threats. This draft explores ways one
    might dispel that notion, and discusses how security/privacy addressing might
    be used on 6LoWPAN technologies without additional overhead in data packets.</p>"
