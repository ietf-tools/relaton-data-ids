abstract:
- content: "<p>On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2 protocol.
    RoCEv2 specification does not define the congestion management and load balancing
    methods. RoCEv2 relies on the existing Link-Layer Flow-Control IEEE 802.1Qbb(Priority-based
    Flow Control, PFC)to provide a lossless network. RoCEv2 Congestion Management(RCM)
    use ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification, defined in RFC3168) to signal the congestion
    to the destination and use the congestion notification to reduce the rate of injection
    and increase the injection rate when the extent of congestion decreases. More
    and more practice of congestion management for RoCEv2 appear in the industry,
    such as DCQCN(Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification). There is a demanding
    for the new RoCE protocol(temporary alias RoCEv3) to provide stronger congestion
    management and load balancing mechanisms for RDMA deployment in modern datacenter.</p>"
