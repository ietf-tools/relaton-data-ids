abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a few changes to cookies inspired by the properties
    of the HTTP State Tokens mechanism proposed in [I-D.west-http-state-tokens]. First,
    cookies should be treated as "SameSite=Lax" by default. Second, cookies that explicitly
    assert "SameSite=None" in order to enable cross-site delivery should also be marked
    as "Secure". Third, same-site should take the scheme of the sites into account.
    Fourth, cookies should respect schemes. Fifth, cookies associated with non-secure
    schemes should be removed at the end of a user's session. Sixth, the definition
    of a session should be tightened.</p>
