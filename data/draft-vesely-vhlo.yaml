abstract:
- content: "<p>Verified Hello (VHLO) is an SMTP extension for managing authorization
    by policy, as done for whitelisting messages. The VHLO command verb provides for
    weak authentication of SMTP clients and policy negotiation. Policies and reputation
    are being increasingly used to identify messages worthiness. However, they are
    currently enforced by rejecting SMTP transactions, or discarding messages. Feedback
    is scarce, also because reply codes are difficult to interpret automatically.
    Negotiation is not provided for. VHLO is designed so that servers can provide
    feedback to their clients about which vouching services or authentication methods
    they require. Credentials can also be negotiated on the fly, in order to allow
    clients to learn whether messages will be whitelisted by the receiving server
    before actually transmitting them. Negotiation and feedback are intended to ease
    rapid diffusion of popular reputation systems and authentication methods. A IANA
    register is defined for extending the set of available methods. The VHLO command
    is similar to EHLO, but accepts a series of parameters. The sender communicates
    the mail domain name of the organization on whose behalf it operates, along with
    any vouching services (VBR) for its reputation. On the other hand, the sending
    host's affiliation with that mail domain is checked by DNS lookups (MX, PTR, or
    SPF) or using DKIM. DNSBLs and Greylisting are also considered. Weakly authenticated
    clients enjoy an intermediate level of trust: they have no relying privileges,
    but may attempt to deliver mail to local users, are whitelisted from some filters,
    and may receive DSNs and feedback-loop abuse reports as needed. However, failing
    to succesfully negotiate VHLO authentication does not preclude a client's ability
    to relay mail: It may relay as usual; that is to say, without knowing whether
    the credentials it tries to provide have any meaning for the receiving server.</p>"
