abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents motivations for extensions to RSVP in order
    to enable setting up of reservations on explicit routes. The advantages of providing
    this support are discussed in the context of MPLS and QoS routing. An approach
    to providing these extensions by means of opaque routing objects in RSVP messages
    is presented.</p>"
