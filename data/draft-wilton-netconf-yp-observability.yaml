abstract:
- content: "<p>This early draft proposes some enhancements to YANG-Push to optimize
    its behavior for operational data telemetry. It also lists some additional issues
    that could potentially be discussed if there is further interest in this work,
    in particular whether we should be attempting extensions to YANG-Push (as this
    document is currently framed) or instead should attempt to define a new 'YANG-Push
    lite'.</p>"
