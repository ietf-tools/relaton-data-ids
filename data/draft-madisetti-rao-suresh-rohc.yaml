abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced Compressed RTP (ECRTP) and Robust Header Compression (ROHC)
    are IP header compression schemes that have been proposed for use in wireless
    applications, primarily for voice and audio applications. While ROHC offers a
    high degree of compression and is robust, it is also computationally expensive.
    On the other hand, ECRTP does not achieve as high a compression, while being less
    expensive computationally. Our porposal, E2CRTP, is an enhanced version of ECRTP
    that offers a middleground between the ROHC and ECRTP, providing robustness, compression
    efficiency, and moderate computational complexity.</p>"
