abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the architecture of mobile SCTP (mSCTP) for
    IP mobility support. The SCTP is the third transport layer protocol next to TCP/UDP.
    It can also be used for IP mobility from the multi- homing features. The SCTP
    with the ADDIP extension (or mSCTP) would provide seamless or soft handover for
    the mobile host without support of routers or agents in the networks. For location
    management, the mSCTP could be used along with Mobile IP, Session Initiation Protocol
    or Reliable Server Pooling.</p>"
