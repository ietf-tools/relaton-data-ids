abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be generated using different algorithms. This draft
    sets out to specify a way for validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server
    which cryptographic algorithms they support.</p>"
