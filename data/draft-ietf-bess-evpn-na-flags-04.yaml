abstract:
- content: "<p>An EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry an IPv4 or
    IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this information
    to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation
    messages and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the Address Resolution procedure.
    The information conveyed in the MAC/IP route may not be enough for the remote
    PE to reply to local ARP or ND requests. For example, if a PE learns an IPv6-&gt;MAC
    ND entry via EVPN, the PE would not know if that particular IPv6-&gt;MAC pair
    belongs to a host, a router or a host with an anycast address, as this information
    is not carried in the MAC/IP route advertisements. Similarly, other information
    relevant to the IP-&gt;MAC ARP/ND entries may be needed. This document defines
    an extended community that is advertised along with an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement
    route and carries information relevant to the ARP/ND resolution, so that an EVPN
    PE implementing a proxy-ARP/ND function can reply to ARP Requests or Neighbor
    Solicitations with the correct information.</p>"
