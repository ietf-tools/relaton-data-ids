abstract:
- content: "<p>As a part of their deliverables, working groups of the IETF may develop
    BEEP profiles. During the development process, it is desirable to assign a transient
    identifier to each profile. If the profile is subsequently published as an RFC,
    then a permanent identifier is subsequently assigned by the IANA.</p>"
