abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes passive DAD techniques over on-demand ad-hoc
    routing protocols such as AODV and DYMO. In order to achieve these two goals:
    (a) improving the accuracy of detecting address conflicts and (b) reducing the
    time taken to detect these conflicts, this document provides several techniques
    using additional information including sequence, location, or neighbor knowledge.</p>"
