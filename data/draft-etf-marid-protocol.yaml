- content: "<p>This document defines the format of a record that domains publish to
    authorize a set of hosts to send mail on its behalf. This document also defines
    the check_host() function that mail receivers evaluate to see if a particular
    host is authorized to submit a particular piece of mail. This document only describes
    the particulars of the syntax and the algorithm of the function. See the MARID
    Core draft (draft-ietf-marid-core) for how these are used in the context of sending
    and receiving Internet mail.</p>"
