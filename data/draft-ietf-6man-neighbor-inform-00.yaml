abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an optional mechanism as part of IPv6 Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration for distribution of unique interface identifiers to
    IPv6 hosts on a link. Hosts can then use these unique interface identifiers to
    generate unique autoconfigured link local and global unicast addresses. This mechanism
    is intended for use in networks where link layer identifiers are used for generating
    interface identifiers and where non unique link layer identifiers will result
    in duplicate link local addresses. An example of such network is Ethernet Broadband
    access networks.</p>"
