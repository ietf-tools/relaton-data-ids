- content: "<p>This document is a product of the Service Location and Internet Printing
    Protocol Working Groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Comments
    should be sent to the srvloc@srvloc.org and ipp@pwg.org mailing lists. This document
    defines the 'service:printer:' abstract type and the attributes associated with
    it. This 'service:printer:' template is designed to be used in conjunction with
    the Service Location Protocol, Version 2 (SLPv2) [13], but may be used with any
    directory service which supports attribute/value pair registration, such as the
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, Version 3 (LDAPv3 [16]). The 'service:printer:'
    type is specified as an abstract service type. Printers advertised with the 'service:printer:'
    abstract type may be accessible by one or more print protocols, such as IPP [3]
    and LPR [2].</p>"
