abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides informational guidance for using the Multipath
    Extension for QUIC with the SCION networking technology. SCION is an inter-domain
    routing protocol that supports path-aware multi-path networking. The multiple
    paths and their associated path information offered by SCION provide opportunities
    as well as challenges for combining QUIC-MP with SCION. This document explores
    various aspects of this combination, such as algorithms for congestion control,
    RTT estimation, and general application scenarios. In addition, it provides techniques
    and guidance to maintain the security of QUIC-MP and SCION, and to leverage path-aware
    multi-path networking with QUIC-MP.</p>"
