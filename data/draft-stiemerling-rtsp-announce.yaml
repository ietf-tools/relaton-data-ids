abstract:
- content: "<p>Some IPTV deployments that are using the Real Time Streaming Protocol
    (RTSP) require the ability of the server to notify clients about asynchronous
    events occurring during an RTSP session. Current deployments typically use the
    ANNOUNCE method of RTSP 1.0 for sending such asynchronous events from a server
    to clients by using some proprietary extensions. However, the ANNOUNCE method
    has been removed from the current RTSP 2.0 draft, leaving the new specification
    without a mechanism for sending asynchronous messages from the server. This memo
    describes a use case for such an asynchronous message and proposes a new RTSP
    2.0 method.</p>"
