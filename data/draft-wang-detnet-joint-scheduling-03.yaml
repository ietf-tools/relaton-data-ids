abstract:
- content: "<p>In industrial field/backhaul networks, joint real-time scheduling method
    is important to make end-to-end flows meet their deadline. This document proposes
    four joint scheduling methods, and they involve four scenarios: time-slotted industrial
    backhaul network, regarding industrial backhaul network as a black box system,
    ignoring delay of industrial backhaul and establishing latency model of industrial
    backhaul network.</p>"
