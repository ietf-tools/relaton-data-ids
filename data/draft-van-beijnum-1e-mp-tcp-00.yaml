abstract:
- content: "<p>Normal TCP/IP operation is for the routing system to select a best
    path that remains stable for some time, and for TCP to adjust to the properties
    of this path to optimize throughput. A multipath TCP would be able to either use
    capacity on multiple paths, or dynamically find the best performing path, and
    therefore reach higher throughput. By adapting to the properties of several paths
    through the usual congestion control algorithms, a multipath TCP shifts its traffic
    to less congested paths, leaving more capacity available for traffic that can't
    move to another path on more congested paths. And when a path fails, this can
    be detected and worked around by TCP much more quickly than by waiting for the
    routing system to repair the failure. This memo specifies a multipath TCP that
    is implemented on the sending host only, without requiring modifications on the
    receiving host.</p>"
