abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the necessity and solutions of PPSP NAT traversal.
    Two NAT traversal solutions based are described in this document: PPSP-ICE and
    RELOAD-ICE solution. PPSP-ICE and RELOAD-ICE solutions both use ICE. PPSP-ICE
    solution uses PPSP messages to convey ICE parameters, while RELOAD-ICE solution
    proposes to form a RELOAD overlay with PPSP peers and use RELOAD messages to exchange
    ICE parameters. Extensions to PPSP are also proposed to support these solutions.</p>"
