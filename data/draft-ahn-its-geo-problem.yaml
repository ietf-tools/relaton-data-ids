abstract:
- content: "<p>For the support of IPv6-based ITS applications, ITS data packets are
    required to be delivered based on the geographical location (longitude and latitude)
    information of the destination ITS node or area. Therefore, geographical forwarding
    mechanisms are preferred in the ITS environment. In this draft, we define the
    issues to be considered in delivering IPv6 ITS data based on geographical location.</p>"
