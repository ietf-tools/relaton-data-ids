abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an authentication service that uses EAP transported
    by means of CoAP messages with the following purposes: o Authenticate a CoAP-enabled
    device that enters a new security domain managed by a domain Controller. o Derive
    key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them, enabling the establishment
    of a security association between them. o Optionally, to generate key material
    for other types of Security Associations. Generally speaking, this document is
    specifying an EAP lower layer based on CoAP, to bring the benefits of EAP to IoT.</p>"
