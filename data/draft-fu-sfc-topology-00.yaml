abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a deployment topology of Service Function Chaining(SFC).
    The topology is in accordance with the SFC architecture in [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture].
    Currently, such architecture only includes architectural concepts, principles,
    and components used in the construction of composite services through deployment
    of SFCs, without any instruction for the field deployment. It is still difficult
    to map from the architecture to a real deployment of SFC. In this document, we
    propose this topology which will give instructions for the field deployments.
    We further propose a VCPE usecase of SFC in the transport network, which explains
    the details of the deployment topology.</p>"
