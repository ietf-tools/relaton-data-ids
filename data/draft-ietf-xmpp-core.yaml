abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and
    Presence Protocol (XMPP), a protocol for streaming Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) elements in order to exchange structured information in close to real time
    between any two network endpoints. While XMPP provides a generalized, extensible
    framework for exchanging XML data, it is used mainly for the purpose of building
    instant messaging and presence applications that meet the requirements of RFC
    2779. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
