abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part by their
    class. The class field is not effective, and it is not used the way it appears
    to have been intended. This memo suspends additions to the DNS class registry
    pending greater clarity on how classes might be used, and until such clarification
    requires those defining new RRTYPEs to define them for all classes.</p>"
