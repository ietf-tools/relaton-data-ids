abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes issues raised by the deployment and use of Internationalized
    Domain Names. It describes problems both at the time of registration and for use
    of those names in the DNS. It recommends that IETF should update the RFCs relating
    to IDNs and a framework to be followed in doing so, as well as summarizing and
    identifying some work that is required outside the IETF. In particular, it proposes
    that some changes be investigated for the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications
    (IDNA) standard and its supporting tables, based on experience gained since those
    standards were completed. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
