abstract:
- content: "<p>The data plane for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8754] is built
    using IPv6 as the underlying forwarding plane. Due to this underlying use of IPv6,
    Segment Identifiers (SIDs) used by SRv6 can resemble IPv6 addresses and behave
    like them [RFC8754][RFC8986] while exhibiting slightly different behaviors in
    some situations. This document intends to explore the characteristics of SRv6
    SIDs and to clarify the relationship of SRv6 SIDs to the IPv6 Addressing Architecture
    [RFC4291].</p>"
