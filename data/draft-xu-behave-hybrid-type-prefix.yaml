abstract:
- content: <p>To build IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses for IPv4/IPv6 translation, the
    Well-Known Prefix (WKP) and Network Specific Prefix (NSP)-based address formats
    have been defined in [Address-Format]. However, both of them have some limitations
    in several use cases. Hence, this document aims at discussing the validity of
    the use cases and assess the interest of the BEHAVE WG to meet the requirement
    of unambiguously distinguishing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresses from native IPv6
    ones. Doing so would guide the address selection and therefore allow avoiding
    crossing unnecessary or even useless address family translators. Conventions used
    in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</p>
