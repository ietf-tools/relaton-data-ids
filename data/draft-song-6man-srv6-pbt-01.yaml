abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications such as SRv6 TE may require to collect detailed performance
    data on SR paths. Existing in-situ OAM techniques incur encapsulation and header
    overhead issues. This document describes a method based on Postcard-based Telemetry
    with Packet Marking for SRv6 on-path OAM, which avoids the extra overhead for
    encapsulating telemetry-related instruction and metadata in SRv6 packets.</p>"
