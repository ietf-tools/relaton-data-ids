abstract:
- content: "<p>A Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture has been specified
    for the computation of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks in
    the context of single or multiple domains (where a domain is referred to as a
    collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or
    path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems). In
    PCE-based environments it is thus critical to monitor the state of the path computation
    chain for troubleshooting and performance monitoring purposes: liveness of each
    element (PCE) involved in the PCE chain, detection of potential resource contention
    states, statistics in term of path computation times are examples of such metrics
    of interest. This document specifies procedures and extensions to the Path Computation
    Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to gather such information.</p>"
