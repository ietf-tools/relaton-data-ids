abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational
    media services such as interactive video. The solution conforms to the packet
    conservation principle and is a hybrid loss- and delay based congestion control/rate
    management algorithm that also supports ECN and L4S. The algorithm is evaluated
    over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a LongTerm Evolution
    (LTE) and 5G system simulator and is shown to achieve both low latency and high
    video throughput in these scenarios. This specification obsoletes RFC 8298. The
    algorithm supports handling of multiple media streams, typical use cases are streaming
    for remote control, AR and 3D VR googles.</p>"
