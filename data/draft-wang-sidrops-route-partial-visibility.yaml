abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), validating prefix-
    origin pairs using Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) globally and performing
    Route Origin Validation (ROV) locally at each Autonomous System (AS) with validated
    ROA payloads (VRPs) can lead to inconsistent results due to partial route visibility.
    This document highlights how partial route visibility can turn originally non-loose
    ROAs into loose VRPs, outlines the causes of partial route visibility, and discusses
    potential solutions to mitigate the issue.</p>"
