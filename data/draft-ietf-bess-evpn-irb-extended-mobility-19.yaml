abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Integrated
    Routing and Bridging (IRB) procedures specified in RFC7432 and RFC9135 to enhance
    the mobility mechanisms for EVPN-IRB based networks. The proposed extensions improve
    the handling of host mobility and duplicate address detection in EVPN-IRB networks
    to cover a broader set of scenarios where a host's unicast IP address to MAC bindings
    may change across moves. These enhancements address limitations in the existing
    EVPN-IRB mobility procedures by providing more efficient and scalable solutions.
    The extensions are backward compatible with existing EVPN-IRB implementations
    and aim to optimize network performance in scenarios involving frequent IP address
    mobility. NOTE TO IESG (TO BE DELETED BEFORE PUBLISHING): This draft lists six
    authors which is above the required limit of five. Given significant and active
    contributions to the draft from all six authors over the course of six years,
    we would like to request IESG to allow publication with six authors. Specifically,
    the three Cisco authors are the original inventors of these procedures and contributed
    heavily to rev 0 draft, most of which is still intact. AT&amp;T is also a key
    contributor towards defining the use cases that this document addresses as well
    as the proposed solution. Authors from Nokia and Juniper have further contributed
    to revisions and discussions steadily over last six years to enable respective
    implementations and a wider adoption.</p>"
