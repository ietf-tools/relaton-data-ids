abstract:
- content: <p>I propose a simple, low-cost, low-power, Static RAM (SRAM) based architecture
    for the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) function of transit and border routers
    in the Default Free Zone (DFZ) of the Internet. This will provide direct hardware
    forwarding irrespective of the size of the "global BGP routing table", within
    the current IPv4 convention of limiting advertised prefixes to no longer than
    /24. Routers with this or a similar architecture provide the only elegant hardware
    solution to the problem of route disaggregation, which is unavoidable due to increasing
    numbers of ISPs and Autonomous System (AS) end-users who need to advertise their
    prefixes on topologically diverse parts of the network, for purposes including
    multihoming and traffic engineering. Router hardware limitations with respect
    to route disaggregation could also be eliminated for IPv6, by adding further SRAMs
    or, on a more limited basis, by using spare space in the SRAM which is required
    for IPv4. Two additional SRAMs and a reallocation of the existing 2000::/3 global
    unicast allocations to a smaller range - for instance 2000::/10 - would provide
    for Provider Independent (PI) /32 allocations to 4 million ISPs and multihomed
    end-users. Each /32 assignment could be advertised as up to eight /35 prefixes
    - each of which provides 8192 /48 user networks. A less disruptive alternative
    to reallocating existing IPv6 global unicast addresses would be to define a /10
    prefix - inside or outside 2000::/3 - for new PI assignments to ISPs and AS end-users
    with the long-term assurance of rapid SRAM-based forwarding for prefixes as short
    as /35, without concern for route aggregation or network topology. It may be feasible,
    for a decade or more, to handle IPv6 without an addition SRAM chip. Unused space
    in the IPv4 chip (or two chips for larger routers) would map 2,097,152 /35 prefixes
    - for instance to support PI assignments of /32 prefixes to 262,144 ISPs and AS
    end-users. This would provide 17 billion /48 prefixes - the standard assignment
    for non-AS end-users.</p>
