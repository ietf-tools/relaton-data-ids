abstract:
- content: "<p>A contributing factor to the explosive growth in IP address allocation
    is the coming together of two seeming unrelated factors. One factor is arbitrary
    relationship within the Domain Name Server that requires an unique IP address
    to be associated with a Domain Name. The second factor is the public's desire
    to have short Domain Names unique to their enterprise. We believe a small modification
    to the Domain Name Server will break this relationship and lessen pressure on
    IP address allocation. This modification should also make system configuration
    easier than dealing with IP addresses for each Domain Name supported on a given
    host. One difficulty with the proposed modification is that similar 'small' changes
    are required in the WWW browsers to pick up the port number and append it to the
    URL.</p>"
