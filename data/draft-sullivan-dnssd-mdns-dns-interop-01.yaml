abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming systems
    other than the Domain Name System when looking for services. Different name systems
    use different conventions for the characters allowed in any name. In order for
    DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems
    are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying technology.
    This memo presents an outline of the requirements for selection of labels for
    mDNS and DNS when they are expected to interoperate in this manner.</p>"
