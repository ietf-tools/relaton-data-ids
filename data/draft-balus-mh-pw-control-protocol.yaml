abstract:
- content: "<p>[MS PWE3 Requirements] describes the requirements to allow a service
    provider to extend the reach of pseudo-wires across multiple domains. A Multi-Segment
    PW is defined as a set of two or more contiguous PW segments that behave and function
    as a single point- to-point PW. The current specification of the PW Architecture
    [PW ARCH] defines the PW as a single Segment entity, connecting the Attachment
    Circuits between two Ultimate PEs (U-PE). The current procedures for establishing
    a single segment PW (SS-PW) is described in [PW Control], where typically an LDP
    session is established between the ultimate PEs handling the Pseudowire End Service
    (PWES). No intermediate nodes, between the PEs, are aware of the PW. The purpose
    of this draft is to specify new LDP extensions, end to end signaling procedures
    to address the related requirements specified in [MS-PWE3 Requirements]. The proposed
    procedures follow the guidelines defined in [RFC3036bis] and enable the usage
    of addressing schemes (L2FECs) and other TLVs already defined for PWs in [PW Control].
    The solution described in the draft provides a MS-PW Operational Model, Signaling
    Procedures consistent with the regular (SS-)PWs, in order to enable seamless implementation,
    deployment. The resulting MS-PW building blocks accommodate and enhance LDP-VPLS,
    VPWS solutions with minimal changes in the Information Models and Software Modules
    related to the L2VPN functionality.</p>"
