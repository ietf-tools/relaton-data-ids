abstract:
- content: <p>This document first updates the concept "Aggregate header limit"(AHL)
    which is originally proposed in RFC8883 to indicate the total header size that
    a router is able to process at full forwarding rate. Then this document describes
    the problems for path calculation and function enablement without the awareness
    of AHL in IPv6, and the considerations for AHL collection are also included.</p>
