abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is aimed at implementors of caching proxies using HTTP/1.1[1]
    and ICPv2[2]. It describes small extensions to these protocols which are intended
    to aid the inter-operation of caching proxies. These extensions provide debug
    facilities, optimizations for ICP reply messages, and the ability to request object
    purge operations.</p>"
