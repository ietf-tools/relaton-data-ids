abstract:
- content: "<p>For scalability purposes, a network may comprise multiple Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas. An inter-area Traffic Engineered Label Switched
    Path (TE-LSP) is an LSP that transits through at least two IGP areas. In a multi-area
    network, topology visibility remains local to a given area, and a head-end Label
    Switching Router (LSR) cannot compute an inter-area shortest constrained path.
    One key application of the Path Computation Element (PCE)-based architecture is
    the computation of inter-area TE-LSP paths. The PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP)
    is used to communicate computation requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs)
    to PCEs, and to return computed paths in responses. This document lists a detailed
    set of PCECP-specific requirements for support of inter-area TE-LSP path computation.
    It complements the generic requirements for a PCE Communication Protocol. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
