abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Path-Aware
    Semantic Addressing (PASA) that enables IP packet transmission over links where
    the transmission of a full length address may not be desirable. Furthermore, packet
    forwarding is stateless, meaning that no routing table needs to be built, rather,
    the forwarding decision is based solely on the destination address structure.
    This document focuses on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy
    Network), in which the topology is static, where nodes' location is fixed, and
    the connection between nodes is also rather stable. This specifications details
    the PASA architecture, address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format
    design, including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.</p>"
