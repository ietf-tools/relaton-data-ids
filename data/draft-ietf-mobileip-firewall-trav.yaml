abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of network security mechanisms such as ingress filtering, firewall
    systems and private address spaces can disrupt normal operation of Mobile IP [GuGl97].
    This document outlines behavioral guidelines for Mobile Nodes, their Home Agents
    and intervening Firewalls. Compliance with these guidelines allows secure datagram
    exchange between a mobile node and its home agent even across firewalls, ingress
    filtering routers and distinct address spaces. To its correspondent nodes, the
    mobile node appears to be connected to its home network even while roaming on
    the general Internet. It enjoys the same connectivity (modulo performance penalities)
    and, if desired, privacy outside its protected domain as on the inside. The guidelines
    described here solve a restricted, but still useful, variant of the general firewall
    traversal problem for Mobile IP. They make the following assumptions: (a) All
    intervening firewalls belong to the mobile node's protected home domain and their
    existence and relative placement, with respect to a mobile node's current location,
    is known a priori. (b) Mobile nodes use co-located care-of addresses (rather than
    Foreign Agents) when outside their protected home domain. (c) Firewalls implement
    standard</p>"
