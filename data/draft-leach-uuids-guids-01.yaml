abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the format of UUIDs (Universally Unique
    IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128 bits
    long, and if generated according to the one of the mechanisms in this document,
    is either guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until
    3400 A.D. or extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen).
    UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) [1] and later
    in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment [2].
    This specification is derived from the latter specification with the kind permission
    of the OSF.</p>"
