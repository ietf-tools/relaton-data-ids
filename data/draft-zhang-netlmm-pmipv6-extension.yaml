abstract:
- content: "<p>The NetLMM WG is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized
    mobility management (NetLMM), taking basic support for registration, de-registration
    and handover into account in the first protocol release. When a mobile node connects
    to the access networks through a sole interface or multiple interfaces, the condition
    of the access networks should be considered to improve the performance of the
    ongoing applications. According to the normal operation, Local Mobility Anchor
    (LMA) can not get enough information to do the necessary scheduling with Mobile
    Access Gateway (MAG) and Mobile Node (MN), such as flow distribution. This document
    defines a PMIPv6 extension that carries network condition in the form of simple
    class indication which is calculated and sent from MAG to LMA in the Access Technology
    Type option.</p>"
