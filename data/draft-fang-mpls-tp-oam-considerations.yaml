abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is
    based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudo wire (PW) procedures as specified in
    the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudo wire (PW) and multi-segment PW
    (MS-PW) architectures complemented with additional Operations, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM) procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching
    management for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence
    of a control plane. This document is intended to explain the criticality of progressing
    the essential suite of MPLS-TP OAM solution elements in order to meet the urgent
    and increasing requirements for metro packet transport networks. It describes
    examples of key packet transport network applications for several operators, reviews
    associated MPLS-TP service provider requirements, and analyzes MPLS-TP OAM solution
    approaches that have been submitted to the IETF. Based upon this, it is recommended
    that the solution elements described in draft-bhh- mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] be included
    within the MPLS-TP toolkit for supporting MPLS-TP OAM Functions, and that the
    draft be progressed as a Standards Track RFC.</p>"
