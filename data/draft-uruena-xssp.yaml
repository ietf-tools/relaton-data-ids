abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the eXtensible Service Subscription Protocol
    (XSSP), a lightweight protocol that allows XSDF Agents to be subscribed to the
    Service information repository. XSDF subscribed Agents are notified when any change
    occurs. Directory Agents from the same Realm are subscribed among them in order
    to synchronize the common Service repository. XSSP is one of the protocols of
    the eXtensible Service Discovery Framework (XSDF).</p>"
