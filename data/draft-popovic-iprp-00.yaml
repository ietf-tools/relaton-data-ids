abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable packet delivery within stringent delay-constraints is of paramount
    importance to industrial processes with hard real-time constraints, such as electrical
    grid monitoring. Because retransmission and coding techniques counteract the delay
    requirements, reliability is achieved through replication over multiple fail-independent
    paths. Existing solutions such as the parallel redundancy protocol (PRP) replicate
    all packets at the MAC layer over parallel paths. PRP works best in local area
    networks, e.g., sub-station networks. However, it is not viable for IP-layer wide-area
    networks which are key elements of emerging smart grids. Such a limitation on
    scalability, coupled with lack of security, and diagnostic inability, renders
    it unsuitable for reliable data- delivery in smart grids. To address this issue,
    a transport-layer design: IP parallel redundancy protocol (iPRP) is presented.
    Designing iPRP poses non-trivial challenges in the form of selective packet-replication,
    soft-state and multicast support. In addition to unicast, iPRP supports multicast,
    widely used in smart-grid networks. It replicates only time-critical UDP traffic.
    iPRP only requires a simple software installation on the end-devices. There are
    no other modifications needed to the existing monitoring application, end- device
    operating system or to the intermediate network devices. iPRP has a set of diagnostic
    tools for network debugging. With an implementation of iPRP in Linux, it is shown
    that iPRP supports multiple flows with minimal processing-and-delay overhead.
    It is publicly available and is currently being installed in the EPFL campus smart-grid.</p>"
