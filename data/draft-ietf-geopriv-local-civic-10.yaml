abstract:
- content: "<p>New fields are occasionally added to civic addresses. A backward- compatible
    mechanism for adding civic address elements to the Geopriv civic address format
    is described. A formal mechanism for handling unsupported extensions when translating
    between XML and DHCP civic address forms is defined for entities that need to
    perform this translation. Initial extensions for some new elements are also defined.
    The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol mechanism (defined in RFC
    5222) that returns civic address element names used for validation of location
    information is clarified and is normatively updated to require a qualifying namespace
    identifier on each civic address element returned as part of the validation process.
