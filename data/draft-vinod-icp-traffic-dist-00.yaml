abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent interest in finding solutions for traffic problems stemming
    from HTTP have centered around the use of cooperating proxy-caches. We contend
    that by using a deterministic, hash-based approach for routing URLs within an
    'array' of proxy servers, many of the benefits of alternative cache cooperation
    protocols (such as ICP) may be realized. As an example of such an implementation
    we propose the use of 'Proxy Client Configuration Files' between proxy servers
    in order to exchange routing information. This implementation is motivated in
    part by the adoption of this file by existing, popular web browsers to provide
    intelligent URL request routing. This draft discusses adopting this well-understood,
    widely implemented browser protocol by web proxies in order to facilitate intelligent
    routing of requests within a network of proxy servers.</p>"
