abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic DNS Update Protocol assumes that the devices/applications
    performing dynamic registration of the DNS records will delete the records from
    the DNS database when the records become invalid. Initial deployment of the devices
    supporting the Dynamic DNS Update protocol indicated that there are multiple legitimate
    scenarios when records dynamically registered in DNS are not removed from the
    database by the devices that originally registered them. This can result in a
    substantial number of stale records. This document describes a mechanism to clean
    up these stale records.</p>"
