abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new algorithm method for rekeying multicast
    groups. It takes advantage of the mathematical properties of modular reduction
    in order to reduce the number of messages needed for rekeying. Moreover the technique
    is very suitable for batch processing. It achieves greater bandwidth reduction
    than other existing batch techniques. Batch processing techniques are specially
    suitable for benchmarks scenarios where a great amount of users can join or leave
    the group at once (typically single source broadcast). One of the most important
    items to take into account when performing batch rekeying is that key trees must
    be kept balanced all the time. Current methods for batch rekeying assure tree
    balancing by adding an additional method to usual rekeying. We propose a batch
    rekeying method that allows members to change their position in the key tree.
    This change has to be notified to single members with the updated keys. An adaptation
    of the GDOI protocol in order to contain this information is finally proposed.</p>"
