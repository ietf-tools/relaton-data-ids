abstract:
- content: '<p>The envelope protocol specifies a structured format for hierarchical
    binary data focused on the ability to transmit it in a privacy- focused way. Envelopes
    are designed to facilitate "smart documents" and have a number of unique features
    including: easy representation of a variety of semantic structures, a built-in
    Merkle-like digest tree, deterministic representation using CBOR, and the ability
    for the holder of a document to selectively encrypt or elide specific parts of
    a document without invalidating the document structure including the digest tree,
    or any cryptographic signatures that rely on it.</p>'
