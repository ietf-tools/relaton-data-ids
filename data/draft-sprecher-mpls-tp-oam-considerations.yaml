abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the MPLS technology
    for use in transport network deployments. The work on MPLS-TP has extended the
    MPLS technology with additional architectural elements and functions that can
    be used in any MPLS deployment. MPLS-TP is a set of functions and features selected
    from the extended MPLS toolset and applied in a consistent way to meet the needs
    and requirements of operators of packet transport networks. During the process
    of development of the profile, additions to the MPLS toolset have been made to
    ensure that the tools available met the requirements. These additions were motivated
    by MPLS-TP, but form part of the wider MPLS toolset such that any of them could
    be used in any MPLS deployment. One major set of additions provides enhanced support
    for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). This enables fault management
    and performance monitoring to the level needed in a transport network. Many solutions
    and protocol extensions have been proposed to address the requirements for MPLS-TP
    OAM, and this document sets out the reasons for selecting a single, coherent set
    of solutions for standardization. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
