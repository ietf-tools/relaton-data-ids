abstract:
  content: "<p>This document specifies a profile of the QUIC protocol and the HTTP/
    QUIC mapping that facilitates the transfer of HTTP resources over multicast IP
    using the QUIC transport as its framing and packetisation layer. Compatibility
    with the QUIC protocol's syntax and semantics is maintained as far as practical
    and additional features are specified where this is not possible.</p>"
