abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs [RFC7519], are URL-safe JSON- based
    security tokens that contain a set of claims that can be signed and/or encrypted.
    JWTs are being widely used and deployed as a simple security token format in numerous
    protocols and applications, both in the area of digital identity, and in other
    application areas. The goal of this Best Current Practices document is to provide
    actionable guidance leading to secure implementation and deployment of JWTs.</p>"
