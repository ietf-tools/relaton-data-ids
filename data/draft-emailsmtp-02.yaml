abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need for information in the email client
    whether the recieved email was send by telnet to a mail server by strangers and
    a way to configure the email clients to not to show such emails.Emails of financial
    importance should not be send using this method.SPAMMING is a distraction.If i
    get 10 SPAM for one authentic email, then i would not be able to pay attention
    to the authentic email.</p>"
