abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to discuss some of the definitions required
    to undertake the specifications of such benchmarks, and also to discuss some of
    the possible ways to benchmark a routing protocol performance within a network,
    and some of the implications of those benchmarks. The definition of convergence
    is discussed first, then polling network devices. Several tests which are commonly
    used to measure network convergence are examined. This draft does not attempt
    to define what techniques should be used to benchmark network convergence, but
    only to provide considerations that testers shoudl consider when attempting to
    measure netowrk convergence using various methods.</p>"
