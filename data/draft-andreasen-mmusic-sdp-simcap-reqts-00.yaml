abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of requirements for defining Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) attributes that will allow SDP to provide a minimal and backwards
    compatible capability negotiation mechanism. The mechanism is intended as a simple
    and limited solution to the general capability negotiation problem being addressed
    by ongoing work on the next generation of SDP, also known as SDPng.</p>"
