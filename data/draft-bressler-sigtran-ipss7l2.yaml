abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use of TCP/IP as the transport protocol
    for common channel signaling, Signaling System #7 (SS7). The migration from the
    current 56k/64k physical layer to an IP based transport will reduce the cost associated
    with dedicated trunk based link. Also, the current signaling point (SP) network
    using quasi- associated architecture will be maintained to make the transition
    as seamless as possible.</p>"
