abstract:
- content: "<p>The shift to multi-cloud environments brought data leakage prevention
    challenges for organisations. The current Cross-Tenant Access Restriction (XTAR)
    mechanisms do not cover critical scenarios where users can connect to multiple
    tenants (organisational and personal), facilitating data exfiltration. The goal,
    similar to previously proposed, reviewed and accepted protocols that have been
    published as RFC standards and are now widely adopted, is to help organisations
    keep their data under control when using one or more Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
    This can be done by incentivising CSPs to adopt the proposed protocol, Extended-Cross-Tenant
    Access Restriction (E-XTAR), consisting of a globally readable header specifying
    the allowed &lt;CSP, tenantID&gt; combinations allowed by the home organisation.
    The work gathers scenarios contributing to the importance of a cloud-agnostic,
    universally embraced protocol.</p>"
