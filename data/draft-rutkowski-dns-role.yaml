abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the surrounding legal jurisdictional, operational,
    and functional requirements and practices in light of potential transitions of
    Internet DNS name and numbering responsibilities and administration. It notes
    that although international and domestic bodies like the ITU or FCC possess jurisdiction
    in this area, they are likely to be receptive to participating in and sanctioning
    some form of new adhoc international and domestic alliances effected by service
    providers and operations bodies. Such an approach would also provide a measure
    of immunity from litigation, and comport with traditional Internet community preferences
    for distributed bottom-up solutions undertaken by existing ISP and operations
    communities whose interests are most affected, rather than top-down single organization
    oversight and control.</p>"
