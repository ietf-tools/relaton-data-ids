abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebSocket protocol [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol] provides
    a subprotocol extension facility. The MessageBroker WebSocket Subprotocol (MBWS)
    is a WebSocket Subprotocol used by messaging clients to send messages to, and
    receive messages from an internet message broker (herein called a message broker).
    A message broker is a messaging intermediary that queues messages sent by its
    clients for asynchronous delivery to its clients. Messages are addressed to message-broker-specific
    address names. Clients send messages to addresses and consume messages from addresses.
    Clients do not send messages directly to other clients. Message brokers provide
    a range of functionality that is outside the scope of MBWS. Typically an internet
    message broker provides a REST API for working with this functionality; such as
    configuring client credentials; setting client access controls; configuring address
    routing; etc. MBWS limits its scope to the definition of a WebSocket subprotocol
    that provides a full duplex, reliable message transport protocol between message
    brokers and their clients; and, between message brokers. Since reliable message
    transport is often independent of a broker's particular features, MBWS can be
    used as the message transport protocol for a wide range of message brokers. The
    MBWS subprotocol defines a binary message frame and a text message frame. Both
    types of frame carry the same protocol; however, the protocol bindings differ
    slightly. The binary frame is a WebSocket binary message that contains an MBWS
    binary header followed by a binary message body. The text frame is a WebSocket
    UTF-8 text message that contains an MBWS text header followed by a text message
    body.</p>"
