abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6 address
    is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the IPv4 network or
    Internet. This document analyses a number of proposed solutions for communicating
    whether the synthesis is taking place, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix
    used by the NAT64 and DNS64. This enables both NAT64 avoidance and intentional
    utilization by allowing local IPv6 address synthesis.</p>"
