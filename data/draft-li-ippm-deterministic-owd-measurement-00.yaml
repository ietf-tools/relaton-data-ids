abstract:
- content: "<p>One-way delay is a key indicator to measure network quality. Some applications
    are one-way transmission in the network, such as some high-definition video services,
    and are very sensitive to one-way delay. Excessive delay will affect user experience
    greatly. To some extent, the network can't even be used, so it is very important
    to accurately measure the network transmission delay. The current one- way delay
    measurement method has problems such as high complexity and low measurement accuracy.
    In order to solve the problem of high- precision one-way delay measurement, a
    one-way delay measurement method based on deterministic networking is proposed
    in this document. The method takes advantage of the delay characteristics of the
    deterministic networking and does not depend on precise time synchronization.</p>"
