abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies how to use "PKCS #12: Personal Information
    Exchange Syntax v1.1" (RFC 7292) to generate the transport key containers for
    storing keys and certificates in conjunction with the Russian national standard
    GOST algorithms. PKCS #12 v1.1 describes a transfer syntax for personal identity
    information, including private keys, certificates, miscellaneous secrets, and
    extensions. This specification has been developed outside the IETF. The purpose
    of publication being to facilitate interoperable implementations that wish to
    support the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement of
    the cryptographic algorithms used here.</p>'
