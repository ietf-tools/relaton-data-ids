abstract:
- content: <p>Based on the hybrid spectrum sensing method, this paper proposes a SENS
    node selection algorithm which effectively reduces the number of nodes participated
    in spectrum sensing. The algorithm reduces the loads and energy consumption of
    the cognitive wireless sensor networks. It conforms to the development trend of
    current cognitive wireless sensor networks. At the same time, This method is also
    suitable for traditional wireless sensor networks. This algorithm which considers
    the perception of energy consumption and performance parameters of nodes forms
    a node priority function, The network selects the nodes according to the priority
    of nodes, It reduces energy consumption and improves the spectrum sensing performance.
    In the cooperative spectrum sensing, sensor nodes transmit the sensing results
    to the fusion center. Moreover, this paper uses the "OR" standard, the node whose
    local sensing decision is "1" transmits the local sensing result to the fusion
    center. So it can reduce the energy consumption in the process of spectrum sensing
    and achieve the purpose of energy saving.</p>
