abstract:
- content: "<p>This document focuses on the Admission Control functionality performed
    by the Edge Router in the IntServ/DiffServ interworking scenario described in
    [COPS-ISDS]. More precisely it describes the interaction between the RSVP and
    the COPS protocols in the Edge Router and introduces an API (Application Programming
    Interface) aimed at allowing the intercommunication between them. Anyway, the
    API described here is designed as a flexible interface, and should be able to
    support communication between a generic application and the COPS Client Type described
    in [COPS-ODRA].</p>"
