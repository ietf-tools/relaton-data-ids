abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet capable mobile or portable devices are already a modern commodity
    while it is becoming all the more common that such devices are hosts to more then
    one wireless interface. The aim of this document is to show that a mobile user
    may make best use of this property by using multiple wireless interfaces in parallel.
    This would incline that the mobile user can distribute active flows across the
    available wireless interfaces and is able to seamlessly transfer them between
    the wireless interfaces in mid-session without interruption.</p>"
