abstract:
- content: <p>Many devices make use of so-called "Call Home" functionality in order
    to be managed or updated, or to otherwise establish outbound communication in
    the face of NATs, firewalls, and mobility. This memo defines call home functionality,
    discusses the requirement for firewall traversal, some mechanisms used, and security
    considerations of those mechanisms. Several existing examples will be shown. This
    memo also contains examples of how one would make SNMP over SSH, NETCONF over
    SSH, and interactive terminal access call-home protocols.</p>
