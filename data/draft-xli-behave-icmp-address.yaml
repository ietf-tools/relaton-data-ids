abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator may receive ICMPv6 packets containing
    non IPv4-translatable addresses as the source that should be passed across the
    translator as an ICMP packet directed to the the IPv4-translatable destination.
    This document discusses the considerations and the stateless address mapping algorithms
    for source address translation in ICMPv6 headers for such cases.</p>"
