    of incident information and statistics among involved parties and responsible
    Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) for reactionary analysis of
    current intruder activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead
    to incident prevention. A common and well defined format will help in retrieving,
    archiving and exchanging Incident Reports across organizations, regions and countries.
