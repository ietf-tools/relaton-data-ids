abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the promising deployment scenarios for Multipath TCP (MPTCP)
    is to enable a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) that is connected to multiple
    networks (e.g., DSL, LTE, WLAN) to optimize the usage of such resources, thereby
    providing better serviceability overall (including whenever the CPE fails to connect
    to one of the access networks). This document specifies a MPTCP profile for such
    deployments in network regions that are firewall- and NAT-free.</p>"
