abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes an existing protocol for transporting
    IP packets over AppleTalk networks. It is intended to specify, standardize, and
    enhance existing implementations. There is much confusion over what MacIP really
    is, as it has grown by many small increments designed and implemented by at least
    as many people. There has been no central or formal design document, so each of
    the protocol additions and their effects are not well understood. We hope to dissect
    the anatomy of the current state of the art, and recommend a functional subset
    of the protocol features and a new gateway architecture that will help provide
    services to multiple zones more reliably. The MacIP protocol is used to transport
    IP packets across AppleTalk networks. There are many existing host and gateway
    implementations of this protocol, and most of them have many slight differences.</p>"
