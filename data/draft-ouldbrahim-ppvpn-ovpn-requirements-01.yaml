abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses service requirements for provider provisioned
    optical virtual private network The intent of this document is to include the
    OVPN work as part of PPVPN charter. A VPN service model based on optical connectivity
    has a lot of functional elements in common with other models already chartered
    in PPVPN. Inclusion of this topic in the charter will facilitate convergence and
    maximize reusability of common techniques to provide VPN service functions independently
    of the VPN connectivity level. That is also a global objective of the PPVPN standardization
    effort.</p>"
