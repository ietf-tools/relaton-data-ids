abstract:
- content: "<p>OCSP [RFC2560] establishes the Internet standard for online certificate
    status. An OCSP path discovery responder is an enhanced OCSP responder that provides
    requestors with certification paths. The technological and geographic diversity
    of the sources of these data motivates existence of service that enables relying-party
    software to acquire certification path data from an OCSP server rather than replicate
    the same functionality. This specification establishes an Internet standard extension
    to OCSP to address this need.</p>"
