abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to address the requirement to support
    protection of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in an MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    mesh topology. The shared mesh protection mechanism enables multiple protection
    paths within a shared mesh protection domain to share protection resources for
    the protection of working paths by coordinating protection switching operations
    according to the priority assigned to each end-to-end linear protection domain.
    This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) /
    International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector
    (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
