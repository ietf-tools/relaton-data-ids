abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may deploy
    IPv6 multicast service in BGP/MPLS IPv6 VPNs. Multicast in IPv4 BGP/MPLS VPN has
    been in operation for several years and related drafts are on RFC standard track.
    IPv6 infrastructure is under construction and new application based on IPv6 is
    being developing now. Multicast will act an important role in the future IPv6
    environment. This document reuses and extends the method defined in draft-ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast-01
    to support multicast traffic in IPv6 VPNs. Specially, both IPv6 core and IPv4
    core are considered in this document. The inter-working between an IPv4 site and
    an IPv6 sited is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
