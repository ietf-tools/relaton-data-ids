abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet pseudowires are widely deployed to support packet transport
    of Ethernet services. These services in-turn provide transport for a variety of
    client networks, e.g., IP and MPLS. This document uses procedures defined in the
    existing IETF specifications of Ethernet pseudowires carried over MPLS networks.
    Many of the requirements for the services provided by the mechanisms explained
    in this document are also recognized by the MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) design
    effort formed jointly by the IETF and ITU-T. The solution described here does
    not address all of the MPLS-TP requirements, but it provides a viable form of
    packet transport service using tools that are already available. This document
    also serves as an indication that existing MPLS techniques form an appropriate
    basis for the design of a fully- featured packet transport solution addressing
    all of the requirements of MPLS-TP. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
