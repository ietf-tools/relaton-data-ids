abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet hosts - such as PCs - while capable of running multicast
    applications, cannot access the MBone (or other wide-area multicast network) because
    the router(s) that connect them to the Internet do not yet support IP multicast
    routing. The 'UDP Multicast Tunneling Protocol' (UMTP) enables such a host to
    establish an 'ad hoc' connection to the MBone by tunneling multicast UDP datagrams
    inside unicast UDP datagrams. By using UDP, this tunneling can be implemented
    as a 'user level' application, without requiring changes to the host's operating
    system.</p>"
