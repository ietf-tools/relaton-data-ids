abstract:
- content: "<p>EDNS0 [EDNS0] specifies a general framework for extending the packet
    format used by the Domain Name System protocols. The framework includes a simple
    version numbering scheme to allow the parties in a DNS protocol exchange to determine
    which extension features the other party understands. While having the advantage
    of simplicity, the version numbering scheme as specified has drawbacks: - It provides
    no way to deprecate a protocol feature; - It provides no way to deploy experimental
    protocol features. This note proposes to replace the monolithic version numbering
    mechanism with a mechanism for listing an explicit set of protocol features that
    a particular implementation supports. We retain version numbering as a way of
    abbreviating the feature sets that we expect to see in common use.</p>"
