abstract:
- content: "<p>Opaque Link-State Advertisements (LSA) extend the topological link
    state of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). The information contained in Opaque
    LSA may be used directly by OSPF or indirectly by some application wishing to
    distribute information throughout the OSPF domain. However the Link-State Database
    (LSDB) synchronization process is kept unified, i.e., there is no messaging or
    processing allowing to order the exchanges in the link state database synchronization
    process. We call this ordering, phasing of logically segmented LSDB into Opaque
    and non-Opaque. The motivation is to prevent delaying reaching Full state whereas
    synchronizing over the entire LSDB would delay full adjacency establishment.</p>"
