abstract:
- content: "<p>There is emerging interest in the use of MPLS LSPs for the delivery
    of multicast traffic. Efficient delivery of multicast traffic using MPLS requires
    P2MP LSPs. This document describes a mechanism to setup P2MP LSPs using PIM-SSM
    and LDP. PIM-SSM is a widely deployed multicast routing protocol and has well
    defined procedures for signalling multicast traffic. LDP is a well defined mechanism
    for distribution of MPLS labels. Utilizing both PIM-SSM and LDP for setting up
    P2MP LSPs keeps the clear separation between signalling and label distribution,
    and minimizes changes to both protocols. PIM-SSM signals when to receive multicast
    traffic and LDP distributes label information regarding how to receive multicast
    traffic.</p>"
