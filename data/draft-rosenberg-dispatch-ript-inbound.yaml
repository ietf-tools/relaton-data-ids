abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) protocol defines
    a technique for establishing, terminating and otherwise managing calls between
    entities in differing administrative domains. While it can be used for single
    user devices like an IP phone, it requires the IP phone to have TLS certificates
    and be publically reachable with a DNS record. This specification remedies this
    by extending RIPP to enable clients to receive inbound calls. It also provides
    basic single-user features such as forking, call push and pull, third-party call
    controls, and call appearances. It describes techniques for resiliency of calls,
    especially for mobile clients with spotty network connectivity.</p>"
