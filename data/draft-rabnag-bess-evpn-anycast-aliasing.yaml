abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) all-active multi-
    homing procedures in Network Virtualization Over Layer-3 (NVO3) networks provide
    the required Split Horizon filtering, Designated Forwarder Election and Aliasing
    functions that the network needs in order to handle the traffic to and from the
    multi-homed CE in an efficient way. In particular, the Aliasing function supports
    load balancing of unicast traffic from remote Network Virtualization Edge (NVE)
    devices to NVEs that are multi-homed to the same CE, regardless of whether the
    CEâ€™s MAC/IP information has been learned on all those NVEs. This document introduces
    an optional enhancement to the EVPN multi-homing Aliasing function, referred to
    as EVPN Anycast Multi- homing. This optimization is specific to EVPN deployments
    over NVO3 tunnels (i.e., IP-based tunnels) and may offer benefits in typical data
    center designs, which are discussed herein.</p>"
