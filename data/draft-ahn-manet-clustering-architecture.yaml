abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture for clustering in the MANET
    which can be an efficient communication structure for the case when MANET nodes
    have the tendency of forming groups. In this type of MANET, each group of nodes
    forms a cluster which is represented by a cluster head. In this draft, we define
    the terminology for the MANET clustering and the related communication procedure.</p>"
