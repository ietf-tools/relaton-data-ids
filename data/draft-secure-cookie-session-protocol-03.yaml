abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of SCS, a small cryptographic protocol
    layered on top of the HTTP cookie facility, that allows its users to produce and
    consume authenticated and encrypted cookies, as opposed to usual cookies, which
    are un-authenticated and sent in clear text. An interesting property, rising naturally
    from the given confidentiality and authentication properties, is that by using
    SCS cookies, it is possible to avoid storing the session state material on the
    server side altogether. In fact, an SCS cookie presented by the user agent to
    the origin server can always be validated (i.e. possibly recognized as self-produced,
    untampered material) and, as such, be used to safely restore application state.
    Hence, typical use cases may include devices with little or no storage offering
    some functionality via an HTTP interface, as well as web applications with high
    availability or load balancing requirements which would prefer to handle application
    state without the need to synchronize the pool through shared storage or peering.
    Nevertheless, its security properties allow SCS to be used whenever the privacy
    and integrity of cookies is a concern, by paying an affordable price in terms
    of increased cookie size, additional CPU clock cycles needed by the symmetric
    key encryption and HMAC algorithms, and related key management, which can be made
    a nearly transparent task.</p>"
