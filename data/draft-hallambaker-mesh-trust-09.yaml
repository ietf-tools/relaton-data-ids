abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper extends Shannon's concept of a 'work factor' as applied
    to evaluation of cryptographic algorithms to provide an objective measure of the
    practical security offered by a protocol or infrastructure design. Considering
    the hypothetical work factor based on an informed estimate of the probable capabilities
    of an attacker with unknown resources provides a better indication of the relative
    strength of protocol designs than the computational work factor of the best-known
    attack. The social work factor is a measure of the trustworthiness of a credential
    issued in a PKI based on the cost of having obtained the credential through fraud
    at a certain point in time. Use of the social work factor allows evaluation of
    Certificate Authority based trust models and peer to peer (Web of Trust) models
    to be evaluated in the same framework. The analysis demonstrates that both approaches
    have limitations and that in certain applications, a blended model is superior
    to either by itself. The final section of the paper describes a proposal to realize
    this blended model using the Mathematical Mesh. [Note to Readers] Discussion of
    this draft takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which
