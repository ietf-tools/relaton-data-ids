abstract:
- content: <p>Building on already available security formats and message transports
    (like PGP/MIME for email), and with the intention to stay interoperable to systems
    widespreadly deployed, pretty Easy privacy (pEp) describes protocols to automatize
    operations (key management, key discovery, private key handling including peer-to-peer
    synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices) that have
    been seen to be barriers to deployment of end-to-end secure interpersonal messaging.
    pEp also introduces "Trustwords" (instead of fingerprints) to verify communication
    peers and proposes a trust rating system to denote secure types of communications
    and signal the privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level. In
    this document, the general design choices and principles of pEp are outlined.</p>
