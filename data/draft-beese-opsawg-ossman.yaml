abstract:
- content: "<p>In commercial embedded systems utilizing open source, there are legal
    requirements to make open source software utilized in a product known. Headless
    devices have no UI to display an open source manifest. Additionally, printed manuals
    become out of date as software updates occur throughout the product lifetime.
    This standard intends to create a common method of retrieving open source manifests
    directly from an embedded device utilizing Ethernet or Wi- Fi.</p>"
