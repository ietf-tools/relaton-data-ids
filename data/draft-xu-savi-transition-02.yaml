abstract:
- content: "<p>IP spoofing always is bothering us along with the Internet invention.
    With the rapid development of IPv6 next generation Internet, this issue is more
    prominent. Existing IP anti-spoofing proposals, including SAVI(Source Address
    Validation Improvement) which was advocated by IETF, only focused on single-stack
    or simple network scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, none of them has paid
    attention to the IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. However, since transition schemes
    are plenty and various, one solution cannot meet all requirements of them. In
    this draft, we present a SAVI-based general frame-work for IP source address validation
    and traceback in the IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios, which achieve this by extracting
    out essential and mutual properties from these schemes, and forming sub-solutions
    for each property. When one transition scheme is composed from various properties,
    its IP source address validation and traceback solution is directly comprised
    by the corresponding sub-solutions. Thus, the most exciting advantage of this
    framework is that it is a once-and-for-all solution no matter how transition schemes
    change.</p>"
