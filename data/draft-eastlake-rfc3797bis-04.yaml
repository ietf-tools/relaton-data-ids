abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method for making random selections in such
    a way as to promote public confidence in the unbiased nature of the choice. This
    method is referred to in this document as "verifiable selection". It focuses on
    the selection of the voting members of the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom)
    from the pool of eligible volunteers; however, similar techniques could be and
    have been applied to other selections. This document obsoletes RFC 3797.</p>
