abstract:
- content: "<p>In the networks where IPv6 tunneling is used, it is not specific about
    how a tunnel end-node identifies the received tunnel packets by checking the destination
    and source addresses. when the tunnel end- node is configured with multiple IPv6
    addresses or multiple IPv6 tunnel instances, such identification is necessary.
    This document describes the problem and defines the behavior of IPv6 tunnel end-
    nodes about identifying tunnel packets.</p>"
