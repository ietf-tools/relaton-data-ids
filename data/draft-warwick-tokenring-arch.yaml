abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains an extract from the approved text of IEEE standard
    802.5R ''Dedicated Token Ring''. The extract comprises the MIB for the Dedicated
    Token Ring Concentrator, in SNMPv2 format. The changes from the previous version
    of this draft are small but important, and are in the area of CRF creation, where
    a RowStatus mechanism replaces the previous way of creating CRFs. 802.5R is a
    standard that encompasses the existing 802.5 token- passing method of operation,
    and also defines a new duplex method of operation for use only on dedicated point
    to point links, that does not use tokens for data transmission. The architecture
    of a DTR Concentrator is defined in the 802.5R standard. It is a MAC layer bridging
    device, which uses a new set of forwarding rules that ease interoperability between
    source routing and transparent bridging in an 802.5 LAN. The DTR Concentrator
    MIB is derived from the Source Routing and Transparent Bridge MIBs (RFCs 1525
    and 1493).</p>"
