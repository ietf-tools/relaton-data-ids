abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an efficient way to ensure erasure-resilient
    transmission of progressively encoded multimedia sources via RTP using Reed-Solomon
    codes. The level of erasure protection can be explicitly adapted to the importance
    of the respective parts in the source stream, thus allowing a graceful degradation
    of application quality with increasing packet loss rate on the network. Hence,
    this type of unequal erasure protection (UXP) schemes is intended to cope with
    the rapidly varying channel conditions on wireless access links to the Internet
    backbone. Nevertheless, backward compatibility to currently standardized non-progressive
    multimedia codecs is ensured, since equal erasure protection (EXP) represents
    a subset of generic UXP. By defining a comparably simple payload format, the proposed
    scheme can be easily integrated into the existing framework for RTP.</p>"
