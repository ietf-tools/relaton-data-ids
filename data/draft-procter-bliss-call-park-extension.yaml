abstract:
- content: "<p>Call Park and Call Retrieve are useful telephony services that are
    familiar to many users. Existing implementations using the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) show that a variety of approaches can be taken, with varying degrees
    of interoperability. This draft discusses a number of feature variations, and
    how they may be implemented using existing techniques. An additional URI parameter
    is also described, which enables further common use-cases to be implemented.</p>"
