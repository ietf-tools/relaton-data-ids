abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension of HTTP authentication framework
    for use with interactive clients. Recently, the fundamental features of HTTP-level
    authentication is not enough for complex requirements of various Web-based applications.
    This makes these applications to implement their own authentication frameworks
    using HTML Forms and other means, which becomes one of the hurdles against introducing
    secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and user- agent clients.
    The extended framework fills gaps between Web application requirements and HTTP
    authentication provisions to solve the above problems, while maintaining some
    upper-compatibility against existing Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.</p>"
