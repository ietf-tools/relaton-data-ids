abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to support mobile networks with Mobile
    IP or Mobile IPv6 using reverse tunneling. It provides this support capability
    with no modifications to Mobile IP or routing protocol signaling, but also defines
    new extensions to ease in the implementation of network mobility. There are two
    described scenarios of mobile router support, consumer mode, and fully enabled
    mode. In the former, the mobile router is not allowed to use routing protocol
    signaling with the home agent, but performs routing for subnet(s) assigned to
    it. In the latter mode, both the home agent and the mobile router use a routing
    protocol in the same manner as fixed routers.</p>"
