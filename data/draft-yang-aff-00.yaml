abstract:
- content: "<p>Alert Filtration and Fusion (AFF) is proposed to solve the problems
    of existing IMS(Intrusion Management System). The Alert Filtration is used to
    filtrate original alerts and reduce the alerts which are obviously unavailable.
    The Alert Fusion is used to reduce redundant alerts and find the relationships
    of alerts. The false positive rate and false negative rate can be reduced by Alert
    Filtration and Fusion.</p>"
