abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal addresses key identification, key serialization, and
    key compression for Quantum Safe Cryptographic (QSC) algorithms currently under
    evaluation in the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process. The purpose of
    this proposal is to simplify the management of key material for algorithms as
    they evolve through standardization phases into production. Early definition of
    key material standards will help expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms
    at the same time as improving interoperability between implementations and minimizing
    divergence across standards.</p>"
