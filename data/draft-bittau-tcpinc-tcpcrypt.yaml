abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies tcpcrypt, a cryptographic protocol that protects
    TCP payload data and is negotiated by means of the TCP Encryption Negotiation
    Option (TCP-ENO) [I-D.ietf-tcpinc-tcpeno]. Tcpcrypt coexists with middleboxes
    by tolerating resegmentation, NATs, and other manipulations of the TCP header.
    The protocol is self-contained and specifically tailored to TCP implementations,
    which often reside in kernels or other environments in which large external software
    dependencies can be undesirable. Because of option size restrictions, the protocol
    requires one additional one-way message latency to perform key exchange. However,
    this cost is avoided between two hosts that have recently established a previous
    tcpcrypt connection.</p>"
