abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem of long delays between connection
    establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios, including that
    in which dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4
    or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments. Additionaly, it describes a modification
    to TCP's reaction to soft errors that has been implemented in a variety of TCP/IP
    stacks to help overcome this problem.</p>"
