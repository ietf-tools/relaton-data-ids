abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for Persistent
    Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' scheme name.
    The purpose of the standard is to support general, global, sustainable, humanly
    readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for such
    web materials. The PWID URI ca assist in two ways: First, by providing potential
    resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme for documents, which is not
    sufficiently covered by existing web reference practices. Second, by providing
    a standardized way to specify web elements in a web collection also known as web
    corpus. Definitions of web collections are often needed for extraction of data
    used in production of research results, e.g. for evaluations in the future. Current
    practices today are not persistent as they often use some CDX version, which vary
    for different implementations.</p>"
