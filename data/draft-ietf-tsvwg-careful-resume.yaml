abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies careful convergence of Congestion Control (CC),
    providing a cautious method that enables fast startup for a wide range of connections
    or reconnections. The method reuses a set of computed CC parameters that are based
    on the previously observed path characteristics between the same pair of transport
    endpoints, such as the bottleneck bandwidth, available capacity, or the Round
    Trip Time (RTT). These parameters are stored, allowing them to be later used to
    modify the CC behavior of a subsequent connection. The document also discusses
    assumptions and defines requirements around how a sender utilizes these parameters
    to provide opportunities for a connection to more quickly get up to speed (i.e.
    utilize the available capacity). It discusses how these changes impact the capacity
    at a shared network bottleneck and the safe response that is needed after any
    indication that the new rate is inappropriate. The method is expected to be appropriate
    to IETF transports.</p>"
