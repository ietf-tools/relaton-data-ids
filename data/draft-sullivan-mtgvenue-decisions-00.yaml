abstract:
- content: "<p>Selecting a site for an IETF meeting necessarily involves balancing
    various factors about the site and the goals of the IETF meeting. Those who are
    faced with choosing a site need guidance on how to prioritize objectives in making
    such decisions, since no algorithm is possible. This memo provides a set of such
    objectives in order of importance.</p>"
