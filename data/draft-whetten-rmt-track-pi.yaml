- content: "<p>One of the protocol instantiations the RMT WG is chartered to create
    is a TRee-based ACKnowledgement protocol (TRACK). Rather than create a set of
    monolithic protocol specifications, the RMT WG has chosen to break the reliable
    multicast protocols into Building Blocks (BB) and Protocol Instantiations (PI).
    A Building Block is a specification of the algorithms of a single component, with
    an abstract interface to other BBs and PIs. A PI combines a set of BBs, adds in
    the additional required functionality not specified in any BB, and specifies the
    specific instantiation of the protocol.</p>"
