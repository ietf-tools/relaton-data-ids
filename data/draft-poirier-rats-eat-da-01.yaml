abstract:
- content: "<p>In confidential computing, device assignment (DA) is the method by
    which a device (e.g., network adapter, GPU), whether on-chip or behind a PCIe
    Root Port, is assigned to a Trusted Virtual Machine (TVM). For the TVM to trust
    the device, the device must provide the TVM with attestation Evidence confirming
    its identity and the state of its firmware and configuration. Since Evidence claims
    can be consumed by 3rd party attestation services external to the TVM, there is
    a need to standardise the representation of Evidence to ensure interoperability.
    This document defines an attestation Evidence format for DA as an EAT (Entity
    Attestation Token) profile.</p>"
