abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a key derivation function (KDF) wrap-around
    or a meta-KDF that's designed to mix in key assignment parameters to the key stream
    generation phase. This allows a security module to rely upon and enforce the key
    assignment parameters during the assigment of key material from the generated
    key stream to the cryptographic objects.</p>"
