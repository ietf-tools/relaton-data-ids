abstract:
- content: "<p>Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework documents several application-agnostic
    mechanisms such as OPES tracing, OPES bypass, and OPES callout protocol. This
    document extends those generic mechanisms for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    adaptation. Together, application-agnostic OPES documents and this HTTP profile
    constitute a complete specification for HTTP adaptation with OPES. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
