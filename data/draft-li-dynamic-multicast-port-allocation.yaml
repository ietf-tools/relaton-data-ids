abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a dynamic multicast port allocation mechanism
    using Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6). The solution enables decoupling between
    the destination port carried in multicast packets sent by the source and the actual
    receiving port used by receivers. This allows multicast receivers to dynamically
    allocate unused ports as receiving ports, eliminating the requirement for all
    receivers to use the same port number. The mechanism defines a new SRv6 function
    End.MTP for automatic multicast port allocation and supports three operational
    modes to accommodate different deployment scenarios.</p>"
