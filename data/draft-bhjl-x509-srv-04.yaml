abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to allow parties to locate X.509 certificate
    stores with Domain Name System Service records in order to retrieve certificates
    and certificate revocation lists. The primary purpose of such retrievals is to
    facilitate the association of X.509 and PGP public keys with e-mail addresses
    to allow for encrypted e-mail exchanges.</p>"
