abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft requests development of detailed specifications for the
    technical and operational requirements for an Internet-based International Emergency
    Preparedness Scheme (IEPS) as defined by ITU-T Recommendation E.106. Public telecommunications
    services have long had such a scheme, to ensure priority handling of telephone
    communications, such as during natural disasters. As a wide range of communication
    services increasingly rely upon the family of specifications related to Internet
    Protocol (IP), IETF work needs to include consideration and provision for supporting
    IEPS. This work needs to be addressed in two phases concurrently - 1) interface
    for transition from today's public switched telephone network (PSTN) to IP-based
    network telephony services, and 2) additional and enhanced capabilities, such
    as application-specific IEPS services. An Email list for discussion and a Web
    site for background and documents has been established to assist the work</p>"
