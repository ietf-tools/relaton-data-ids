- content: "<p>The TCP MD5 Signature Option [RFC2385], used predominantly by BGP,
    has seen significant deployment in critical areas of Internet infrastructure.
    The security of this option relies heavily on the quality of the keying material
    used to compute the MD5 signature. This document addresses the security requirements
    of that keying material.</p>"
