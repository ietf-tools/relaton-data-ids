abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) has been in use in the Internet
    for a decade, and remains one of the most popular protocols (by volume) in use
    today. This document is a replacement for RFC 977, and officially updates the
    protocol specification. It clarifies some vagueness in RFC 977, includes some
    new base functionality, and provides a specific mechanism to add standardized
    extensions to NNTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
