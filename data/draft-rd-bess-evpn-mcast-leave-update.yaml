abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener
    Discovery (MLD) Proxies for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) specification describes the procedures
    to synchronize IGMP/MLD membership report and leave group states in all the PEs
    that are attached to the same Ethernet Segment. In particular, the Multicast Leave
    Synch route described in the same specification, synchronizes the leave procedures
    on all the members of the Ethernet Segment, for a multicast group and for an amount
    of time (the Maximum Response Time). The use of the Maximum Response Time may
    be different depending on whether the local state was created by IGMPv2, IGMPv3
    or MLDv2. In addition, the Maximum Response Time advertised in the Multicast Leave
    Synch route needs to account for the time that it takes for the route to be propagated
    in the network, which might not be easy to predict. This document clarifies the
    use of the Maximum Response Time and updates the procedures for the Multicast
    Leave Synch route.</p>"
