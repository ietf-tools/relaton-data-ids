abstract:
- content: "<p>In centralized IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) architecture,
    the Access Controller (AC) isn't intelligent enough actually to aggregate all
    the wireless frames, even the bandwidth requirement in the access point is increasing.
    Thus it is a general case in the existing operator's network that WTPs forward
    the wireless frames directly to Access Router (AR) to avoid overload on the AC.
    In this scenario, CAPWAP Control Channel and CAPWAP Data Channel are separated
    from each other. This document extends CAPWAP for applicability of CAPWAP Control
    and Data Channel separation.</p>"
