abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP), for active tags, i.e. RFIDs that include tamper resistant computing
    resources, as specified for example in the ISO 14443 or 15693 standards. HIP-Tags
    never expose their identity in clear text, but hide this value (typically an EPC-Code)
    by a particular equation (f) that can be only solved by a dedicated entity, referred
    as the portal. HIP exchanges occurred between HIP- Tags and portals; they are
    shuttled by IP packets, through the Internet cloud.</p>"
