abstract:
- content: "<p>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] defines a network
    representation of a search filter transmitted to an LDAP server. Some applications
    may find it useful to have a common way of representing these search filters in
    a human-readable form. This document defines a human-readable string format for
    representing the full range of possible LDAP version 3 search filters, including
    extended match filters. This document replaces RFC 2254. See Appendix A for a
    list of changes relative to RFC 2254.</p>"
