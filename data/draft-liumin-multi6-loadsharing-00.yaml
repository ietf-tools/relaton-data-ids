abstract:
- content: <p>In order to reach the goal of load sharing and traffic engineering in
    multihoming, there must be some mechanism for the local host to make a selection
    of the "best" source locator to used. Obviously the selection includes the objective
    to select a currently viable path. What's more, it also includes the objective
    to select a path with larger bandwidth, which is more difficult to judge than
    reachability. In this memo, we propose a simple mechanism to determine the availability
    and bandwidth condition between a multihomed host and its ISP. It will help to
    share the load among multiple paths and provide better performance for the host's
    traffic. This mechanism could be part of traffic engineering functions, which
    could be used as the basis of locator selection before initial session establishment
    and aslo could be used to trigger locator swithes to avoid loss of connectivity,
    long delay or large loss rate.</p>
