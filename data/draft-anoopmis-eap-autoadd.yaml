abstract:
- content: "<p>IoT devices are fast getting embedded into our lives, and when put
    together they have the potential to generate a precise and detailed history of
    our lives and store them forever. Their networking and communicational power can
    be unleashed for malicious and sabotage purposes, by a motivated attacker sitting
    in the far corner of the world. Attacks on Industrial IoT systems can cause greater
    disasters. It is therefore essential to inculcate the security aspect, right from
    design to development to operations. The first operation of an IoT device is to
    bootstrap itself, and due importance should be placed to ensure that this operation
    is carried out securely and with due diligence. However, it's easier said than
    done, and this paper outlines several approaches for secure automated bootstrapping
    and also proposes a new method, which is compared against the existing mechanisms
    for several qualitative factors.</p>"
