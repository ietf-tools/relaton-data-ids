abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) that may be
    used as a tool for multicast network management. MCOP provides multicast network
    remote management with centralized information database located at Multicast Control
    Server (MCS). It allows gradual, group and network specific multicast network
    deployment. MCOP protocol is used between MCS and routers that have directly connected
    multicast sources or receivers. The actual control is done by MCOP enabled routers
    based on the information received from the MCS. MCOP router can filter IGMP/MLD
    reports and multicast packets before they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layer
    or multicast routing stack of the router. MCOP is independent of multicast routing
    protocols.</p>"
