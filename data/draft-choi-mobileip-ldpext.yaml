abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how to build the large-scale Mobile IP network
    through the MPLS network. One small-scale Mobile IP network could be connected
    to other networks through the MPLS backbone network. It proposes the MPLS network
    architecture to provide the large-scale Mobile IP network. Specifically, it proposes
    that the label distribution protocol (LDP) can be applied to set up the Label
    switched path (LSP) tunnels between the mobile agents (that is, Foreign Agents
    and Home Agents)[3]. It means that the IP-in-IP tunnels can be replaced by one
    or multiple Label Switched Paths (LSPs) on the MPLS network.</p>"
