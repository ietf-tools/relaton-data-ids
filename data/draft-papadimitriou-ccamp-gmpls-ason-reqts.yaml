abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocol has been defined to
    control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These
    include support for requesting TDM connections including SONET/SDH and Optical
    Transport Networks (OTNs). This document concentrates on the signaling aspects
    of the GMPLS suite of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered by the
    signalling protocol to support the capabilities of an Automatically Switched Optical
    Network (ASON). This document provides a problem statement and additional requirements
    on the GMPLS signaling protocol to support the ASON functionality.</p>"
