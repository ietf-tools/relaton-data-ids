abstract:
- content: "<p>With the maturity of cloud native application development, applications
    can be decomposed into finer grained atomic services. On the other hand, as a
    distributed computing paradigm, fine grained micro-services could be deployed
    and implemented in a distributive way among edges to make computing, storage and
    run-time processing capabilities as close to users as possible to provide satisfied
    QoE. Under the circumstances analyzed, a Hybrid-Function-Chain (HFC) framework
    is proposed in this draft, aiming to wisely allocate and schedule resources and
    services in order to provide consistent end- to-end service provisioning.</p>"
