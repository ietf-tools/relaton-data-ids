abstract:
- content: "<p>Support for network technology in buildings varies greatly depending
    on the age of the building, but the ease of building a home network is also highly
    dependent on the chosen wiring, power, and equipment space designs. As networking
    technology evolves at a fast pace, it is important to choose designs that are
    expected to be useful for a long time. While there are many cabling, equipment,
    and protocol standards, only limited standards exist for the physical network
    layout for new buildings. This memo sets a baseline requirements that new, single-family
    dwellings must at least satisfy in order to benefit from advances in networking
    technology. Standardizing network technology for buildings is a challenging task,
    however. This memo has been submitted for the home networking working group at
    the IETF as one forum that the authors were able to find that cares about the
    home network as a system. However, in general the IETF has expertise only on protocols,
    not on the physical medium. Advice is sought on what existing standards already
    address this problem, what standardization efforts may be under way in the world,
    and if work remains, what the right forum to discuss these matters might be.</p>"
