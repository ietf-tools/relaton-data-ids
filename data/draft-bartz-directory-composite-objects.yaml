abstract:
- content: "<p>Composite Objects for the Directory (COD) describes an abstraction
    layer above the schema, content, and structure facilities of the Directory. COD
    enables the construction of reusable information com- ponents from schema primitives.
    These components include composite objects, type-signed object references, graphs
    of object hierarchies, and object-oriented relationships among Directory objects.
    COD also provides a repository of templates, or prototypes of the information
    components. This repository captures component design information which cannot
    be expressed in the Directory schema. This repository allows the design of the
    components to be unequivocably described and reused both within and beyond the
    immediate Directory instance.</p>"
