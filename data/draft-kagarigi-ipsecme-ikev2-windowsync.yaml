abstract:
- content: '<p>IKEv2 and IPsec protocols are widely used for deploying VPN. In order
    to make such VPN highly available and failure-prone, these VPNs are implemented
    as IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) cluster. But there are many issues in IKEv2/IPsec
    HA cluster. The draft "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" enumerates all the issues
    encountered in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment. This draft proposes an extension
    to IKEv2 protocol to solve main issues of "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in
    Hot Standby cluster and gives implementation advice for others. The main issues
    to be solved are: o IKE Message Id synchronization : This is done by obtaining
    the message Id values from the peer and updating the values at the newly active
    cluster member after the failover. o IPsec SA Counter synchronization : This is
    done by sending incremented the values of replay counters by the newly active
    cluster member to the peer as expected replay counter value.</p>'
