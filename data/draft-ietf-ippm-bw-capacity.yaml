abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring capacity is a task that sounds simple, but in reality can
    be quite complex. In addition, the lack of a unified nomenclature on this subject
    makes it increasingly difficult to properly build, test, and use techniques and
    tools built around these constructs. This document provides definitions for the
    terms 'Capacity' and 'Available Capacity' related to IP traffic traveling between
    a source and destination in an IP network. By doing so, we hope to provide a common
    framework for the discussion and analysis of a diverse set of current and future
    estimation techniques. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
