abstract:
- content: "<p>[RSVP-IPSEC] defines RSVP extensions for IPsec which permit support
    of reservations for individual IPsec flows, but it does not support aggregate
    reservations between the IPsec devices with Diffserv [DIFFSERV] classification
    and scheduling. Conversely, [RSVP-AGG] defines how to aggregate individual RSVP
    reservations over Aggregate IP reservations when the aggregation region supports
    Diffserv, but it does not address the case where the Aggregator and Deaggregator
    use IPsec. Also, [RSVP-AGG] does not address the case where multiple Aggregate
    reservations are needed for the same DSCP from the same Aggregator to the same
    Deaggregator. However, there are scenarios requiring aggregate reservations for
    IPsec tunnels or requiring multiple aggregate reservations for the same DSCP from
    a given Aggregator to a given Deaggregator. This document specifies the incremental
    RSVP extensions beyond those defined in [RSVP-IPSEC] and [RSVP-AGG] to support
    such reservations.</p>"
