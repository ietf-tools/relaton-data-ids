abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an increase in the permitted TCP initial window
    (IW) from between 2 and 4 segments, as specified in RFC 3390, to 10 segments.
    It discusses the motivation behind the increase, the advantages and disadvantages
    of the higher initial window, and presents results from several large scale experiments
    showing that the higher initial window improves the overall performance of many
    web services without risking congestion collapse. Finally, it outlines a list
    of concerns to be addressed in future tests.</p>"
