abstract:
- content: <p>This memo specifies how to support RTP packet stream thinning (or rate
    adaptation) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) with the Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP) running over UDP to make effect in parallel with reliable RTCP
    report to the RTP sender. It introduces "dummy RTP packets" into the single-session
    transmission (SST) mode for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) and Multiview Video Coding
    (MVC). The reactions of RTP receivers upon receiving the "dummy RTP packets" are
    defined. The document also recommend to extend the ECN functionalities based on
    the scalability feature of SVC and MVC.</p>
