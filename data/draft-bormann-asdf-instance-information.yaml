- content: "<p>This document discusses types of Instance Information to be used in
    conjunction with the Semantic Definition Format (SDF) for Data and Interactions
    of Things (draft-ietf-asdf-sdf) and will ultimately define Representation Formats
    for them as well as ways to use SDF Models to describe them. The present revision
    is not much more than a notepad; it is expected that it will be respun at least
    once before the 2025-04-09 ASDF meeting.</p>"
