abstract:
- content: "<p>The design of the core QUIC transport subsumes many HTTP/2 features,
    prominent among them stream multiplexing. A key advantage of the QUIC transport
    is stream multiplexing free of head-of-line (HoL) blocking between streams. In
    HTTP/2, multiplexed streams can suffer HoL blocking due to TCP. If HTTP/2's HPACK
    is used for header compression, HTTP/QUIC is still vulnerable to HoL blocking,
    because of HPACK's assumption of in-order delivery. This draft defines QCRAM,
    a variation of HPACK and mechanisms in the HTTP/QUIC mapping that allow the flexibility
    to avoid header-compression-induced HoL blocking.</p>"
