abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents home control and automation application specific
    requirements for ROuting in Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL). In a modern home,
    a high number of wireless devices are used for a wide set of purposes. Examples
    include lighting control, heating control, sensors, leak detectors, healthcare
    systems and advanced remote controls. Because such devices only cover a limited
    radio range, multi-hop routing is often required. The aim of this document is
    to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices
    in a home network environment.</p>"
