abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing protocols are designed to use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate
    data being received from a neighboring router to ensure that it has not been modified
    in transit, and actually originated from the neighboring router purporting to
    have originating the data. Most of the cryptographic mechanisms defined to date
    rely on hash algorithms applied to the data in the routing protocol packet, which
    means the data is transported, in the clear, along with a signature based on the
    data itself. These mechanisms rely on the manual configuration of the keys used
    to seed, or build, these hash based signatures. This document outlines some of
    the problems with manual keying of these cryptographic algorithms.</p>"
