abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines guidelines by which application designers can
    create applications that communicate reliably and efficiently in the presence
    of Network Address Translators (NATs), particularly when the application has a
    need for "peer-to-peer" (P2P) type of communication. The guidelines allow a P2P
    application to work reliably across a majority of existing NATs, as well as all
    future NATs that conform to the behave requirements specified in companion documents.
    The NAT traversal techniques described in the document do not require the use
    of special proxy or relay protocols, do not require specific knowledge about the
    network topology or the number and type of NATs in the path, and do not require
    any modifications to IP or transport-layer protocols on the end hosts.</p>
