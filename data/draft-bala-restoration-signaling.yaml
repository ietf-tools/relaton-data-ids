abstract:
- content: "<p>Restoration of switched connections under tight time constraints is
    a challenging problem in optical mesh networks. This draft describes different
    protection modes for connections under both local and end- to-end restoration
    scenarios, and defines lightweight protocol mechanisms (over IP) for restoration-related
    signaling.</p>"
