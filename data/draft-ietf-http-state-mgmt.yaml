abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP
    requests and responses. It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set- Cookie,
    which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents.
    The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal, but it can
    interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
