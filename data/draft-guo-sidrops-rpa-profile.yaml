abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
    content type for Route Path Authorizations (RPA) objects used in Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure (RPKI). An RPA is a digitally signed object that provides a
    means of verifying whether an IP address block is received from AS a to AS b and
    announced from AS b to AS c. When validated, an RPA's eContent can be used for
    the detection and mitigation of route hijacking, especially providing protection
    for the AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE. This object is a variant of the aut-num
    object in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR).</p>"
