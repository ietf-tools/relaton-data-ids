abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more operators have deployed or are about to deploy IPv6 transition
    technologies such as DS-lite, MAP, LAFT6, etc. The fundamental elements of these
    technologies are Network Address Translation (NAT) and Tunneling. The elements
    of these transition technologies may be subject to a number of attacks, unless
    appropriate mitigations are in place. This memo discusses the security implications
    of the aforementioned points, and additionally, provides a number of operational
    mitigations that could be deployed against these attacks.</p>"
