abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) is a signaling protocol which adds
    a new layer between the traditional Transport and the Network layer. HIP is an
    end-to-end authentication and key exchange protocol, which supports security and
    mobility in a commendable manner. The HIP base specification is generalized and
    purported to support different key exchange mechanisms in order to provide confidentiality
    protection for the subsequent user data traffic. This draft explains a mechanism
    to establish Secure Real Time Protocol associations, to protect the user data
    packets, by using HIP.</p>"
