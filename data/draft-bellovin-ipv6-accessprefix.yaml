- content: "<p>Some very low-end devices are expected to rely on address-based authentication,
    even though that is not a high-security mechanism. In particular, they may wish
    to permit access by 'local' peers only, for some value of 'local'. This memo proposes
    a new Router Advertisement option to supply a list of privileged prefixes.</p>"
