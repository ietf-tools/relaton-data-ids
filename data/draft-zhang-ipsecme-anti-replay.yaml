abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an alternate method to do the anti-replay checks
    and updates for IP Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Protocol
    (ESP). The method defined in this document obviates the need for bit shifting
    and it reduces the number of times an anti-replay window is adjusted. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
