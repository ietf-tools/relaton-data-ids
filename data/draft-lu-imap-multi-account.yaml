abstract:
- content: "<p>Simultaneous authentication of multiple mail accounts belonging to
    a single user is an attractive feature but is not supported in the current Internet
    Message Access Protocol [RFC3501]. This document introduces an extension of the
    Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With this extension,
    when a client is authenticated with one of its user identifiers, all the other
    associated user identifiers (if present) are also regarded as authenticated ones.
    Furthermore, this document specifies the syntax of LISTA and SELECTA commands
    for the IMAP4rev1 protocol. With LISTA command, a client can obtain a list of
    all the identifiers authenticated for the user. With SELECTA command, a client
    can select one of the user's authenticated identifiers and then gain access to
    all the mailboxes belonging to that identifier, without having to log out and
    re-log in with that identifier.</p>"
