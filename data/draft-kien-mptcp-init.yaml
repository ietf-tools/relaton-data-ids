abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a new method of connection initialization for
    Multipath TCP (MPTCP). In the current implementation, the MPTCP's first subflow
    needs to be successfully initialized before an additional flow takes its turn.
    This yields to a degradation of MPTCP benefit in many use cases (e.g., transferring
    short flows). To overcome the problem, we propose to duplicate the first SYN packet
    and send the duplicating ones via multiple interfaces.</p>"
