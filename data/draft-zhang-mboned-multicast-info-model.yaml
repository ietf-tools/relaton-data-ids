abstract:
- content: "<p>This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast
    model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full advantages of existed
    multicast protocol models to control the multicast network, and guides the deployment
    of multicast service. And also, there will define several possible RPCs about
    how to interact between multicast info model and multicast protocol models. This
    multicast information model is mainly used by the management tools run by the
    network operators in order to manage, monitor and debug the network resources
    used to deliver multicast service, as well as gathering some data from the network.</p>"
