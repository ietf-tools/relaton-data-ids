abstract:
- content: "<p>A load balancer that does not terminate TLS may wish to provide some
    information to the backend server, in addition to forwarding TLS data. This draft
    proposes a protocol between load balancers and backends that enables secure, efficient
    delivery of TLS with additional information. The need for such a protocol has
    recently become apparent in the context of split mode ESNI.</p>"
