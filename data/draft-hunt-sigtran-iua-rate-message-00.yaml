abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new message, its associated acknowledgement
    message, and a new parameter to extend the ISDN Q.921-User Adaptation (IUA) protocol
    (RFC4233). The protocol extension is to support the use of an Overload Control
    Agent in a Signaling Gateway (SG). The Overload Control Agent is able to restrict
    the admission of new originating ISDN calls (sessions) messages from the ISDN
    End Point to each Application Server Process (ASP). Both messages defined here
    contain a single mandatory parameter, the Call (Session) Admission Rate. An ASP
    is able to use this protocol extension to control the rate of new calls admitted
    towards that ASP by the Overload Control Agent. The new message and its acknowledgement
    message are added to the Application Server Process Traffic Maintenance (ASPTM)
    message class. As the DPNSS1/DASS2 Extension to IUA (DUA, RFC4129) also uses the
    ASPTM message class, the IUA protocol extension described in this document also
    applies to DUA. For backward compatibility, a Signaling Gateway which does not
    support the new message is expected to follow standard IUA behaviour by discarding
    the message, and returning an error code of "Unsupported Message Type" to the
    sender.</p>
