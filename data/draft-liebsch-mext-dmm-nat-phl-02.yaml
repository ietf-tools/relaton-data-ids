abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to enable
    offloading some traffic from their core network. In scope of a solution for Distributed
    Mobility Management is the maintenance of IP sessions and IP address continuity
    when mobile nodes get a new mobility anchor assigned during handover. This document
    proposes the use of identifier-locator split concepts to achieve optimal routing
    of data packets to a mobile node's current mobility anchor. The use of per-host
    locator IP addresses allows translation of addresses within the mobile operator
    network to route packets to the mobile node's current mobility anchor, while address
    translation is kept transparent to the communication endpoints.</p>"
