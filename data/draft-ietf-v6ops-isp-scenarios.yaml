abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes practices and plans that are emerging among
    Internet Service Providers for the deployment of IPv6 services. They are based
    on practical experience so far, as well as current plans and requirements, reported
    in a survey of a number of ISPs carried out in early 2010. This document identifies
    a number of technology gaps, but it does not make recommendations. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
