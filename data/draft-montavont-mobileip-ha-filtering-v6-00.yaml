abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 allows a MN to receive incoming packets to its home address
    while it is away from its home network. In a heterogeneous environment, a MN may
    have multiple interfaces, each with different characteristics. While a MN is in
    a visited network, due to the performance of the interfaces or to the user preferences,
    the MN may want to forbid the redirection from its home agent of a kind of flow,
    or to indicate a target CoA for a kind of flow. In this draft, we propose new
    mobility options that allow a MN to advertise filters to its home agent. A filter
    is associated with a CoA, in such a way that the MN can register several CoA and
    can register several filters for one CoA. A filter may indicate that a flow which
    maps to a filter must be dropped or must be redirected to the indicated CoA.</p>"
