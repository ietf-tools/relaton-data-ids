abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Working Group Chairs
    and Routing Area Director chartered a design team to take forward the encapsulation
    discussion and see if there was potential to design a common encapsulation that
    addresses the various technical concerns. This document provides a record, for
    the benefit of the IETF community, of the considerations arrived at by the NVO3
    encapsulation design team, which may be helpful with future deliberations by working
    groups over the choice of encapsulation formats. There are implications of having
    different encapsulations in real environments consisting of both software and
    hardware implementations and within and spanning multiple data centers. For example,
    OAM functions such as path MTU discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations
    along the data path. The design team recommended Geneve with a few modifications
    as the common encapsulation. This document provides more details, particularly
    in Section 7.</p>"
