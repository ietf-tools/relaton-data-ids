abstract:
- content: "<p>Much discussion has resulted over the last few years regarding L2 triggers
    in wired and wireless scenarios. Recent wireless goals have been to collect requirements
    from various IETF related working groups for L2 triggers in wireless environments.
    For example, the Mobile IP and SeaMoby working groups require such L2 information
    to optimize handoff. It was the hope that the output of such an effort would be
    used to design an API or protocol if desired. A requirements draft [REQ] discusses
    requirements from the following FMIPv6, low latency MIPv4, and SeaMoby context
    transfer work. Discussion over the last several months in the PILC working group
    raises concerns about a generic L2 trigger framework independent if the it is
    for wired-line or wireless application. The goal of this document is to provide
    a clear problem statement of L2 triggers. Discussion has also been documented
    in this problem statement regarding special needs of the wireless application.
    For example, the method for communicating L2 information to L3 may be better suited
    for the wire-lined case (e.g., MIB) but not for the wireless scenario. Finally,
    recommendations on where to go with the L2 trigger area in IETF has been provided.
    This draft is preliminary.</p>"
