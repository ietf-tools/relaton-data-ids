abstract:
- content: "<p>Mailing-lists distribute email to multiple recipients by forwarding
    and potentially modifying messages to document the distribution to the recipients.
    Unfortunately forwarding breaks SPF (RFC7208) authentication and message modification
    breaks DKIM (RFC6376) authentication. This document is based on draft-chuang-replay-
    resistant-arc which is built on ARC (RFC8617) with extensions to tolerate common
    mailing-list message modifications. This specification characterizes the mailing-list
    transforms such that a receiver can reverse them to enable digital signatures
    verification and attribution of the message content. These message modifications
    are: 1) prepending a description string to the Subject header, 2) rewriting the
    From header, 3) removing the original DKIM-Signature and 4) appending a footer
    to the message body.</p>"
