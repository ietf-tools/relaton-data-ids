abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocol
    that allows applications to discover the presence and types of Network Address
    Translators (NATs) and firewalls between them and the public Internet. It also
    provides the ability for applications to determine the public IP addresses allocated
    to them by the nat. STUN works with nearly all existing NATs, and does not require
    any special behavior from them. As a result, it allows a wide variety of applications
    to work through existing NAT infrastructure. The STUN protocol is very simple,
    being almost identical to echo.</p>"
