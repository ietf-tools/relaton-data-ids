abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a context transfer proposal that allows completion
    of context transfer outside timing critical message sequence for handover. The
    context transfer process is initiated at a moment of MN’s choice (in regard to
    layer 2 and 3 handover and MN’s traffic) and is completed without a disruption
    in the flow of MN’s real time traffic. This proposal is in line with the current
    fast handover framework within Mobile IP WG [3]. Although this document provides
    a specific recommendation, the framework proposed here, along with multiple alternatives
    that are mentioned, provides a great amount of flexibility in detailed design
    of context transfer. A minimum reliability mechanism for ensuring quality of transferred
    context is added to provide context updates that cannot be achieved by any transport
    protocol.</p>"
