abstract:
- content: "<p>As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new
    interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on intent rather
    than detailed specifics. An intent-based protocol language is need to enable customers
    to easily describe their diverse intent for network connectivity to the network
    management systems. This document describes the problem Intent-Based NEtwork Modeling
    (IB-Nemo) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use cases that demonstrate
    this problem, and a proposed scope of work. Part of the scope is the validation
    of the language as a minimal subset. The IB-NEMO language is a protocol language
    for interactions between an application and a network manager/controller. Some
    would call this boundary between the application and the network management system
    as northbound interface (NBI), and any protocol language that crosses this as
    an NBI. IB-Nemo focuses on creating minimal subset of the total possible Intent-Based
    desired commands. By creating a minimal subset (about 20% of the total possible),
    the IB-Nemo language can be a simple Intent interface for most applications (hopefully
    80%). Part of validation of this language is to to determine what data models
    should result in the network controller from different use cases. This way as
    IB-Nemo protocol language is reduced the effort can verify that the critical information
    is stilled passed.</p>"
