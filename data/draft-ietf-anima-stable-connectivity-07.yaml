abstract:
- content: "<p>OAM (Operations, Administration and Maintenance - as per BCP161, (RFC6291)
    processes for data networks are often subject to the problem of circular dependencies
    when relying on connectivity provided by the network to be managed for the OAM
    purposes. Provisioning while bringing up devices and networks tends to be more
    difficult to automate than service provisioning later on, changes in core network
    functions impacting reachability cannot be automated because of ongoing connectivity
    requirements for the OAM equipment itself, and widely used OAM protocols are not
    secure enough to be carried across the network without security concerns. This
    document describes how to integrate OAM processes with the autonomic control plane
    (ACP) in Autonomic Networks (AN) in order to provide stable and secure connectivity
    for those OAM processes. This connectivity is not subject to aforementioned circular
    dependencies.</p>"
