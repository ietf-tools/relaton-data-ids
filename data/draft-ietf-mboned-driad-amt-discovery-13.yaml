abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC 7450, "Automatic Multicast Tunneling" (or
    AMT), by modifying the relay discovery process. A new DNS resource record named
    AMTRELAY is defined for publishing AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels.
    The reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use
    AMTRELAY resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and
    forward multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel. Other extensions
    and clarifications to the relay discovery process are also defined.</p>
