abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a new version of the Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) protocol, version 1.4. It is designed to address key challenges that have
    emerged since the standardization of TLS 1.3, specifically related to the mobility
    of devices, the need for enhanced 0-RTT security, the integration of post-quantum
    cryptography, and the refinement of downgrade protection mechanisms. TLS 1.4 introduces
    a fundamental architectural shift by decoupling the cryptographic session state
    from the underlying transport-layer connection. This is achieved through a new,
    transport-agnostic Connection ID (CID). The protocol also provides a new, cryptographically-enforced
    replay defense for 0-RTT handshakes based on an atomic "read-compare-write" operation
    on a single-use Session Nonce. A native hybrid post-quantum key exchange framework
    is integrated into the handshake, offering a robust "safety net" against future
    cryptanalytic threats. This specification formally obsoletes TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446)
    and all its related mechanisms. This document updates RFCs 5705, 6066, 7627, and
    8422 and obsoletes RFCs 5077, 5246, 6961, 8422, and 8446. This document also specifies
    new requirements for TLS 1.2 implementations.</p>
