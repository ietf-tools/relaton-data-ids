abstract:
- content: <p>The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that each user's device
    is configured with the user's identities that they wish to use in ABFAB transactions.
    This will require something on that device, either built into the operating system
    or a standalone utility, that will manage the user's identities and identity to
    service mappings. Anyone designing that "something" will face the same set of
    challenges. This document aims to document these challenges with the aim of producing
    well-thought out UIs with some degree of consistency.</p>
