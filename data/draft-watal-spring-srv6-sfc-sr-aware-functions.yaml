abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture of Segment Routing over IPv6
    (SRv6) Service Function Chaining (SFC) with SR-aware functions. This architecture
    provides the following benefits: * Comprehensive management: a centralized controller
    for SFC, handling SR Policy, link-state, and network metrics. * Simplicity: no
    SFC proxies, so that reduces nodes and address resource consumption. Discussion
    Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Discussion of this
    document takes place on the Source Packet Routing in Networking Working Group
    mailing list (spring@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/spring/.
