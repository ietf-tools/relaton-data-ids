abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) today is defined by RFC
    8610, RFC 9165, RFC 9682, and RFC\ 9741). RFC 9165 and the latter (as well as
    some more application specific specifications such as RFC 9090) have used the
    extension point provided in RFC 8610, the control operator. As CDDL is used in
    larger projects, feature requirements become known that cannot be easily mapped
    into this single extension point. Hence, there is a need for evolution of the
    base CDDL specification itself. The present document provides a roadmap towards
    a "CDDL 2.0"; it is intended to serve as a basis for implementations that evolve
    with the concept of CDDL 2.0. It is based on draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-freezer,
    but is more selective in what potential features it takes up and more detailed
    in their discussion. This document is intended to evolve over time; it might spawn
    specific documents and then retire, or it might eventually be published as a roadmap
    document.</p>
