abstract:
- content: <p>An analysis of security threats has been done for some parts of the
    multicast infrastructure, but the threats specific to the last-hop ("Local Area
    Network") attacks by hosts on the PIM routing protocol have not been well described
    in the past. This memo aims to fill that gap.</p>
