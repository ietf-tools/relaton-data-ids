abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a very simple strawman protocol for agents to request NAT address
    translations and firewall pinholes from a middlebox. This protocol uses the underlying
    transport for reliability and to avoid reinventing TCP. This protocol does not
    use an existing protocol like COPS, SOAP, HTTP or DIAMETER as these protocols
    include significant complexity that is not required to solve the middlebox problem.</p>"
