abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new report block type within the framework
    of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR). One of the initial XR report
    block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block. This report conveys
    the information regarding the individual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet
    receipt and loss events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the transmission
    of the report. The new report, which is referred to as the Post-repair Loss RLE
    Report, carries the information regarding the remaining lost packets after all
    error-repair techniques are applied. By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses
    before and after the error repair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness
    of the error-repair techniques in an aggregated fashion. This document also defines
    the signaling of the Post-repair Loss RLE Report in the Session Description Protocol
    (SDP).</p>"
