abstract:
- content: "<p>Communication technology is becoming more and more developed, the Internet
    of Things coverage is becoming more and more comprehensive, and a large number
    of data and devices are joining, which also makes more data security and privacy
    issues appear. Therefore, this draft proposes a scheme to build an information-centered
    network. By analyzing common network attack methods, an intelligent protection
    optimization system is established from three aspects: naming and parsing, data
    exchange, and data caching, so as to achieve better content privacy protection
    without adding additional costs.</p>"
