abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard
    Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.
    The security needs are well-recognized and and many standardization steps for
    providing security have been taken, for example, the specification of Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). However,
    the design space of IoT applications and systems is complex and exposed to multiple
    types of threats. In particular, threats keep evolving at a fast pace while many
    IoT systems are rarely updated and still remain operational for decades. This
    document has three main parts: First, it summarizes exemplary security threats
    and suitable mitigation strategies to protect against multiple types of threats.
    Second, it describes a comprehensive agile security framework to integrate existing
    security processes such as risk asssement or vulnerability assessment in the lifecycle
    of a smart object in an IoT application. Thus, instead of having a security configuration
    that is fixed at manufacturing time, our approach allows us to apply a - security
    profile - on the device tailored for a specific environment at any point of time.
    Third, we discuss the concept of security profiles and give examples of them.
    The core of our agile security approach relies on two protocols: the Protocol
    for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) and the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability
    Assessment (PAVA). PACS is executed during the onboarding phase of a smart object
    in an IoT system and is in charge of automatically performing a risk assessment
    and assigning a security profile to defeat the identified risks. The assigned
    security profile fits the specific environment and threat model of the application
    in which the device has been deployed. PAVA is executed during the operation of
    the IoT object and ensures that vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system
    are discovered in a proactive way. These two protocols can benefit users, manufactures
    and operators by automating IoT security. We describe a few examplary security
    profiles that could be applicable in different application areas and automatically
    configured by means of PASC and PAVA.</p>"
