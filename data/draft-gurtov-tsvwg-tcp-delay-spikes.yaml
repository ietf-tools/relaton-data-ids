abstract:
- content: "<p>We suggest a more conservative management of TCP's retransmit timer
    and a more careful response of the TCP sender on duplicate ACKs. The former reduces
    the risk of triggering spurious timeouts, while the latter eliminates potentially
    unnecessary retransmits. Although, we believe that these suggestions are permitted
    (although not explicitly) by RFC2581 and RFC2988, they do not seem to be widely
    known nor deployed in existing TCP implementations. We therefore want to make
    implementers aware of these choices.</p>"
