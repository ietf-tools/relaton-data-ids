abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a critical component in the Internet
    to exchange routing information between network domains. Due to this central nature,
    it is important to understand the security and reliability requirements that can
    and should be ensured to prevent accidental or intentional routing disturbances.
    Previously, security considerations for BGP have been described in RFC7454 / BCP194.
    Since the publications of RFC7454 / BCP194, several developments and changes in
    operational practice took place that warrant an update of these best current practices.
    This document replaces RFC7454 / BCP194, focusing on the overall goals, and providing
    a less implementation centric set of best practices. To this end, the document
    describes the security requirements and goals when operating BGP for exchanging
    routing information with other networks. The document explicitly does not focus
    on specific technical implementations and requirements. Operators are advised
    to consult documentation and contemporary informational documents concerning methods
    to ensure that these properties are sufficiently ensured in their network.</p>"
