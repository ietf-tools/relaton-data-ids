abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the Border Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP),
    a protocol for inter-domain multicast routing. BGMP builds shared trees for active
    multicast groups, and optionally allows receiver domains to build source-specific,
    inter-domain, distribution branches where needed. BGMP natively supports "source-specific
    multicast" (SSM). To also support "any-source multicast" (ASM), BGMP requires
    that each multicast group be associated with a single root (in BGMP it is referred
    to as the root domain). It requires that different ranges of the multicast address
    space are associated (e.g., with Unicast-Prefix-Based Multicast addressing) with
    different domains. Each of these domains then becomes the root of the shared domain-trees
    for all groups in its range. Multicast participants will generally receive better
    multicast service if the session initiator's address allocator selects addresses
    from its own domain's part of the space, thereby causing the root domain to be
    local to at least one of the session participants. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
