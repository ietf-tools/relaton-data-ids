abstract:
- content: "<p>Collecting Resource availability information in Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) devices in real time helps in better managebility of resources
    in the SIP network. Resource availability monitoring in SIP devices helps administrator
    to take informed decision and corrective measures to tackle under or over resource
    utilization in the network. Resource availability information can also be used
    for SIP overload control in SIP based Media servers by passing resource demand
    vector between devices. This document defines resource availability XML document
    and the mechanisms that can be used to exchange the document between SIP entities.</p>"
