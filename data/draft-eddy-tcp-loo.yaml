abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for increasing the space available
    for TCP options. Two new TCP options (LO and SLO) are detailed which reduce the
    limitations imposed by the TCP header's Data Offset field. The LO option provides
    this extension after connection establishment, and the SLO option aids in transmission
    of lengthy connection initialization and configuration options.</p>"
