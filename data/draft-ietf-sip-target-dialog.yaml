abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the Target-Dialog header field for the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP), and the corresponding option tag, tdialog. This header
    field is used in requests that create SIP dialogs. It indicates to the recipient
    that the sender is aware of an existing dialog with the recipient, either because
    the sender is on the other side of that dialog, or because it has access to the
    dialog identifiers. The recipient can then authorize the request based on this
    awareness. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
