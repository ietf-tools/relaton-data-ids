abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Source Origin Authorization (SOA), a new object
    in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), designed to extend RPKI's capabilities
    to securing the data plane. An SOA object is a digitally signed artifact that
    records information about the possible last-hop ASes traversed by packets before
    reaching a specific AS. By providing this information, the SOA enables other ASes
    to collaboratively filter traffic with spoofed source addresses claiming to originate
    from the IP space of the target AS, thereby enhancing global Internet security
    through mitigation of source address spoofing and DDoS attacks.</p>"
