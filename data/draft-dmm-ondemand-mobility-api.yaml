abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications differ with respect to whether they need IP session continuity
    and/or IP address reachability. The network providing the same type of service
    to any mobile host and any application running on the host yields inefficiencies.
    This document describes a solution for taking the application needs into account
    in selectively providing IP session continuity and IP address reachability on
    a per- socket basis.</p>"
