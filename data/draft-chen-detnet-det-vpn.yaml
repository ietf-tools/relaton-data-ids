abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) services are expected to be integrated
    with VPN technologies. Such deployment scenarios include mobile backhauls and
    TSN islands inter-connections. This document describes an overall VPN framework
    that provides deterministic transport services (called deterministic VPN), specifies
    corresponding control and data plane protocols that are required to support the
    framework, and initially summarizes potential extensions of existing protocols
    to enable deterministic VPNs.</p>"
