abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round-trip times
    to the closest DNS root server; those resolvers may have difficulty getting responses
    from the root servers, such as during a network attack. Some DNS recursive resolver
    operators want to prevent snooping by third parties of requests sent to DNS root
    servers. In both cases, resolvers can greatly decrease the round-trip time and
    prevent observation of requests by serving a copy of the full root zone on the
    same server, such as on a loopback address or in the resolver software. This document
    shows how to start and maintain such a copy of the root zone that does not cause
    problems for other users of the DNS, at the cost of adding some operational fragility
    for the operator. This document obsoletes RFC 7706.</p>"
