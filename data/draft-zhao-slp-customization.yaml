abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two extensions (Select and Sort) for the Service
    Location Protocol (SLP). These extensions allow a User Agent (UA) to request that
    the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) entries in a Service Reply (SrvRply) be limited
    to the specified number, or be sorted according to the specified sort key list.
    Using these two extensions together can facilitate discovering the best match,
    such as finding a service that has the maximum speed or the minimum load. This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
