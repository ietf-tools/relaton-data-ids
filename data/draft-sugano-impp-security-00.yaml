abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the current results of the author's investigations
    into decisions required for security issues in IMPP protocol design. We discuss
    possible options for methods of authentication and encryption appropriate to IMPP
    requirements. In particular, we propose our design decisions for message integrity
    checking, user authentication, time stamping, and message confidentiality. Moreover,
    we consider some ACL and firewall issues. This memo attempts to complement the
    IMPP design basis [Basis] by providing a discussion of privacy and security.</p>"
