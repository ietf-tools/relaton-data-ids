abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of TCP options to support the migration
    of an active TCP connection across IP addresses and TCP port numbers. Using this
    option, a TCP peer can open a migrateable connection, transfer one or more bytes
    on it, and continue the connection from another IP address/TCP port pair in an
    application-transparent fashion. The set of addresses or ports from where a connection
    might be continued need not be known in advance. Security against connection hijacking
    is achieved using a secret cryptographic cookie negotiated through an Elliptic
    Curve Diffie-Hellman [ANSI-X962] exchange during connection establishment. The
    initiation of migration can be done either by one of the communicating peers,
    or by a trusted third-party that presents the negotiated cryptographic cookie.</p>"
