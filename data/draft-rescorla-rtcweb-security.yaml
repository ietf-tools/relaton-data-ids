abstract:
- content: <p>The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTC-Web) working group is tasked
    with standardizing protocols for real-time communications between Web browsers.
    The major use cases for RTC-Web technology are real-time audio and/or video calls,
    Web conferencing, and direct data transfer. Unlike most conventional real-time
    systems (e.g., SIP- based soft phones) RTC-Web communications are directly controlled
    by some Web server, which poses new security challenges. For instance, a Web browser
    might expose a JavaScript API which allows a server to place a video call. Unrestricted
    access to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to "bug" a user's
    computer, capturing any activity which passed in front of their camera. This document
    defines the RTC-Web threat model and defines an architecture which provides security
    within that threat model.</p>
