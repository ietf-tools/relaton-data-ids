abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the raionale and requirements for in-band signalling
    of Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics for the Internet Protocol (IP) There
    has been extensive work on QoS for IP, leading to the development of RSVP, NSIS
    and other protocols. New requirements emerging from the use of IP to carry services
    such as video and voice are leading in turn to additional requirements for QoS
    signalling. The authors believe that these can best be met by adding in-band signalling
    to IP, complementing the existing protocols for QoS signalling.</p>"
