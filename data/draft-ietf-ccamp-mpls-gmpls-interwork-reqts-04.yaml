abstract:
- content: "<p>Operation of a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering
    (TE) network as a client network to a Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) network has enhanced
    operational capabilities compared to those provided by a coexistent protocol model
    (i.e., operation of MPLS-TE over an independently managed transport layer). The
    GMPLS network may be a packet or a non-packet network, and may itself be a multi-layer
    network supporting both packet and non-packet technologies. An MPLS-TE Label Switched
    Path (LSP) originates and terminates on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR).
    The GMPLS network provides transparent transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP.
    This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements for operating
    MPLS-TE networks over GMPLS networks. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
