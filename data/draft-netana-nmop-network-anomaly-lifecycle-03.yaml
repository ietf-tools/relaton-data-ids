abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the network.
    Accurately detect problems is very challenging for network operators in production
    networks. Good results require a lot of expertise and knowledge around both the
    implied network technologies and the specific service provided to consumers, apart
    from a proper monitoring infrastructure. In order to facilitate network anomaly
    detection, novel techniques are being introduced, including programmatical, rule-based
    and AI-based, with the promise of improving scalability and the hope to keep a
    high detection accuracy. To guarantee acceptable results, the process needs to
    be properly designed, adopting well-defined stages to accurately collect evidence
    of anomalies, validate their relevancy and improve the detection systems over
    time, iteratively. This document describes the lifecycle process to iteratively
    improve network anomaly detection accurately. Three key stages are proposed, along
    with a YANG model specifying the required metadata for the network anomaly detection
    covering the exchange of information between different stages of the lifecycle.</p>"
