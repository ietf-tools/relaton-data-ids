abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related
    to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability. The complexity
    raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in classical
    IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies,
    GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi- layered network
    of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies. In
    GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple
    switching types is referenced in this document as a multi-region network (MRN).
    When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either a
    single or multiple regions, this document uses the term, Multi-layer Network (MLN).
    This draft defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region/multi-layer networks
    and lists a set of functional requirements.</p>"
