abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can
    carry anydata payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision
    new service with any expense.The benefit of this technology is core router need
    not understand the full customer route. If the service a layer 2 then thereis
    no need of vrf, for customer the service provider cloud is like a virtual switch.The
    protocol used for label distribution is LDP, BGP,RSVP. The most popular protocol
    for outer label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit of adding more TLV to
    its payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for generating labels for mac
    address rather for ip address which gives the benefit to service provider not
    to run complex routing protocol on core, this does not require ip address. This
    gives service provider the flexibility to deploy any services, there is no need
    for changes in network layer when the customer goes for ipv4 to ipv6. This can
    reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the customer and reduces the hardware cost too.</p>"
