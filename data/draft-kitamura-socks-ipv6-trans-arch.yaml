abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an IPv6/IPv4 Translator architecture that is
    based on the SOCKSv5 [RFC1928] mechanism. In this architecture, the SOCKS mechanism
    is extended by adding adaptive address family distinguish functions for supporting
    heterogeneous communications. By applying the mechanism together with protocol
    conversion functions, the IPv6/IPv4 Translator architecture is accomplished. This
    Translator provides communications between IPv6 and IPv4 nodes without sacrificing
    any convenience and functionalities of current communication methods. It is NOT
    necessary to modify the current DNS system at all. Only socksify environment is
    needed to communicate between IPv6 and IPv4 nodes. By using multiple chained Translators,
    a tunneling-like communication topology can be realized. With the architecture,
    there is no vulnerability of the packet fragmentation, and the connection can
    be authenticated by the native SOCKS authentication methods.</p>"
