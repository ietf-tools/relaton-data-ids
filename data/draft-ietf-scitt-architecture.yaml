abstract:
- content: "<p>Traceability of physical and digital Artifacts in supply chains is
    a long-standing, but increasingly serious security concern. The rise in popularity
    of verifiable data structures as a mechanism to make actors more accountable for
    breaching their compliance promises has found some successful applications to
    specific use cases (such as the supply chain for digital certificates), but lacks
    a generic and scalable architecture that can address a wider range of use cases.
    This document defines a generic, interoperable and scalable architecture to enable
    transparency across any supply chain with minimum adoption barriers. It provides
    flexibility, enabling interoperability across different implementations of Transparency
    Services with various auditing and compliance requirements. Issuers can register
    their Signed Statements on any Transparency Service, with the guarantee that all
    Consumers will be able to verify them. Within the SCITT Architecture, a producer
    is known as an Issuer, and a consumer is known as a Verifier.</p>"
