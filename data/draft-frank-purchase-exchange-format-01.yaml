abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the purchase exchange format (PEF), which consists
    of signed purchase records, to enable sharing, verification, and transfer of information
    about license ownership. This enables sharing of subscriptions, rentals, and one-time-purchases
    across platforms as well as deleting or switching accounts of (media) service
    providers without loosing or double-purchasing products. It can also be applied
    to non-media items and physical objects like family-shared rentals of tools or
    proof of purchase for guarantee claims.</p>"
