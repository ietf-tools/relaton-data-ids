abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the process of directing packets
    through a network so that they can be acted on by an ordered set of abstract service
    functions before being delivered to the intended destination. An architecture
    for SFC is defined in RFC7665. The Network Service Header (NSH) can be inserted
    into packets to steer them along a specific path to realize a Service Function
    Chain. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a widely deployed forwarding technology
    that uses labels to identify the forwarding actions to be taken at each hop through
    a network. Segment Routing is a mechanism that provides a source routing paradigm
    for steering packets in an MPLS network. This document describes how Service Function
    Chaining can be achieved in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation
    of the NSH in an MPLS label stack.</p>"
