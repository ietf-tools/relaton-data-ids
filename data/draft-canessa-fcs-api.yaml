abstract:
- content: "<p>During the past twelve months there has been interest in Fixed Content
    Storage servers. Vendors have been introducing offerings that use proprietary
    API calls. This is causing delay in acceptance. By using a set of standard API
    calls software developers, vendors and end-users would benefit. This document
    provides background on the need for an API. It defines a simple and reduced yet
    robust set of Application Programming Interface (API) calls to be supported by
    implementations of FCS servers. Store, query and retrieve operations are described
    in detail. The concept, description and format of a Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
    are provided. A GUID serves as a unique handle to each object stored by a FCS
    server. The list of the set of API calls is defined. A basic set of data structures
    and support functions is presented.</p>"
