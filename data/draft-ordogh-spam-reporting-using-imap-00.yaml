abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] does not support reporting
    spam on its own. There are a number of solutions available based on the multipart/report
    content type defined in [REPORT]. However, these solutions require including the
    message contents and hence, consume bandwidth to transmit the entire message.
    In bandwidth-constrained environments - such as mobile networks - it is highly
    desirable to send only a minimum set of information - a reference - instead of
    the entire message. Furthermore, it is desirable to permit individual server implementations
    to handle spam in any way these systems choose to: do nothing, flag, recommend
    deletion or relocation, perform deletion or relocation, and, involve any choice
    of spam aggregator services in the decision process, such as [OMA-SPAMREP]. Solutions
    that exist today employ manipulating proprietary flags in the IMAP storage to
    achieve the bare minimum, however more advanced solutions cannot be developed
    by using flags only; the IMAP server needs to be involved actively in the spam
    reporting process. This document specifies the syntax of the SREP command, which
    allows a client to inform the server that the user considered a message (or parts
    thereof) spam, or, that the user no longer considers a message (or parts thereof)
    spam. Since all information about the message is readily available on the server,
    the command also allows the server to implement a more intelligent and accurate
    decision logic, which may be invoked when the spam is reported and the server
    can respond with its decision to the client. Additionally, this document contains
    example flows, illustrating various decisions that the server may choose to evaluate,
    including invoking a service based on [OMA-SPAMREP]. This document focuses only
    on the client-server interactions and the scope is limited to messages that either
    exist on the IMAP server, or, exist elsewhere and the IMAP server is configured
    to access them. Consequently, deposit-time filtering, messages that have been
    deleted, or, exist in an external storage but are accessible via an access protocol
    unknown to the IMAP server are out of scope.</p>"
