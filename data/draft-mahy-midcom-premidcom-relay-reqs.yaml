abstract:
- content: "<p>STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP for NATS) specifies a mechanism which
    enables nodes in a private network to determine if they are behind a NAT, to discover
    their remapped address and port, and for many types of NATs to send UDP traffic
    through them. In addition TCP connections initiated from the private side of NATs
    already works. This document specifies requirements for a mechanism that enables
    traversal of expected TCP traffic through all NATs, and traversal of UDP traffic
    through symmetric NATs.</p>"
