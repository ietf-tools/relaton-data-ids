abstract:
- content: <p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a RESTful application
    protocol for constrained nodes and networks. The state of a resource on a CoAP
    server can change over time. This document specifies a simple protocol extension
    for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve a
    representation of a resource and keep this representation updated by the server
    over a period of time. The protocol follows a best-effort approach for sending
    new representations to clients and provides eventual consistency between the state
    observed by each client and the actual resource state at the server.</p>
