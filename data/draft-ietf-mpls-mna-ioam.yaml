abstract:
- content: "<p>In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM), defined
    in RFC 9197, is an on-path telemetry method to collect and record the operational
    state and telemetry information using, for example, Pre- allocated, Proof-of-Transit,
    Edge-To-Edge or Incremental IOAM Option, that can be used to calculate various
    performance metrics. RFC 9326 defined the IOAM Direct Export (IOAM-DEX) Option
    in which the operational state and telemetry information are collected according
    to the specified profile and exported in a manner and format defined by a local
    policy on each node along the path. MPLS Network Actions (MNA) techniques are
    meant to indicate actions to be performed on any combination of Label Switched
    Paths, MPLS packets, and the node itself, and to transfer data needed for these
    actions. This document explores the MNA mechanisms to collect and transport the
    on-path operational state, and telemetry information IOAM data fields, including
    IOAM-DEX Option.</p>"
