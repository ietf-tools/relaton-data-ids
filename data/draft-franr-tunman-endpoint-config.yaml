- content: "<p>This draft specifies the configuration information that will be used
    to define, establish,activate, and maintain tunnel facilities. As IP- based services,
    such as VPNs, grow in popularity, tunnel configuration and management becomes
    ever more important since these services and mechanisms proposed for their deployment
    are based on tunnels and tunneling protocols.</p>"
