abstract:
- content: "<p>AAA servers are in use within the Internet today to provide authentication
    and authorization services for dial-up computers. Such services are likely to
    be equally valuable for mobile nodes using Mobile IP when the nodes are attempting
    to connect to foreign domains with AAA servers. AAA servers today identify clients
    by using the Network Access Identifier (NAI). Our proposal defines a way for the
    mobile node to identify itself, by including the NAI along with the Mobile IP
    Registration Request. This memo also updates RFC 2290 which specifies the Mobile-IPv4
    Configuration option for IPCP, by allowing the Mobile Node's Home Address field
    of this option to be zero and specifying a comprehensive procedure for achieving
    a NAI-based home address assignment and more particularly, the Home Agent and
    Mobile Node behaviors including the error recovery mechanisms for various scenarios
    related to NAI-based home address assignment.</p>"
