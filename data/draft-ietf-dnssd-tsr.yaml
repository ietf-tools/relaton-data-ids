abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new conflict resolution mechanism for DNS,
    for use in cases where the advertisement is being proxied, rather than advertised
    directly, e.g. when using a combined DNS-SD Advertising Proxy and SRP registrar.
    A new EDNS option is defined that communicates the time at which the set of resource
    records on a particular DNS owner name was most recently updated.</p>"
