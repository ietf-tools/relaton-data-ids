abstract:
- content: "<p>With rapid development of next generation networks, it is expected
    that a separate effort to study data modeling languages in the interest of network
    management should be undertaken. Based on a good understanding of the requirements
    of data modeling in next generation network management domain, evaluation on management
    data modeling languages becomes an essential way for the purpose of standardization
    to replace proprietary data models in the near future. Our project aims to establish
    a framework for evaluation to measure the capabilities of management data modeling
    languages in meeting those requirements by a set of criteria, which are modeling
    approaches, interoperability, conformance, extensibility, readability, data representations
    and security considerations.</p>"
