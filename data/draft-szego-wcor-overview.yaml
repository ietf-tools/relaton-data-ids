abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Welcomed Correspondence Extensions is to provide, in the
    simplest and least intrusive way possible (both programmatically and to the user),
    a method of avoiding unsolicited and unwanted email without drastically changing
    the infrastructure of the Internet's existing mail transports. This document describes
    a two-phase evolutionary approach in order to maintain compatibility with existing
    standard POP3/IMAP4 retrieval/delivery servers, SMTP mail transfer agents, and
    end-user mail clients.</p>"
