abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols forming a
    unified, defragmented IoT platform. Such a platform will make objects accessible
    to applications across organizations and domains. Towards this goal, quite a few
    proposals have been made to build a unified host centric IoT platform as an overlay
    on top of today's Internet. Such overlay solutions, however, are inadequate to
    address the important challenges posed by a heterogeneous, global scale deployment
    of IoT, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and communication reliability,
    due to the inherent inefficiencies of the current Internet. To address this problem,
    we propose to build a common set of protocols and services, which form an IoT
    platform, based on the Information Centric Network (ICN) architecture, which we
    call ICN-IoT. ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides
    seamless mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery.
    This draft describes representative IoT requirements and ICN challenges to realize
    a unified ICN-IoT framework. Towards this, we first identify a list of important
    requirements which a unified IoT architecture should have to support tens of billions
    of objects. Though we see most of the IoT requirements can be met by ICN, we discuss
    specific challenges ICN has to address to satisfy them. Then we discuss important
    and popular IoT scenarios including the "smart" home, campus, grid, transportation
    infrastructure, healthcare, Education, and Entertainment.</p>
