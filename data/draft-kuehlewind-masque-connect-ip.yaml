abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a new HTTP method CONNECT-IP to proxy IP traffic.
    CONNECT-IP uses HTTP/3 Datagrams to use QUIC Datagrams for efficient transport
    of proxied IP packets, with the possibility to fallback to HTTP/3 over reliable
    QUIC streams, or even HTTP 1.x and 2. CONNECT-IP supports two modes: a tunneling
    mode where IP packets are forwarded without modifications and flow forwarding
    mode which supports optimization for individual IP flows forwarded to the targeted
    peer. To request tunneling or flow forwarding, a client connects to a proxy server
    by initiating a HTTP/3 connection and sends a CONNECT-IP request which either
    indicates the address of the proxy or the target peer. The proxy then forwards
    payload received on that stream or in an HTTP datagram with a certain stream ID.</p>"
