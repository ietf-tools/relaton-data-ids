abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of Network
    Address Translation and transparent bridging functionality within a CableHome
    compliant residential gateway. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that
    is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects is consistent with
    the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.</p>"
