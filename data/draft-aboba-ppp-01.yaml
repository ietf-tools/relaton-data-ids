abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the ''PPP Authentication Operation'' for LDAP.
    This operation provides for PPP authentication in an LDAP association and is defined
    in terms of an LDAP extended operation. It is expected that this extended operation
    will be useful in inte- grating authentication protocols such as RADIUS and TACACS+
    with LDAP- based directory services. Consolidation of information stores is desirable
    since it results in lessened administrative workload and a consistent view of
    user information throughout the enterprise.</p>"
