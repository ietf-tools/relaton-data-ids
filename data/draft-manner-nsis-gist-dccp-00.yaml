abstract:
- content: "<p>The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol specification
    supports two transport modes: UDP for very infrequent messaging, and TCP for all
    other cases. However, with TCP comes certain undesirable features, e.g., head
    of line blocking, which affect performance when a number of sessions are multiplexed
    over the same TCP connection. In certain environments and deployment scenarios,
    an unreliable, but still congestion controlled, transport would be needed. This
    specification proposes DCCP as a transport protocol for GIST.</p>"
