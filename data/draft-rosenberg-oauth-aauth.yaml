abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Agent Authorization Grant, an OAuth 2.1 extension
    allowing a class of Internet applications - called AI Agents - to obtain access
    tokens in order to invoke web-based APIs on behalf of their users. In the use
    cases envisaged here, users interact with AI Agents through communication channels
    - the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or texting - which do not permit
    traditional OAuth grant flows. Instead, AI agents collect Personally Identifying
    Information (PII) through natural language conversation, and then use that collected
    information to obtain an access token with appropriately constrained scopes. A
    primary considering is ensuring that the Large Language Model (LLM) powering the
    AI Agent cannot, through hallucination, result in impersonation attacks.</p>"
