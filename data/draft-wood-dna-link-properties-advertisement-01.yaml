abstract:
- content: "<p>Routers are increasingly connected to a variety of smart modems. Such
    a modem's incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied over time with adaptive
    coding and modulation to suit the channel characteristics. The link rate and conditions
    offered by the modem to connected devices therefore vary. For connected devices
    to condition traffic and get the most out of the modem's link capacity, they need
    to know the modem's link conditions. This document describes one simple method
    for the modem to advertise link rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages,
    and discusses alternative approaches to communicating this information.</p>"
