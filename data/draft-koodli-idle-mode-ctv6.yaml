abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the problem of expediting authenticated network
    access as well as enabling authorized context transfer during idle-mode handovers.
    In essence, this document addresses idle-mode context transfers, so that an idle-mode
    Mobile Node (MN) can resume its sessions in a seamless fashion. We propose supplying
    the session key in the paging message to the Access Router (AR) that locates the
    idle Mobile Node.</p>"
