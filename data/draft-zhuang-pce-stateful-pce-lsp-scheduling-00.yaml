abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a set of extensions needed to the stateful Path
    Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP), so as to enable Labeled
    Switched Path (LSP) scheduling for path computation and LSP setup/deletion based
    on the actual network resource usage duration of a traffic service in a centralized
    network environment. A scheduled LSP can be setup at the its starting time and
    deleted after its usage duration such that LSPs for the other traffic services
    can take over these network resources beyond that period.</p>"
