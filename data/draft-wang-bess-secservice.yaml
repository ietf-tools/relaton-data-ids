abstract:
- content: "<p>For certain users, security is of paramount importance. Even when building
    their own backbone networks, these users require end-to-end service encryption
    to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their data. In such scenarios,
    IPsec can be used to provide flexible and robust encryption capabilities, while
    SRv6 can be used to guide the forwarding of data packets along different paths
    on the network. By combining these technologies, users can create a highly secure
    and efficient network environment that meets their specific needs and requirements.</p>"
