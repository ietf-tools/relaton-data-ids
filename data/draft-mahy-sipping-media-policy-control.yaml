abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP conferencing framework defines a model for tightly-coupled
    conferencing in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), in which a Conference Policy
    Control Protocol is used to manipulate policies relevant to a specific conference,
    such as conference membership policy, authorization policy, and media policy.
    This document describes a logical model to describe media processing in a SIP
    conference. It also defines specific protocol semantics and a specific syntax
    to manipulate that model.</p>"
