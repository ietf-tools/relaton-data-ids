- content: "<p>This document extends the MSRP connection model to negotiate the direction
    of the TCP connection setup. This provides a partial yet simple solution for scenarios
    whereby either, but not both, party to an MSRP session is located behind a NAT
    or firewall, and cannot serve as the passive endpoint for TCP connection setup.</p>"
