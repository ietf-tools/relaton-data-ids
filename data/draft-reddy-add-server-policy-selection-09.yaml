abstract:
- content: "<p>The document defines a mechanism that is meant to communicate DNS resolver
    information to DNS clients for use as a criteria for server selection decisions.
    Such an information that is cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity
    is used for the selection of DNS resolvers. Typically, evaluating the resolver
    information and the signatory, DNS clients with minimal or no human intervention
    can select the DNS servers for resolving domain names. This assertion is useful
    for encrypted DNS (e.g., DNS-over-TLS, DNS- over-HTTPS, or DNS-over-QUIC) servers
    that are either public resolvers or discovered in a local network.</p>"
