abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on life deployments and three interoperability events, this document
    provides advice to network operators about best practices when implementing IEEE
    802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) networks. It is principally addressed to
    system integrators and solution providers, including those that do not yet support
    SPB. Some advice to implementers is also included. The intention of the advice
    is to facilitate multi vendor network deployments as well as provide guidance
    for new installations.</p>"
