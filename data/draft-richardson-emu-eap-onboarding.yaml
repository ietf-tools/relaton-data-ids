abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method by which an unconfigured device can
    use EAP to join a network on which further device onboarding, network attestation
    or other remediation can be done. While RFC 5216 supports EAP-TLS without a client
    certificate, that document defines no method by which unauthenticated EAP-TLS
    can be used. This draft addresses that issue. First, by defining the @eap.arpa
    domain, and second by showing how it can be used to provide quarantined network
    access for onboarding unauthenticated devices.</p>"
