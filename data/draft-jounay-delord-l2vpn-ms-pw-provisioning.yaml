abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Providers (SPs) have described the requirements to allow them
    to extend the Pseudowires (PWs) across multiple domains via the use of multi-segment
    Pseudowires (MS-PWs). Several tools relating to provisioning, auto-discovery and
    signaling have been developed to allow the dynamic setup of MS-PWs. However there
    is no end to end view that describes how these tools can be used in carrier networks.
    This document aims at providing this view by describing the different stages required
    for an end to end L2VPN service setup relying on MS-PWs. These stages are VPN
    provisioning, auto-discovery (network and service), signaling and monitoring.</p>"
