abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the IPv6 address space within a single /64 subnet is very
    large, the typical distribution of the addresses in this space is very non-uniform.
    This non-uniformity, together with the dictionary- based DNS brute-force enumeration,
    allows practical remote mapping of the IPv6 addresses in these subnets. This document
    proposes a technique which can be used to decrease the exposure of the server
    subnets to trivial scanning. As a side effect, the proposed technique allows to
    drastically simplify the address management.</p>"
