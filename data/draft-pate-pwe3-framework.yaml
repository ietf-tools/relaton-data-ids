abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge
    (PWE3). It discusses the emulation of circuits (such as T1, E1, T3, E3 and SONET/SDH)
    and services (such as ATM and Frame Relay) over packet switched networks (PSNs)
    using IP or MPLS. It presents an architectural framework for pseudo wires (PWs),
    defines terminology, specifies the various protocol elements and their functions,
    overviews some of the services that will be supported and discusses how PWs fit
    into the broader context of protocols.</p>"
