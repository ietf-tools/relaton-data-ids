abstract:
- content: "<p>IP/UDP/RTP header compression [CRTP] can generate a large number of
    lost packets when used over links with significant error rates, especially when
    the round-trip time of the link is large. This document describes a more robust
    header compression scheme. The scheme is adaptable to the characteristics of the
    link over which it is used and also to the properties of the packet streams it
    compresses. Robustness against link-loss is achieved without decreasing compression
    efficiency.</p>"
