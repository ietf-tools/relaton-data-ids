- content: "<p>Several RFCs define all of the standards having to do with the format,
    transfer and management of E-mail and messages. So many are out there that it
    is often difficult to find out where a specific item is. This memo is an attempt
    to give the reader a general overview of the material and to show where to look
    for particular information on mail and messaging standards.</p>"
