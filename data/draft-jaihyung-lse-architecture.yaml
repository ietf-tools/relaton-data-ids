abstract:
- content: "<p>A solution for GMPLS implementation using 48bits of Ethernet multicast
    address as label is proposed. It is claimed that Ethernet bridges supporting IEEE
    802.1D-2004 and IEEE 802.1Q-2003 may implement GMPLS according to this proposal
    without requiring modification to data plane, hence this solution is an appropriate
    candidate solution for GELS (GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching) group. The LSP established
    in this method is intrinsically bi-directional. Ethernet bridges of this implementation
    provide traffic engineered frame delivery path. Any point-to-point LSP can be
    transformed to multi-point LSP, and vice versa. It is interoperable with 802.1D/Q
    bridges. This proposal allows automated setup of VLAN using GMPLS in small scale
    network. IEEE 802.1 controlled spanning tree path may co- exist with GMPLS controlled
    LSP path when VLAN is used for segregating GMPLS flows and normal Ethernet flows.
    Clear advantage of this proposal compared to all-router based backbone network
    is cost- effectiveness that it helps reducing CAPEX/OPEX of operators. With the
    aid of well-established IP technology, it also helps enhancing scalability and
    manageability of bridged backbone network.</p>"
