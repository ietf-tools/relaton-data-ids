abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification requires the Mobile Access Gateway
    (MAG) to send a separate Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the Local Mobility
    Agent (LMA) for each mobile node (MN) to renew the MN's mobility binding. This
    document defines a mechanism by which a MAG can update the mobility bindings of
    multiple MNs attached to it with a single PBU message to the serving LMA. This
    document also specifies a new mobility option that can be used by the mobility
    entities in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain for carrying the group affiliation of a
    mobile node in any of the mobility signaling messages.</p>"
