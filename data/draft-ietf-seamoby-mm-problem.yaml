abstract:
- content: "<p>Seamless mobility requires preserving the capability, security, and
    quality of service offered to a mobile node during handoffs. To achieve seamlessness,
    low (ideally no) latency and low (ideally zero) packet loss handoff protocols
    are needed. Limiting the effect of handoffs has the potential to improve handoff
    performance in terms of latency and packet loss. This draft identifies the problem
    area for seamless mobility and defines the scope of the work for the SeaMoby work
    group.</p>"
