abstract:
- content: <p>The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) fundamentally changes the way in which
    two Internet hosts communicate. One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP
    does not require modifications to the traditional network-layer functionality
    of the Internet, i.e., its routers. In the current Internet, however, many devices
    other than routers modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet.
    These "middleboxes" are intermediary devices that perform functions other than
    the standard functions of an IP router on the datagram path between source and
    destination hosts. Whereas some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP
    at all, others can affect some aspects of HIP communication and others can render
    HIP communication impossible. This document discusses the problems associated
    with HIP communication across network paths that include specific types of middleboxes,
    namely, network address translators and firewalls. It identifies and discusses
    issues in the current HIP specifications that affect communication across these
    types of middleboxes.</p>
