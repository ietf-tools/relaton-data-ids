abstract:
- content: '<p>A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is
    to set a Record-Route header on initial requests in order to make subsequent requests
    pass through it. This header contains a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    indicating where and how the subsequent requests should be sent to reach the proxy.
    Like any SIP URI, it can contain sip or sips schemes, IPV4 or IPV6 addresses,
    and URI parameters that could influence the routing like different transport parameters
    (UDP, TCP, SCTP...), or a compression indication like "comp=sigcomp". When a proxy
    has to change some of those parameters between its incoming and outgoing interfaces
    (multi-homed proxies, transport switching, sip to sips or IPV4 to IPV6 scenarios...),
    the question arises on what should be put in Record- Route: it is just not possible
    to make one header having the characteristics of both sides at the same time.
    This document aims to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified
    on this topic; it formally suggests the use of the double Record-Route technique
    as a replacement to the current RFC3261 text, which only describes Record-Route
    rewriting solution.</p>'
