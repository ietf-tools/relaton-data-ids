abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC1531] provides a method
    for a host to retrieve common configuration parameters at boot time. These include
    the host's IP address, default gateway, subnet mask, DNS server, and other useful
    things. When a host is booted from the network, it does not have access to these
    configuration parameters from its local or network disk right away; it relies
    instead on DHCP to provide them. One such parameter that is not yet provided is
    a list of IP hosts to which to send SNMP notifications [RFC1448] during the boot
    process, particularly if the boot fails. As the host is already gleaning similar
    information from DHCP, a new option to specify these SNMP 'trap' hosts appears
    to be the simplest method to gain this information. Hosts not booting from the
    network benefit as well, since SNMP notification hosts can now be configured centrally
    through DHCP. This document describes a proposed DHCP option that specifies a
    list of SNMP notification hosts to which SNMP notifications should be sent.</p>"
