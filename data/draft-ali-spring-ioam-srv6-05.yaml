abstract:
- content: "<p>OAM and PM information from the SR endpoints can be piggybacked in
    the data packet. The OAM and PM information piggybacking in the data packets is
    also known as In-situ OAM (IOAM). IOAM records operational and telemetry information
    in the data packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the
    network. This document defines how IOAM data fields are transported as part of
    the Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) header.</p>"
