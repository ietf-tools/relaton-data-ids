abstract:
- content: "<p>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards track protocol
    to facilitate centralized key management for IPsec security associations as defined
    in RFC 2401, as an alternative to IKE (RFC 2409). Participating systems will use
    the Kerberos architecture as defined in RFC 1510 (and its successors) for key
    management. The goal of the working group is to produce a streamlined, fast, easily
    managed, and cryptographically sound protocol without requiring public key. The
    working group will not require changes to either IPsec (RFC 2401), or Kerberos
    (RFC 1510).</p>"
