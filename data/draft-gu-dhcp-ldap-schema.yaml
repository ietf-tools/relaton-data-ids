abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a schema for representing DHCP service in an
    LDAP-based directory. The integration of DHCP with a directory makes it possible
    for an organization to centrally administer its DHCP service, regardless of the
    number of DHCP servers it deploys. This management approach further reduces the
    total cost of ownership and improves scalability of DHCP service.</p>"
