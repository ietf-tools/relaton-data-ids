abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a cooperative communication method of theconverged
    multi-media wireless resource management network.It can maximize the utilization
    of heterogeneous network resources and optimize the access to wireless resources
    of the network in the form of Mesh, which solves the problem of collaborative
    wireless resource management in multi-media converged networks. Through the overall
    consideration of multi-media converged networks including wired network, wireless
    network, broadband network, and narrowband network, joint access control and resource
    scheduling for network devices with different characteristics in heterogeneous
    networks are realized.</p>"
