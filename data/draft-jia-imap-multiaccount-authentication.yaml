abstract:
- content: "<p>Simultaneous authentication for multiple accounts is an attractive
    feature but is not supported in the current Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501].
    This document introduces an extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol,
    Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1). With this extension, when a client is authenticated
    with one of its account identifiers, it is also authenticated automatically with
    all the other associated account identifiers (if present), i.e., a client can
    be authenticated for all of its associated accounts at the same time.</p>"
