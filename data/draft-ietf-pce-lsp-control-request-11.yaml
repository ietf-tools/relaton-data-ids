abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) retains information about
    the placement of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs). When a PCE has stateful control over LSPs, it may send
    indications to LSP head-ends to modify the attributes (especially the paths) of
    the LSPs. A Path Computation Client (PCC) that has set up LSPs under local configuration
    may delegate control of those LSPs to a stateful PCE. There are use cases in which
    a stateful PCE may wish to obtain control of locally configured LSPs that it is
    aware of but have not been delegated to the PCE. This document describes an extension
    to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) to enable a PCE
    to make requests for such control.</p>"
