abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an efficient model called ''Facility based computation
    model'' for computing bypass tunnels paths in the context of the MPLS TE Fast
    Reroute, while allowing bandwidth sharing between backup tunnel protecting independent
    resources. Both a centralized and a distributed path computation scenarios are
    described. The required signaling extensions are also addressed in the draft.</p>"
