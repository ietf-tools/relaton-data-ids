abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, TCP as specified in RFC 793 was threatened by the blind
    data injection attack because of the loose acceptable ACK value validation, where
    the ACK value of a data segment is considered valid as long as it does not acknowledge
    data ahead of the next segment to send. RFC 5961 improved the defect by shrinking
    the range of acceptable ACK values in a data segment. Later, RFC 9293 involved
    the updates proposed by RFC 5961 as a TCP stack implementation option. However,
    an endpoint that follows the RFC 9293 specifications can still accept a data segment
    containing an ACK value acknowledging data that the endpoint has never sent. This
    document specifies small modifications to the way TCP verifies incoming data segments'
    ACK value to prevent TCP from accepting invalid ACK values.</p>"
