abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an update to the wildcard definition of RFC 1034. The interaction
    with wildcards and CNAME is changed, an error condition is removed, and the words
    defining some concepts central to wildcards are changed. The overall goal is not
    to change wildcards, but to refine the definition of RFC 1034. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
