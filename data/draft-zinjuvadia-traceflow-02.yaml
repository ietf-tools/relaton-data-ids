abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new OAM protocol - TraceFlow that captures
    information pertaining to a traffic flow along the path that the flow takes through
    the network. TraceFlow is ECMP and link-aggregation aware and captures the information
    about constituent members through which the traffic flow passes. TraceFlow gathers
    information that is relevant to the flow such as interface address, interface
    statistics, effect of network policies on the flow and so on. Conventions used
    in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</p>
