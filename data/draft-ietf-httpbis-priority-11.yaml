abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme that allows an HTTP client to communicate
    its preferences for how the upstream server prioritizes responses to its requests,
    and also allows a server to hint to a downstream intermediary how its responses
    should be prioritized when they are forwarded. This document defines the Priority
    header field for communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent
    manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing responses. These
    share a common format structure that is designed to provide future extensibility.</p>"
