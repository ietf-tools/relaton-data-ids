abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   In interpersonal messaging end-to-end encryption means for
    public key\n   distribution and verification of its authenticity are needed; the\n
    \  latter to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.\n\n   This document proposes
    a new method to easily verify a public key is\n   authentic by a Handshake process
    that allows users to easily verify\n   their communication channel.  The new method
    is targeted to\n   Opportunistic Security scenarios and is already implemented
    in\n   several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).\n\n\t </p>\n      "
