abstract:
- content: "<p>Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP (RFC4271) relations
    for communicating various routing policies between peers. It is also a common
    best practice among operators to propagate various additional information about
    routes intra-domain. The most common tool used today to attach various information
    about routes is through the use of BGP communities (original, extended or large).
    This document defines a new flexible Community encoding in a BGP Attribute that
    enhances what can be accomplished with BGP communities. Three initial use cases
    for this are flow specification version 2 (FSv2) actions, routing policy distribution
    (rpd) actions, and wide communities.</p>"
