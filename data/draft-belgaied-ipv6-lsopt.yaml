abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option type used as an explicit
    security label. The hosts supporting Labeled Security add this option to the packets
    they originate in order to convey the sensitivity of the data. The routers that
    recognize this option will use it to make routing decision, in conformance with
    a pre-established policy. The IPSec protection requirements and a transition scheme
    from the existing IPv4 security options to the LS option are also proposed.</p>"
