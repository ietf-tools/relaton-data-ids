abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
    for representing presence information for a presentity. This format defines a
    textual note, an indication of availability (open or closed) and a Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for communication. Presentities who supply presence information
    often are willing to provide a description of a collection of resources (such
    as files, printers, etc.), that are at watchers' disposal. This document extends
    the PIDF to provide the syntax and format for the description of such resources
    within the PIDF.</p>"
