abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell (SSH) Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key
    distribution protocol that is limited to provisioning an SSH server with a user's
    public keys. This document describes a new protocol that builds on the protocol
    defined in RFC 4819 to allow the provisioning of keys and certificates to a server
    using the SSH transport. The new protocol allows the calling client to organize
    keys and certificates in different namespaces on a server. These namespaces can
    be used by the server to allow a client to configure any application running on
    the server (e.g., SSH, Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), Simple
    Network Management Protocol (SNMP)). The new protocol provides a server-independent
    mechanism for clients to add public keys, remove public keys, add certificates,
    remove certificates, and list the current set of keys and certificates known by
    the server by namespace (e.g., list all public keys in the SSH namespace). Rights
    to manage keys and certificates in a particular namespace are specific and limited
    to the authorized user and are defined as part of the server's implementation.
    The described protocol is backward compatible to version 2 defined by RFC 4819.</p>"
