abstract:
- content: "<p>There are on-going activities in the networking community to develop
    solutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless
    access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE 802.21. Intelligent access
    selection, taking into account link layer attributes, requires the delivery of
    a variety of different information types to the terminal from different sources
    within the network and vice-versa. The protocol requirements for this signalling
    have both transport and security issues that must be considered. The signalling
    must not be constrained to specific link types, so there is at least a common
    component to the signalling problem which is within the scope of the IETF. This
    draft presents a problem statement for this core problem.</p>"
