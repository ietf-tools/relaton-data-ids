abstract:
- content: "<p>Conventional Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) impose several challenges
    on factory floors as their numbers and size on the factory floors/plants continues
    to grow. Virtualized PLCs can help overcome many of those concerns. They can improve
    the automation in Industry control networks by simplifying communication between
    higher-level applications and low-level factory floor machine operations. Virtual
    PLCs provide an opportunity to integrate a diverse set of non- internet protocols
    supporting Industrial-IoT and IP connections to improve coordination between applications
    and field devices. Besides automation, virtual PLCs also enhance programmability
    in industry process control systems by abstracting control functions from I/O
    modules. However, to achieve desired outcome and benefits, both operational and
    application networks should evolve. This document introduces virtual PLC concept,
    describes the details and benefits of virtualized PLCs, then focuses on the problem
    statement and requirements.</p>"
