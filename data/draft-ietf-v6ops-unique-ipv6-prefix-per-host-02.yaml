abstract:
- content: "<p>In some IPv6 environments the need has arisen for hosts to be able
    to utilise a unique IPv6 prefix even though the link or media may be shared. Typically
    hosts (subscribers) on a shared network, either wired or wireless, such as Ethernet,
    WiFi, etc., will acquire unique IPv6 addresses from a common IPv6 prefix that
    is allocated or assigned for use on a specific link. In most deployments today
    IPv6 address assignment from a single IPv6 prefix on a shared network is done
    by either using IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) and/or stateful
    DHCPv6. While this is still viable and operates as designed there are some large
    scale environments where this concept introduces significant performance challenges
    and implications, specifically related to IPv6 router and neighbor discovery.
    This document outlines an approach utilising existing IPv6 protocols to allow
    hosts to be assigned a unique IPv6 prefix (instead of a unique IPv6 address from
    a shared IPv6 prefix). Benefits of a unique IPv6 prefix compared to a unique IPv6
    address from the service provider are going from improved subscriber isolation
    to enhanced subscriber management.</p>"
