abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
    protocol 1.0 [TLS] to support SEED and HAS-160. The SEED algorithm is 128-bit
    symmetric block cipher algorithm. [SEED] The HAS-160 is 160-bit secure hash function,
    whose block size is 512 bit. [HAS] Both algorithms are developed in Korea since
    1997 for stronger communication security. Currently, SEED is widely used and is
    the mandatory cipher in banking and stock applications in Korea.</p>"
