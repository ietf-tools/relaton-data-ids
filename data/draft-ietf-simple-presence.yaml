abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of presence. Presence is defined as
    the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network.
    Historically, presence has been limited to "on-line" and "off-line" indicators;
    the notion of presence here is broader. Subscriptions and notifications of presence
    are supported by defining an event package within the general SIP event notification
    framework. This protocol is also compliant with the Common Presence Profile (CPP)
    framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
