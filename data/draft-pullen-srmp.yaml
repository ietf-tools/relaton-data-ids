abstract:
- content: "<p>The Selectively Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is a transport protocol,
    intended to deliver a mix of reliable and best-effort messages in an any-to-any
    multicast environment, where the best-effort traffic occurs in significantly greater
    volume than the reliable traffic and therefore can carry sequence numbers of reliable
    messages for loss detection. SRMP is intended for use in a distributed simulation
    application environment, where only the latest value of reliable transmission
    for any particular data identifier requires delivery. SRMP has two sublayers:
    a bundling sublayer handling message aggregation and congestion control, and a
    Selectively Reliable Transport (SRT) sublayer. Selection between reliable and
    best-effort messages is performed by the application. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
