abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose an API standard for BGP Peering, also known as interdomain
    interconnection through global Internet Routing. This API offers a standard way
    to request public (settlement-free) peering, verify the status of a request or
    BGP session, and list potential connection locations. The API is backed by PeeringDB
    OIDC, the industry standard for peering authentication. We also propose future
    work to cover private peering, and alternative authentication methods.</p>"
