abstract:
- content: "<p>The IS-IS routing protocol uses TLV (Type-Length-Value) encoding in
    a variety of protocol messages. The original IS-IS TLV definition allows only
    for 255 octets of value in maximum. MP-TLV [I-D.ietf-lsr-multi-tlv] gives one
    proposal trying to solve this issue, but has some unsolved challenges for its
    implementations and deployment. This document analyzes in detail these challenges
    and proposes the community to find other better solution.</p>"
