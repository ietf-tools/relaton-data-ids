abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Internet climate poses serious threats to the Domain Name
    System. In the interim period before the DNS protocol can be secured more fully,
    measures can already be taken to harden the DNS to make 'spoofing' a recursing
    nameserver many orders of magnitude harder. Even a cryptographically secured DNS
    benefits from having the ability to discard bogus responses quickly, as this potentially
    saves large amounts of computation. By describing certain behavior that has previously
    not been standardized, this document sets out how to make the DNS more resilient
    against accepting incorrect responses. This document updates RFC 2181. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
