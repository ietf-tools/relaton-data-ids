abstract:
- content: <p>This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes
    of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a destination prefix.
    This implies not simply routing "to a destination", but "traffic going to that
    destination AND using a specified flow label". It may be combined with other qualifying
    attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a specified flow
    label AND from a specified source prefix". The obvious application is data center
    inter-tenant routing using a form of role-based access control. If the sender
    doesn't know the value to insert in the flow label (the receiver's tenant ID),
    it in effect has no route to that destination, thus providing an access list that
    is as changeable and scalable as routing.</p>
