abstract:
- content: "<p>Full use of electronic mail throughout the world requires that (subject
    to other constraints) people be able to use close variations on their own names
    (written correctly in their own languages and scripts) as mailbox names in email
    addresses. This document introduces a series of specifications that define mechanisms
    and protocol extensions needed to fully support internationalized email addresses.
    These changes include an SMTP extension and extension of email header syntax to
    accommodate UTF-8 data. The document set also includes discussion of key assumptions
    and issues in deploying fully internationalized email. This document is a replacement
    for RFC 4952; it reflects additional issues identified since that document was
    published. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
