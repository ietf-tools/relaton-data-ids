abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM Flooding Mechanism and Source Discovery (PFM-SD) is a mechanism
    for source discovery within a PIM domain. PIM signaling over BIER has been defined,
    allowing for BIER to interoperate with PIM. This document defines PFM-SD over
    BIER, such that PFM-SD can be used by PIM in a PIM domain to discover sources
    that are reachable via BIER. Also, this document provides PFM-SD extensions to
    discover the BIER ingress router closest to the source. This can be used by BIER
    overlays, such as PIM signaling over BIER, to determine which router to signal.</p>"
