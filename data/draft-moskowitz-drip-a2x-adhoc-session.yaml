abstract:
- content: "<p>Aircraft-to-anything (A2X) communications are often single broadcast
    messages that need to be signed with expensive (in cpu and payload size) asymmetric
    cryptography. There are also frequent cases of extended exchanges between two
    devices where a lower cost symmetric key protect flow can be used. This document
    shows both how to secure A2X broadcast messages with DRIP DET and Endorsement
    objects and to leverage these to create an AdHoc session key for just such a communication
    flow.</p>"
