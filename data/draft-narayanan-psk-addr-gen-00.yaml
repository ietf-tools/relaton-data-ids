abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographically generated addresses (CGAs) provide a means of generating
    an IP address that is tied to a public key of a node. Using this means, the address
    ownership of the node can be verified by using the public key of the node to decrypt
    data signed by the node using its private key. In AAA-based systems, there is
    currently no means of performing such absolute address ownership checks, since
    address authorization is traditionally outside the scope of AAA. However, in some
    key generation protocols, it may be critical to perform address ownership verification
    or authorization before the generated key can be used. When such key generation
    protocols are AAA-based, there is no known method of address authorization to
    allow this operation. This draft provides a means of IPv6 address generation using
    a shared secret so that the IP address of a node can be verified by the entity
    with which the node shares the secret.</p>"
