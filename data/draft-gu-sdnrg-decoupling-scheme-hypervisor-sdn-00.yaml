abstract:
- content: "<p>Different hypervisors are used in SDN network in cloud datacenters,
    such as KVM, VMware ESXi and Xen. However, different hypervisors are not well
    supported by SDN network to some degrees. In order to solve the problems with
    hypervisor VMware ESXi and Xen, decoupling schemes for hypervisor from SDN architecture
    are presented. Through different decoupling schemes, we want to find a better
    way in order to get the overall view by the SDN network.</p>"
