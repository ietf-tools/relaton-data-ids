abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes
    TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections. In the current TCP specification ([RFC0793]),
    there are some inappropriate or not up to date functions. Here we focus and discuss
    on TCP TIME-WAIT state function. TIME-WAIT is the last state of TCP connection
    of Active Close side node. After TCP connections are effectively closed, they
    move to TIME-WAIT state. After TIME-WAIT state is finished, resources of connections
    are released. This means that even if connections are effectively finished, resources
    of connections are NOT released. The TIME-WAIT state prevents from releasing them.
    From the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity communication
    styles, it is thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of evil functions. In order
    to provide efficient communication that matches current styles, an idea "Sharp
    Close" that eliminates or minimizes TIME- WAIT state of TCP connections is proposed.</p>
