abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the SMTP service extension for checkpoint/resume,
    which allows a client to recover from a lost connection to the server without
    having to repeat all of the commands and message content sent prior to the interruption,
    and with less risk of duplicated messages. It also includes an updated specification
    of the predecessor SMTP service extension for checkpoint/restart.</p>"
