abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Secure Frame (SFrame) end-to-end encryption
    and authentication mechanism for media frames in a multiparty conference call,
    in which central media servers (SFUs) can access the media metadata needed to
    make forwarding decisions without having access to the actual media. The proposed
    mechanism differs from other approaches through its use of media frames as the
    encryptable unit, instead of individual RTP packets, which makes it more bandwidth
    efficient and also allows use with non-RTP transports.</p>"
