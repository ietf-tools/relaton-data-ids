abstract:
- content: "<p>Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine makes
    it possible to dynamically relocate functional entities without topological and
    physical constraints. By tapping into this technique, service mobility, which
    deals with not only functional entities but also sessions established between
    those entities, will become possible and such capability is especially longed
    for realizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks. This document provides
    the reference model for service mobility in a virtual environment and defines
    the control protocol between the virtualized platform and the managing controller
    to realize service mobility.</p>"
