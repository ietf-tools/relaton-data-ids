abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the architecture and protocol implications
    of making network initiation support easier with NetLMM. The framework is restricted
    to inter-technology mobility within a single NETLMM domain. It is proposed to
    add a new NetLMM message from the LMA to the MAG, which function is to trigger,
    upon various events, the location registration procedure. Further, it is indicated
    how to complement NetLMM with 802.21 control mechanisms to achieve adequate network
    initiation.</p>"
