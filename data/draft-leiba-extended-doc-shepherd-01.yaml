abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 4858 talks about "Document Shepherding from Working Group Last Call
    to Publication". There's a significant part of a document's life that happens
    before working group last call, starting, really, at the time a working group
    begins discussing a version of the idea that's been posted as an individual draft.
    It seems reasonable and helpful to begin shepherding when there's a call for adoption
    as a working group document, and this document gives one Area Director's view
    of how that extended shepherding function might work, and what tasks might be
    involved throughout the document's lifecycle.</p>
