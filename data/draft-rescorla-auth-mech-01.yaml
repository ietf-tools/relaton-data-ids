abstract:
- content: "<p>Authentication is perhaps the most basic security problem for design-
    ers of network protocols. Even the early Internet protocols such as TELNET and
    FTP, which provided no other security services, made pro- vision for user authentication.
    Unfortunately, these early authenti- cation systems were wholly inadequate for
    the Internet Threat Model [REF] and a vast array of other authentication mechanisms
    have been introduced in an attempt to close these holes. The most striking thing
    about these security mechanisms is how many of them are essentially similar. There
    are only 7 basic classes of authentication protocol but there are a large number
    of slightly dif- ferent protocols with essentially the same security properties.
    This memo surveys the space of authentication mechanisms, describes the basic
    classes and provides examples of protocols which fit into each class.</p>"
