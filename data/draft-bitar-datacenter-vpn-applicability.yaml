abstract:
- content: "<p>Cloud Computing has been attracting a lot of attention from the networking
    industry. Some of the most publicized requirements are related to the evolution
    of the Cloud Networking Infrastructure to accommodate a large number of tenants,
    efficient network utilization, scalable loop avoidance, and Virtual Machine Mobility.
    This draft describes a framework for cloud networking, highlighting the applicability
    of existing work in various IETF Working Groups (e.g., RFCs and drafts developed
    in IETF L2VPN and L3VPN Working Groups) to cloud networking, and the gaps and
    problems that need to be further addressed. That is, the goal is to understand
    what may be re-used from the current protocols and call out requirements specific
    to the Cloud space that need to be addressed by new standardization work with
    proposed solutions in certain cases.</p>"
