abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the format of the data returned by a Time Stamp
    Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it. The time stamping
    service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) as one component in building
    reliable non-repudiation services (see [ISONR]). We also give an example of how
    to place a signature at a particular point in time, from which the appropriate
    CRLs may be checked.</p>"
