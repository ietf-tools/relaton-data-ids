abstract:
- content: <p>The OAuth Web Resource Authorization Profiles (OAuth WRAP) allow a server
    hosting a Protected Resource to delegate authorization to one or more authorities.
    An application (Client) accesses the Protected Resource by presenting a short
    lived, opaque, bearer token (Access Token) obtained from an authority (Authorization
    Server). There are Profiles for how a Client may obtain an Access Token when acting
    autonomously or on behalf of a User. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is
    submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.
