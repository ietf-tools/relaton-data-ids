abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP over connection-oriented transport protocol based systems are likely
    to face certain distinct performance and behavioral issues that are not manifest
    when SIP is transported over connectionless protocols. Allowing SIP entities to
    mutually conserve connections over a predictable, extended period of time is one
    of the leading requirements to help SIP entities deliver their optimal performance
    in the network. Overall, this document contemplates transport layer connection
    management issues relating to SIP. Requirements and potential solutions for introducing
    a backward compatible notion of persistent connections in SIP are presented.</p>"
