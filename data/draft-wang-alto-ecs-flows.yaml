abstract:
- content: "<p>The Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) has limitations to illustrate the network
    condition and to work with the OpenFlow protocol. This document extends ECS to
    improve the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol by (1) defining
    more types of endpoint address such as port number, protocol type, domain and
    etc; (2) adding flow constraints.</p>"
