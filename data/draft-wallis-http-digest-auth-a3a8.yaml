abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a one-time password generation mechanism for Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest access authentication based on Global System for
    Mobile Communications (GSM) authentication and key generation functions A3 and
    A8. The HTTP Authentication Framework includes two authentication schemes: Basic
    and Digest. Both schemes employ a shared secret based mechanism for access authentication.
    The A3-A8 mechanism performs user authentication and session key distribution
    in GSM and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. A3-A8 is
    a challenge-response based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography.</p>"
