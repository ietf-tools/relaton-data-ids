abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component
    of the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual authentication as well
    as to establish and to maintain IPsec Security Associations (SAs) between the
    respective parties. IKEv2 supports several different authentication mechanisms,
    such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and Shared
    Key (SK). Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent (HA), as
    a Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified. However, that specification
    focused on the usage of EAP and did not include support for SK-based authentication
    available with IKEv2. This document specifies the IKEv2-server-to-Diameter-server
    communication when the IKEv2 peer authenticates using IKEv2 with SK. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
