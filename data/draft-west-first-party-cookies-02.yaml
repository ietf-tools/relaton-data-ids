abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6265 by defining a "First-Party-Only" attribute
    which allows servers to assert that a cookie ought to be sent only in a "first-party"
    context. This assertion allows user agents to mitigate the risk of cross-origin
    information leakage, and provides some minimal protection against cross-site request
    forgery attacks.</p>
