abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurements
    and related metrics. To better address the traceroute measurements storing issue,
    the authors first of all give a definition of the traceroute tool, describe the
    tool itself as well as its parameters and the default values on the most common
    operating systems and the output results that can be stored. Afterwards, the common
    information model with the base elements of the traceroute measurement storing
    is defined dividing the information elements in two semantically separated groups
    (configuration elements and results ones). Moreover an additional element is defined
    to relate configuration elements and results ones by means of a common unique
    identifier. On the basis of the information model a data model is then proposed
    in order to actually store the traceroute measurements. Finally considerations
    on how to extract relevant metrics related to traceroute measurements are given.</p>"
