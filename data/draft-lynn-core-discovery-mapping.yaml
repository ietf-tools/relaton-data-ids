- content: "<p>Resource and service discovery are complimentary. Resource discovery
    provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while service discovery
    can provide a scalable method to locate servers in large networks. This document
    defines a method for mapping between CoRE Link Format attributes and DNS-Based
    Service Discovery fields to allow either method to be used to locate service interfaces
    down to the granularity of function sets in mixed HTTP/CoAP environments.</p>"
