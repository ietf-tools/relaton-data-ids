abstract:
- content: <p>In the context of MPLS TE Fast Reroute, the Merge Point (MP) address
    is required at the Point of Local Repair (PLR) in order to select a backup tunnel
    intersecting a fast reroutable Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP)
    on a downstream Label Switching Router (LSR). However, existing protocol mechanisms
    are not sufficient to find an MP address in multi-domain routing networks where
    a domain is defined as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) area or an Autonomous
    System (AS). Hence, the current MPLS Fast Reroute mechanism cannot be used in
    order to protect inter-domain TE LSPs from a failure of an Area Border Router
    (ABR) or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR). This document specifies the use
    of existing Record Route Object (RRO) IPv4 and IPv6 sub-objects (with a new flag
    defined) thus defining the node-id sub-object in order to solve this issue. The
    MPLS Fast Reroute mechanism mentioned in this document refers to the "Facility
    backup" MPLS TE Fast Reroute method. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
