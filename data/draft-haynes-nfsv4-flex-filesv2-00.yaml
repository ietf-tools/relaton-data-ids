abstract:
- content: "<p>The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between
    the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file.
    The flexible file layout type is an extension to pNFS which allows the use of
    storage devices in a fashion such that they require only a quite limited degree
    of interaction with the metadata server, using already existing protocols. This
    document describes two extensions to the flexible file layout type to allow for
    multiple stateids for tightly coupled NFSv4 models and an additional security
    mechanism for loosely coupled models.</p>"
