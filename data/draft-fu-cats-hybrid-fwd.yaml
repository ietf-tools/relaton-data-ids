abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a hybrid forwarding mechanism for CATS (Computing-Aware
    Traffic Steering). The mechanism integrates the CATS forwarding table with the
    IP forwarding table, optimizing the utilization of forwarding table capacity.
    By customizing the forwarding model based on service identifiers, it can accommodate
    both experience-sensitive and non-experience-sensitive services. Additionally,
    it supports flow-granularity load balancing, enhancing the utilization of computing
    and networking resources while ensuring differentiated service requirements are
    satisfied.</p>"
