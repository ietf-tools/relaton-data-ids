abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP [1] protocol allows a mobile node (MN) to move between different
    networks seamlessly. However, in certain cases, the latency involved in the handoff
    can be beyond the threshold required for the support of delay-sensitive or real-time
    services. In order to address the above problem, there have been many proposals
    related to extensions of Mobile IP handoffs in order to achieve efficient handoff
    procedures.</p>"
