abstract:
- content: "<p>In traditional GSTN-based fax, a coverpage is often sent before the
    actual document. Some of the uses for a coverpage are: o routing the document
    to the correct recipient o identifying the sender o providing comments to the
    recipient about the document o page count o transmission date Current fax-over-SMTP
    aware applications do not have a standard way to indicate that a coverpage has
    been included with a message, or that there is a good possibilty that a coverpage
    is part of the message. This memo provides a mechanism to indicate that a coverpage
    has been included or has probably incluced in a message.</p>"
