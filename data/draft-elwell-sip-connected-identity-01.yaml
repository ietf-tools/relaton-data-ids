abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request, the UAS can have
    a different identity from that in the To header. This document provides a means
    for that UA to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the
    reverse direction and for that identity to be signed by an authentication service.
    The same mechanism can be used to indicate a change of identity during a dialog,
    e.g., because of some action in a PSTN behind a gateway. This work is being discussed
    on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
