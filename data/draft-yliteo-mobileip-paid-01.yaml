abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a hierarchical IP addressing scheme that provides
    end-to-end host connectivity across routing realms with overlapping address space.
    PAID agents are routers that connect an internal private network to the global
    public Internet. The PAID agents' public IP addresses augment the locally significant
    private addresses to form globally unique binary IP addresses for private hosts.
    This extends the IPv4 address space and allows Internet hosts to use private instead
    of public IP addresses for global Internet communication. The proposal does not
    need any changes to the current routing infrastruture but requires an extension
    to the end hosts' network socket descriptors and the domain name system.</p>"
