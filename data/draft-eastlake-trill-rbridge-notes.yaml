abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides additional informational material related to
    RBridges, which are devices that implement the TRILL protocol. It is a supplement
    to the RBridges base protocol specification and includes discussion of tradeoffs
    in some features and configurations of RBridges. In addition, it provides a sketch
    of a proof that, with reasonable assumptions, persistent loops do not occur in
    a TRILL campus.</p>"
