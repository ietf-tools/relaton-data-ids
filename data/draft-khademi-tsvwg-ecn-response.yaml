abstract:
- content: "<p>This document relaxes recommendations and prescriptions from RFC3168
    and RFC4774 that get in the way of experimentation with different ECN strategies.
    First, RFC3168 and RFC4774 state that, upon the receipt by an ECN-Capable transport
    of a single CE packet, the congestion control algorithms followed at the end-systems
    MUST be essentially the same as the congestion control response to a single dropped
    packet. This document relaxes this rule in order to encourage experimentation
    with different backoff strategies. Second, this document allows future IETF specifications
    to use the ECT(1) codepoint in ways that are currently prohibited by RFC3168.
    Third, this document allows future IETF experiments to use the ECT(0) or ECT(1)
    codepoint on any TCP segment.</p>"
