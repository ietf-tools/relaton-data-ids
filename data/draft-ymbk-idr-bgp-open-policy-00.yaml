abstract:
- content: "<p>Route Leaks are propagation of BGP prefixes which violate assumptions
    of BGP topology relationships; e.g. passing a route learned from one peer to another
    peer or to a transit provider, passing a route learned from one transit provider
    to another transit provider or to a peer. Today, approaches to leak prevention
    rely on marking routes according to some configuration options without any check
    of the configuration corresponds to that of the BGP neighbor, or enforcement that
    the two BGP speakers agree on the relationship. This document enhances BGP Open
    to establish agreement of the (peer, customer, provider, internal) relationship
    of two BGP neighboring speakers to enforce appropriate configuration on both sides.
    Propagated routes are then marked with a flag according to agreed relationship
    allowing detection and mitigation of route leaks.</p>"
