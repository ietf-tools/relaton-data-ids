abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a Service Mesh Dynamic-Trust Architecture (SM-
    DTA) to address security risks in dynamic service-to-service communication within
    distributed service mesh environments. The architecture is applicable to scenarios
    such as elastic service scaling and cross-domain service invocation. SM-DTA enforces
    end-to- end security governance through service identity authentication, dynamic
    context-aware policy engines, and data sovereignty proxies.</p>"
