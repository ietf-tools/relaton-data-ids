abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a number of communication performance requirements
    that are imposed by traffic safety applications on a network layer. These traffic
    safety applications and requirements have been derived by the USA VSC (Vehicle
    Safety Communications)and VSC-A (VSC-Applications) projects and by the European
    Car to Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) and the ETSI TC ITS standardization
    body. The goal of this document is to stimulate the discussion on judging whether
    these performance requirements could or could not be supported (currently and
    in the future) by IP based network solutions.</p>"
