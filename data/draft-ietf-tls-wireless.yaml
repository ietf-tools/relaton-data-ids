abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests extensions to TLS designed to make TLS more
    amenable to use within wireless environments. The extensions may be used by TLS
    clients and servers. The extensions are backwards compatible - communication is
    possible between TLS 1.0 clients that support the extensions and TLS 1.0 servers
    that do not support the extensions, and vice versa.</p>"
