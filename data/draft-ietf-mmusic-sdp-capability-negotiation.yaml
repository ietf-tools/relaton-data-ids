abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended to describe multimedia
    sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other
    forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was not intended to provide capability
    indication or capability negotiation; however, over the years, SDP has seen widespread
    adoption and as a result it has been gradually extended to provide limited support
    for these, notably in the form of the offer/answer model defined in RFC 3264.
    SDP does not define how to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols
    (e.g., RTP profiles) or attributes. This makes it difficult to deploy new RTP
    profiles such as Secure RTP or RTP with RTCP-based feedback, negotiate use of
    different security keying mechanisms, etc. It also presents problems for some
    forms of media negotiation. The purpose of this document is to address these shortcomings
    by extending SDP with capability negotiation parameters and associated offer/answer
    procedures to use those parameters in a backwards compatible manner. The document
    defines a general SDP Capability Negotiation framework. It also specifies how
    to provide attributes and transport protocols as capabilities and negotiate them
    using the framework. Extensions for other types of capabilities (e.g., media types
    and media formats) may be provided in other documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
