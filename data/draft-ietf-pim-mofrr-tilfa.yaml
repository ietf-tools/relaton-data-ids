abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR) has been defined in [RFC7431],
    but the selection of the secondary multicast next hop only according to the loop-free
    alternate fast reroute, which has restrictions in multicast deployments. This
    document describes a mechanism for Multicast-only Fast Reroute by using Topology
    Independent Loop-free Alternate fast reroute, which is independent of network
    topology and can achieve covering more network environments.</p>"
