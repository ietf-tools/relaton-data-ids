abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents describes the hybrid information-centric networking
    (hICN) architecture for IPv6. The specifications describe a way to implement information-networking
    functionalities into IPv6. The objective is to use IPv6 without creating overlays
    with a new packet format as an additional encapsulation. The intent of the present
    design is to introduce some IPv6 routers in the network with additional packet
    processing operations to implement ICN functions. Moreover, the current design
    is tightly integrated into IPv6 to allow easy interconnection to IPv6 networks
    with the additional design objective to exploit existing IPv6 protocols as much
    as possible as they are, or extend them where needed.</p>"
