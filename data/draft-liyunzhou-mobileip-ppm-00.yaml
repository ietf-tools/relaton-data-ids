abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to explore an approach for the interoperability
    testing of Mobile IP implementations across the Internet. It proposes client/server
    proximity proxies, two intermediate entities between the mobile node and the mobility
    agent. This model can be used to solve the problem addressed in the hierarchical
    foreign agents model. The document proposes to build a tunnel between proximity
    proxies using Tunnel Request and Tunnel Reply messages, and enable routing policies
    to the tunnel by using Proxy Update message and adding a bit in Agent Advertisement
    message.</p>"
