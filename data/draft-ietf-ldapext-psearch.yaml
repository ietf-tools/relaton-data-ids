abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] search
    operation to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client can receive notification
    of changes that occur in an LDAP server. The mechanism is designed to be very
    flexible yet easy for clients and servers to implement. Since the IETF is likely
    to pursue a different, more comprehensive solution in this area, this document
    will eventually be published with Informational status in order to document an
    existing practice.</p>"
