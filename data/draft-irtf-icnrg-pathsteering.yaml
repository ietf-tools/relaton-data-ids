abstract:
- content: "<p>Path Steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of
    ICN content objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along a previously
    discovered path. It has various uses, including the operation of state-of-the-art
    multipath congestion control algorithms and for network measurement and management.
    This specification derives directly from the design published in _Path Switching
    in Content Centric and Named Data Networks_ (4th ACM Conference on Information-Centric
    Networking - ICN'17) and therefore does not recapitulate the design motivations,
    implementation details, or evaluation of the scheme. Some technical details are
    different however, and where there are differences, the design documented here
    is to be considered definitive. This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric
    Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
