abstract:
- content: <p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the author. The address used by the mail transport service is provided separately,
    through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO" command. Before final delivery, handling can
    entail a sequence of addresses that lead to the recipient. It can be helpful for
    a message to have a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and
    to include each address used for that recipient. This specification defines a
    header field for this information.</p>
