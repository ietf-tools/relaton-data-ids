abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes novel protocols to bind IPv4/IPv6 addresses
    and flows to MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). For MPEG-2 systems to become true
    subnetworks of the general Internet, methods are required to signal IPv4/v6 addresses
    to the link receivers and transmitters; this is known as Address Resolution (AR),
    or Neighbour Discovery (ND). In MPEG-2 networks, an IP address must be associated
    with a Packet ID (PID) and specific transmission multiplex. In this documents
    2 mechanisms based on standard XML semantics and multimedia signalling are introduced
    to comply to established IP over DVB AR established. These protocols are seen
    to complement the current approaches based on SI table with a more IP centric
    approach.</p>"
