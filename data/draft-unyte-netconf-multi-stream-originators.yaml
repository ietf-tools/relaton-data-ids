abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the distributed data export mechanism that
    allows multiple data streams to be managed by using a single subscription. Specifically,
    device can decide to decompse one subscription into multiple subscriptions to
    the line-cards. So that each line-card can directly push data to the collector
    without passing through a broker for internal consolidation. And the device can
    indicate the subscription decomposition result to the receiver to check the data
    integrity.</p>"
