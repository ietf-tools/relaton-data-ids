abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new document series intended for use as a
    repository for IETF operations documents, which should be more ephemeral than
    RFCs, but more referenceable than Internet-Drafts, and with more clear handling
    procedures than a random Web page. It proposes to establish this series as an
    RFC 3933 process experiment. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
