abstract:
- content: "<p>The X.500 Standard has the concept of first level DSAs, whose administrators
    must collectively manage the root naming context through bilateral agreements
    or other private means which are outside the scope of the Standard. The Paradise-Nameflow
    X.500 service has an established procedure for managing the root naming context,
    which currently uses Quipu proprietary replication mechanisms and a root DSA.
    The project is moving towards 1993 standard replication protocols and wants to
    standardise a procedure for managing the root naming context which will use 1993
    standard protocols. Such a procedure will be useful to private X.500 domains as
    well as to the Internet X.500 public domain.</p>"
