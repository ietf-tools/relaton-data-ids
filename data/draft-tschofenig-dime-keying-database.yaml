abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter Base specification offers security protection between
    neighboring Diameter peers using TLS, DTLS, and IPsec. The development of a solution
    to protect Diameter Attribute Value Pairs between non-neighboring nodes is currently
    work in progress. Diameter nodes maintain different types of databases, depending
    on their functions. Examples include the peer table and the realm-based routing
    table. This document describes a conceptual model for a keying database as it
    would be used by a Diameter node to determine what AVPs to protect, and what keys
    / algorithms to use. On the receiving side it allows the receiving node to select
    the appropriate security association for verifying the protected AVPs. The design
    is similar to IPsec and inspired by the routing protocol security key table.</p>"
