abstract:
- content: <p>The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0" includes the specification for
    a Basic Access Authentication scheme. This scheme is not considered to be a secure
    method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed over the
    network as clear text. A specification for a different authentication scheme is
    needed to address this severe limitation. This document provides specification
    for such a scheme, referred to as "Digest Access Authentication". [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
