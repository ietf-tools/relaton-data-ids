abstract:
- content: "<p>A novel mobility management approach has been proposed, that leverages
    routable location-independent identifiers (IDs) and an Information-Centric Networking
    (ICN) communication model integrated in IPv6, also referred to as Hybrid ICN (hICN).
    In virtue of its anchorless property, we denote this approach as hICN-AMM (hICN
    Anchorless Mobility Management) hereinafter. Such approach belongs to the category
    of pure ID-based mobility management schemes whose objective is (i) to overcome
    the limitations of traditional locator-based solutions like Mobile IP, (ii) to
    remove the need for a global mapping system as the one required by locator- identifier
    separation solutions like LISP or ILA. ID-based networking as proposed by ICN
    architectures allows to disentangle forwarding operations from changes of network
    location, hence removing tunnels and user plane or control plane anchors. This
    document discusses hICN-AMM deployment options and related tradeoffs in terms
    of cost/benefits. Particular attention is devoted to the insertion in the recently
    proposed 5G Service Based Architecture under study at 3GPP where an hICN-AMM solution
    might present a more efficient alternative to the traditional tunnel-based mobility
    architecture through GTP-U.</p>"
