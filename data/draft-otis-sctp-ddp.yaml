abstract:
- content: "<p>In many applications, direct placement of data avoids the overhead
    of multiple copies or excessive context switching and is a desirable feature.
    To accomplish this using an Internet Protocol, a direct placement adaptation layer
    is defined within this document. This adaptation exists as a small shim sitting
    above SCTP. This shim fragments messages for path compliance, prefixes the placement
    header, and may place data directly into a user buffer. The ultimate goal is to
    have placement occur by the network interface card, where this shim coordinates
    such placement while proper network layering is maintained. As SCTP was not designed
    to directly handle offset based fragmentation, the shim handles message fragmentation
    to introduce the offsets as well as determine message reception signaling as a
    result of unordered delivery needed for immediate placement.</p>"
