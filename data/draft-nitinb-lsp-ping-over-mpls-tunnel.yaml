abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods for performing lsp-ping traceroute
    over mpls tunnels. The techniques outlined in RFC 4379 fail to perform correct
    traceroute validation and path discovery for a LSP that goes over other mpls tunnels.
    This document describes new procedures that can be used in conjunction with the
    standard procedures described in RFC 4379 to trace such LSPs.</p>"
