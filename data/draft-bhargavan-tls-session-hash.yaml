abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) master secret is not cryptographically
    bound to important session parameters such as the client and server identities.
    Consequently, it is possible for an active attacker to set up two sessions, one
    with a client and another with a server such that the master secrets on the two
    sessions are the same. Thereafter, any mechanism that relies on the master secret
    for authentication, including renegotiation after session resumption, becomes
    vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker can simply forward
    messages back and forth between the client and server. This specification defines
    a TLS extension that contextually binds the master secret to a log of the full
    handshake that computes it, thus preventing such attacks.</p>"
