abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges implement the TRILL protocol, which in turn makes use of an
    extended version of the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) routing
    protocol to determine topology and frame forwarding and for the distribution and
    synchronization of data. RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding with zero
    configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and multipathing
    for both unicast and multicast traffic. Rbridges also support VLANs. This document
    specifies some details of IS-IS PDUs used in TRILL.</p>"
