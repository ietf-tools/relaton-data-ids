abstract:
- content: '<p>"BGP Routes with Color" have become a topic of interest in the IDR
    Working Group. The authors of the various proposals have many things in mind to
    solve with them, how a color might be used, and the operational model for their
    solution. In general, the solutions share some core properties: Routes for an
    IP endpoint, that have a domain-wide semantic element to differentiate forwarding
    (often called a color), and appropriate state to enable that differentiated forwarding.
    Examples of the technologies enabling differentiated forwarding include MPLS and
    Segment Routing. This document examines two of the current proposals - BGP Color-Aware
    Routing, and BGP Classful Transport - and proposes mechanisms to permit them to
    interoperate.</p>'
