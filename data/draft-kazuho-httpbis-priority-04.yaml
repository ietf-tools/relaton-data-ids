abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme for prioritizing HTTP responses. This
    scheme expresses the priority of each HTTP response using absolute values, rather
    than as a relative relationship between a group of HTTP responses. This document
    defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial priority in an
    HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing
    the responses. These share a common format structure that is designed to provide
    future extensibility.</p>"
