abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by
    Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v3.2 agents. S/MIME provides
    a method to send and receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral
    part of S/MIME agent processing. S/MIME agents validate certificates as described
    in RFC 5280, the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL
    Profile. S/MIME agents must meet the certificate processing requirements in this
    document as well as those in RFC 5280. This document obsoletes RFC 3850.</p>"
