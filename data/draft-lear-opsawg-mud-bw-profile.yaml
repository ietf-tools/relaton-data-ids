abstract:
- content: "<p>Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which devices
    can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave, and how the
    network should treat them. Earlier work focused on access control. This draft
    specifies a means by which manufacturers can express to deployments what form
    of bandwidth profile devices are expected to have with respect to specific services.</p>"
