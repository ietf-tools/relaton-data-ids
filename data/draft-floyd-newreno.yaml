abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2581 [RFC2581] documents the following four intertwined TCP congestion
    control algorithms: Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, and Fast
    Recovery. RFC 2581 [RFC2581] explicitly allows certain modifications of these
    algorithms, including modifications that use the TCP Selective Acknowledgement
    (SACK) option [RFC2018], and modifications that respond to 'partial acknowledgments'
    (ACKs which cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was detected)
    in the absence of SACK. The NewReno mechanism described in this document describes
    a specific algorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred to as
    NewReno. This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey
    Hoe in [Hoe95].</p>"
