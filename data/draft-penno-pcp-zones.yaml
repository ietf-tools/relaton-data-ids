abstract:
- content: "<p>A zone is a notion which denotes a routing instance, a set interfaces
    or prefixes characterized by having a different address realm and/or security
    policy. A NAT device can route packets with the same source IP address to different
    zones depending on configuration policies such as destination IP address. This
    functionality has been present for many years in NAT devices from multiple vendors.
    PCP allows a host to interact with a PCP-controlled NAT device and request an
    external IP and port. Therefore a PCP Server that controls the NAT device and
    receives a PCP request from a host needs to know from which NAT pool to allocate
    an external IP address and port. This document specifies an extension to PCP to
    support the zone concept.</p>"
