abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the requirements and procedures to achieve
    the multihoming of media for voice over IP sessions using the transport layer
    protocol as signaling Control Transmission Protocol. Media is an essential part
    of any voice over IP session. SIP (RFC 3261) is a text based signaling protocol
    and Multihoming using SIP can be achieved by using the SCTP as a transport protocol
    (RFC 4168), therefore the application level resiliency can be guaranteed even
    in case of any middle node or terminal failures. But any voice over IP or multimedia
    session is nearly insignificant, if the media path is broken during a call and
    is waiting for a timeout which further shall lead to a call drop.A complete solution
    to Multihoming can be achieved if a system is capable of a performing the failovers
    at both application and media plane and still maintaining the session irrespective
    of the application or media path failures or at least to detect a signaling or
    media path failure and terminate the session rather than waiting for timeouts.
    The requirement of Multihoming in media can also be derived from the fact that
    in any voice, video or data session, the signaling and call setup time use to
    be incomparably short than that of real media session at media plane. Therefore
    providing the resiliency at the signaling level does not provide the guaranteed
    and best effort service from a media session point of view as not only signaling
    but media is an integral part of it.</p>"
