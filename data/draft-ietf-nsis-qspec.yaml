abstract:
- content: "<p>The Quality-of-Service (QoS) NSIS signaling layer protocol (NSLP) is
    used to signal QoS reservations and is independent of a specific QoS model (QOSM)
    such as IntServ or Diffserv. Rather, all information specific to a QOSM is encapsulated
    in a separate object, the QSPEC. This document defines a template for the QSPEC
    including a number of QSPEC parameters. The QSPEC parameters provide a common
    language to be reused in several QOSMs and thereby aim to ensure the extensibility
    and interoperability of QoS NSLP. While the base protocol is QOSM-agnostic, the
    parameters that can be carried in the QSPEC object are possibly closely coupled
    to specific models. The node initiating the NSIS signaling adds an Initiator QSPEC,
    which indicates the QSPEC parameters that must be interpreted by the downstream
    nodes less the reservation fails, thereby ensuring the intention of the NSIS initiator
    is preserved along the signaling path. This document defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.</p>"
