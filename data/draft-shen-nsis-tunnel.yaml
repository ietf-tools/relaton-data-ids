abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents an NSIS operation over IP tunnels scheme using
    QoS NSLP as the NSIS signaling application. Both sender-initiated and receiver-initiated
    reservation modes are discussed. The scheme proposes the use of separate signaling
    sessions inside the tunnel for the end-to-end sessions. Packets belonging to qualified
    tunnel sessions are assigned special flow IDs to be distinguished from the rest
    of the tunnel traffic. The end-to-end session and its corresponding tunnel session
    are associated with each other when necessary; so that adjustment in one session
    may be reflected in the other.</p>"
