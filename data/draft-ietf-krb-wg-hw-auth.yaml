abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an extension to the Kerberos protocol for performing
    initial authentication of a user without using that user's long-lived password.
    Any "hardware preauthentication" method may be employed instead of the password,
    and the key of another principal must be nominated to encrypt the returned credential.</p>
