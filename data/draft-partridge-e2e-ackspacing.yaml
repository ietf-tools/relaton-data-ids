abstract:
- content: "<p>Suppose you want TCP implementations to be able to fill a 155 Mb/s
    path. Further suppose that the path includes a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit,
    so the round trip delay through the path is at least 500 ms, and the delay-bandwidth
    product is 9.7 megabytes or more. If we further assume the TCP implementations
    support TCP Large Windows and PAWS (many do), so they can manage 9.7 MB TCP window,
    then we can be sure the TCP will eventually start sending at full path rate (unless
    the satellite channel is very lossy). But it may take a long time to get the TCP
    up to full speed.</p>"
