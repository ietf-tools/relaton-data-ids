abstract:
- content: "<p>Support for multi-tenancy has been the subject of recent work on P4
    switch programming. This draft further describes a potential use case where a
    tenant programs a virtual network built over a mobile network, and discusses related
    requirements. The use case is based on the existing 5GLAN feature, since it is
    a well documented virtual network architecture supported by 5G.</p>"
