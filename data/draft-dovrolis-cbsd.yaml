abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Class-Based Service Differentiation (CBSD)
    architecture and it proposes a set of Per-Hop-Behaviors that can be used for implementing
    it. According to CBSD, the network traffic is mapped to a set of classes. The
    differentiating factor between traffic classes is the relative forwarding quality
    in a DS capable router. The Class PHBs have quite similar semantics with the Precedence
    PHBs, recently proposed by Baker et.al. in [PREC], but an attempt is made here
    to define them in a more general manner, decoupling them from specific implementation
    possibilities. There is also a semantical overlap between the Expedited Forwarding
    PHB of [DSFIELD] and the highest Class PHB. Consequently, the Diffserv working
    group may want to combine these three PHB proposals in a single one, minimizing
    the number of DS Field bits used.</p>"
