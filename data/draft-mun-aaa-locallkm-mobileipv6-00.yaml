abstract:
- content: "<p>Isolating the access to mobility agents by the VPN gateway which guards
    the home agent, home resources is disturbing the operations of mobile node away
    from its home that needed to perform the registration of the current location
    according to the specification because the access from the outside is restricted
    by the VPN policy. This paper presents the authentication and key exchange scheme
    using the AAA infrastructure for a user in Internet to access the Intranet behind
    the VPN gateway. By defining the role of authentication and tunnel processing
    for each agent or relaying entity, we are able to obtain our goal to the security-aware
    environment. Also, the performance result of the proposed scheme is discussed
    in depth.</p>"
