abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER is a scalable multicast overlay [RFC8279] that utilizes some routing
    underlay, e.g., IP, to build up its Bit Index Forwarding Tables (BIFTs). This
    document proposes a Fast Reroute Extension for BIER (BIER-FRR). In case of a link
    or node failure, the routing underlay may first utilize FRR techniques to restore
    connectivity and then its forwarding tables converge. After that, BIER can update
    its BIFTs, which requires time. BIER packets may not be delivered until the last
    procedure has finished. With BIER-FRR, a BIER Forwarding Router (BFR) can deliver
    BIER packets again after a link or node failures as soon as the connectivity within
    the routing underlay is restored and the BFR is informed about a next-hop (NH)
    that is unreachable on a lower layer. BIER-FRR provides a mode for link protection
    and node protection. For link protection, it tunnels traffic to the next-hop using
    the underlying routing. For node protection, it forwards BIER packets to their
    specific next-hop and next-next-hops using tunnels in the underlying routing after
    applying a suitable backup bitmask to the bitstring in the BIER header of each
    packet. This procedure prevents duplicates. If topology allows, BIER-FRR achieves
    full protection against any single component failure. For link protection, BIER-FRR
    requires only a minor change to the forwarding logic. For node protection, BIER-FRR
    also requires backup entries in the BIFT. This document describes the concept
    and operating principles of BIER- FRR. It defines the necessary modifications
    to the BIER forwarding Procedure and the BIFT, and explains how backup entries
    are computed.</p>"
