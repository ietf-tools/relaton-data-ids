abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as
    patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to
    ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information as possible
    about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as early as possible in the
    development process. The policies are intended to benefit the Internet community
    and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.
    This document sets out the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology
    worked on within the IETF. It also describes the objectives that the policies
    are designed to meet. This document updates RFC 2026 and, with RFC 5378, replaces
    Section 10 of RFC 2026. This document also obsoletes RFCs 3979 and 4879.</p>"
