abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is work in progress and defines the basic QoS Package
    that addresses the different means of supporting Quality of service (QoS) on IP
    networks. This memo also defines the RSVP package (that falls into the Integrated
    services model) and the Differentiated services package in association with the
    Megaco/H.248 Protocol that can be used to control a Media Gateway (MG) from an
    external controller, called a Media Gateway controller (MGC). It is intended to
    satisfy the requirements in section 12 of the Megaco/H.248 requirement document
    [2].</p>"
