abstract:
- content: <p>This document analyzes the state of the Internet domain-based routing
    system, concentrating on Inter-Domain Routing (IDR) and also considering the relationship
    between inter-domain and intra-domain routing. The analysis is carried out with
    respect to RFC 1126 and other IDR requirements and design efforts looking at the
    routing system as it appeared to be in 2001 with editorial additions reflecting
    developments up to 2006. It is the companion document to "A Set of Possible Requirements
    for a Future Routing Architecture" (RFC 5772), which is a discussion of requirements
    for the future routing architecture, addressing systems developments and future
    routing protocols. This document summarizes discussions held several years ago
    by members of the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) and other interested
    parties. The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record
    of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not
    necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical
    consensus of the research group at the date of publication. This document defines
    a Historic Document for the Internet community.</p>
