abstract:
- content: "<p>Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network
    domain to manage network resources to create a virtualized network that is under
    the control of a network operator (or perhaps the customer). Network slicing is
    an approach to network operations that builds on the concept of network abstraction
    to provide programmability, flexibility, and modularity. It uses techniques such
    as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
    to create multiple logical (virtual) networks, each tailored for a given use case,
    on top of a common network. These logical networks are referred to as network
    slices. A network slice does not necessarily represent dedicated resources in
    the server network, but does constitute a commitment by the service provider to
    provide a specific level of service. The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered
    Networks (ACTN) defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts
    of network and service abstraction to detach network and service control from
    the underlying data plane. This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to
    network slicing in an IETF technology network. It also identifies the features
    of network slicing not currently within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where
    ACTN might be extended.</p>"
