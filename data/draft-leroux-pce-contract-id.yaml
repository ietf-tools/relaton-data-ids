abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture can be used for
    computing Traffic Engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) that traverse multiple
    Autonomous Systems (AS) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks. This may require communication between PCEs in each AS,
    based upon on the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP). When ASes belong to distinct
    service providers, a per-service negotiation and activation procedure may be required
    before starting PCE based path computation. For the sake of illustration, the
    IPSphere Forum (IPSF) is currently specifying an architecture so as to automate
    the negotiation and activation of such an inter-provider TE LSP service. The result
    of such negotiation is a per-service contract identifier that needs to be carried
    in PCEP, so that PCEs can apply inter-provider path computation policies. For
    that purpose, this draft defines an extension to the PCEP protocol so as to carry
    a contract ID in request messages.</p>"
