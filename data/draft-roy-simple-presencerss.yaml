abstract:
- content: "<p>Web feeds (hereby referred to as 'feed') have always played an important
    role in providing users content related updates of Websites without having to
    visit those websites manually. Typical examples of feed usage include users 'subscribing'
    to the feed of a website (example, CNN.com) and thereby automatically receiving
    'news headlines' when the content changes. Recently, there have been significant
    innovations (example [13][12]) where feeds from different sources have been combined
    to produce new services in a 'Web Based Service Creation Environment' model allowing
    users to create interesting services building on top of 'primitives' that can
    be represented on the Web. This document describes the motivation for a feed for
    Presence information, which the authors believe would be useful to create new
    services using a similar environment described above. NOTE 1: Architecturally,
    it is also possible that the reverse situation, i.e. feed converted to a Presence
    state is also useful, typically for services that could be triggered at the Presentity
    based on certain conditions. However, this document focuses on the former, i.e.
    Presence state to feed. NOTE 2: It is not necessary that each PUA support the
    capability of generating feeds. It is possible that a central aggregation server
    generates the required feed on behalf of the PUAs.</p>"
