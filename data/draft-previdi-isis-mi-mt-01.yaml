abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a mechanism that allows a single router to share
    one or more links among multiple IS-IS routing protocol instances. Multiple instances
    allow the deployment of multiple address-families as well as multiple instances
    of the same address-family and it is an alternative to Multi-Topology IS-IS. Routers
    will form instance specific adjacencies, exchange instance specific routing updates
    and compute paths utilizing instance specific LSDB information. Each PDU will
    contain a new TLV identifying the instance to which the PDU belongs. This allows
    a network operator to deploy multiple IS-IS topologies in parallel, using the
    same set of links when required and still have the capability of computing topology
    specific paths. This draft does not address the forwarding paradigm that needs
    to be used in order to ensure data PDUs are forwarded according to the topology
    to which they belong.</p>"
