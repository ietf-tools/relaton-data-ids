abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient transmission of voice over wireless links requires significant
    engineering effort. Because of the high cost of bandwidth on such links, special
    techniques for compression of voice data and its transmission over the air have
    been developed. The compression techniques and the wireless physical layers have
    been co-designed for maximum spectral efficiency and human perceptual euphony.</p>"
