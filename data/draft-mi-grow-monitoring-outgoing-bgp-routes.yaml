abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] is designed to monitor
    BGP [RFC4271] running status, such as BGP peer relationship establishment and
    termination and route updates. At present, the BMP only monitors the incoming
    bgp routes (Adj-RIB-In), does not monitor the outgoing bgp routes (Adj-RIB-Out).
    This draft extends the applicability of BMP [RFC7854] to monitor the outgoing
    bgp routes.</p>"
