abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a bare bones "index table"-approach for organizing
    a set of ICN data objects into a large, File-Like ICN Collection (FLIC). At the
    core of this collection is a so called manifest which acts as the collection's
    root node. The manifest contains an index table with pointers, each pointer being
    a hash value pointing to either a final data block or another index table node.</p>
