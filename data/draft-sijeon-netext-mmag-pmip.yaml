abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies IP mobility support protocol for moving network
    including mobile nodes (MNs) over Proxy Mobile IPv6 network by introducing a new
    functional entity, mobile MAG (mMAG) on the moving network. The mMAG takes charges
    of MN's movement detection, binding update on behalf of MNs as a mobile access
    gateway (MAG) does in PMIPv6 infrastructure. This protocol also supports IP session
    continuity for a mobile node to move between mobile network and fixed MAG. This
    protocol does not require any modification or extension on the MN.</p>"
