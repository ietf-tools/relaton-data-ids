abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a mechanism for using
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
    (AEAD) to provide cryptographic security for the client-server mode of the Network
    Time Protocol (NTP). NTS is structured as a suite of two loosely coupled sub-protocols:
    the NTS Key Establishment Protocol (NTS-KE) and the NTS Extension Fields for NTPv4.
    NTS-KE handles NTS service authentication, initial handshaking, and key extraction
    over TLS. Encryption and authentication during NTP time synchronization is performed
    through the NTS Extension Fields in otherwise standard NTP packets. Except for
    during the initial NTS-KE process, all state required by the protocol is held
    by the client in opaque cookies.</p>"
