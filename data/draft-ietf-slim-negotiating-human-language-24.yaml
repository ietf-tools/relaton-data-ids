abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human (i.e., natural) language needs, abilities,
    and preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. This document
    defines new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media- level attributes so that
    when establishing interactive communication sessions ("calls"), it is possible
    to negotiate (i.e., communicate and match) the caller's language and media needs
    with the capabilities of the called party. This is especially important for emergency
    calls, because it allows for a call to be handled by a call taker capable of communicating
    with the user or for a translator or relay operator to be bridged into the call
    during setup. However, this also applies to non-emergency calls (for example,
    calls to a company call center). This document describes the need as well as a
    solution that uses new SDP media attributes.</p>
