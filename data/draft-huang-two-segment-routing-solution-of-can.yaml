abstract:
- content: "<p>CAN (Computing Aware Network) is designed to enable the routing network
    to be aware of computing status thus deliver the service flow accordingly. Nevertheless,
    computing and networking is quite different in terms of resource granularity as
    well as its status stability. It would gain significant benefits to accommodate
    the computing status to that of networking by employing a hierarchical computing
    routing segment scheme. The network-accommodated computing status could be maintained
    at remote CAN nodes while the rest could reside at local CAN nodes. By enabling
    the network to schedule and route computing services in a compatible way with
    the current IP routing network, CAN would bring benefits to the industry by both
    efficiently pooling the computing resources and rendering services through perspective
    of converged networking and computing.</p>"
