abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF)
    is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest
    to intrusion detection and response systems and to the management systems that
    may need to interact with them. This document describes a data model to represent
    information exported by intrusion detection systems and explains the rationale
    for using this model. An implementation of the data model in the Extensible Markup
    Language (XML) is presented, an XML Document Type Definition is developed, and
    examples are provided. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
