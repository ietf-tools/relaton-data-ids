abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile SCTP (mSCTP) is defined as SCTP with the ADDIP extension. The
    mSCTP can be used for providing seamless handover by exploiting its multi-homing
    feature. On the other hand, the Mobile IP basically provides the location management.
    In this document, we discuss the use of mSCTP along with Mobile IP for Internet
    mobility support in the transport layer. The use of SCTP with Mobile IP is focused
    on the mobile sessions that are initiated by CN to MN.</p>"
