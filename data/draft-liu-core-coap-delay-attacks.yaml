- content: "<p>Various attacks including delay attack have become a topic in the security
    of Internet of Things (IoT), especially for the constrained nodes utilizing sensors
    and actuators which connect and interact with the physical world. [I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators]
    describes several serious delay attacks, discusses tougher requirements and then
    recommends mechanisms to mitigate the attacks. It also specifies some disadvantages
    with the mechanisms. This document proposes alternative mechanisms to address
    some of the disadvantages</p>"
