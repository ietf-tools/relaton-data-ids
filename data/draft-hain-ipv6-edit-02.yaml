abstract:
- content: <p>There will be IPv4-only applications that remain in use as network managers
    begin deploying IPv6-only networks, or turning off IPv4 in the exiting dual-stack
    networks. These applications require a dual- stack capable host operating system,
    but that OS may find that the local network has not provided on-link IPv4 provisioning
    or routing support for the resulting packets. Skepticism that this situation will
    exist is widespread; because it is easy to ignore the costs someone else will
    incur and focus on the local situation. Taking the system level viewpoint, that
    skepticism makes no sense when it is widely acknowledged that people will resist
    replacing something that is working, particularly when the reason it might artificially
    stop is due to 'someone else's problem'. The reality of IPv4-only applications
    persisting in an IPv6-only provisioned network is specifically ignored by RFC
    4038. This document deals with the situation by defining a new tunneling type
    for use within the edge or leaf network to the border where it interconnects with
    an IPv4 routing domain. The draft is being discussed on the ipv6@ietf.org list.
