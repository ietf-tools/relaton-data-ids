abstract:
- content: '<p>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale
    content delivery. As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure
    and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. There
    is a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so that their collective
    CDN footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content
    Service Providers (CSPs) to end users. The Content Distribution Network Interconnection
    (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable
    solution for such CDN interconnection. The goal of the present document is to
    outline the requirements for the solution and interfaces to be specified by the
    CDNI working group. Requirements Language The key words "Must", "Should" and "May"
    in this document are to be interpreted in the following way: o "Must" indicates
    requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI protocols in the stated scope
    (aka "within initial CDNI scope" or "beyond initial scope"). A requirement is
    stated as a "Must" when it is established by that it can be met without compromising
    the targeted schedule for WG deliverables, or when it is established that specifying
    a solution without meeting this requirement would not make sense and would justify
    re-adjusting the WG schedule, or both. o "Should" indicates requirements that
    are to be supported by the CDNI protocols in the stated scope (aka "within initial
    CDNI scope" or "beyond initial scope") unless the WG realizes at a later stage
    that attempting to meet this requirement would compromise the overall WG schedule
    (for example it would involve complexities that would result in significantly
    delaying the deliverables). o "May" indicates requirements that are to be supported
    by the CDNI protocols in the stated scope (aka "within initial CDNI scope" or
    "beyond initial scope") provided that dedicating WG resources to this work does
    not prevent addressing "Should" and "Must" requirements and that attempting to
    meet this requirement would not compromise the overall WG schedule.</p>'
