abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies several special NAT traversal scenarios when two
    or more LISP Sites/MNs which locate behind the same NAT equipment communicate
    with each other. When these LISP Sites/MNs communicate with each other, it may
    cause routing latency and will increase re- encapsulation load on Re-encapsulating
    Tunnel Routers(RTRs) based on existing LISP-NAT strategy. In this draft, we give
    detail descriptions of these scenarios. Also we propose some suggestions to solve
    the problems. According to our strategy, a new kind of message is used for RTRs
    to send relative information of Corresponding Sites/MNs to xTRs.</p>"
