abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of neighbor graphs as a method for dynamically caching the
    context of mobile stations in front of the station's mobility path can reduce
    the latency of handoff's between base stations or access points. Neighbor graphs
    capture the set of all potential mobility paths for a wireless network. Given
    any base station or access point, the set of all possible hand-offs can easily
    be determined by examining the neighbor graph in either a distributed fashion
    (at each base station) or centralized at the AAA server. This draft describes
    how the neighbor graph algorithm works at both the base station and the AAA server.</p>"
