abstract:
- content: "<p>It is impracticable to deploy new EDNS options, with EDNS version 0,
    on a global scale due to inconsistent server behaviour in deployed servers when
    a EDNS option is present in the query. Most existing EDNS option deployment has
    been small scale between essentially consenting implementations. When EDNS options
    were added to every outgoing recursive query made it became clear that trial and
    error to discover the level of EDNS version 0 support was not practicable. This
    document request that EDNS version 1 be assigned so that consistent well defined
    behaviour can be seen when a EDNS option is present.</p>"
