abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification is currently being
    revised. There are a number of issues that have been identified in the IANA registries
    related to the SDP protocol (These are tracked in the issue tracker). This document
    has the goal of addressing these issues by making the necessary changes in the
    IANA registries and registration procedures. The changes and updates listed in
    this draft are submitted in this individual draft rather than the 4566bis draft
    because (i) the 4566bis draft has seen quite a number of changes recently, which
    require a detailed review and further revisions would make the review process
    difficult, and (ii) the changes and updates listed in this draft are all IANA
    related matters. If this draft gets published separately, it will update RFC 4566
    or the RFC resulting from the 4566bis draft. An alternative option is to include
    the whole text in the 4566bis draft once the changes and updates are agreed.</p>"
