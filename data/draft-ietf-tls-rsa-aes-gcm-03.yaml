abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as a Transport Layer Security (TLS) authenticated
    encryption operation. GCM provides both confidentiality and data origin authentication,
    can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second
    and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations. This memo defines
    TLS cipher suites that use AES-GCM with RSA, DSA, and Diffie-Hellman-based key
    exchange mechanisms. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
