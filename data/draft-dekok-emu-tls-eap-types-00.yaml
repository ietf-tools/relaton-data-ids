abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-TLS [RFC5216] is being updated for TLS 1.3 in [EAPTLS]. Many other
    EAP [RFC3748] and [RFC5247] types also depend on TLS, such as FAST [RFC4851],
    TTLS [RFC5281], TEAP [RFC7170], and possibly many vendor specific EAP methods.
    This document updates those methods in order to use the new key derivation methods
    available in TLS 1.3. Additional changes necessitated by TLS 1.3 are also discussed.</p>"
