abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 unicast addressing format includes a separation between the
    prefix used to route packets to a subnet and the interface identifier used to
    specify a given interface connected to that subnet. Historically the interface
    identifier has been defined as 64 bits long, leaving 64 bits for the prefix. This
    document discusses the reasons for this fixed boundary and the issues involved
    in treating it as a variable boundary.</p>"
