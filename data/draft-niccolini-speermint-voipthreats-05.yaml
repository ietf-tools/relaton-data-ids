abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the different security threats related to SPEERMINT
    classifying them into threats to the Location Function, to the Signaling Function
    and to the Media Function. The different instances of the threats are briefly
    introduced inside the classification. Finally the existing security solutions
    in SIP and RTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently available
    for such threats. The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate
    the SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors in order to specify security-related requirements.
    Once the requirements are identified, methods and solutions how to achieve such
    requirements can be selected.</p>"
