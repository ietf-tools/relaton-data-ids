abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a lightweight mechanism for signaling a PE router's
    capability to encapsulate MPLS using dynamic GRE and/or IP. This is applicable
    when a MPLS packet is tunnelled using a dynamic GRE and/or IP encapsulation [MPLS-IP-GRE]
    between PE routers. For instance the MPLS packet may be a 2547 based MPLS VPN
    packet [2547bis] or a layer 2 packet transported using MPLS [MARTINI]. Adding
    such a mechanism has several benefits. It helps in blackhole avoidance and eases
    transitioning from MPLS tunneling based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs to GRE/IP tunneling
    based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs (and vice versa). Such a mechanism is needed where
    a network may be using MPLS and GRE (or IP) for tunneling, at the same time, in
    2547 based or Layer 2 VPNs. It can help in encapsulation selection when multiple
    tunneling technologies are supported. It can also be used to enhance the security
    of the network backbone.</p>"
