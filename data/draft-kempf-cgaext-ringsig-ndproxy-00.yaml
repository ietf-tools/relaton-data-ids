abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3971 and 3972 (SEND) define a protocol for securing resolution
    of a statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 address to a link address as defined by IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery. SEND does this by requiring the autoconfigured addresses to
    be cryptographically generated by the host from an RSA public key. However, one
    drawback of SEND is that such addresses cannot be securely proxied. Proxy Neighbor
    Discovery is important for Mobile IPv6 and in certain other cases. In this document,
    we describe an extension of SEND to addresses that are cryptographically generated
    using multiple public keys, called multi-key CGAs. Neighbor Discovery messages
    for multi- key CGAs are signed with an RSA ring signature, a type of signature
    that can be generated using the private key of any node from a group of nodes
    but which requires the public keys of all group members to verify. Multi-key CGAs
    can be securely proxied by all nodes that contribute keys to the address. The
    advantage of multi-key CGAs over other techniques of secure address proxying,
    such as trusting the router or using an attribute certificate, is that it preserves
    location privacy. A receiver cannot determine from the IPv6 address, ring signature,
    or cryptographic parameters whether the node or the proxy is defending the address,
    and hence whether the node is on or off the link.</p>"
