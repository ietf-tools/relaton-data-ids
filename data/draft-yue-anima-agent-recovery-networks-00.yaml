abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a task-oriented, agent-based method for fault
    recovery in converged public-private mobile networks. The proposed method introduces
    a multi-agent collaboration framework that enables autonomous failure detection,
    scoped diagnosis, inter-domain coordination, and intent-driven policy reconfiguration.
    It is particularly applicable in complex 5G/6G network deployments, such as Multi-Operator
    Core Networks (MOCN) and Standalone Non-Public Networks (SNPN), where traditional
    centralized management is insufficient for ensuring high service reliability and
    dynamic recovery. The document also specifies protocol requirements for inter-agent
    communication, state consistency, and secure coordination, aiming to support interoperability
    and resilience across heterogeneous network domains.</p>"
