abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational document describes and identifies the requirements
    for a profile of a certificate management protocol to handle Public Key Certificate
    (PKC) lifecycle interactions between Internet Protocol Secuity (IPsec) Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) Systems using IKE (versions 1 and 2) and Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) Systems. These requirements are designed so that they meet the needs of
    enterprise scale IPsec VPN deployments. It is intended that a standards track
    profile will be created that fulfills these requirements</p>"
