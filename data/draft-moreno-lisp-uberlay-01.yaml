abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the use of the Locator/ID Separation Protocol
    (LISP) to interconnect multiple disparate and independent network overlays by
    using a transit overlay. The transit overlay is referred to as the "uberlay" and
    provides connectivity and control plane abstraction between different overlays.
    Each network overlay may use different control and data plane approaches and may
    be managed by a different organization. Structuring the network into multiple
    network overlays enables the interworking of different overlay approaches to data
    and control plane methods. The different network overlays are autonomous from
    a control and data plane perspective, this in turn enables failure survivability
    across overlay domains. This document specifies the mechanisms and procedures
    for the distribution of control plane information across overlay sites and in
    the uberlay as well as the lookup and forwarding procedures for unicast and multicast
    traffic within and across overlays. The specification also defines the procedures
    to support inter-overlay mobility of EIDs and their integration with the intra-overlay
    EID mobility procedures defined in draft-ietf-lisp-eid-mobility.</p>
