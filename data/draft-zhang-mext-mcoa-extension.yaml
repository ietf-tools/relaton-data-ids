abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multiple Care-of Addresses Registration [2] is a useful protocol
    which allows a mobile node to get Internet access through multiple accesses simultaneously,
    in which case the mobile node would be configured with multiple active IPv6 care-of
    addresses. It proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv6 protocol to register and
    use multiple care-of addresses with the Binding Identifier Mobility Option. This
    document describes a simple extension to Binding Identifier Mobility Option to
    allow mobile node to select the most wanted link for the ongoing service.</p>"
