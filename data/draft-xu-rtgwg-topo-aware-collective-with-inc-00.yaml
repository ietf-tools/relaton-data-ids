abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, the mapping mechanism between the logical and physical
    topology of collective communication is analysed in In- Network Computing(INC)
    enabled network, as well as the impact of topology-aware collective communication
    algorithms on INC enabled large-scale computing clusters. Requirements are also
    proposed to design efficient mapping mechanism between logical and physical topology
    and topology-aware collective communication algorithms.</p>"
