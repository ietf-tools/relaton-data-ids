abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Node and Link Attribute TLVs to Border Gateway
    Protocol-Link State (BGP-LS) to advertise supported In-situ Flow Information Telemetry
    (IFIT) capabilities at node and/or link granularity. An ingress router cannot
    insert IFIT-Data-Fields for packets going into a path unless an egress router
    has indicated via signaling that it has the capability to process IFIT-Data-Fields.
    In addition, such advertisements would be useful for entities (e.g. Path Computation
    Element (PCE)) to gather each router's IFIT capability for achieving the computation
    of end-to-end Traffic Engineering (TE) paths that be able to fulfill the visibility
    of on- path OAM data.</p>"
