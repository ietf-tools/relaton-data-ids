abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper is a direct result, necessitated by the correction of the
    mathematical anomaly that plague IPv4. Whose resolution also proposed an end to
    the disparities resulting from a shortage of available IP Addresses. However,
    the proposal did not seem to garner the unfledging support through the suggestion
    of an alternate IP system of addressing. Which is nothing more than an exploitation
    of the present IPv4 system. As presented in the paper entitled; 'The Mathematical
    Reality of IP Addressing in IPv4 Questions the need for Another IP System of Addressing'.
    Needless to say, it is thought that a greater clarification of the underlining
    foundation of this subject matter is that which is needed. Notwithstanding my
    personal beliefs, that the promises made by the IT Industry itself, will not be
    forth coming if an adequate IP System of Addressing is not employed. Nor the mention
    of the hidden cost the consumer is expected to pay, which is a direct result of
    their knowledge regarding a clear understanding of our present technology, and
    the ability of the Technology to the IT Industry, which could reduce the overall
    cost today. All while fulfilling of the promises they made to the consumer, which
    becomes the reality of a future which benefits all mankind.</p>"
