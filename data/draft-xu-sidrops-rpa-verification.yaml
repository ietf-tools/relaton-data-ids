abstract:
- content: "<p>The Route Path Authorizations (RPA) is an RPKI object that attests
    to the complete routing paths description which an Autonomous System (AS) would
    obey in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagation. This document specifies
    an RPA-based AS Path Verification methodology to mitigate, even solve, AS Path
    forgery and route leaks. This document also explains the various BGP security
    threats that RPA can help address and provides operational considerations associated
    with RPA deployment.</p>"
