abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Security Architecture is intended to be a guide for designing
    and implementing protocols for use in the Internet. The Architecture was begun
    by the Privacy and Security Research Group (PSRG) of the Internet Research Task
    Force (IRTF). It is ongoing effort of the PSRG in cooperation with the Security
    Directorate of the IETF. This draft presents Section 1 of the Architecture. Section
    1 explains why the Architecture is needed, describes its scope, reviews networking
    and security concepts and terms, and states architectural principles for Internet
    security. Section 2 will discusses security services in networks, and Section
    3 will discuss security mechanisms. Section 4 will discuss the correspondence
    between security services, security mechanisms, and protocol layers, explaining
    each service placement. Section 5 will describe the security status of the Internet
    suite of protocols, covering seven functional areas: network and transport, intra-domain
    routing, inter-domain routing, infrastructure services, remote processing, and
    applications. Section 6 will describe how to deploy available security technology
    in five scenarios of increasing complexity.</p>"
