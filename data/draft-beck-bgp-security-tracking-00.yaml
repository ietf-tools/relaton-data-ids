abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the BGP Path Security Tracking attribute, an
    extension to BGP-4. This attribute provides a transitive means for networks to
    indicate BGP security checks in place to upstream networks. Upstream networks
    can optionally use that information to modify the path selection algorithm giving
    preference to paths reporting better security where the prefix length is the same
    and as-path length is similar. Effectively reporting no security would be treated
    the same as prepending the announcement once and reporting strong security would
    be treated the same as not prepending. The net result of using the information
    to influence path selection is that more secured paths would be preferred over
    less secured paths.</p>"
