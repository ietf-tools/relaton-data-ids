abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal introduces a new BGP attribute that can be used by BGP
    routers to advertise their capability to support any kind of host liveliness checking
    protocols (for example BFD). This attribute can be used to avoid black-holes scenarios
    seen when BGP next-hop is not the peer, in particular on Internet eXchange Points
    (IXPs) implementing BGP Route-Servers. IXP member routers can exchange their capability
    to implement a given host liveliness checking Foreword A placeholder to list general
    observations about this document.</p>"
