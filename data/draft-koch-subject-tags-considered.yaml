- content: "<p>Various mailing lists modify the Subject: header field of messages
    sent to the list to contain a kind of identifier enclosed in square brackets.
    Every now and then this 'feature' is also requested for the main IETF list. This
    document collects pros and cons of this approach, tries to identify the real issue
    and will, in a later stage, try to give a recommendation.</p>"
