abstract:
- content: "<p>This likely involves a new TCP/IP standard. I'm not so technical to
    know if it's feasible or informed to know if it exists (perhaps in IPv6), or is
    proposed. But simply put, in addition to the numbered range of ports used now
    for IP services like ssh, http, etc., in the interest of security, arbitrary named
    ports could be used e.g. http://foo.bar.net:mooky, or telnet 0 thisone, further
    these named ports could be encrypted strings.</p>"
