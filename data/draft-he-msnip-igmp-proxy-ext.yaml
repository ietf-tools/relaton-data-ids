abstract:
- content: "<p>IGMP Proxying can be used to forward multicast data traffic in certain
    network topologies. Due to the limitation of the IGMP Proxying, a Proxy has to
    forward multicast packets received from downstream interfaces to upstream interface.
    In this document, we proposed a solution to solve this inefficiency by using an
    extension to MSNIP.</p>"
