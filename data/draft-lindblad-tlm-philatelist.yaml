abstract:
- content: "<p>Timestamped telemetry data is collected en masse today. Mature tools
    are typically used, but the data is often collected in an ad hoc manner. While
    the dashboard graphs look great, the resulting data is often of questionable quality,
    not well defined, and hard to compare with seemingly similar data from other organizations.
    This document proposes a standard, extensible, cross domain framework for collecting
    and aggregating timestamped telemetry data in a way that combines YANG, metadata
    and Time Series Databases to produce more dependable and comparable results.</p>"
