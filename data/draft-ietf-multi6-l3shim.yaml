abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a particular approach to IPv6 multihoming. The
    approach is based on using a multi6 shim placed between the IP endpoint sublayer
    and the IP routing sublayer, and, at least initially, using routable IP locators
    as the identifiers visible above the shim layer. The approach does not introduce
    a "stack name" type of identifier, instead it ensures that all upper layer protocols
    can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while still seeing a stable IPv6
    address.</p>
