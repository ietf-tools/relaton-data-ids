abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the GMA (Generic Multi-Access) traffic splitting
    control algorithm. The receiving endpoint measures one- way-delay, round-trip
    time, and delivery rate for multiple connections and determines how a data flow
    is split across them. When update is needed, it will send out a control message,
    aka Traffic Splitting Update (TSU), to notify the transmitting endpoint of the
    new traffic splitting configuration. Compared to other sender-based multi-path
    transport protocols, e.g. MPTCP, MPQUIC, the GMA traffic splitting algorithm is
    receiver-based and does not require per-packet feedback, e.g. Ack. It is designed
    specifically to support the Generic Multi-Access (GMA) convergence protocol as
    introduced in [MAMS] [GMA]. The solution has been developed by the authors based
    on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including IETF and 3GPP, is
    not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.</p>"
