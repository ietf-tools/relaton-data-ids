abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM as defined in RFC6376 is an IETF standard of cryptographically
    signing email with a domain key. DKIM is widely used to build a reputation based
    on the signing domain and assign that reputation to message filtering. Section
    8.6 defines a vulnerability called DKIM replay, in which a single message can
    be replayed to a large group of unrelated recipients, thereby hijacking the reputation
    of the original sender. This proposal defines a method of declaring the original
    envelope sender and recipient(s) within a DKIM signature such that compliant DKIM
    validators can detect a DKIM signature which may have been replayed and modify
    their use of domain reputation accordingly. This technique remains fully backwards
    compatible with DKIM validators which do not support the new methods, while allowing
    compliant forwarders to declare their ingress authentication state in Authentication
    Results headers for consumption by subsequent validators.</p>"
