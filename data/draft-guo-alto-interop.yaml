abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed
    to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such
    information to applications, with the goal of modifying network resource consumption
    patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. This document
    provides a framework that contains data structures, configurations, and message
    templates, to test the functionality and interoperability of an ALTO client and
    an ALTO server.</p>"
