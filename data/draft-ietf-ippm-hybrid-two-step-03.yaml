abstract:
- content: "<p>The development and advancements in network operation automation have
    brought new measurement methodology requirements. mong them is the ability to
    collect instant network state as the packet being processed by the networking
    elements along its path through the domain. That task can be solved using on-path
    telemetry, also called hybrid measurement. An on-path telemetry method allows
    the collection of essential information that reflects the operational state and
    network performance experienced by the packet. This document introduces a method
    complementary to on-path telemetry that causes the generation of telemetry information.
    This method, referred to as Hybrid Two-Step (HTS), separates the act of measuring
    and/or calculating the performance metric from collecting and transporting network
    state. The HTS packet traverses the same set of nodes and links as the trigger
    packet, thus simplifying the correlation of informational elements originating
    on nodes traversed by the trigger packet.</p>"
