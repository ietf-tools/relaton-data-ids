abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for combining a traditional MLS
    session with a post-quantum (PQ) MLS session to achieve flexible and efficient
    hybrid PQ security that amortizes the computational cost of PQ Key Encapsulation
    Mechanisms and Digital Signature Algorithms. Specifically, we describe how to
    use the exporter secret of a PQ MLS session, i.e. an MLS session using a PQ ciphersuite,
    to seed PQ guarantees into an MLS session using a traditional ciphersuite. By
    supporting on-demand traditional-only key updates (a.k.a. PARTIAL updates) or
    hybrid-PQ key updates (a.k.a. FULL updates), we can reduce the bandwidth and computational
    overhead associated with PQ operations while meeting the requirement of frequent
    key rotations.</p>"
