abstract:
- content: '<p>The size of the global routing table is a rapidly growing problem.
    Several solutions have been proposed. These solutions commonly divide the Internet
    into two address spaces, one for determining the delivery location, and one to
    use during transit. Packets destined for delivery addresses are tunneled through
    the default-free zone (DFZ), which uses only transit addresses. For this process
    to work, there must be a mapping service that can supply an appropriate destination
    transit address for any given delivery address. We present a design for such a
    mapping service. We adhere to a "do no harm" design philosophy: maintain all desirable
    features of the current architecture without negatively affecting its security
    or reliability. Our design aims to minimize delay and prevent loss in packet encapsulation,
    minimize the number of modifications to existing hardware, minimize the number
    of new devices, and keep the level of control traffic manageable.</p>'
