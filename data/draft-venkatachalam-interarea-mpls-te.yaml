abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose an architecture for the inter-area LSP setup
    based on a combination of constraints. We derive the architectural requirements
    for the routing protocols, signaling protocols and the MIBs to support such an
    idea. We also demonstrate how such a mechanism will reduce the crankback during
    LSP setup. A possible outline of the modifications to the CSPF algorithm and examples
    are presented. In the companion document [INTER_AREA_EXT] we elaborate on the
    extensions required for such architecture.</p>"
