abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths,
    called "segments". These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols
    (IS-IS and OSPF). And a segment is identified by a Segment Routing ID (SID). This
    document proposes a method to reduce the SID configuration in a SR domain. Only
    the selected SR nodes which named Segment Routing Management Nodes (SRMNs) are
    configured by NMS, while other SRs in the domain need zero-SR-configuration.</p>
