abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this document is to propose a mechanism for the reoptimization
    of MPLS Traffic Engineering loosely routed explicit LSP paths. A loosely routed
    explicit LSP path is a path specified as a combination of strict and loose hop(s)
    that contains at least one loose hop and zero or more strict hop(s). The path
    calculation (which implies ERO expansion) to reach a loose hop is made on the
    previous hop defined in the TE LSP path. This draft proposes a mechanism that
    allows: - The TE LSP Head-end LSR to trigger a new ERO expansion on every hop
    having a next hop defined as a loose hop, - An LSR to signal to the TE LSP head-end
    that a better path exists to reach a loose hop (than the current path in use).
    A better path is defined as a path with a lower cost, where the cost is determined
    by the metric used to compute the path. This primarily applies to inter-area TE
    LSPs and inter-AS TE LSPs when the path is defined as a list of loose hops (generally
    the loose hops are the ABRs/ASBRs) but the following mechanism is also applicable
    to any loosely routed explicit path within a single routing domain.</p>"
