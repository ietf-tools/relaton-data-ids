abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 addressing architecture specifies formats for unicast addresses,
    but provides no operational guidelines for their use. There is a clear need for
    IPv6 to support organizational-scope communications whether members of the organization
    are located in the same site or different sites. Aspects of certain types of sites
    introduce challenges for supporting organizational-scope communications. Of special
    interest are nomadic sites, e.g., sites that are intermittently-connected or disconnected
    from the global Internet, sites that frequently change provider points of attachment,
    sites that temporarily or permanently merge with other sites, etc. This memo will
    discuss scenarios and goals for IPv6 support organizational-scope communications.</p>"
