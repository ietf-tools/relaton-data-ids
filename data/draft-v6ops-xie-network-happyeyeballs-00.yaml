abstract:
- content: "<p>During the period of IPv6 transition, both ISP and ICP (Internet Content
    Provider) care about user's experience in dual-stack network. They hesitate to
    provide IPv6 to their users due to the fear of poor IPv6 performance. Network-based
    Happy Eyeballs (NHE) is proposed in this memo as a approach to provide better
    connectivity to end users by doing accurate measurement and comparison on IPv6/IPv4
    performance on the network side other than client-side Happy Eyeballs (HE) ([RFC8305]).
    It works independently with client's adoption of HE. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION:
    The source of the document with test script is currently placed at GitHub [NHE-GitHub].
    Comments and pull request are welcome.</p>"
