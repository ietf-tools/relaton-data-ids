abstract:
- content: "<p>When network address translation (NAT) is used in an address resource
    restricted environment, or when a lot of users are located under a NAT device,
    IP addresses and port resources may be eaten up, and this affects user experiences
    very negatively. This situation can be greatly mitigated by tweaking mapping behavior
    and session timer handling in NAT functions. This document proposes extension
    for optimizing NAT IP address and port resources in address resource restricted
    environments. The extension enables simultaneous use of a NAT external port for
    different transport sessions.</p>"
