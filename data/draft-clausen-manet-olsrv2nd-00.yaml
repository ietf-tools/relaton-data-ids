abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the neighborhood discovery protocol for the
    Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2. The protocol provides each node
    with local topology up to two hops distance, describing a node's 1-hop neighbors
    and symmetric 2-hop neighbors. This is achieved through periodic message exchange.
    The neighborhood discovery protocol may be used by other MANET protocols which
    need neighborhood information. The protocol imposes minimum requirements to the
    network by not requiring sequenced or reliable transmission of control traffic.</p>"
