abstract:
- content: "<p>[IKE] allows a device to set up a secure session by using a bidirectional
    authentication method using either pre-shared keys or digital certificates. However
    [IKE] does not provide a method to leverage legacy authentication methods which
    are widely deployed today. This document describes a method for using existing
    unidirectional authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS, SecurID, and OTP within
    IPSec's ISAKMP protocol. The purpose of this draft is not to replace or enhance
    the existing authentication mechanisms described in [IKE], but rather to allow
    them to be extended using legacy authentication mechanisms.</p>"
