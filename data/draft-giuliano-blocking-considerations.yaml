abstract:
- content: "<p>Geopolitical conflicts can cause policy makers to question whether
    or not blocking the Internet connectivity for an opposing region is a constructive
    tactic. This document provides an overview of the various technologies that can
    be used to implement regional blocking of Internet connectivity and discusses
    the implications of these options. This document does not advocate any policy
    or given blocking mechanism, but does attempt to articulate the implications of
    these blocking technologies for policy makers. The document also intends to help
    inform policy makers from countries who could be exposed to such blocking techniques
    on the implications of these methods.</p>"
