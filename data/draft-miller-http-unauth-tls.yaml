abstract:
- content: "<p>With the pervasiveness of passive monitoring and ubiquity of unencrypted
    Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP), it is desirable to mitigate passive monitoring
    without causing an undue burden on HTTP user agents and servers. This document
    describes the rationale and process for using Transport Layer Security (TLS) in
    an unauthenticated manner for exchanging HTTP messages. The application of unauthenticated
    TLS - particularly when Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) algorithms are used - change
    monitoring from being a passive attack into an active attack.</p>"
