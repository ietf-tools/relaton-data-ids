abstract:
- content: <p>There can be M2M scenarios where responses from server against requests
    from client might be considered redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with
    no response path from the server to the client) may be desired to minimize resource
    consumption in constrained systems while simultaneously updating a bulk of resources
    or updating a resource with a very high frequency. CoAP already provides a non-confirmable
    (NON) mode of message exchange where the server end-point does not respond with
    ACK. However, obeying the request/response semantics, the server end-point responds
    back with a status code indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and
    satisfy the request". This draft introduces a header option for CoAP called 'No-Response'.
    Using this option the client explicitly tells the server to suppress responses
    against the particular request. This option also provides granular control to
    enable suppression of a particular class or a combination of response-classes.
    This option may be effective for both unicast and multicast requests. Present
    draft also discusses few exemplary applications which benefit from this option.</p>
