abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies extensions to e-mail and netnews standards, to
    allow for the submission of translations of messages, not only at initial submission
    time, but also at later time, and made by other translators than the original
    author of the message. Three new e-mail/netnews header fields are proposed, 'Content-Translation-Of',
    'Content- Translator' and 'Translation-Request'.</p>"
