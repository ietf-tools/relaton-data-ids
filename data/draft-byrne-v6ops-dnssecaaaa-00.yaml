abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS64 is a widely deployed technology allowing hundreds of millions
    of IPv6-only hosts to reach IPv4-only resources. DNSSEC is a technology used to
    validate the authenticity of information in the DNS. Currently, there are scenarios
    where DNS64 and DNSSEC do not work well together. This document states that any
    DNSSEC signed resources record should include a native IPv6 resource record as
    the most complete and expedient path to solve any deployment conflict with DNS64
    and DNSSEC.</p>"
