abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
    public-key algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). The ECC algorithms
    support the creation of digital signatures and the exchange of keys to encrypt
    or authenticate content. The definition of the algorithm processing is based on
    the ANSI X9.62 standard, developed by the ANSI X9F1 working group, the IEEE 1363
    standard, and the SEC 1 standard. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
