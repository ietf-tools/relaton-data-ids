    networking solutions. However, routing loops may occur when route are imported
    to an instance from another and cause critical problem. This document provides
    a way to detect routing loop and introduces new sub-TLVs to support advertisement
    IPv4 and IPv6 prefix extended attribute flags and the source router ID of the
    router which import the route and redistribute the route.</p>"
