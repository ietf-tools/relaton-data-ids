abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 describes how a Mobile Node can change its point of attachment
    to the Internet. While MIPv6 focuses on unicast communications, it also proposes
    two basic mechanisms, known as bidirectionnal tunneling and remote subscription,
    to handle multicast communications with mobile members. In the mean time, the
    deployment of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) is of great consideration, using
    the PIM-SM and MLDv2 protocols.</p>"
