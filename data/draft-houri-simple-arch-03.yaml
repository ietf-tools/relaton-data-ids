abstract:
- content: "<p>This document collects information required for the creation a complete
    Presence and IM system using SIMPLE and other IETF protocols. This information
    has been spread out across numerous other internet drafts and RFCs. The document
    tries to put everything together, discussing the servers involved, security mechanisms,
    call flows, etc. The goal of this document is that someone, who is not an expert
    in the IETF protocols, can read this document and understand how the IETF protocols
    can be used for building a complete system and how it should work. SPECIFCATIONS
    SECTION TO BE UPDATED SHORTLY</p>"
