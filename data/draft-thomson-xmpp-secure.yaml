abstract:
- content: "<p>The history of secure messaging in XMPP is spotty. The long-running
    de facto scheme, OTR, enjoys fairly wide implementation and use, but OTR suffers
    from some serious usability and security shortcomings that make it unsuitable
    as a basis for encryption. This document describes an architecture that provides
    end-to-end confidentiality and integrity for XMPP messaging. Solutions for both
    multi-user and one-to-one messaging are provided.</p>"
