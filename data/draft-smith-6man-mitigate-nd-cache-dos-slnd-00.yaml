abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 neighbor discovery cache is vulernable to a Denial of Service
    attack that purposely exhausts the state used during the neighbor discovery address
    resolution process. This can be very disruptive when a router is successfully
    attacked. This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor discovery to be used
    by routers to eliminate the opportunity for this DoS attack. This method of stateless
    neighbor discovery would be used for unknown or untrusted packet sources, when
    the router's neighbor cache's state capacity reaches a medium to high threshold
    of use. Trusted packet sources would continue to be provided with traditional
    stateful neighbor discovery.</p>"
