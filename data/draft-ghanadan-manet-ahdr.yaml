abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Adaptive Hybrid Domain Routing (AHDR) protocol.
    It describes the parts of the protocol that are required of all implementations
    as well as optional requirements that each implementation may include. AHDR allows
    router nodes to form far- reaching ad-hoc networks, especially in wireless environments.
    AHDR uses a combination of proactive and reactive routing schemes to be responsive
    to topology changes without incurring high protocol overhead. AHDR adapts to network
    conditions in order to minimize network overhead and maximize network reachability.</p>"
