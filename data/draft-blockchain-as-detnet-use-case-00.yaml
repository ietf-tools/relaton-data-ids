abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft brings blockchain into the detnet use case list. Generally
    speaking, blockchain is both a technical term and a blockchain-based industry,
    which is spreading into a wide range of industries other than the thriving bitcoin.
    Blockchain would have to require the supporting network offer deterministic networking
    service rather than the ongoing best-effort, because of its inherent p2p and frequent
    multicast working mechanism. Blockchain working process, its current network mechanism
    and challenges ahead, as well as requirements to detnet will be illustrated in
    the draft.</p>"
