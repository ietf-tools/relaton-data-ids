abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard
    ITU-T Recommendation H.266 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23090-3, both also
    known as Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and developed by the Joint Video Experts
    Team (JVET). The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network
    Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation
    of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets. The payload format has wide applicability
    in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality
    video, among others.</p>"
