abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam
    and attach to different access networks without disrupting the ongoing sessions
    that nodes of the mobile network may have. By extending the Mobile IPv6 support
    to Mobile Routers, nodes of the mobile network are not required to support any
    kind of mobility, since packets go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA)
    bi- directional tunnel. Data packets belonging to communications of nodes of the
    mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent, and therefore resulting paths
    are likely to be suboptimal. Additionally, the solution adds packet overhead,
    due to the use of encapsulation between the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.
    There are currently a set of well defined NEMO Route Optimization requirements
    for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration, which potential solutions
    should meet. This document analyses how the problem of NEMO RO for Aeronautics
    Mobile Networks might be tackled, in a way as generic as possible, trying to identify
    those open questions and deployment considerations that need to be addressed.
    The main goal of this document is to foster the discussion about aeronautics NEMO
    RO solution space within the MEXT WG.</p>"
