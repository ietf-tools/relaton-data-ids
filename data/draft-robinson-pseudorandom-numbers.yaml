- content: <p>This document provides a set of several thousand standardized hexadecimal
    pseudorandom values for use in creating repeatable sequences of so-called "random"
    numbers for various purposes. It can also provide a set of seed values for encryption
    or compression programs or any other use of a large set of numbers. It also provides
    a reference listing for the MD5 and CRC values of all prior published on-line
    Internet RFCs. Distribution of this memo is unlimited and unrestricted. Reproduction
