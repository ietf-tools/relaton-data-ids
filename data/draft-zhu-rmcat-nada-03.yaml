abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme named network-assisted dynamic adaptation
    (NADA), a novel congestion control approach for interactive real-time media applications,
    such as video conferencing. In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending
    rate based on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified approach.
    The scheme can benefit from explicit congestion notification (ECN) markings from
    network nodes. It also maintains consistent sender behavior in the absence of
    such markings, by reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead. We present
    here the overall system architecture, recommended behaviors at the sender and
    the receiver, as well as expected network node operations. Results from extensive
    simulation studies of the proposed scheme are available upon request.</p>"
