abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Group Security Association Management (GSAM)
    protocol, which manages the IPsec Group Security Associations that are used to
    protect some packets of Secure IGMP (SIGMP) and Secure MLD (SMLD). In GSAM, one
    router is elected as the group controller / key server to create group security
    associations for all the interesting secure groups and distribute them to authorized
    users and other routers.</p>"
