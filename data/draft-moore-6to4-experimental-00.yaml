abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo explains why the 6to4 specifications are being reclassified
    as Experimental protocols. It also makes recommendations for limiting the scope
    of continued use of 6to4 for those wishing to use it. These recommendations are
    being made in light of decreasing applicability of 6to4 and of operational problems
    associated with its use.</p>"
