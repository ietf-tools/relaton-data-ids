abstract:
- content: "<p>The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and defines
    the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices. 6top defines
    a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH schedule. To realize the full
    functionality of sensor networks and allow their adoption and use in real applications
    we need additional mechanisms. Specifically, the interaction with 6top, control
    and modify schedules, monitor parameters etc must be defined. Higher layers monitoring
    and management entities are then able to use these capabilities to create feedback
    loops. Although, there have been many custom implementations of such feedback
    loops between the routing, transport and MAC layers in sensor network deployments,
    there has been a lack of standards based approaches. This draft defines the messaging
    between monitoring and management entities and the 6top layer and a mapping to
    the 6top commands. The document also presents a particular implementation of the
    generic data model specified in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface] based on CoAP
    and CBOR.</p>"
