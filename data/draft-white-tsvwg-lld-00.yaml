- content: '<p>NOTE: This document is a reformatted version of [LLD-white-paper].
    The evolution of the bandwidth capabilities - from kilobits per second to gigabits
    - across generations of DOCSIS cable broadband technology has paved the way for
    the applications that today form our digital lives. Along with increased bandwidth,
    or "speed", the latency performance of DOCSIS technology has also improved in
    recent years. Although it often gets less attention, latency performance contributes
    as much or more to the broadband experience and the feasibility of future applications
    as does speed. Low Latency DOCSIS technology (LLD) is a specification developed
    by CableLabs in collaboration with DOCSIS vendors and cable operators that tackles
    the two main causes of latency in the network: queuing delay and media acquisition
    delay. LLD introduces an approach wherein data traffic from applications that
    aren''t causing latency can take a different logical path through the DOCSIS network
    without getting hung up behind data from applications that are causing latency,
    as is the case in today''s Internet architectures. This mechanism doesn''t interfere
    with the way applications share the total bandwidth of the connection, and it
    doesn''t reduce one application''s latency at the expense of others. In addition,
    LLD improves the DOCSIS upstream media acquisition delay with a faster request-grant
    loop and a new proactive scheduling mechanism. LLD makes the internet experience
    better for latency sensitive applications without any negative impact on other
    applications. The latest generation of DOCSIS equipment that has been deployed
    in the field - DOCSIS 3.1 - experiences typical latency performance of around
    10 milliseconds (ms) on the Access Network link. However, under heavy load, the
    link can experience delay spikes of 100 ms or more. LLD systems can deliver a
    consistent 1 ms delay on the DOCSIS network for traffic that isn''t causing latency,
    imperceptible for nearly all applications. The experience will be more consistent
    with much smaller delay variation. LLD can be deployed by field-upgrading DOCSIS
    3.1 cable modem and cable modem termination system devices with new software.
    The technology includes tools that enable automatic provisioning of these new
    services, and it also introduces new tools to report statistics of latency performance
    to the operator. Cable operators, DOCSIS equipment manufacturers, and application
    providers will all have to act in order to take advantage of LLD. This white paper
    explains the technology and describes the role that each of these parties plays
    in making LLD a reality.</p>'
