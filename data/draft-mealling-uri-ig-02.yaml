abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper is the product of the W3C URI Interest Group. It addresses
    and attempts to clarify two issues pertaining to URIs, and presents recommendations.
    Section 1 addresses how URI space is partitioned and the relationship between
    URIs, URLs, and URNs. Section 2 describes how URI schemes and URN namespace ids
    are registered. Section 3 mentions additional unresolved issues not considered
    by this paper and section 4 presents recommendations. Questions concerning this
    document should be directed to the uri@w3.org mailing list.</p>"
