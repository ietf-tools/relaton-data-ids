abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes extensions to the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol(SCTP) [RFC2960] and the "Dynamic Address Reconfiguration" [draft-ietf-tsvwg-addip-sctp].
    In this proposal, we propose changes to the way ASCONF's are handled and bundled
    to allow multiple ASCONF's to be sent during times of disconnected connectivity.
    This then allows a method which allows the retransmit of multiple ASCONF chunk
    within a single packet to better support reliable handover.</p>
