abstract:
- content: "<p>Overlay routing technologies (a.k.a. peer-to-peer technologies) have
    been introduced to various distributed systems, such as content delivery networks
    and live media streaming systems. However, these systems cannot always utilize
    optimal network resources from the viewpoint of layer 3 network providers and
    operators of layer 3 network providers have difficulties in controlling and optimizing
    the traffic of these systems because these systems construct their own networks
    (i.e., overlay networks) over the layer 3 network without taking into account
    layer 3 network's routing policies. The ALTO Working Group has worked on application-layer
    traffic optimization to fill the gaps in routing policies between the layer 3
    network and overlay networks by providing the underlay network topology and cost
    information to applications that build overlay networks. However, since ASes are
    operated under different policies and cost metrics for application-layer traffic
    optimization are assumed to be autonomously configured by each AS, there are considerations
    in applying application-layer traffic optimization techniques to cross-domain
    (inter-AS) traffic. This document summarizes general problems with cross-domain
    traffic of overlay networks and considerations on the AS-level application-layer
    traffic optimization from the viewpoint of inter-AS economics. This document also
    discusses the conceivable approaches to solve the problems and considerations.</p>"
