abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the CLIENTID extension to IMAP. IMAP CLIENTID
    allows an IMAP client to identify itself to the IMAP server, which allows the
    IMAP server to store data specific to an individual IMAP client. The solution
    includes two new mechanisms. One to request a new Client-ID, and another to disclose
    the Client-ID to the IMAP server, which in turn initializes the client environment.</p>"
