abstract:
- content: "<p>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) is an XML-based language
    that can be used to specify rules for the execution of Web services in general
    and OPES content services in particular. OPES services are a new class of applications
    running on network intermediaries, such as caches, proxies, gateways, etc. or
    dedicated (callout) servers. They are invoked through intermediaries acting on
    behalf of application endpoints. IRML is designed to serve as a simple and efficient,
    but yet powerful language to express the service execution policies of application
    endpoints. IRML rules are typically processed by intermediaries that trigger the
    execution of OPES services according to these rules and policies.</p>"
