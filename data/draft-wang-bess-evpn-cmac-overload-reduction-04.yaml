abstract:
- content: "<p>When PBB EVPN [RFC7623] is used in Segment Routing networks, it is
    complicated to make use of the SID list to carry a function that is aiming for
    C-MACs. In [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], End.DX2 function is defined,
    this function can be used in EVPN VPLS. When it is used in EVPN VPLS, the data-plane
    learning defined in End.DT2U function can also be activated for End.DX2 function.
    On the basis of such End.DX2 function, SRv6 EVPN can meet all the requirements
    per [RFC7623] and bring us some other benefits. Such SRv6 EVPN is called light-
    weighted SRv6 EVPN, and it will be more simpler than PBB EVPN over SRv6. It is
    easy for the light-weighted SRv6 EVPN to carry a SID that is aiming for customer
    ethernet packets, because there will be no other ethernet header between the SID
    list and the customer ethernet header. These SIDs may be user-defined functions
    for the customer ethernet headers.</p>"
