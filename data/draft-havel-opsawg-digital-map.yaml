abstract:
- content: "<p>This document shares experience in modelling digital map based on the
    IETF RFC 8345 topology YANG modules and some of its augmentations. First, the
    concept of Digital Map is defined and its connection to the Digital Twin is explained.
    Next to Digital Map requirements and use cases, the document identifies a set
    of open issues encountered during the modelling phases, the missing features in
    RFC 8345, and some perspectives on how to address them.</p>"
