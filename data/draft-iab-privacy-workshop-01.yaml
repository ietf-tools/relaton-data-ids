abstract:
- content: "<p>On December 8-9, 2010, the IAB co-hosted an Internet privacy workshop
    with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the Internet Society (ISOC), and MIT's
    Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The workshop
    revealed some of the fundamental challenges in designing, deploying, and analyzing
    privacy-protective Internet protocols and systems. Although workshop participants
    and the community as a whole are still far from understanding how best to systematically
    address privacy within Internet standards development, workshop participants identified
    a number of potential next steps. For the IETF, these included the creation of
    a privacy directorate to review Internet-Drafts, further work on documenting privacy
    considerations for protocol developers, and a number of exploratory efforts concerning
    fingerprinting and anonymized routing. Potential action items for the W3C included
    investigating the formation of a privacy interest group and formulating guidance
    about fingerprinting, referrer headers, data minimization in APIs, usability,
    and general considerations for non-browser-based protocols. Note that this document
    is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented
    in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect
    the views of the IAB, W3C, ISOC, or MIT CSAIL. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
