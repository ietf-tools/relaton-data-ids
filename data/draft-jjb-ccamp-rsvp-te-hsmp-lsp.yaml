abstract:
- content: "<p>In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    environment, the RSVP-TE based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSP allows traffic to
    transmit from root to leaf node, but there is no co-routed reverse path for traffic
    from leaf to root node. This draft introduces a Hub and Spoke Multipoint (HSMP)
    LSP, which allows traffic from both the root to the leaves through a P2MP LSP
    and also the leaves to the root along a co-routed reverse path.</p>"
