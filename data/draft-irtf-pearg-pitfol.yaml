abstract:
- content: "<p>Software systems typically generate log messages in the course of their
    operation. These log messages (or 'logs') record events as they happen, thus providing
    a trail that can be used to understand the state of the system and help with troubleshooting
    issues. Given that logs try to capture state that is useful for monitoring and
    debugging, they can contain information that can be used to identify users. Personal
    data identification and anonymization in logs is crucial to ensure that no personal
    data is being inadvertently logged and retained which would make the logging system
    run afoul of laws around storing private information. This document focuses on
    exploring mechanisms that can be used by a generating or intermediary logging
    service to specify personal or sensitive data in log message(s), thus allowing
    a downstream logging server to potentially enforce any redaction or transformation.</p>"
