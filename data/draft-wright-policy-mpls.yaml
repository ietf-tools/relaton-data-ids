abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a brief overview of MPLS networks and policy- based
    network architectures. It proposes that MPLS networks be Policy-Enabled in order
    to facilitate easier administration. To facilitate further discussion, an Intra-net
    example of a policy- based MPLS network architecture is described. Example policies
    applicable to the MPLS network are discussed. A scenario of operation example
    is provided to illustrate some of the dynamics associated with Policy-Enabled
    MPLS networks.</p>"
