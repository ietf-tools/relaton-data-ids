abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents intelligent network management based on Artificial
    Intelligent (AI) such as reinforcement-learning approaches. In a heterogeneous
    network, intelligent management with Artificial Intelligent should usually provide
    real-time connectivity, the type of network management with the quality of real-time
    data, and transmission services generated by an application service. With that
    reason intelligent management system is needed to support real- time connection
    and protection through efficient management of interfering network traffic for
    high-quality network data transmission in the both cloud and IoE network systems.
    Reinforcement-learning is one of the machine learning algorithms that can intelligently
    and autonomously provide to management systems over a communication network. Reinforcement-learning
    has developed and expanded with deep learning technique based on model-driven
    or data- driven technical approaches so that these trendy techniques have been
    widely to intelligently attempt an adaptive networking models with effective strategies
    in environmental disturbances over variety of networking areas. For Network AI
    with the intelligent and effective strategies, intent-based network (IBN) can
    be also considered to continuously and automatically evaluate network status under
    required policy for dynamic network optimization. The key element for the intent-based
    network is that it provides a verification of whether the represented network
    intent is implementable or currently implemented in the network. Additionally,
    this approach need to provide to take action in real time if the desired network
    state and actual state are inconsistent.</p>"
