abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
    install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices via exchange
    of XML messages in textual representation. Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) is
    a W3C-recommended binary representation of XML Information Set, which is more
    efficient from both CPU and bandwidth utilization perspective. This document defines
    a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows peers to agree
    to exchange protocol messages using EXI encoding.</p>"
