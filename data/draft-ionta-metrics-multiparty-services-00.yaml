abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex
    growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along the Core
    network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly derived from a
    Network-oriented point of view, and therefore a general perspective, not focused
    on specific services - with some more Performance factors, so to include a Service-oriented
    point of view, more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own characteristics
    in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and so on. To achieve the above
    goal, and starting from the one-to-group performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644
    [RFC5644], an effort to a deeper analysis and definition of spatial aggregation
    metrics (as a part of the framework for metric composition defined in RFC 5835
    [RFC5835])is proposed in this memo, where the main focus is on multiparty communications
    (e.g. video providers, online biding, online stock market, etc.). This memo lends
    itself to passive measurement as well as active measurement. Finally this memo
    is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes, framework concepts, and need
    to widen the current performance metrics depending on the application, service
    etc.</p>"
