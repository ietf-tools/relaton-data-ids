abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the role of the UDP transport checksum when
    used with IPv6, as defined in RFC2460. It presents a summary of the trade-offs
    for evaluating the safety of updating RFC 2460 to permit an IPv6 UDP endpoint
    to use a zero value in the checksum field as an indication that no checksum is
    present. This method is compared with some other possibilities. The document also
    describes the issues and design principles that need to be considered when UDP
    is used with IPv6 to support tunnel encapsulations. It concludes that UDP with
    a zero checksum in IPv6 can safely be used for this purpose, provided that this
    usage is governed by a set of constraints.</p>"
