abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
    Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765. The algorithm translates between IPv4
    and IPv6 packet headers (including ICMP headers). This specification addresses
    both a stateless and a stateful mode. In the stateless mode, translation information
    is carried in the address itself, permitting both IPv4-&gt;IPv6 and IPv6-&gt;IPv4
    session establishment with neither state nor configuration in the IP/ICMP translator.
    In the stateful mode, translation state is maintained between IPv4 address/transport_port
    tuples and IPv6 address/ transport_port tuples, enabling IPv6 systems to open
    sessions with IPv4 systems. The choice of operational mode is made by the operator
    deploying the network and is critical to the operation of the applications using
    it. Significant issues exist in the stateless and stateful modes that are not
    addressed in this document, related to the address assignment and the maintenance
    of the translation tables, respectively. This document confines itself to the
    actual translation. Acknowledgement of previous work This document is a product
    of the 2008-2009 effort to define a replacement for NAT-PT. It is an update to
    and directly derivative from Erik Nordmark's [RFC2765], which similarly provides
    both stateless and stateful translation between IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460],
    and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]. The original document was a
    product of the NGTRANS working group. The changes in this document reflect five
    components: 1. Redescribing the network model to map to present and projected
    usage. 2. Moving the address format to the framework document, to coordinate with
    other drafts on the topic. 3. Description of both stateful and stateless operation.
    4. Some changes in ICMP. 5. Updating references.Requirements The keywords MUST,
    MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and
    OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described
    in [RFC2119].</p>"
