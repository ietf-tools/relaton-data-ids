abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic localization for peer-to-peer applications is currently discussed
    by the IETF ALTO working group. The protocol specification itself is discussed
    and some issues about load reduction for ALTO/P4P servers are also discussed,
    but mainly on the transport level (i.e., caching of traffic localization data)
    and some data aggregation by using macros that comprise a number of IP prefixes.
    However, there are no considerations about reducing the query load to the ALTO
    server. This memo aims at giving informational guidance to P2P applications implementers
    on how reduce the query load for ALTO.</p>"
