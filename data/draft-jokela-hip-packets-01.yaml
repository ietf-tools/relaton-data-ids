abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes alternative, optimized packet structures for the
    Host Identity Payload and Host Layer Protocol (HIP). The packet structures presented
    in this memo are intended replace original packets in HIP. In addition, this memo
    describes a new packet, CER, to transmit certificates. The main objective in redefining
    HIP packet structures is to make the packet structures simpler and more distinct,
    which makes the implementation work easier, hopefully leading to more secure protocol
    implementation. The new structures reduce the average packet size and take advantage
    of other existing IPv6 protocols formats, including alignments concerns, like
    the newly suggested Mobility header format for Mobile IPv6.</p>"
