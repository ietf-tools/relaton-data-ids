abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, "/.well-known/", that can be used by
    well-known URIs, specifically for the "http" and "https" URI schemes, which has
    since been adopted by other URI schemes. The present memo formally updates RFC
    7595, which defines the URI schemes regustry, to record the availability of these
    well-known URIs to the URI schemes registered there.</p>
