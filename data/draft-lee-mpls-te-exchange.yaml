abstract:
- content: "<p>The current link state routing protocols flood link states to all routers
    so that routers have the information required to compute the shortest paths to
    route packets on a hop by hop basis. However, for the purpose of establishing
    MPLS paths, constraint path computation is only performed at certain nodes, for
    instance, at the node where path setup is triggered or at the head-end of a loosely
    routed segment that crosses a network (or area) boundary. In addition, it not
    possible to have all required constraints present in all nodes in a network, nor
    is it always feasible for nodes setting up paths to compute the constraint paths
    themselves, a notable example is when a path traverses network or area boundary.
    These reasons motivate a solution using a 'subset' of routers (called route exchangers),
    to collect constraint information and exchange it with other route exchangers.
    Route exchangers store traffic engineering link states and other types of constraint
    information and compute on demand, the explicit routes required by routers establishing
    paths. Hence, link state information need only be distributed to the subset of
    nodes that help compute constraint paths in the network.</p>"
