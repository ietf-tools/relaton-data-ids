abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and CBOR Object Signing and
    Encryption (COSE) are two widely used security wrappers, which have been developed
    in the IETF and have intentionally been kept in sync. This document provides guidance
    for protocol designers developing extensions for JOSE/COSE and for implementers
    of JOSE/COSE libraries. Developers of application using JSON and/or JOSE should
    also read this document but are realistically more focused on the documentation
    offered by the library they are using.</p>"
