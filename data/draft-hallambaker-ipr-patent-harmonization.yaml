abstract:
- content: "<p>Considerations for IETF patent policy are considered and proposals
    made for reform. The particular objective of these proposals is to reduce the
    amount of time spent in unproductive discussion of IPR issues and to allow Working
    Groups to provide Patent Rights Holders with clearly defined criteria that must
    be met in order for their technology to be accepted.</p>"
