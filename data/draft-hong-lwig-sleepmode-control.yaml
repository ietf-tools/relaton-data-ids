- content: "<p>This document describes the mechanism of sleep mode control. The router
    which manages a network can control IPv6 sleepy nodes and deliver the packets
    from/to exterior networks. The IPv6 router can keep the IPv6 sleepy node as sleep
    state and handle the packets from/ to the IPv6 sleepy nodes. Also, this document
    describes the mechanism of sleep mode control using synchronization information.</p>"
