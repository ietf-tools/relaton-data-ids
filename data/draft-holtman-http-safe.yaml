- content: "<p>This document defines a HTTP response header field called Safe, which
    can be used to indicate that repeating a HTTP request is safe. Such an indication
    will allow user agents to handle retries of some safe requests, in particular
    safe POST requests, in a more user-friendly way.</p>"
