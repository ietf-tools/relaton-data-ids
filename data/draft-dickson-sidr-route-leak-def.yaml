abstract:
- content: <p>The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to
    advertise reachability for IP prefixes. This reachability information is propagated
    in a peer-to-peer topology. Routes may be announced to neighbors, contrary to
    the receiver's local peering policy. If that occurs, those routes may then be
    propagated indiscriminantly, once they have been accepted. This document considers
    the situations that can lead to routes being leaked, and tries to find acceptable
    definitions for describing these scenarios. The purpose of these definitions is
    to facilitate analysis of what a route leak is, and what the scope of the problem
    space for route leaks is. This, in turn, is intended to inform a requirements
    document for detection of (and prevention of) route leaks. And finally, the definitions
    and requirements are intended to allow proposed solutions which meet these criteria,
    and to facilitate evaluation of proposed solutions. The ultimate goal is to "solve
    the route leaks problem".</p>
