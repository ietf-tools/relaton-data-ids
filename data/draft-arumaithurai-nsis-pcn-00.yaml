abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Quality of Service model (QOSM), for networks
    that support the use of the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using
    pre-congestion notification. Ths is a technique to perform admission control in
    a Diffserv network by measuring the congestion level in a domain. New flows are
    admitted only if the current congestion level is below the allowed threshold.
    When the controlled load in a domain exceeds a certain threshold, the egress prompts
    the ingress to pre-empt certain flows. This proposal is based on the proposal
    made by B.Briscoe et al., for the extension of RSVP to support the Controlled
    load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.</p>"
