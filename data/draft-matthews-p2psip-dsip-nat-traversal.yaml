abstract:
- content: "<p>This document shows how the algorithm for resource registration and
    lookup in a SIP-based peer-to-peer system can be implemented in the presence of
    NATs. More precisely, this document show how this algorithm can be generalized
    into a method of routing arbitrary SIP requests through overlays, and how this
    approach can be used to set up new connections between peers to use for additional
    SIP signaling. The document uses SIP to signal new dSIP connections, and uses
    Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to allow these connections to be
    established through NATs.</p>"
