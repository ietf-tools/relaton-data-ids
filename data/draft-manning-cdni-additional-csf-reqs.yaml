abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) is to deliver content
    to end users in an efficient manner from the perspective of the network providers
    and with consistently good performance from the perspective of the end user. Due
    to footprint limitations of a single network provider, it may be necessary to
    interconnect CDNs between different providers. The Content Distribution Network
    Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable
    and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection. The requirements for CDN interconnection
    are being discussed and developed in various industry forums. One example is the
    Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) Cloud Services Forum
    (CSF) which is looking at CDN interconnection requirements from the perspective
    of telecom providers. This document introduces some additional requirements to
    be included in the CDNI working group based on conclusions reached by ATIS CSF.
    The goal is for specifications developed by CDNI to successfully support some
    of the needs expressed by ATIS CSF as interpreted by the authors of this document.</p>"
