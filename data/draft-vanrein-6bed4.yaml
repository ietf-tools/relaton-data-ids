abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only networks, hosts and applications.
    It passes IPv6 frames over UDP between IPv4 sites. Peers connected over 6bed4
    can switch to direct routes over UDP/IPv4 after deducing that this will be reliable.
    6bed4 lets peer-to-peer applications benefit from transparant addressing in IPv6
    and delegates NAPT concerns to 6bed4. It is possible to use 6bed4 as a fallback
    for IPv6, or as an additional route. Servers can be setup as IPv6-only servers
    with NAT64 for IPv4-only customers who only need client-server facilities, and
    add a 6bed4router to also facilitate reliable peer-to-peer protocols.</p>"
