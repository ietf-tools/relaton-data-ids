abstract:
- content: "<p>A suite of protocols is being developed in the IETF to allow networks
    consisting of photonic switches (PXCs), optical crossconnects (OXCs), routers,
    switches, DWDM optical line systems (OLSs), and optical add-drop multiplexors
    (OADMs) to use an MPLS- based control plane to dynamically provision resources
    and to provide network survivability using protection and restoration techniques.</p>"
