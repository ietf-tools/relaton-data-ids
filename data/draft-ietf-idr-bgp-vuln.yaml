abstract:
- content: "<p>Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4), along with a host of other infrastructure
    protocols designed before the Internet environment became perilous, was originally
    designed with little consideration for protection of the information it carries.
    There are no mechanisms internal to BGP that protect against attacks that modify,
    delete, forge, or replay data, any of which has the potential to disrupt overall
    network routing behavior. This document discusses some of the security issues
    with BGP routing data dissemination. This document does not discuss security issues
    with forwarding of packets. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
