abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for TLS servers to request, and TLS
    clients to provide, Privacy Pass tokens as part of the Encrypted Client Hello
    in the TLS handshake. This creates a way to add support for anonymous attestation
    and rate-limiting to servers that are enforcing denial-of-service protections
    as part of processing TLS handshakes.</p>"
