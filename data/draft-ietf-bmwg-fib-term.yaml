abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the terms to be used in a methodology that
    determines the IP packet forwarding performance of IP routers as a function of
    the forwarding information base installed within a router. The forwarding performance
    of an IP router may be dependent upon or may be linked to the composition and
    size of the forwarding information base installed within a router. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
