abstract:
- content: "<p>For when we can't meet in person, when there's interim work to be done,
    or just because the task calls for it, an asynchronous text- based meeting can
    sometimes be perfectly productive and useful. Given how much the IETF uses email
    already [RFC3934] this document aims to create additional guidance for co-chairs
    and meeting facilitators who might want to host a meeting asynchronously with
    mailing lists. Drawing from decades of facilitation experience in global networks,
    the document also treats unique considerations for facilitators that are introduced
    by this meeting methodology.</p>"
