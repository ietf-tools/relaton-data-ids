abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become very popular, and with
    this popularity, the harmful misconceptions that there is a specific limit to
    the number of features that can be implemented using SIP primitives, and that
    informational documents produced by the SIPPING Working Group that show example
    call flows place restrictions on what can be implemented. One especially catchy
    buzzword--The "SIPPING 16"--supposedly refers to the sixteen basic features of
    SIP. This document describes why the mythical SIPPING 16 does not exist, and where
    to find out more information about SIP features.</p>
