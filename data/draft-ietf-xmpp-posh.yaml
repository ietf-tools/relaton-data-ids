abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates
    for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result,
    domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates
    that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force
    end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier,
    resulting in degraded security. This document defines methods that make it easier
    to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application
    protocols. Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they
    might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.</p>"
