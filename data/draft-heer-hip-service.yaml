abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a signaling protocol for secure
    communication, mobility, and multihoming that introduces a cryptographic namespace.
    This document specifies an extension for HIP that enables HIP end-hosts and HIP-aware
    middleboxes to announce services to HIP hosts during a HIP Base EXchange (BEX)
    or HIP update. Service providers are able to specify the type and requirements
    of a service; clients can then decide to agree on the terms of service. This allows
    the service provider to verify the accordance of the client with the service conditions
    while the client is able to verify the authenticity of the used service.</p>"
