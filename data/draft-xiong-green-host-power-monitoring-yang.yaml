abstract:
- content: "<p>This document will build a hierarchical YANG data model of SDN controller/management
    platform, router/switch and host to monitor the energy consumption of network
    devices and servers. SDN controller/ management platform obtains data from routers/switches,
    and routers/ switches obtain data from hosts. Therefore, in the overall hierarchical
    structure, the SDN controller/management platform directly obtains energy consumption
    data of all routers/switches, and indirectly obtains the specific energy consumption
    data of all hosts through routers/switches.</p>"
