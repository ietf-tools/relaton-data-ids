abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile IPv6
    operations using RADIUS infrastructure. The RADIUS interactions take place when
    the Mobile Node attaches, authenticates and authorizes to a Proxy Mobile IPv6
    domain. Furthermore, this document also defines a RADIUS based interface between
    the Local Mobility Anchor and the RADIUS server for authorizing received initial
    Proxy Binding Update messages for the mobility service session. In addition to
    the mobility session setup related RADIUS interaction, this document defines the
    baseline for both the Mobile Access Gateway and the Local Mobility Anchor generated
    accounting. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full
