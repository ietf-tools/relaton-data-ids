abstract:
- content: "<p>The current IPv6 Neighbor Discovery specification does not provide
    semantics for carrying vendor-specific options in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
    messages. With the anticipated wide scale deployment of IPv6 networks, it is useful
    for organizations and vendors to have the ability to carry organization/vendor
    specific information in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. This will facilitate
    the vendors and organizations to make deployment specific extensions as needed
    in system deployment. This document defines a new vendor-specific information
    option that can be carried in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages exchanged between
    IPv6 nodes on a link.</p>"
