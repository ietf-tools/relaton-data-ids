abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a distributed Control Element for SDN implementations.
    This document describes various complexities associated with data-center management
    on adoption of new technologies in data center networking. While Server vitalization,
    cloud computing have very much increased the networking complexities while OpenFlow/SDN
    gives a different perspective which could provide solution. Network virtualisation
    is next thing in happening. Traditional methods of managing each data-center element
    are increasing management complexities. The key to reduce the management complexity,
    and have automated infrastructure in very highly scaled data center network is
    to have orthogonal management and control network to the Data network. A distributed
    CE yet with a single manager orchestrating the networks will give much needed
    intelligence to OF controller.</p>"
