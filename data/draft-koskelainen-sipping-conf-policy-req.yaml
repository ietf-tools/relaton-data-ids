abstract:
- content: "<p>The conference participants may communicate with the conference policy
    server, using a conference policy control protocol (CPCP) which is a strictly
    client-server transactional protocol. This document describes the requirements
    for conference policy data. Media policy related requirements are beyond the scope
    of this document. CPCP protocol is not mandatory and the only mechanism to manipulate
    conference policy data in a conference. For example, web interface can be used
    as well to perform conference policy manipulation. However, for automata a protocol
    is needed.</p>"
