abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses our experiences from deploying NAT64 devices
    for various Internet applications. Before the final transition to an IPv6-only
    network, NAT64 is one of the possible technologies which may be used to give users
    access to the IPv4-only parts of the Internet via an IPv6-only network. This document
    analyzes the testing results for a number of popular applications and describes
    the problems to be solved in the period of transition from IPv4 to IPv6.</p>"
