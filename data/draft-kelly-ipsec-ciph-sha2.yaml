abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes the use of Hashed Message Authentication
    Mode (HMAC) in conjunction with the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms in
    IPsec. These algorithms may be used as the basis for data origin authentication
    and integrity verification mechanisms for the Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP), Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE), and IKEv2 protocols,
    and also as Pseudo-Random Functions (PRFs) for IKE and IKEv2. Truncated output
    lengths are specified for the authentication-related variants, with the corresponding
    algorithms designated as HMAC-SHA-256-128, HMAC-SHA-384-192, and HMAC-SHA-512-256.
    The PRF variants are not truncated, and are called PRF-HMAC-SHA-256, PRF-HMAC-SHA-384,
    and PRF-HMAC-SHA-512. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
