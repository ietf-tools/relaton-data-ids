abstract:
- content: <p>This memo introduces a compact data-structure representation of multicast
    trees called "Recursive Bitstring Structure" (RBS) and its use for (stateless)
    forwarding of packets that include this structure in their header. It is intended
    as an alternative to "flat" bitstring addresses as used in BIER and BIER-TE or
    possible forwarding plane variations such as MSR6. RBS aims to improve performance
    and scalability over flat bitstrings and simplify operations. Operations is simplified
    because RBS does not require the use, management and optimization of network-wide
    configured address spaces BIFT-ID and SI and because one common RBS mechanism
    can replace flat bitstring addresses for both shortest-path forwarding and tree
    engineered forwarding. It intends to improve performance by allowing multicast
    to sparse set of receivers in larger networks with fewer packets and it intends
    to improve scalability by requiring less BIFT state on routers.</p>
