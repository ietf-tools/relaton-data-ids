abstract:
- content: "<p>ASON (Automatic Switch Optical Network), which provides fast and dynamic
    connection from point to point, is the typical representation of the next generation
    intelligent optical network. There are two main kinds of resource reservation
    protocols in RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering), the
    most widely applied signaling in ASON, which are FRP (forward reservation protocol)
    and BRP (backward reservation protocol). Both of them are used to apply in single-domain
    optical network. However, when they are used in multi-domain optical network,
    there are apparent drawbacks. On base of FRP and BRP, we propose a reservation
    protocol-IDRPBP, which is based on priority in multi-domain optical network with
    wavelength conversion implement at border nodes. Through analysis and simulation,
    we find it can achieve the trade-off between blocking probability and connection
    setup time.</p>"
