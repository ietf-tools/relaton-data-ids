abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes domainname-based service principal names and
    the corresponding name type for the GSS-API. Domain-based service names are similar
    to host-based service names, but using a domain name (not necessarily and Internat
    domain name) instead of or in addition to a hostname. The primary purpose of domain-based
    service names is to provide a way to name clustered services after the domain
    which they service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's
    servers based on authentication of their names.</p>"
