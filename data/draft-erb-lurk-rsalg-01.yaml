abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol between a content provider and an
    external key owner that enables the provider to act as a TLS termination end-point
    for the key owner, without having the key actually being provisioned at the provider.
    The protocol between the two preserves forward secrecy, and is also designed to
    prevent the use of the key owner as a general-purpose signing oracle which would
    make it complicit in attacks against uses of the very keys it is trying to protect.</p>"
