abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a novel communication approach which reasons
    about WHAT is being communicated (and invoked) instead of WHO is communicating.
    Such approach is meant to transition away from locator-based addressing (and thus
    routing and forwarding) to an addressing scheme where the address semantics relate
    to services being invoked (e.g., for computational processes, and their generated
    information requests and responses). The document introduces Routing on Service
    Addresses (ROSA), as a realization of what is referred to as 'service-based routing'
    (SBR), to replace the usual DNS+IP sequence, i.e., the off-path discovery of a
    service name to an IP locator mapping, through an on-path discovery with in-band
    data transfer to a suitable service instance location for a selected set of services,
    not all Internet-based services. SBR is designed to be constrained by service-specific
    parameters that go beyond load and latency, as in today's best effort or traffic
    engineering based routing, leading to an approach to steer traffic in a service-specific
    constraint-based manner. Particularly, this document outlines sample ROSA use
    case scenarios, requirements for its design, and the ROSA system design itself.</p>"
