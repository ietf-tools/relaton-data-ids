abstract:
- content: "<p>Pushback [MB01] is designed to detect and control high bandwidth aggregates
    in the network. An aggregate is a collection of packets with a common property.
    For instance, with the destination prefix as the common property, all packets
    with a matching prefix define an aggregate.</p>"
