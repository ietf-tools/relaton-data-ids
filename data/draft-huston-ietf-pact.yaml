abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF standards process must exhibit four qualities (Predictability,
    Accountability, Competency, and Timeliness), which we term 'the IETF Pact'. Growth
    in the IETF's size and diversity challenges its ability to make progress in producing
    useful specifications. This proposal puts forward procedural changes that will
    improve the IETF PACT, without altering the IETF's philosophy or structure, and
    without requiring changes to the formal IETF standards process (cf., RFC 2026
    [1]).</p>"
