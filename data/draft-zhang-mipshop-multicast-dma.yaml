abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast traffic
    to MN (Mobile Node). An approach named Mobile IPv6 Multicast with Dynamic Multicast
    Agent is proposed which combines Movement Based Method [2] and Distance Based
    Method [3], Such a design allows MN to optimize multicast route, and meanwhile
    reduce the handoff frequency by selecting new multicast agent dynamically. In
    addition to weakening the triangle route problem and diminishing the influence
    of handoff to multicast, this approach provides global mobility in Internet without
    limitations on network topology. This draft is the same as the earlier version,
    it is just an update of it.</p>"
