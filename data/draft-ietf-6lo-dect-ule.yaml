abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) Ultra Low Energy
    (ULE) is a low-power air interface technology that is proposed by the DECT Forum
    and is defined and specified by ETSI. The DECT air interface technology has been
    used worldwide in communication devices for more than 20 years. It has primarily
    been used to carry voice for cordless telephony but has also been deployed for
    data-centric services. DECT ULE is a recent addition to the DECT interface primarily
    intended for low-bandwidth, low-power applications such as sensor devices, smart
    meters, home automation, etc. As the DECT ULE interface inherits many of the capabilities
    from DECT, it benefits from operation that is long-range and interference-free,
    worldwide- reserved frequency band, low silicon prices, and maturity. There is
    an added value in the ability to communicate with IPv6 over DECT ULE, such as
    for Internet of Things applications. This document describes how IPv6 is transported
    over DECT ULE using IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN)
    techniques.</p>"
