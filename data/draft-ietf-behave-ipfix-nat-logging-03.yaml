abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT devices are required to log events like creation and deletion of
    translations and information about the resources it is managing. The logs are
    required in many cases to identify an attacker or a host that was used to launch
    malicious attacks and/or for various other purposes of accounting. Since there
    is no standard way of logging this information, different NAT devices behave differently
    and hence it is difficult to expect a consistent behavior. The lack of a consistent
    way makes it difficult to write the collector applications that would receive
    this data and process it to present useful information. This document describes
    the information that is required to be logged by the NAT devices.</p>"
