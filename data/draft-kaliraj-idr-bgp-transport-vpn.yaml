abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "service mapping",
    to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes using BGP. The document
    describes a framework for service mapping, and specifies BGP protocol procedures
    that enable dissimination of the service mapping information that may span across
    administrative domains. It makes it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to
    the same destination. A new BGP transport address family is defined for this purpose
    that uses BGP-VPN [RFC4364] technology and follows MPLS-BGP [RFC8277] NLRI encoding.
    This new address family is called "Transport-VPN".</p>
