abstract:
- content: <p>This document attempts to clarify the notion of the Zero Window Probes
    (ZWP) described in RFC 1122 [RFC1122]. In particular, it clarifies the actions
    that can be taken on connections which are experiencing the ZWP condition. The
    motivation for this document stems from the belief that TCP implementations strictly
    adhering to the current RFC language have the potential to become vulnerable to
    Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is
    submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.
