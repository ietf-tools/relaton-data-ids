abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analysis the use of hashes in SeND, possible threats
    and the impact of recent attacks on hash functions used by SeND. Current SeND
    specification [rfc3971] uses SHA-1 [sha-1] hash algorithm and PKIX certificates
    [rfc3280] and does not provide support for the hash algorithm agility. Based on
    previous analysis, this document suggests multiple hash support that should be
    included in the SeND update specification.</p>"
