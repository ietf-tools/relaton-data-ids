abstract:
- content: "<p>ANIMA defined Autonomic Service Agent to build intelligent management
    functions into network devices, and could interact with each other through a standard
    protocol (aka GRASP).With the rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven
    AI technologies, there is now a potential opportunity to enhance the ASA to be
    AI-powered, thereby elevating the intelligence of device-built-in management functions
    to a whole new level.This document analyzes the impact of the AI-powered ASA,
    mostly from the perspective of the ASA communication protocol.</p>"
