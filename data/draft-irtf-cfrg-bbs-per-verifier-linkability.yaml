abstract:
- content: "<p>The BBS Signatures scheme defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures],
    describes a multi-message digital signature, that supports selectively disclosing
    the messages through unlinkable presentations, built using zero-knowledge proofs.
    Each BBS proof reveals no information other than the signed messages that the
    Prover chooses to disclose in that specific instance. As such, the Verifier (i.e.,
    the recipient) of the BBS proof, may not be able to track those presentations
    over time. Although in many applications this is desirable, there are use cases
    that require the Verifier be able to track the BBS proofs they receive from the
    same Prover. Examples include monitoring the use of access credentials for abnormal
    activity, assertion of pseudonymous identity, monetization, etc.. This document
    provides a mechanism for binding prover secret material for pseudonym creation
    to a BBS signature and shows how to use this bound information for the creation
    of context dependent pseudonyms in BBS proofs.</p>"
