abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501] requires a client to
    initiate a LOGOUT command to close the network connection. However, it's often
    desirable to have the server initiate the termination of the network connection.
    This allows the network to deactivate a service provided to a client. This document
    specifies the syntax of a server-initiated LOGOUT command, which will allow a
    server to tell the client that the connection needs to be closed.</p>"
