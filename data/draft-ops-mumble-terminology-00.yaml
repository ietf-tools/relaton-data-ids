abstract:
- content: "<p>Policy Based Networking (PBN) is a topic of interest to many areas
    within the networking community. Initially considered for the implementation and
    control of QoS services, several groups are looking to deploy policy-based networks
    for a wider variety of applications, such as security and VPN. We have found,
    when trying to coordinate efforts of the different groups, that there are some
    misunderstandings among the groups, some of which can be attributed to the different
    terminology that has propagated through the groups. In this draft, we attempt
    to clear up some of these misunderstandings, concentrating on PBN for Policy Provisioning
    (rap), Differentiated Services (diffserv), IP Security (ipsp), and general Policy
    Framework (policy). The terminology discussed here is not meant to be an exhaustive
    list of PBN-related terms and concepts, but it is intended to represent at least
    the four areas mentioned. It is NOT intended that this draft defines an architecture
    or framework for PBN _ each group is clearly qualified to define these for themselves.
    Instead, we identify the terminology common to all PBN applications and suggest
    definitions, which are meaningful and useful, yet general enough to be applicable
    across all PBN applications.</p>"
