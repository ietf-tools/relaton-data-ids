abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.15.4 networked solutions employing [RFC4944] for applications
    like Smart Grid Home Area Networking require unattended service discovery which
    can be supported with small, single packet (or few packet) exchanges. At the same
    time, it is desirable to mix wired devices into the same network so interoperation
    of service discovery between devices with differing operational characteristics
    is desired.</p>"
