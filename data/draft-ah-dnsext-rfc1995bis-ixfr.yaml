abstract:
- content: "<p>The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for maintaining
    coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers consists of three mechanisms.
    Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) is one of the mechanisms and originally was defined
    in RFC 1995. This document aims to provide a more detailed and up-to-date specification
    of the IXFR mechanism and to align it with the current specification of the primary
    zone transfer mechanism, AXFR, given in RFC 5936. Further, based on operational
    experience, this document juxtaposes to the original IXFR query a new query type,
    IXFR-ONLY, that will likely be preferred over IXFR in specific deployments. This
    document obsoletes and replaces RFC 1995.</p>"
