abstract:
- content: "<p>The Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Network Programming framework
    enables a network operator or an application to specify a packet processing program
    by encoding a sequence of instructions in the IPv6 packet header. Following the
    SRv6 Network Programming concept, this document defines an SRv6 based mechanism
    for inter-layer network programming, which can help to integrate the packet network
    layer with its underlying layers efficiently. A new SRv6 behavior called End.XU
    is introduced, which is a variant of the SRv6 End.X behavior. Instead of pointing
    to an interface with layer-3 adjacency, the End.XU behavior points to an underlay
    interface which connects to a remote layer-3 node via underlying links or connections
    that are invisible in the L3 network topology. The applicability of the End.XU
    behavior in typical inter- layer network programming scenarios is also illustrated.</p>"
