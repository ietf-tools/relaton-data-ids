abstract:
- content: <p>A Fibre Channel pseudowire (PW) is used to carry Fibre Channel frames
    over an MPLS network. This enables service providers to offer "emulated" Fibre
    Channel services over existing MPLS networks. This document specifies the mechanisms
    controlling the reliable transport of Fibre Channel PW over MPLS networks. The
    encapsulation of Fibre Channel PDUs within a pseudowire and the procedures for
    using a PW to provide a Fibre Channel service are specified in [FC-encap].</p>
