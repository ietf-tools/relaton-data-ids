    work, CJK GPs, together with Integration Panel [IP] members, recognized that a
    common terminology definition for key concepts is essential in order to have an
    efficient, transparent and smooth progress of developing CJK Label Generation
    Rules (LGR) [I-D.ietf-lager-specification].</p>"
