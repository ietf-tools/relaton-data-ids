abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameter
    server to authenticate, authorize and collect accounting information for Mobile
    IPv4 services rendered to a mobile node. Combined with the Inter-Realm capability
    of the base protocol, this application allows mobile nodes to receive service
    from foreign service providers. Diameter Accounting messages will be used by the
    foreign and home agents to transfer usage information to the Diameter servers.</p>"
