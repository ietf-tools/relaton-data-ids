abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to SMTP that allows email to be
    exchanged as a storage system immutable XAM (eXtensible Access Method) reference.
    When MTAs employ the TBR mode, message origination can not be spoofed, and message
    acceptance is not asserted until retrieval of the referenced message. This strategy
    ensures a minimal SMTP overhead, increasing the responsibility of senders in order
    to limit the load of unwanted messages upon receivers. In addition, the TBR extension
    requires an [RFC2821] MAIL FROM address in the same domain as the server from
    which the XAM will be fetched, so that a dependable status-reporting path is assured.</p>"
