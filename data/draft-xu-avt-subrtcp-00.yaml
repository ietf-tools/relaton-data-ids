abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SubRTCP, an extension to RTCP. SubRTCP operates
    on the same underlying transport establishement as for RTCP but functions independently
    of the latter. SubRTCP extends RTCP to the middle nodes of an RTP session to allow
    monitoring of its data delivery also at and between these middle nodes. Such an
    internal visibility provided by SubRTCP at the middle nodes complements the delivery
    monitoring by RTCP at the endpoints particularly in service providers' interest.</p>"
