abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft outlines the modeling of optical pluggables within a host
    packet device in the context of a packet over optical network. The model encompasses
    all pertinent properties of the pluggable for various packet over optical use
    cases and is partitioned into three primary areas: the optical media interface,
    the electrical plug to host interconnect, and the physical equipment of the pluggable.
    Included in the model are representations of configuration, states, and telemetry
    data, as well as of profiles and coherent plug capabilities. Emphasizing the importance
    of considering both vendor- agnostic and vendor-specific attributes in modeling
    coherent pluggables. Drawing from existing models in IETF, OpenConfig, ITU-T,
    OIF, and TAPI, this model offers enhanced uniform structuring and naming. Additionally,
    it provides insight into the mapping to plug interface structures defined in CMIS.
    This draft introduces the concpet of "Coherent Pluggable Manifest", where a represents
    the capabilities of a type&amp;version of pluggable, maintained in a public repository
    of all pluggables. This document also covers gap analysis of current IETF drafts
    and other SDOs on coherent pluggables attributes and provides the complete lifecycle
    of a coherent pluggable from operators'' approval through viability assessment
    to deployment.</p>'
