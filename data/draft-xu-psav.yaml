abstract:
- content: "<p>Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination
    address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection of the source
    address and malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses.
    The inter-domain source address validation architecture is an effort to enhance
    the Internet by using state machine to generate consistent tags. When communicating
    between two end hosts at different ASes, tags will be added to the packets to
    identify the authenticity of the IP source address. This memo introduces PSAV,
    an Inter-AS source address validation mechanism.</p>"
