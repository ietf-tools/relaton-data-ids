abstract:
- content: "<p>6to4 [1] defines a mechanism for allowing sites to communicate using
    IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet. It does so by assigning a block of IPv6 addresses
    corresponding to any 'public' (globally-scoped) IPv4 address, and a means of tunneling
    IPv6 traffic destined for such addresses over the IPv4 Internet. In this way,
    any site which is connected to the IPv4 Internet and which has at least one global
    IPv4 address assigned to it, can communicate with IPv6. The advantage of 6to4
    is that it decouples deployment of IPv6 by the core of the network (e.g. Internet
    Service Providers or ISPs) from deployment of IPv6 at the edges (e.g. customer
    sites), allowing each site or ISP to deploy IPv6 support in its own time frame
    according to its own priorities. With 6to4, the edges may communicate with one
    another using IPv6 even if one or more of their ISPs do not yet provide native
    IPv6 service. In addition, the principal cost of the 6to4 transition mechanism
    is borne by those who benefit from it. However, the ability to perform so-called
    'reverse lookups' (lookups of IP addresses rather than domain names) in DNS requires
    that there be a delegation path for the IP address being queried, from the DNS
    root to the servers for the DNA zone which provides the PTR records for that IP
    address. For ordinary IPv6 addresses, the necessary DNS servers and records for
    IPv6 reverse lookups would be maintained by the each organization to which an
    address block is delegated; the delegation path of DNS records reflects the delegation
    of address blocks themselves. However, for IPv6 addresses beginning with the 6to4
    address prefix, the DNS records would need to reflect IPv4 address delegation.
    Since the entire motivation of 6to4 is to decouple site deployment of IPv6 from
    infrastructure deployment of IPv6, such records cannot be expected to be present
    for a site using 6to4 - especially for a site whose ISP did not yet support IPv6
    in any form. This memo discusses several potential mechanisms for locating the
    DNS servers which are assumed to provide 'reverse lookup' of 6to4 addresses.</p>"
