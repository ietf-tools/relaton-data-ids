abstract:
- content: "<p>When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress LSRs can
    receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream
    nodes. According to the RSVP-TE specification, the ingress LSR can forward traffic
    through an LSP as soon as it receives a RESV message. However, if the ingress
    LSR forwards traffic through the LSP before forwarding state has been installed
    on all downstream nodes, traffic can be lost. This memo describes LSP Self-ping.
    When an ingress LSR receives an RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures
    to ensure that forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes. LSP
    Self-ping is an extremely light-weight mechanism. It does not consume control
    plane resources on transit or egress LSRs.</p>"
