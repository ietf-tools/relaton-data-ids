abstract:
- content: <p>An EAP extension, called "EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP)", has
    been specified that supports an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient
    re-authentication between the peer and the server through an authenticator. This
    document specifies Diameter support for ERP. The Diameter EAP application is re-used
    for encapsulating the newly defined EAP Initiate and EAP Finish messages specified
    in the ERP specification. AVPs for request and delivery of Domain Specific Root
    Keys from the AAA/EAP server to the ER server are also specified. Additionally,
    this document also specifies Diameter processing rules relevant to ERP.</p>
