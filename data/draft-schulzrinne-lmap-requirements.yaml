abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network
    diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public policy. To conduct such
    measurements, user networks gather data, either on their own initiative or instructed
    by a measurement controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated
    measurement server. This document describes a logical architecture and summarizes
    key requirements for protocols to connect the components. The system is designed
    to support residential and small- enterprise networks, using either wired or wireless
    networks. The architecture supports an extensible set of active and passive measurements,
    but the details of the metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.</p>"
