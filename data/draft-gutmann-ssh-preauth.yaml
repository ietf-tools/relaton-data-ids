abstract:
- content: "<p>Devices running SSH are frequently exposed on the Internet, either
    because of operational considerations or through misconfiguration, making them
    vulnerable to the constant 3-degree background radiation of scanning and probing
    attacks that pervade the Internet. This document describes a simple pre-authentication
    mechanism that limits these attacks with minimal changes to SSH implementations
    and no changes to the SSH protocol itself.</p>"
