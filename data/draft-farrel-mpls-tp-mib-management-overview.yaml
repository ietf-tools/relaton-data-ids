abstract:
- content: "<p>A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been developed
    to help model and manage the various aspects of Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus
    on the specific areas of responsibility of the modules that they describe. The
    MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS functionality specific to
    the construction of packet-switched transport networks. This document describes
    the MIB-based management architecture for MPLS-TP and indicates the interrelationships
    between the different MIB modules used for MPLS-TP network management. This document
    is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
    to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network
    as defined by the ITU-T. This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving
    IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF Last
    Call. [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert
    the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]
