abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet has been moving towards a more standardized and open infrastructure
    to cope with its growing requirements. One requirement of particular interest
    and importance is that of network security. With the possible addition of CLNP
    [ISO8473] as a connectionless network protocol for the Internet the most useful
    solution is an integrated network security protocol that will provide security
    services and mechanisms for both IP and CLNP. The protocol defined by this Internet
    Draft is used to provide security services in support of an instance of communication
    between network layer entities for either IP or CLNP. An attempt is made to keep
    the functionality as close as possible to [ISO11577]. As a result this specification
    contains all of the technical complexities and problems of [ISO11577]. Editorial
    comments are included to address certain technical issues, such as headers ending
    on word boundaries, type-length-value encoding problems, etc. that may be outside
    the scope of [ISO11577]. This specification should be viewed as an initial attempt
    at identifying a protocol that can provide a set of security services for both
    IPV4 and CLNP</p>"
