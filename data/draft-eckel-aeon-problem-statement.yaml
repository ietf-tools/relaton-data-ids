abstract:
- content: "<p>Identification and treatment of application flows are critical for
    the successful deployment and operation of applications. Historically, this functionality
    has been accomplished to the extent possible using heuristics, which inspect and
    infer flow characteristics. Heuristics may be based on port ranges, network separation,
    or deep packet inspection (DPI). But many application flows in current usages
    are dynamic, time-bound (short lived for some of them), possibly encrypted (TLS
    for signaling), peer-to-peer, possibly asymmetric, and used on non-dedicated devices,
    any combination of which renders such techniques less effective or results in
    compromises to application security or user privacy.</p>"
