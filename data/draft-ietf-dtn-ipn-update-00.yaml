abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'ipn' URI scheme was first defined in [RFC6260] as a format for
    endpoint identifiers with the Delay Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol version
    6 (BPv6) [RFC5050], when using Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE). [RFC7116]
    requested IANA registries to control the allocation of the numeric identifiers
    used with the 'ipn' URI scheme. The Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) specification
    [RFC9171] repeats the definition of the 'ipn' URI scheme, for use with BPv7, reusing
    the format from [RFC6260]. Because the specification of the 'ipn' URI scheme has
    been split over several documents, referencing different versions of the Bundle
    Protocol, some confusion has occurred amongst readers and implementers. This document
    pulls together the information contained in those previous documents and asserts
    the specification of the 'ipn' URI scheme for use with BPv7, acting as an update
    to those previous documents. A criticism of the existing 'ipn' URI scheme node
    number allocation strategy as defined in [RFC7116] is that sub-ranges of a single
    number space are assigned for the use by individual organisations. This allocation
    strategy results in inefficient encoding of URIs with BPv7. This document extends
    the format of the 'ipn' URI scheme to include Numbering Authorities, allowing
    for a more flexible sub- allocation strategy, resulting in a more efficient encoding
    with BPv7.</p>"
