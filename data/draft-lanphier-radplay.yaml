abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines RTP Archiving, Delivery, and Playback (RADPLAY)
    extensions for the Session Description Protocol (SDP, [RFC 2327]). These extensions
    provide a standard means of archiving and delivering RTP streams via HTTP, using
    SDP and the commonly used 'rtpdump' file format. As a result of its design, it
    also provides a way of delivering generic RTP streams over HTTP, thus making it
    a suitable replacement for approaches which rely on network-unfriendly mechanisms
    such as 'HTTP tunneling'.</p>"
