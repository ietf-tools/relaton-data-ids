abstract:
- content: "<p>During World IPv6 Day on June 8, 2011, several key content providers
    enabled their networks to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 services. Hundreds of organizations
    participated in this effort, and in the months and weeks leading up to the event
    worked hard on preparing their networks to support this event. The event was largely
    unnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since it means that no
    major problems were detected. For the Internet, however, there was a major change
    on a short timescale. This memo discusses measurements that the authors made from
    the perspective of an end user with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity. Our measurements
    include the number of most popular networks providing AAAA records for their service,
    as well as delay and connection failure statistics.</p>"
