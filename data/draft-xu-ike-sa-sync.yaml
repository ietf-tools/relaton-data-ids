abstract:
- content: "<p>It will take a long time and mass computation to do session resumption
    among IKE/IPsec gateways possibly maintaining huge numbers of IKEv2/IPsec SAs,
    when the serving gateway fails or over-loaded. The major reason is that the prcocedure
    of IKEv2 SA re-establishment will incur a time-consuming computation especially
    in the Diffie- Hellman exchange. In this draft, a new IKE security associations
    synchronization solution is proposed to do fast IKE SA session resumption by directly
    transferring the indexed IKE SA (named stub) from old gateway to new gateway,
    wherein the most expensive Diffie- Hellman calculation can be avoided. Without
    some time-consuming IKEv2 exchanges, the huge amount of IKE/IPsec SA session resumption
    procedures can be finished in a short time.</p>"
