abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions for the flow control of the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) that avoid interactions with fast startup congestion control
    mechanisms, in particular the Quick-Start TCP extension. Quick-Start is an optional
    TCP extension that allows to start data transfers with a large congestion window,
    using feedback of the routers along the path. This can avoid the time consuming
    Slow-Start, provided that the TCP flow control is not a limiting factor. There
    are two potential interactions between the TCP flow control and congestion control
    schemes without the standard Slow-Start: First, receivers might not allocate a
    sufficiently large buffer space after connection setup, or they may advertise
    a receive window implicitly assuming the Slow-Start behavior on the sender side.
    This document therefore provides guidelines for buffer allocation in hosts supporting
    the Quick-Start extension. Second, the TCP receive window scaling mechanism can
    prevent fast startups immediately after the initial three-way handshake connection
    setup. This document describes a simple solution to overcome this problem.</p>"
