abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to identify and propose a new work item
    for the IETF. This document describes the PSTN Intelligent Network (IN) Architecture
    support of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks. The concept of the 'Soft-SSF'
    is introduced which acts as an overlay between the IP telephony call control and
    the Intelligent Network layer provided by the IN Service Switching Function (SSF)
    and the IN Service Control Function (SCF). This 'Soft-SSF' provides the necessary
    mapping between the SIP protocol state machine and the IN Basic Call State Model
    (BCSM). Also introduced is the Call Manager Function (CMF) which acts as a Mediation
    Node. The CMF entity is responsible for passing service related information to
    and from IN service layer, namely the SCF, and managing the service control relationship.
    As such, the CMF may contain a SSF-like functionality or subset thereof, to model
    the pre and post conditions that are required to interact with an SCF. The document
    specifically deals with the proposed standardized interfaces between the functional
    entities identified in the IN Network with associated functional entities represented
    in the SIP network. A mapping of parameters of the SIP protocol to the Intelligent
    Network Application Part Protocol(INAP) may be required for the support of the
    SIP Proxy Server call control protocol, states and events. Thereby enabling the
    Mediation Node (CMF) to model a SIP Proxy server. It is the proposal of this document
    to define the Mediation Node(CMF)to Soft SSF interface as a work item in the IETF
    as it is presently not a subject for standardization.</p>"
