abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), described in RFC 3031, is a method
    for forwarding packets that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets,
    called labels, to determine packet next hops. A fundamental concept in MPLS is
    that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels
    used to forward traffic between and through them. This common understanding is
    achieved by using a set of procedures, called a Label Distribution Protocol (as
    described in RFC 3036) , by which one LSR informs another of label bindings it
    has made. One such protocol, called LDP, is used by LSRs to distribute labels
    to support MPLS forwarding along normally routed paths. This document reports
    on a survey of LDP implementations conducted in August 2002 as part of the process
    of advancing LDP from Proposed to Draft Standard. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
