- content: "<p>This document defines the Authorization Challenge Endpoint, which supports
    a first-party native client that wants to control the process of obtaining authorization
    from the user using a native experience. In many cases, this can provide an entirely
    browserless OAuth 2.0 experience suited for native applications, only delegating
    to the browser in unexpected, high risk, or error conditions.</p>"
