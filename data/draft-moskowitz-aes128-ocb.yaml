abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the AES Cipher Algorithm with 128
    bit key in Offset CodeBook (OCB) Mode, with an implicit IV, as a confidentiality
    mechanism within the context of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload [ESP].
    OCB is a parallelizable block-cipher mode of operation that simultaneously provides
    privacy and authenticity.</p>"
