abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610,
    provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. RFCs have added
    to this extension point both in an application-specific and a more general way.
    The present document defines a number of additional generally application control
    operators for text conversion (Bytes, Integers, JSON) and operations on text.</p>
