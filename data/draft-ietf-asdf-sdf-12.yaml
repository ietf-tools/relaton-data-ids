abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet
    of Things. An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their
    associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types
    for the information exchanged in those interactions. Tools convert this format
    to database formats and other serializations as needed. // A JSON format representation
    of SDF 1.0 was defined in version // (-00) of this document; version (-05) was
    designated as an // _implementation draft_, labeled SDF 1.1, at the IETF110 meeting
    of // the ASDF WG (2021-03-11). The present version (-12) collects // smaller
    changes up to 2022-06-30. It also removes deprecated // elements from SDF 1.0.</p>"
