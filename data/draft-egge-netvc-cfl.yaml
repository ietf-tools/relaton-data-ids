abstract:
- content: "<p>Chroma from luma (CfL) prediction is a new and promising chroma-only
    intra predictor that models chroma pixels as a linear function of the coincident
    reconstructed luma pixels. In this document, we propose the CfL predictor adopted
    in Alliance Video 1 (AV1) to the NETVC working group. The proposed CfL distinguishes
    itself from prior art not only by reducing decoder complexity, but also by producing
    more accurate predictions. On average, CfL reduces the BD-rate, when measured
    with CIEDE2000, by 5% for still images and 2% for video sequences.</p>"
