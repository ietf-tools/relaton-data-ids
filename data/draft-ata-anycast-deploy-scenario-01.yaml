abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, the use of anycasting is quite limited. In this document we
    list possible deployment scenarios in IPv6 anycasting. We consider three conditions
    based on the region of anycasting, and list possible scenarios. For each scenario
    we also clarify example applications as well as technical issues to be resolved.</p>"
