abstract:
- content: "<p>Two solutions are presented to show how to use Dual-Stack Lite transition
    technique in mobile networks: one for Proxy Mobile IPv6 and the other for Dual-Stack
    Mobile IPv6. Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows IPv4 nodes to receive mobility services
    using an IPv4 home address. Mobile node can have IPv4 only operation by sending
    IPv4 datagrams which are encapsulated by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) at the
    DS- lite home router and and tunneled to Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) which is
    also DS-lite carrier-grade Network Address Translator (NAT). In case of client
    based mobility using DSMIPv6, mobile node is a dual-stack node and it can receive
    an IPv4 home address from the home agent which is co-located with DS-lite carrier-grade
    NAT. Mobile node (MN) encapsulates IPv4 datagrams in IPv6 which are decapsulated
    at the home agent (HA). Mobile network could be WiMAX network or 3GPP Long Term
    Evolution network.</p>"
