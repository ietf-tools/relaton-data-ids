abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a YANG data model for Layer 2 VPN services
    over MPLS networks. These services include Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)
    and Virtual Private LAN service (VPLS) that uses LDP and BGP signaled Pseudowires.
    The current version of the document expands the L2VPN object model to include
    VPLS services in addition to the VPWS services described in the last revision.
    This is a living document and contains aspects of object models that have been
    discussed extensively in the working group with consensus. The intention is to
    continue to seek input from larger audience during evolution of the L2VPN service
    model through this document.</p>"
