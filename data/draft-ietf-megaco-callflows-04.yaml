abstract:
- content: "<p>The Megaco/H.248 call flow examples draft illustrates the usage of
    Megaco - Version 1 protocol [Ref:3] defined between the Media Gateway Controller
    and Media Gateway. In light of the vast features presently incorporated and continuously
    evolving features of the protocol, it serves the purpose of representing typical
    use case scenarios. There are a lot of possible scenarios for usage of MEGACO
    protocol. It is not the intent of the draft to represent the inter-working functionality
    among various protocols, however, an attempt is made to depict its usage in such
    a case for the purpose of completeness in the larger perspective. An attempt has
    been made to illustrate the supplementary call services using MEGACO. The call
    flows can be categorized in to two sub sections,</p>"
