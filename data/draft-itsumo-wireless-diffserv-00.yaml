abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a QoS architecture framework with preliminary
    protocol specifications for next generation wireless IP networks. The architecture
    is based on differentiated services in that traffic are aggregated and forwarded
    in backbone network based on per hop behaviors. In the proposed architecture,
    there is at least one global server and several local nodes in each administration
    domain. The server is referred to as the QoS Global Server (or QGS), and local
    nodes are referred to as QoS local nodes (or QLN). QLNs are ingress nodes of the
    DS (Differentiated Service) domain. They reside generally in the edge of wired
    backbone networks. The QGS retains the global information of the domain, and informs
    QLNs what to do when traffic comes in. The mobile station (MS) has the QoS signaling
    with QGS only. Once the QoS signaling is done, the QGS updates the QoS profile
    in each QLN. The MS is then free to move within the same domain without other
    QoS signaling. The actual traffic generated by MS goes through QLN only. The QGS
    is in control plane and QLNs are in transport plane. By retaining the global information
    in central server and separating control and transport, the architecture is flexible,
    easy to add new services, and more efficient for mobile environment.</p>"
