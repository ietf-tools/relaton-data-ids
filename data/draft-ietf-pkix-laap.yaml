abstract:
- content: "<p>The PKIX working group is profiling the use of X.509 attribute certificates.
    This document specifies a deliberately limited protocol for requesting an attribute
    certificate from a server. It is intended to be complementary to the use of LDAP
    for AC retrieval, covering, for example, those cases where use of an LDAP server
    is not suitable due to the type of authorization model being employed. For many
    other cases, the use of LDAP is preferred.</p>"
