abstract:
- content: <p>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
    traffic engineering systems such as multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) and generalized
    multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) networks. Path computation in large, multi-domain
    or multi-layer networks is highly complex and may require special computational
    components and cooperation between the different network domains. There are multiple
    components in the Path Computation Element (PCE)- based path computation model,
    including PCE discovery and the PCE communication protocol. The PCE model is described
    in the "PCE Architecture" document and facilitates path computation requests from
    Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to PCEs. This document specifies generic requirements
    for a communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs, and between PCEs where cooperation
    between PCEs is desirable. Subsequent documents will specify application-specific
    requirements for the PCE communication protocol.</p>
