abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the transport of metadata in Service Function
    Chains. It precises how metadata MAY be shared reliably by network devices and/or
    network services via Metadata Messages that can be exchanged offline or inline.
    It proposes IPFIX as a representation mechanism for SFC Metadata and SCTP as an
    optional transport mechanism to enable reliable transmission of Metadata in SFC</p>"
