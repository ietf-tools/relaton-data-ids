abstract:
- content: "<p>Many utilities are nowadays connected via dedicated networks, but the
    trend toward a fully IP network is gaining more traction in some sectors (e.g.
    electric power). In some use cases, although it would be desirable to avoid the
    use of IP networks, this may prove unavoidable. Consequently, equipment is linked
    to extensive communication networks, the performance of which cannot be fully
    controlled or known. Some utilities that are not connected to a dedicated network
    may use public wireless networks, which present certain degree of variability
    of some parameters (delay, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth limits). Considering
    the importance of receiving packets with a low delay, this document presents a
    solution for using tunnels to send frames or packets between remote facilities,
    with a certain degree of redundance. This can be useful in some use cases as e.g.
    the sending of event-driven field commands between eletric substations. In some
    cases, these messages can be very critical, and their loss or delay can make the
    difference between a blackout and a simple outage. Considering the high redundancy
    of the protocol, its use must be restricted to traffic flows which require very
    low delay to control critical equipment.</p>"
