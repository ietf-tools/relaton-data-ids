abstract:
- content: "<p>Since RFC 1557, which is a Korean character encoding for internet messages,
    was distributed in 1993, most mailers have been implemented using it. However,
    it's been reported many occurrences of incompatible transfer of Korean mail messages
    such as broken mail messages. Therefore certain features are need to be extended,
    and ambiguous contents must be clarified. This document updates RFC 1557 to resolve
    above matters. This memo provides information for the Internet community. This
    memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo
    is unlimited.</p>"
