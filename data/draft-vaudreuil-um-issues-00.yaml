abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discussed issues and requirements for a profile of the
    IMAP 4, message submission, and notification protocols for use by telephone user
    interfaces delivering the traditional voice mail user experience. Experience with
    IMAP 4 and voice mail systems has shown quite a few limitations that may be addressed
    by protocol extensions and standardized conventions between clients and servers.</p>"
