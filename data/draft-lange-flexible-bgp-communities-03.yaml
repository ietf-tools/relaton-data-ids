abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new attribute for BGP called the Flexible Community
    attribute. Flexible Communities build on the experience and utility of the standard
    BGP community, and the extended BGP community attributes. This attribute allows
    operators to associate structured information with a route or set of routes. This
    information can be then be used to execute routing policy. An enhanced version
    of communities is necessary to accommodate IPv6, 4-byte ASN's, and introduce a
    more extensible and flexible policy expression. This document also introduces
    the concept of Neighbor Classes. A Neighbor Class is applied to a group of BGP
    neighbors who share certain attributes. For example, the PEER Neighbor Class could
    be applied to BGP sessions between ASN X and other networks with which ASN X has
    a non-transit peering relationship.</p>"
