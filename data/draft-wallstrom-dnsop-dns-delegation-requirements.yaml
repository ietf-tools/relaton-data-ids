abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a set of requirements on a well-behaved DNS
    delegation of a domain name. A large number of tools have been developed to test
    DNS delegations, but each tool uses a different set of requirements for what is
    a correct setup for a delegated domain name. However, there are few requirements
    on how to set up DNS in order to just make the delegation work. In order to have
    a well- behaved delegation that is robust to failures and also makes DNS resolvers
    behave consistently, there are a large number of things to consider. Based on
    this document, it should be possible to set up a fully functional DNS delegation
    for a domain name, but also to create a set of test specifications for how to
    test a DNS delegation.</p>"
