abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a multicast routing protocol for mobile ad hoc
    networks (MANETs). The protocol---termed Differential Destination Multicast (DDM)---differs
    from common approaches proposed for ad hoc multicast routing in two ways. Firstly,
    instead of distributing membership control throughout the network, DDM concentrates
    this authority at the data sources (i.e. senders) thereby giving senders knowledge
    of group membership. Secondly, differentially-encoded, variable-length destination
    headers are inserted in data packets which are used in combination with unicast
    routing tables to forward multicast packets towards multicast receivers. Instead
    of requiring that multicast forwarding state be stored in participating nodes,
    this approach also provides the option of stateless multicasting. Each node independently
    has the choice of maintaining cached forwarding state, or requesting its upstream
    neighbor to insert this state into self-routed data packets, or some combination
    thereof. The protocol is best suited for use with small multicast groups operating
    in dynamic networks of any size.</p>"
