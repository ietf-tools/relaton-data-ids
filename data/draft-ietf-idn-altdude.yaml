abstract:
- content: "<p>DUDE [DUDE01] by Mark Welter and Brian Spolarich is an ASCII-Compatible
    Encoding (ACE) of Unicode strings, and AltDUDE is a slight variation on it that
    is conceptually simpler. AltDUDE is a reversible map from a sequence of unsigned
    integers (intended to be Unicode code points) to a sequence of letters (A-Z, a-z),
    digits (0-9), and hyphen-minus (-), henceforth called LDH characters. Such a map
    might be useful for internationalized domain names [IDN], because host name labels
    are currently restricted to LDH characters by [RFC952] and [RFC1123].</p>"
