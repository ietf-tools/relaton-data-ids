abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies several usecases related to the different ways
    IoT devices are exploited by malicious adversaries to instantiate Distributed
    Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. The attacks are generted from IoT devices that
    have no proper protection against generating unsolicited communication messages
    targeting a certain network and creating large amounts of network traffic. The
    attackers take advantage of breaches in the configuration data in unprotected
    IoT devices exploited for DDoS attacks. The attackers take advantage of the IoT
    devices that can send network packets that were generated by malicious code that
    interacts with an OS implementation that runs on the IoT devices. The prupose
    of this draft is to present possible IoT DDoS usecases that need to be prevented
    by TEE. The major enabler of such attacks is related to IoT devices that have
    no OS or unprotected EE OS and run code that is downloaded to them from the TA
    and modified by man-in-the-middle that inserts malicious code in the OS. This
    draft adds list of MUD files for most IoT devices.</p>"
