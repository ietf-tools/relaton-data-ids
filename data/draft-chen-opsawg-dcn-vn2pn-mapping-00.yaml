abstract:
- content: "<p>Cloud tenant needs virtual network to interconnect their VMs on server.
    In order to effectively and efficiently map virtual network to physical network,
    certain mechanism should be employed. This memo analysis the existing VN2PN mapping
    technique employed in DataCenter and point out the potential shortcomings lie
    in it. This memo also try to provide a generic mechanism to facilitate the VN2PN
    mapping in DataCenter network.</p>"
