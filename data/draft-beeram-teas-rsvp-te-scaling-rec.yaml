abstract:
- content: <p>The scale at which RSVP-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) get deployed
    is growing continually and the onus is on RSVP-TE implementations across the board
    to keep up with this increasing demand. This document makes a set of implementation
    recommendations to help RSVP-TE deployments push the envelope on scaling and advocates
    the use of a couple of techniques - "Refresh Interval Independent RSVP (RI-RSVP)"
    and "Per-Peer flow-control" - for improving scaling.</p>
