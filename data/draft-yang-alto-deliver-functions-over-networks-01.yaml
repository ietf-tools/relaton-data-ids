abstract:
- content: "<p>As the rapid development of the Internet, huge amounts of data are
    being generated. To satisfy user demands, service providers deploy services near
    the edge networks. In order to achieve better performances, computing functions
    and user traffic need to be scheduled properly. However, it is challenging to
    efficiently schedule resources among the distributed edge servers due to the lack
    of underlying information, e.g., network topology, traffic distribution, link
    delay/bandwidth, utilization/capability of computing servers. In this document,
    we employ the ALTO protocol to help deliver functions and schedule traffic within
    the edge computing platform. The protocol will provide information of multiple
    resources for the distributed edge computing platform. The usage of ALTO will
    improve the efficiency of function delivery in edge computing.</p>"
