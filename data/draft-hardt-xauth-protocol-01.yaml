abstract:
- content: "<p>Client software often desires resources or identity claims that are
    managed independent of the client. This protocol allows a user and/ or resource
    owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release of identity claims to
    an authorization server. Client software can then request access to resources
    and/or identity claims by calling the authorization server. The authorization
    server acquires consent and authorization from the user and/or resource owner
    if required, and then returns the authorization and identity claims that were
    approved. This protocol can be extended to support alternative client authentication
    mechanisms, authorizations, claims, and interactions. [Editor: suggestions on
    how to improve this are welcome!] [Editor: suggestions for other names than XAuth
    are welcome!]</p>"
