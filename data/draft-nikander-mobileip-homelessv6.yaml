abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a variant of the Mobility Support in IPv6 protocol
    [1], mainly intended for mobile hosts that do not need to or want to use any explicit
    home agent. However, portions of the protocol may be beneficial for other hosts
    as well, including non-mobile hosts, since it reduces the average header sizes
    for packets flowing between two mobile hosts or between a mobile and a non-mobile
    host. It may also be beneficial to multi-homed hosts or sites, since it allows
    migration of connections from one IP address to another.</p>"
