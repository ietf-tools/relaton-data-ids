abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a modeling technique for configuring large scale
    devices in a compact way, when the device contains many similar data node patterns.
    A device here refers to any such entity that acts as a netconf server. This is
    realized by instructing the device to locally generate repetitive patterns of
    data nodes from a master copy called 'template' that is configured in the device.
    This approach is both convenient and efficient, as it minimizes the size of the
    running data store and reduces network provisioning time. It leverages existing
    YANG specification features and can be implemented with standard, off-the-shelf
    tools.The concept that is described in this draft does not aim to be a standard
    track document and does not cover the template solution that is currently being
    discussed within ietf netmod.</p>"
