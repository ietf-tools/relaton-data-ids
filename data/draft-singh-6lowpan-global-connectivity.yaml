abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the short AID (adaptation identifier) in place
    of full IPv6 address, related AID-IPv6 address translation mechanism and frame
    format of it forÂ effective IPv6 header compression when a IEEE 802.15.4 node communicate
    with a IPv6 domain. AID generated by IN-node (a node inside the lowpan) for corresponding
    IPv6 address of OUT-node (a node outside the lowpan), and AID-IPv6 translation
    table maintained at gateway and IN-node. Conversely packet carries an AID value
    in place of OUT-node IPv6 address in adaptation header, and translated back to
    IPv6 at gateway though AID-IPv6 translation table. Also in this document, effective
    frame format design specified for adaptation layer for global as well as local
    communication</p>"
