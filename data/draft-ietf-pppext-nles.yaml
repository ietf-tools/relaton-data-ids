abstract:
- content: "<p>With the introduction of xDSL services into public telecommunications
    networks, direct access (in contrast to dial-up access) will start to be used
    as an access method for data as well as other services. PPP has been very successful
    in providing connections for IP as well as other protocols in the dial-up access
    network. With the advent of direct access, changes will be need to be made for
    identifying the target hosts, as it will no longer be possible to rely on the
    telephone number that is dialed prior to initiating the PPP session. This proposal
    indicates one method for adapting PPP to the new requirements.</p>"
