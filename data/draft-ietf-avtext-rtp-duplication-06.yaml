abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions but can
    occur due to a variety of reasons including unplanned network outages. In unicast
    transmissions, recovering from such an outage can be difficult depending on the
    outage duration, due to the potentially large number of missing packets. In multicast
    transmissions, recovery is even more challenging as many receivers could be impacted
    by the outage. For this challenge, one solution that does not incur unbounded
    delay is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate redundant streams,
    provided that the underlying network satisfies certain requirements. This document
    explains how Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without
    breaking RTP or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.</p>"
