abstract:
- content: "<p>In Mobile IPv6 a mobile node registers with its home agent and its
    correspondent hosts each time it changes care-of address. This draft presents
    a Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 proposal that reduces the number of signaling messages
    sent by a mobile host to its home agent and correspondent hosts and that reduces
    the signaling delay. Our proposal relies on the deployment of Mobility Networks
    that provide flexibility and scalability.</p>"
