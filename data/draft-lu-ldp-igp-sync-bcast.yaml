abstract:
- content: "<p>[LDP-IGP-SYNC] describes a mechanism to prevent black-holing traffic
    (e.g. VPN) when IGP is operational on a link but LDP is not. If this mechanism
    is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP/IGP peer, the cost-out
    procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not an individual peer.
    When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of
    traffic through other established peers on that network. This document describes
    a mechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic. The mechanism does
    not introduce any protocol changes.</p>"
