abstract:
- content: <p>There is a class of data serving protocols and applications that cannot
    tolerate undetected data corruption on the wire. Data corruption could occur at
    the source in software, in the network interface card, out on the link, on intermediate
    routers or at the destination network interface card or node. The Ethernet CRC
    and the 16-bit checksum in the TCP/UDP headers are used to detect data errors.
    Most applications rely on these checksums to detect data corruptions and do not
    use any checksums or CRC checks at their level. Research has shown that the TCP/UDP
    checksums are catching a significant number of errors, however, the research suggests
    that one packet in 10 billion will have an error that goes undetected for Ethernet
    MTU frames (MTU of 1500). Under certain situations, "bad" hosts can introduce
    undetected errors at a much higher frequency and order. With the use of Jumbo
    frames on the rise, and therefore more data bits on the wire that could be corrupted,
    the current 16-bit TCP/UDP checksum, or the Ethernet 32-bit CRC are simply not
    sufficient for detecting errors. This document specifies a proposal to use stronger
    checksum algorithms for TCP Jumbo Frames for IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The Castagnoli
    CRC 32C algorithm used in iSCSI and SCTP is proposed as the error detection code
    of choice.</p>
