abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain (SFC) defines an ordered set of service functions
    (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames and/or flows selected as a result
    of classification. SFC Operation, Administration and Maintenance can monitor the
    continuity of the SFC, i.e., that all elements of the SFC are reachable to each
    other in the downstream direction. But SFC OAM must support verification that
    the order of traversing these SFs corresponds to the state defined by the SFC
    control plane or orchestrator, the metric referred in this document as the path
    consistency of the SFC. This document defines a new SFC OAM method to support
    SFC consistency, i.e. verification that all elements of the given SFC are being
    traversed in the expected order.</p>"
