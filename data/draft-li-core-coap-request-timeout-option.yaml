abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP, to inform a CoAP server
    of the maximum time that a CoAP client will wait a response to its request. A
    CoAP server can use this header to ensure that a timely response is generated.
    Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent
    to core@ietf.org.</p>"
