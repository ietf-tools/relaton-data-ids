abstract:
- content: "<p>With advent of server virtualization technologies, a host is able to
    support multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) in a single physical machine. Data Centers
    can leverage these capabilities to instantiate on the order of 10s to 100s of
    VMs in a single server with current technology. It is conceivable that this number
    can be much higher in the future. Each VM operates as an independent IP host with
    a set of Virtual Network Interface Cards (vNICs), each having its own MAC address
    and mapping to a physical Ethernet interface. These physical servers are typically
    installed in a rack with their Ethernet interfaces connected to a top-of-the-rack
    (ToR) switch. The ToR switches are interconnected through End-of-the-Row (EoR)
    or aggregation switches which are in turn connected to core switches. As discussed
    in [ARP-Problem] the host VMs use ARP broadcasts to find other host VMs and use
    periodic (broadcast) Gratuitous ARPs to refresh their IP to MAC address binding
    in other VM hosts. Such broadcasts in a large data center with potentially thousands
    of VM hosts in a Layer 2 based topology can overwhelm the network. This memo proposes
    mechanisms to reduce the number of broadcasts that are sent throughout the network.
    This is done by having the ToRs intelligently process ARP and frames, rather than
    simply broadcasting them throughout the broadcast domain. While this document
    addresses ARP, the Neighbor Discovery mechanisms used by the IPv6 hosts that make
    use of multicast rather than broadcast also pose similar issues in the Data Center.
    The solutions defined herein should be equally applicable to hosts running IPv6.
    The details will be specified in a subsequent revision.</p>"
