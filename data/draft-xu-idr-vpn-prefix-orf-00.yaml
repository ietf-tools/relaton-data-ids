abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP,
    refered to as "VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to
    perform VPN address-prefix-based route filtering. This ORF-type supports prefix-length-
    or range-based matching, wild- card-based address prefix matching, as well as
    the exact address prefix matching for VPN address families. The VPN Address Prefix
    ORF is applicable in the context of Virtual Subnet and may also be applicable
    in other BGP/MPLS IP VPN environments.</p>
