abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing policies define a set of rules and actions to be applied by
    proto- cols when they send and receive routing updates. When a protocol receives
    an updates, routing policies are used to determine if, and with what infor- mation
    a route gets added to the Routing Information Base (RIB). When preparing to send
    a routing update, routing policy is consulted to see if the route is to be sent
    and if so, what information is to be included in the update. The Routing Policy
    Configuration Language (RPCL) specifies a language for defining routing policies
    in a router.</p>"
