abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks continue to scale, we need a coordinated effort for diagnosing
    control plane health issues in heterogeneous environments. Traditionally, operators
    developed internal solutions to address the identification and remediation of
    control plane health issues, but as networks increase in size, speed and dynamicity,
    new methods and techniques will be required. This document highlights key network
    health issues, as well as network planning requirements, identified by leading
    network operators. It also provides an overview of current art and techniques
    that are used, but highlights key deficiencies and areas for improvement. This
    document proposes a unified management framework for coordinating diagnostics
    of control plane problems and optimization of network design. Furthermore, it
    outlines requirements for collecting, storing and analyzing control plane data,
    to minimise or negate control plane problems that may significantly affect overall
    network performance and to optimize path/peering/policy planning for meeting application-specific
    demands.</p>"
