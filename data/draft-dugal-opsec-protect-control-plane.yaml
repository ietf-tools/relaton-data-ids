abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane
    from undesired or malicious traffic. In this approach, all legitimate control
    plane traffic is identifed. Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter
    is deployed on the router's forwarding plane. That filter prevents traffic not
    specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane.</p>"
