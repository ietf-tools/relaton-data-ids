abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP Snoop database stores valid IPv4-to-MAC and IPv6-to-MAC bindings
    by snooping on Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) messages. These bindings
    are used by security functions like Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), Neighbor Discovery
    Inspection (NDI), IPv4 Source Guard, and IPv6 Source Guard to safeguard against
    traffic received with a spoofed address. These functions are collectively referred
    to as First Hop Security (FHS). This document proposes BGP extensions and new
    procedures to Ethernet VPN (EVPN) [RFC7432] for distribution and synchronization
    of DHCP snoop database to support FHS. Such synchronization is needed to support
    EVPN host mobility and multi- homing.</p>"
