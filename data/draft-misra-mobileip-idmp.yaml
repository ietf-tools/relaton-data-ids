abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces IDMP, a mobility protocol that supports routing
    of datagrams to a mobile node inside a mobility domain. A mobility domain essentially
    identifies a collection of IP subnets and networks that are aggregated together
    based on factors such as geographic proximity or administrative control. In addition
    to supporting basic redirection of packets to mobile nodes, IDMP also provides
    fast handoff support, with minimal packet losses due to mobility-related transients,
    and paging support to reduce the signaling burden on mobile nodes. IDMP uses two
    care-of addresses to manage mobility. The global care-of address identifies the
    mobile's current domain and remains unchanged as long as the mobile does not change
    domains. The local care-of address identifies the mobile's current point of attachment
    and changes every time a mobile node changes subnets. IDMP specifies two types
    of agents, Subnet Agents and Mobility Agents, to support this two-layer mobility
    hierarchy. By using two care-of addresses, IDMP removes the need for host-specific
    routing inside the domain and allows the use of multiple alternative protocols
    for supporting global mobility.</p>"
