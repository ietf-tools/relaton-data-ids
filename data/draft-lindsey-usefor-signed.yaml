abstract:
- content: "<p>The huge growth of Netnews/Usenet in recent years has been accompanied
    by many attempts to abuse the system by various forms of malpractice, particularly
    the forging of various headers, causing it to appear that articles came from parties
    other than those that actually injected them or conveyed some Approval that the
    real poster was not entitled to give. Insofar as Netnews is regularly gatwayed
    to and from Email systems, these problems also extend to the Email domain. This
    document provides a cryptographically secure means whereby it can be established
    beyond doubt that relevant headers of a Netnews article or an Email message have
    not been tampered with in transit, and that they were indeed originated by the
    person purporting to have done so. It seeks to supplement, rather than to supplant,
    the existing protocols for signing the bodies of articles and messages. [This
    proposal arises from the activities of the Usenet Format Working Group, which
    is charged with updating the Netnews standards. Comments are invited, preferably
    sent to the mailing list of the Group at usenet-format@landfield.com.]</p>"
