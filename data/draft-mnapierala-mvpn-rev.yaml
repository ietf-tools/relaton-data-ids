abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes inter-site signaling procedures in MPLS/BGP
    IP VPNs that allow the same multicast stream to flow simultaneously on multiple
    inter-PE paths without duplicates being sent to receivers. Those procedures are
    independent of multicast tunnel technology used in service provider network as
    well as of the protocol used to exchange multicast signaling among PE's. The document
    specifies necessary information elements and their exchange process for the desired
    MVPN operation.</p>"
