abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) is used for compressing the
    IP payload in transmission to increase communication performance. The IPComp is
    applied to the payload of the IP datagram, starting with the first octet immediately
    after the IP header in IPv4, and the first octet after the excluded IPv6 Extension
    headers. However, transport layer information such as source port and destination
    port are useful in many network functions in transmission. This document defines
    extensions of IP payload compression protocol (IPComp) to support compressing
    the payload excluding the transport layer information, to enable network functions
    using transport layer information (e.g., ECMP) working together with the payload
    compression. This document also defines an extension of IPComp to indicate the
    payload is not compressed to solve the out-of-order problems between the compressed
    and uncompressed packets.</p>"
