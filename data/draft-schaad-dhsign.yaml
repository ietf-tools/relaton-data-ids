- content: "<p>This document describes a method for producing a signature from a Diffie-Hellman
    key pair. This behavior is needed for such operations as creating a signature
    of a PKCS #10 certification request. This document describes two different flavors
    of the signature algorithm, one using a D-H key from a CA and the other using
    a temporary key created by the signer.</p>"
