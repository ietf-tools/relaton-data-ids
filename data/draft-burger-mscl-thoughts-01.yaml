abstract:
- content: "<p>IP mutli-function Media Server control is a problem that has slowly
    bubbled up in importance over the past four years. A driver in the IETF is the
    requirements generated by the XCON framework. Many approaches have been proposed.
    Some of these proposals are device- controlled-oriented, such as H.248. Others
    are server-oriented, using SIP and application-oriented markup. Before rushing
    headlong into a framework for a solution, it is time to step back and try to understand
    just what the scope of the problem is. Once consensus is reached, we can then
    move forward with a framework for a solution. This document describes a number
    of existing approaches and proposals to solve the Application Server - Media Server
    protocol problem, their characteristics and benefits and drawbacks.</p>"
