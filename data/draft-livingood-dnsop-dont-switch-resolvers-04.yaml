abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation by recursive DNS resolvers
    has been deployed at scale. However, domain signing tools and processes are not
    yet as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration
    tools and processes. This sometimes results in DNSSEC validation failures, for
    which operators of validating resolvers are often blamed. When these failures
    do occur, end users should not change to a non-validating DNS resolver, as that
    would downgrade their security. They should instead wait until the authoritative
    domain operator updates their DNS records to resolve the error and that change
    propagates across the Internet's DNS resolvers, the timing of which may be dependent
    upon the Time To Live (TTL) settings in the old and/or erroneous DNS resource
    records.</p>"
