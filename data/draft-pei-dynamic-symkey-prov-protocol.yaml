abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a symmetric key provisioning protocol that
    supports provisioning of symmetric keys (One Time Password (OTP) keys or symmetric
    cryptographic keys) and associated attributes dynamically to already issued different
    types of strong authentication devices. This work is a joint effort by the members
    of OATH (Initiative for Open AuTHentication) to specify a protocol that can be
    freely distributed to the technical community. The authors believe that a common
    and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two- factor authentication
    on the Internet by enabling interoperability between commercial and open-source
    implementations.</p>"
