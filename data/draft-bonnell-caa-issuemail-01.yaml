abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record
    type provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certification
    Authorities that may issue certificates for the domain. The core CAA specification
    ([RFC8659]) solely defines Property Tags that restrict the issuance of certificates
    that certify domain names; it does not define a mechanism for domains to restrict
    the issuance of certificates that include email addresses. This specification
    defines a Property Tag that grants authorization to Certification Authorities
    to issue certificates which certify email addresses.</p>"
