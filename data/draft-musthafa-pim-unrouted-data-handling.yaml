abstract:
- content: "<p>A shared-media LAN like Ethernet may have multiple PIM-SM routers connected
    to it. In a scenario where two or more routers are connected to the same LAN and
    if only one of the PIM-SM Routers has members joined for a particular group, all
    the other routers will receive the same traffic. Since no members are joined for
    this group in the routers, each time when data is received, the PIM-SM has the
    overhead of processing all these data packets in the control plane to decide where
    to route the packet. To avoid this, an (S, G) or (*, G) Entry with NULL Oif list
    is created so that discarding of the packets will be handled efficiently in the
    data plane as opposed to searching the route entry in the control plane and then
    dropping the packet.</p>"
