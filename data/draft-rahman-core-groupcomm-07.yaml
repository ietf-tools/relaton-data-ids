abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a working document intended to trigger discussion and develop
    draft text for the CoAP protocol specification in the area of group communication.
    Engineering tradeoffs become more challenging in constrained environments, therefore
    group communication is considered within the context of adjacent topics that may
    impact or be impacted by design choices in the subject area. A solution based
    on IP multicast is proposed.</p>"
