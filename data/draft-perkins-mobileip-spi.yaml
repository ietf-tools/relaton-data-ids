abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new SPI (Security Parameters Index) option
    for use with the Binding Authorization Data option. The new SPI option allows
    for selection of a particular mobility security association to handle the case
    when several such security associations may exist between nodes exchanging messages
    containing a mobility header requiring authorization. The SPI value may be set
    during manual configuration of the security association between two nodes, for
    example a mobile node and its home agent, or between a mobile node and a favored
    correspondent node.</p>"
