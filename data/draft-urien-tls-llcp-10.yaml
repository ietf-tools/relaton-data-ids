abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the support of the TLS protocol over the NFC
    (Near Field Communication) LLCP (Logical Link Control Protocol) layer, which is
    referred as LLCPS. The NFC peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be used by any application
    that needs communication between two devices at very small distances (a few centimeters).
    LLCPS enforces a strong security in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be deployed for
    many services, in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, such as payments, access
    control or ticketing operations. Applications secured by LLCPS are identified
    by the service name "urn:nfc:sn:tls:service".</p>
