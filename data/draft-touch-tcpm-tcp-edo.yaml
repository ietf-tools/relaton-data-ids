abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP segments include a Data Offset field to indicate space for TCP
    options, but the size of the field can limit the space available for complex options
    that have evolved. This document updates RFC 793 with an optional TCP extension
    to that space to support the use of multiple large options such as SACK with either
    TCP Multipath or TCP AO. It also explains why the initial SYN of a connection
    cannot be extending as a single segment.</p>"
