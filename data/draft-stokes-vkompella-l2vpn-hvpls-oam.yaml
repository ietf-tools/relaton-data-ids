abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a methodology for testing the operation, administration
    and maintenance (OA&amp;M) of a general VPN service, that is applied here to Hierarchical
    Virtual Private LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS]. As part of this methodology,
    the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP-PING] are extended to enable HVPLS spoke-
    to-spoke connectivity testing. The approaches to identifying OAM packets has also
    been made compatible with [LSP-PING] and [PWE3-VCCV]. These are the goals of this
    draft: - checking connectivity between 'service-aware' nodes of a network, - verifying
    data plane and control plane integrity, - verifying service membership There are
    two specific requirements to which we call attention because of their seemingly
    contradictory nature: - the checking of connectivity MUST involve the ability
    to use packets that look like customer packets - the OAM packets MUST not propagate
    beyond the boundary of the provider network</p>"
