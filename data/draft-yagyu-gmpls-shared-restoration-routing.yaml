abstract:
- content: "<p>Shared mesh restoration technique efficiently uses network resources
    since restoration capacity is shared across multiple independent failures. In
    this scheme, when a new working LSP is established, its corresponding backup LSP
    is pre-calculated and resources along the restoration route are reserved. The
    resources reserved on each link along the restoration path may be shared across
    different working LSPs that are not expected to fail simultaneously. To make the
    method for selection of backup LSPs more efficient in terms of utilization of
    network resources, each link should provide the route calculator with information
    about its restoration capacity and SRLGs of working LSPs whose backup LSPs share
    the link restoration capacity. In this document we propose extensions to OSPF-TE
    in support of carrying link 'Sharable Bandwidth' information.</p>"
