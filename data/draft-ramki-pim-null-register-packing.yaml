abstract:
- content: "<p>In PIM-SM networks PIM registers are sent from the first hop router
    to the RP (Rendezvous Point) to signal the presence of Multicast source in the
    network. There are periodic PIM Null registers sent from first hop router to the
    RP to keep the state alive at the RP as long as the source is active. The PIM
    Null register packet carries information about a single Multicast source and group.
    This document defines a standard to send multiple Multicast source and group information
    in a single pim Null register packet and the interoperability between the PIM
    routers which do not understand the packet format with multiple Multicast source
    and group details.</p>"
