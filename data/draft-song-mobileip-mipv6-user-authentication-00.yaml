abstract:
- content: "<p>The demand for wireless mobile networking has been dramatically increased
    thanks to rapid development of Wireless technology and de facto Mobile IP technology.
    Mobile IP, as originally specified, defines the protocol enhancements that can
    provide IP mobility over the Internet. The mobile node, identified by its Home
    Address regardless its attaching point can have transparent routing of IP datagrams.
    However it is also necessary to provide User Mobility in nowadays wireless mobile
    network. The user authentication which is defining in this document is to help
    user to originate and terminate the packet regardless of the location of mobile
    terminal and without home address through AAA infrastructure. This document specifies
    the mechanism for the MN-AAA authentication in Mobile IPv6 for IP User Mobility
    support.</p>"
