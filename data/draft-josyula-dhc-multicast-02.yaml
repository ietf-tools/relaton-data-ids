abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) is a system facilitating transmission
    of television channels as multicast streams use dedicated multicast group addresses
    in IP networks. Internet Group Multicast Protocol(IGMP) is widely used for the
    communication between hosts and routers to deliver the multicast streams in the
    IPv4 networks. Similarly,Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol (MLD)is used for
    the communication between the hosts and routers to deliver the multicast streams
    in the IPv6 networks. It is also possible for the networks to distinguish these
    multicast streams not only by their destination multicast group but also by the
    source IP address of the streams. IGMP version-3 and MLD version-2 are protocols
    that allow the hosts to inform the neighboring routers about their desire to receive
    the multicast streams from specific source IP addresses. This needs a mechanism
    to supply the available multicast source address information to the hosts and
    the hosts also should be strictly implemented with the source specific multicasting
    aware protocols such as above mentioned IGMPv3 or MLDv2. This document describes
    a new DHCP option which can addresses these issues. In addition to this, the document
    also describes about the advantages in the networks by implementing this option.</p>"
