abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling traffic
    and may be found in unmanaged scenarios competing for network resources both with
    other PWs and with non-PW traffic, such as TCP/IP flows. Thus, it is worthwhile
    specifying under what conditions such competition is acceptable, i.e., the PW
    traffic does not significantly harm other traffic or contribute more than it should
    to congestion. We conclude that PWs transporting responsive traffic behave as
    desired without the need for additional mechanisms. For inelastic PWs (such as
    Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) PWs), we derive a bound under which such PWs
    consume no more network capacity than a TCP flow. For TDM PWs, we find that the
    level of congestion at which the PW can no longer deliver acceptable TDM service
    is never significantly greater, and is typically much lower, than this bound.
    Therefore, as long as the PW is shut down when it can no longer deliver acceptable
    TDM service, it will never do significantly more harm than even a single TCP flow.
    If the TDM service does not automatically shut down, a mechanism to block persistently
    unacceptable TDM pseudowires is required.</p>"
