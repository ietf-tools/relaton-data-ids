abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines how HTTP Digest Authentication [Digest]
    can be used as a SASL [RFC 2222] mechanism for any protocol that has a SASL profile.
    It is intended both as an improvement over CRAM-MD5 [RFC 2195] and as a convenient
    way to support a single authentication mechanism for web, mail, LDAP, and other
    protocols.</p>"
