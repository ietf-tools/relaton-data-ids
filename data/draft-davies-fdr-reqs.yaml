- content: "<p>This document sets out a set of requirements which we believe are desirable
    for the future routing architecture and routing protocols of a successful Internet.
    This first version is, of necessity, incomplete. It is hoped that this document
    will be useful as a catalyst to the work that needs to be done in both the IRTF
    and the IETF.</p>"
