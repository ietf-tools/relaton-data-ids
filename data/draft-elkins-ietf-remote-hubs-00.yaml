abstract:
- content: <p>Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite a few
    regions. There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are organized. Latin
    America has quite a few remote hubs as does India. The two regions are different
    in how they arose, where they meet, and what they do. Thus, creating a template
    for a remote hub may not work because hubs may be very different across cultures
    and of very different sizes. Lastly, this document discusses how IETF "central"
    can assist with remote hubs.</p>
