abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS labels
    are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN, the packet
    header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30
    bytes, for example. Header compression can significantly reduce the overhead through
    various compression mechanisms, such as enhanced compressed RTP (ECRTP). We consider
    using MPLS to route ECRTP compressed packets over an MPLS LSP without compression/decompression
    cycles at each router. Such an ECRTP over MPLS capability can increase the bandwidth
    efficiency as well as processing scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous
    compressed flows that use header compression at each router. In this draft we
    propose to use RSVP-TE extensions to signal the header compression context and
    other control messages between the ingress and egress LSR. We re-use the methods
    in ECRTP to determine the context.</p>"
