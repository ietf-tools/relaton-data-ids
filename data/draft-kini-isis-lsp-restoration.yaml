abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label switched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with bandwidth guarantees (for
    label switched paths). The reliability of these LSPs can be increased by providing
    a backup LSP onto which traffic can be switched upon failure of an element in
    the path of the active LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth
    can be shared between backup links of more than one active path while still guaranteeing
    recoverability for a set of failures. This sharing greatly increases the network
    efficiency thereby increasing the number of LSPs that can be carried while maintaining
    guarantees. Algorithms which can route such recoverable LSPs while using only
    aggregate network usage information are being developed. To route the active LSP
    and the (possibly shared) backup LSP, the topology information of the network
    is needed and this can be provided by a link state routing protocol like IS-IS.
    This document describes the encoding of the additional information within the
    link state protocol data unit (LSPdu) of IS-IS to enable routing of shared backup
    paths.</p>"
