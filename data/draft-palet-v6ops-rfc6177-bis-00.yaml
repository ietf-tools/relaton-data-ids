abstract:
- content: '<p>The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies, have different views
    regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to end-sites. However,
    all them allow up to a /48 without further justification and clearly state that
    the exact choice of how much address space should be assigned to end-sites is
    a decision of each operator. In fact, the operational community has recently developed
    a document with also covers this topic "Best Current Operational Practice for
    Operators: IPv6 prefix assignment for end-users - persistent vs non-persistent,
    and what size to choose". This document reviews the architectural and operational
    considerations of end-site assignments, and reiterates that assignment policy
    and guidelines belong to the RIR community. This revision is being made to emphasize
    that IPv6 protocol evolution requires an ever increasing availability of subnets
    at the end-site and so, policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet
    is no longer appropriate unless the recipient explicitly agrees to the limitations
    implied by such an assignment. This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment
    to End Sites).</p>'
