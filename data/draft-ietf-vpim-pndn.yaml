abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the interaction between systems sending multi-part
    Internet mail [2] to systems that cannot render parts of the sent message. In
    particular, this document describes an extension to the Delivery Status Notification
    mechanism described in [3]. An example of partial message delivery failure is
    the case when a user sends an audio file and a video file to an Internet Voice
    Mail [4] system. The Internet Voice Mail system can render the audio part but
    not the video part. In this case, a partial delivery occurs. This document reflects
    work undertaken in support of the Internet Voice Mail and Voice Profile for Internet
    Mail [5] initiatives. The VPIM Work Group home page is &lt;http://www.ema.org/vpim&gt;.</p>"
