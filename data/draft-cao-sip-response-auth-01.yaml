abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes some extensions for enhancing SIP response authentication.
    In the real-world SIP deployment, TLS may be not available on some hops. Due to
    the lack of other response authentication mechanisms in SIP, several kinds of
    security attacks could be conducted on those hops through SIP response. This draft
    suggests some approaches for complementary enhancement on SIP response authentication.
    With the new per-hop response authentication proposed in this draft, the security
    gaps on the hops without TLS can be bridged.</p>"
