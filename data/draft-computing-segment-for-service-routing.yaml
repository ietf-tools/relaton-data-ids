abstract:
- content: "<p>Since services delivered from cloud need delicate coordination among
    the client, network and cloud, this draft defines a new Segment to provide service
    routing and addressing functions by leveraging SRv6 Segment programming capabilities.
    With Computing Segments proposed, the network gains its capability to identify
    and process SAN header in need and a complete service routing procedure can be
    achieved.</p>"
