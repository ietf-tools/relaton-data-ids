abstract:
- content: "<p>On February 27-28, 1997, the IPng Working Group held an interim meeting
    in Palo Alto, California to consider adopting Mike O'Dell's 'GSE - An Alternate
    Addressing Architecture for IPv6' proposal [GSE]. In GSE, 16-byte IPv6 addresses
    are split into distinct portions for global routing, local routing and end-point
    identification. GSE includes the feature of configuring a node internal to a site
    with only the local routing and end-point identification portions of the address,
    thus hiding the full address from the node. When such a node generates a packet,
    only the low-order bytes of the source address are specified; the high-order bytes
    of the address are filled in by a border router when the packet leaves the site.</p>"
