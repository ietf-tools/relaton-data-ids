abstract:
- content: "<p>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
    by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible that the
    call-taker feels the need for further communication. For example, the call may
    have been dropped by accident without the call- taker having sufficient information
    about the current situation of a wounded person. A call-taker may trigger a callback
    towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial
    emergency call. This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like
    any other call and as a consequence it may get blocked by authorization policies
    or may get forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF emergency services architecture
    offers capabilities to allow callbask to bypass authorization policies to reach
    the caller without unnecessary delays. However, the mechanism specified prior
    to this document supports only limited scenarios. This document discusses some
    shortcomings, presents additional scenarios where better-than- normal call treatment
    behavior would be desirable, and specifies a protocol solution.</p>"
