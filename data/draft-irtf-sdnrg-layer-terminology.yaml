abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach for network
    programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage
    network behavior dynamically via open interfaces. SDN emphasizes the role of software
    in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding
    plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane. This separation allows
    faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown. However,
    there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what the layer structure
    is in an SDN architecture, and how layers interface with each other. This document,
    a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research Group (SDNRG), addresses
    these questions and provides a concise reference for the SDN research community
    based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC series, and relevant documents
    by other standards organizations.</p>"
