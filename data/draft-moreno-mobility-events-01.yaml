abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the management of the mobility events considered
    in SPIRITS protocol and the definition of their related parameters. The mobility
    events management will allow a SPIRITS server to subscribe to and to be notified
    of location changes of a mobile user. The events would only be applicable to mobile
    users reachable through a CS network. The sending of these events must be allowed
    by setting the related marks in the HLR. Besides, the SPIRITS protocol must be
    able to translate the CAMEL operations involving mobility information into events
    that can be transferred to the SPIRITS client.</p>"
