abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success
    in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive,
    IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions,
    but it also has been extended to better fit the specificities of the different
    use cases. For Internet addressing in particular, as it is defined in RFC 791
    for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist many extensions. Those
    extensions have been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities beyond the
    basic properties of Internet addressing. This document discusses the properties
    the IP addressing model, showcasing the continuing need to extend it and the methods
    used for doing so.</p>"
