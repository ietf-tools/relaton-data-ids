abstract:
- content: "<p>[OSPF-ASON] defines OSPFv2 extensions to fulfill the requirements defined
    in [RFC4258]. In OIF discussion of ASON routing, OIF members have noted that some
    additional functionality beyond that defined in [OSPF-ASON] would be useful for
    deployment of ASON routing by OIF carriers. The purpose of this document is to
    list such additional functionalities, so that CCAMP experts study whether such
    functionalities can be fulfilled by existing GMPLS mechanisms, or whether extensions
    to [OSPF-ASON] are required. Some proposals for potential extensions are provided
    for review by IETF CCAMP.</p>"
