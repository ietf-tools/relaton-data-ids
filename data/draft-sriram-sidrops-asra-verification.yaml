abstract:
- content: "<p>Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) record authorizes provider
    ASes of a customer AS (CAS). While ASPA-based AS_PATH verification can correctly
    detect and mitigate route leaks and some forged-origin or forged-path-segment
    hijacks, it fails to detect some malicious path manipulations for routes that
    are received from transit providers. This document utilizes a new RPKI object
    called Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA) that significantly
    enhances AS_PATH verification complementing ASPA. ASRA fills in a significant
    gap in the ASPA method by adding the capability to detect fake links in the AS_PATHs
    in BGP Updates propagated from providers to customers. ASRA achieves this by allowing
    an AS to register additional AS relationships, i.e., customers and lateral peers.</p>"
