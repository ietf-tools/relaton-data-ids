abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes a mechanism to extend the record header in DTLS.
    To that aim, the DTLS header is modified as follows: the length field is trimmed
    to 15 bits, and the length''s top bit is given the "record header extension indicator"
    semantics, allowing a sender to signal that one or more record header extensions
    have been added to this record. We define the generic format of a record header
    extension and the general rules associated with its handling. Any details regarding
    syntax, semantics and negotiation of a specific record header extension, are left
    to future documents.</p>'
