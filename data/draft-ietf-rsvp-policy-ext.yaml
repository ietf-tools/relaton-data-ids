abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a set of extensions for supporting generic policy
    based admission control in RSVP. [Note 1] These extensions include the standard
    format of POLICY_DATA objects, a generic RSVP/Policy-Control interface, and a
    description of RSVP's handling of policy events. This document does not advocate
    particular policy control mechanisms; however, a Router/Server Policy Protocol
    description for these extensions can be found in [LPM].</p>"
