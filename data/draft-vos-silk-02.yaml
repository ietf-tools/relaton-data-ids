abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SILK, a speech codec for real-time, packet-
    based voice communications. Targeting a diverse range of operating environments,
    SILK provides scalability in several dimensions. Four different sampling frequencies
    are supported for encoding the audio input signal. Adaptation to network characteristics
    is provided through control of bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience and
    use of discontinuous transmission (DTX). And several different complexity levels
    let SILK take advantage of available processing power without relying on it. Each
    of these properties can be adjusted during operation of the codec on a frame-by-frame
    basis.</p>"
