abstract:
- content: "<p>Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4
    address exhaustion approaches, IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical
    and less tractable. Host-based transition mechanisms used in dual-stack environments
    cannot meet all transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert
    to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN)
    devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational changes
    required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document
    proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6
    access services for IPv6 hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving
    much of a legacy ISP network unchanged during the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6
    migration. Unlike CGN alone, incremental CGN also supports and encourages smooth
    transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. An integrated configurable
    CGN device and an adaptive home gateway (HG) device are described. Both are reusable
    during different transition phases, avoiding multiple upgrades. This enables IPv6
    migration to be incrementally achieved according to real user requirements. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
