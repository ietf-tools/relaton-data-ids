abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes two RTP payload formats for in-band telephony signal
    events (TSE) such as DTMF, dial-tone, ring-tone, off-hook, SIT, etc. One payload
    is designed to carry a named signal, and the other is designed carry a compact
    representation of actual audio waveform cadence to be played. The two formats
    are independent, but they can be used together very usefully within redundant
    audio payloads; this enables highly efficient and robust transport of telephony
    network signal events along with a representation of the actual audio media associated
    to the signal events. Acknowledgements: This internet draft is an extension of
    H. Schulzrinne's draft ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt and borrows heavily from it (including
    copying actual text). The main extensions appearing in this draft are as follows:
    a) many other telephony call progress tones and signal events have been added
    to the original DTMF and flash-hook of ietf-avt-dtmf-00.txt (an attempt has been
    made to align this with [MGCP] and [E.180 supp2] b) a second payload is defined
    which carries a highly compact frequency representation of the audio waveform
    of the signal; c) a few clarifications about reliability and redundancy, including
    how the two payloads will work together. Acknowledgement is also due to [MGCP];
    part of this draft is an attempt to use RTP to provide the signal transport required
    by MGCP, in a way which can be reused by a large class of applications.</p>"
