abstract:
- content: "<p>In Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers
    may limit them to maintaining at most a few routes. In some configurations, it
    is necessary to use these memory constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes
    within the LLN. The Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) protocol can
    be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g. the
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram
    using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory constrained
    routers. This document specifies a new IPv6 Routing header type for delivering
    datagrams within a RPL domain.</p>"
