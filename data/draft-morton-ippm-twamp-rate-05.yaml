abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes two rate-measurement features for the core specification
    of TWAMP - the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol: an optional capability where
    the reflector host responds with a controlled burst of test-session packets (instead
    of a single packet), and an optional test mode that requires the responder to
    measure a burst of test packets and communicate the results in truncated packet(s).
    Both features add the ability to control packet size in the tested direction,
    enabling asymmetrical packet size testing. This draft defines the modes in terms
    of traditional UDP test packets. Use of TCP transport instead of UDP may be desirable,
    but is deferred to other work.</p>"
