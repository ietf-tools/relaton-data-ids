abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the SMTP service [RFC1425],
    called Extended DATA Reply. This is an extended format of the SMTP response to
    the DATA verb which provides recipient-specific status information. This allows
    mail recipients to use individual mail filters as part of the Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol. This is a very desirable feature because of escalating amounts of unwanted
    junk E- mail sent over the Internet.</p>"
