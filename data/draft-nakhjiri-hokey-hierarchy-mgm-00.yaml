abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generic delivery framework for usage and/
    or domain specific keys, derived as part of an EAP EMSK hierarchy, from an EAP
    server to an intended third party key holder. The framework description includes
    different scenarios for key delivery, depending on the type of keys being delivered.
    It also includes, specification of derivation of keys required for security protection
    of key requests and delivery signaling. The key delivery framework also includes
    proper specification and conveyance of the context and scope of the keys being
    delivered. All keys generated directly from EMSK as part of the EMSK key hierarchy
    are derived following the guidelines described in [I-D.ietf-hokey-emsk-hierarchy].
    Derivation of the EMSK based handover root key (HRK) and domain specific handover
    root keys (DSHRK) for use in the problem of handover keying and re-authentication
    is also described.</p>"
