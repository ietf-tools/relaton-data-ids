abstract:
- content: "<p>The PIM version 2 messages share a common message header format. The
    common header definition contains eight reserved bits. This document specifies
    how these bits may be used by individual message types and creates a registry
    containing the per-message-type usage. This document also extends the PIM type
    space by defining three new message types. For each of the new types, four of
    the previously reserved bits are used to form an extended type range. This document
    updates RFCs 7761 and 3973 by defining the use of the currently Reserved field
    in the PIM common header. This document further updates RFCs 7761 and 3973, along
    with RFCs 5015, 5059, 6754, and 8364, by specifying the use of the currently reserved
    bits for each PIM message. This document obsoletes RFC 6166.</p>"
