abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) elements for the purpose of exchanging structured information in close to
    real time between any two or more network-aware entities. XMPP provides a generalized,
    extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety
    of applications can be built. The framework includes methods for stream setup
    and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of
    one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication
    of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions.
    This document also specifies the format for XMPP addresses, which are fully internationalizable.
    This document obsoletes RFC 3920.</p>
