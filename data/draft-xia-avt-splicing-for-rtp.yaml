- content: "<p>This memo outlines RTP splicing. Splicing is a process that allows
    a new multimedia stream to be inserted into current multimedia stream and to be
    conveyed to receiver for a period of time. This memo discusses the requirements
    of RTP splicing. In order to satisfy the requirements, this memo lists several
    existing intermediary network elements as alternatives and evaluates whether one
    of alternatives can be used to perform RTP splicing.</p>"
