abstract:
- content: "<p>In view of the characteristics of multi-domain optical networks under
    hierarchical PCE architecture and its key management needs, a novel key management
    scheme (KMS-KI) based on key hypergraph and in this paper identity-based cryptography
    was proposed. The key relationship of multi-domain optical networks was firstly
    modeled into key hypergraph with two layers, namely the vertices was represented
    by points and the key relation at all levels was described with hyperedge. And
    the master keys, the public keys and private keys, the session keys, the layer
    group keys and the inter-domain keys were generated respectively and were dynamic
    managed by using hierarchical identity-based cryptography and improved private
    key generation strategies. When the group members join or leave, the remaining
    group members autonomously used the key value of the pPCE or cPCE to calculate
    and update the group key. So the risk that the new group key was uncovered by
    adversary was greatly reduced. KMS-KI scheme possessed the security performance
    of forward and backward, confidentiality of private keys and the ability of resisting
    collusive attack. Meanwhile, it not only supported the using of hierarchical identity-based
    cryptography, but also had performed comprehensively well in terms of numbers
    of the key storage, numbers of cPCE communication, encryption and decryption times.</p>"
