abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a specific Topology Plugin using a ramification
    of the basic One Hop Lookups based DHT algorithm which is called ONE- HOP-RELOAD.
    In the One Hop Lookups algorithm, each peer maintains a full routing table containing
    information about every node on the overlay in order to route RELOAD message in
    one hop. Compared with CHORD-RELOAD algorithm, ONE-HOP-RELOAD improves the routing
    efficiency, and can maintain complete membership information with reasonable bandwidth
    requirements. This algorithm is able to handle frequent membership changes by
    superimposing a well-defined hierarchy on the system that guarantees topology
    disturbance events notification reach every peer in the overlay within a specified
    amount of time. Currently some typical peer-to-peer storages systems have stringent
    latency requirements, such as Amazon's Dynamo which is built for latency sensitive
    applications uses One-Hop algorithm, so that each node maintains enough routing
    information locally to route a request to the appropriate node directly.</p>"
