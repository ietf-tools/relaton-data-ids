abstract:
- content: <p>When RFC 6374 "Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks"
    were developed, the code points allocated by this RFC were mistakenly placed within
    the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameter
    registry. This document creates a new dedicated name space for Generic Associated
    Channel code points and move them to a name space their own.</p>
