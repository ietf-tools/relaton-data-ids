abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides definitions, formats, references, and citations
    for cryptographic algorithms, usage modes, and associated identifiers and parameters
    used in support of the FORTEZZA suite of cryptographic algorithms with Privacy
    Enhanced Mail (PEM) [4,5] and MIME Object Security Services (MOSS) [10]. This
    document is organized in the same manner as RFC 1423 [5]. It is divided into four
    primary sections, dealing with message encryption algorithms, message integrity
    check algorithms, symmetric key management algorithms, and asymmetric key management
    algorithms (including both asymmetric encryption and asymmetric signature algorithms).</p>"
