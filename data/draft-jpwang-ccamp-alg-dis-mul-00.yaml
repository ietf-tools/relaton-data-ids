abstract:
- content: "<p>The routing problem of multi-domain optical network includes intra-domain
    routing and inter-domain routing.Although the intra-domain routing algorithm has
    been well studied, the inter-domain routing computation in distributed multi-domain
    optical network still presents many problems and needs further research. Compared
    to single domain, the routing computation in multi-domain network needs topology
    abstraction.In this paper, we first have full-mesh topology abstraction improved,
    and then present a novel algorithm to calculate the inter-domain routing. By computing
    the shortest path based on the available wavelengths, the proposed algorithm improves
    the performance of routing provision. Simulation results show that the new algorithm
    achieves the satisfactory blocking performance.</p>"
