abstract:
- content: "<p>CRCP (Camera Recorder Control Protocol) is designed after FTP to be
    useful to operate realtime/batch analog/digital video cameras and video/audio
    recorders over the Internet. The design of CRCP is completely modular. A unit
    consists of several subunits and CRCP currently specifies units POWER, STREAM,
    TAPE and CAMERA. However, CRCP allows arbitrary combination of subunits to make
    it useful to control any home electronics units.</p>"
