abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the use of ROHC header compression mechanisms
    for the NEMO Basic Support protocol [7]. The idea is to use both NEMO and ROHC
    as they have been defined. In the NEMO Basic Support protocol, the tunneling between
    the Mobile Router (MR) and the Home Agent (HA) of the MR is done over different
    access technologies. Some of these technologies are wireless (e.g. Wireless LAN,
    3G or PPP) and have scarce resources by nature, the use of ROHC compression can
    be useful to reduce the bandwidth consumption.</p>"
