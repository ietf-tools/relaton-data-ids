abstract:
- content: "<p>Nested NATs or multi-layer NATs are already widely deployed. They are
    characterized by two or more NAT devices in the path of packets from the subscriber
    to the Internet. Moreover, NAT devices current deployed are PCP unaware and It
    is assumed that NAT aware PCP devices will take a long time to be rolled out.
    Therefore in order to lower the adoption barrier of PCP and make it work for current
    deployed networks, this document proposes a few mechanisms for PCP-enabled applications
    to work through NATs with varying levels of PCP protocol support.</p>"
