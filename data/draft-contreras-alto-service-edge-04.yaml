abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers are starting to deploy and interconnect computing
    capabilities across the network for hosting network functions and applications.
    In distributed computing environments, both computing and topological information
    are necessary in order to determine the more convenient infrastructure where to
    deploy such a service or application. This document proposes an initial approach
    towards the use of ALTO to provide such information and assist the selection of
    appropriate deployment locations for services and applications.</p>"
