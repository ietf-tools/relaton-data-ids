abstract:
- content: <p>Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has
    no staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel to the location
    to perform the initial install and configuration, even in shared facilities with
    "remote-hands" (or similar) support. In many cases, this could be avoided if there
    were an easy way to transfer the initial configuration to a new device while still
    maintaining confidentiality of the configuration. This document extends existing
    vendor proprietary auto-install to provide limited confidentiality to initial
    configuration during bootstrapping of the device.</p>
