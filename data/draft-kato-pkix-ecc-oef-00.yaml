abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 [X.660] encoding
    formats for additional elliptic curve field for digital signatures and subject
    public keys used in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This specification
    supplements [RFC 3280], 'Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure: Certificate
    and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile.' and [RFC3279] 'Algorithms and
    Identifiers for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and Certificate
    Revocation List (CRL) Profile. ' Implementations of this specification MUST also
    conform to RFC 3280 and RFC 3279. In RFC 3279 only prime-field and two-characteristic-field
    were used as field which defines an elliptic curve. This document introduce odd-characteristic-extension-field
    as the 3rd field.</p>"
