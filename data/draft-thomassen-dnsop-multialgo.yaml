abstract:
- content: "<p>This document restates the requirements on DNSSEC signing and validation
    and makes small adjustments order to allow for more flexible handling of configurations
    that advertise multiple Secure Entry Points (SEP) with different signing algorithms
    via their DS record or trust anchor set. The adjusted rules allow both for multi-
    signer operation and for transfer of signed DNS zones between providers, without
    requiring that each provider uses the same signing algorithm. In addition, the
    proposal enables pre-publication of a trust anchor in preparation for an algorithm
    rollover, such as of the root zone. This document updates RFCs 4035, 6840, and
    8624.</p>"
