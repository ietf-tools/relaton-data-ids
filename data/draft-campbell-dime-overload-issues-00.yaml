abstract:
- content: <p>The Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (DIME) working group has undertaken
    an "overload control" work item, with the goal of standardizing a mechanism to
    allow Diameter nodes to report overload information among themselves. Requirements
    currently include, among others, the need to accurately report the scope of overload
    conditions, and the ability to report overload information between nodes that
    are not directly connected at the transport layer. These requirements introduce
    complex issues. This document describes those issues, in the hope that it will
    assist the working group's decision process.</p>
