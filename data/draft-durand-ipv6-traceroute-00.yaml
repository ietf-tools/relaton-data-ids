abstract:
- content: "<p>The traceroute program has proven very useful and has been extensively
    used in the Internet for measurement and debugging purposes. However, it only
    shows the originator to target path and gives no indication on the reverse path.
    Source routing may sometimes be used to find it, but it's very often disable by
    intermediary routers. Another problem occurs when packets do not follow the same
    routes: traceroute outputs are very difficult to read. Other solutions has been
    proposed to record the route taken by an IPv4 packet. Originally, IPv4 contains
    an option in which every intermediary router can add its address [RFC791]. Unfortunately,
    the limitation in size imposed by the options design of IPv4 limits its use to
    9 routers. In [RFC1393] another strategy was proposed. An new IPv4 option was
    created. When a router receives a packet containing this option, it generates
    a ICMP Echo message to the source. This technique couldn't be widely deployed
    in IPv4 because it needed a change in every single router to be efficient. These
    two methods create less traffic on the network and are more accurate, since they
    give the real route taken by packets and are less sensitive to fluttering. The
    IPv6 deployment could be the opportunity to widely deploy a new traceroute mechanism
    based on those two methods. We propose to combine the two previous methods by
    defining a new hop-by-hop option and a new ICMP message type to record the direct
    path from the originator to the target and the reverse path from the target to
    the originator.</p>"
