abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a threat model for the context in which External
    Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP) path security mechanisms will be developed. The
    threat model includes an analysis of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
    and focuses on the ability of an Autonomous System (AS) to verify the authenticity
    of the AS path info received in a BGP update. We use the term "PATHSEC" to refer
    to any BGP path security technology that makes use of the RPKI. PATHSEC will secure
    BGP, consistent with the inter-AS security focus of the RPKI. The document characterizes
    classes of potential adversaries that are considered to be threats and examines
    classes of attacks that might be launched against PATHSEC. It does not revisit
    attacks against unprotected BGP, as that topic has already been addressed in the
    BGP-4 standard. It concludes with a brief discussion of residual vulnerabilities.</p>
