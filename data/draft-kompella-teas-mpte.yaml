abstract:
- content: "<p>Shortest path routing offers an easy-to-understand, easy-to-implement
    method of establishing loop-free connectivity in a network, but offers few other
    features. Equal-cost multipath (ECMP), a simple extension, uses multiple equal-cost
    paths between any two points in a network: at any node in a path (really, Directed
    Acyclic Graph), traffic can be (typically equally) load-balanced among the next
    hops. ECMP is easy to add on to shortest path routing, and offers a few more features,
    such as resiliency and load distribution, but the feature set is still quite limited.
    Traffic Engineering (TE), on the other hand, offers a very rich toolkit for managing
    traffic flows and the paths they take in a network. A TE network can have link
    attributes such as bandwidth, colors, risk groups and alternate metrics. A TE
    path can use these attributes to include or avoid certain links, increase path
    diversity, manage bandwidth reservations, improve service experience, and offer
    protection paths. However, TE typically doesn't offer multipathing as the tunnels
    used to implement TE usually take a single path. This memo proposes multipath
    traffic-engineering (MPTE), combining the best of ECMP and TE. The multipathing
    proposed here need not be strictly equal-cost, nor the load balancing equally
    weighted to each next hop. Moreover, the desired destination may be reachable
    via multiple egresses. The proposal includes a protocol for signaling MPTE paths
    using various types of tunnels, some of which are better suited to multipathing.</p>"
