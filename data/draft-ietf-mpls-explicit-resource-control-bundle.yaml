abstract:
- content: "<p>Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used extensively
    by the service providers. However, when TE links are bundled, identification of
    label resource in Record Route object (RRO) is not sufficient to determine the
    component link within a TE link that is being used by a given LSP. In other words,
    when link bundling is used, resource recording requires mechanisms to specify
    the component link identifier, along with the TE link identifier and Label. As
    it is not possible to record component link in the RRO, this document defines
    the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers
    for resource recording purposes.</p>"
