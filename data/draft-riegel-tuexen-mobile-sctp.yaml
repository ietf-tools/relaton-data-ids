abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport layer mobility management is presented in addition to Mobile
    IP for providing seamless mobility in the Internet. By use of SCTP (Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol) and some of its currently proposed extensions a seamless
    handover can be fully accomplished in the mobile client without any provisions
    in the network, only assisted by functions embedded in Mobile SCTP enabled servers.
    Client mobility management based on Mobile SCTP seems not to require any new protocol
    development. It is a particular application of SCTP eventually solving the requirements
    of transport layer mobility in the Internet.</p>"
