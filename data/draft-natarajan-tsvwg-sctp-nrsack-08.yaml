abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] specifies Selective
    Acknowledgements (SACKs) to allow an SCTP data receiver to acknowledge DATA chunks
    which arrive out-of-order. In SCTP, SACK information is advisory -- though SACKs
    notify a data sender about the reception of specific out-of-order data, the SCTP
    data receiver is permitted to later discard the data, a.k.a reneging. Since delivery
    of a SACKed out-of-order DATA chunk is not guaranteed, a copy of this DATA chunk
    MUST be kept in the data sender's retransmission queue until this DATA chunk is
    cumulatively acked. By definition, data that has been delivered to the application
    is non-renegable by the SCTP data receiver. (Recall that, in SCTP, out- of-order
    data can sometimes be delivered.) Also, SCTP implementations can be configured
    such that the SCTP data receiver is not allowed to, and therefore, never reneges
    on out-of-order data. With SCTP's current SACK mechanism, non-renegable out-of-order
    data is selectively acked, and is (wrongly) deemed renegable by the SCTP data
    sender. This document specifies an extension to SCTP's acknowledgment mechanism
    called Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements (NR-SACKs.) NR-SACKs enable a
    data receiver to explicitly inform the data sender of non-renegable out-of-order
    data. As opposed to renegable data, a data sender can consider non-renegable data
    as never requiring retransmission, and therefore can remove non-renegable data
    from the retransmission queue.</p>"
