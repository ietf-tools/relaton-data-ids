abstract:
- content: <p>In dense topologies (such as data center fabrics based on the Clos and
    butterfly topologies, though not limited to these), IGP flooding mechanisms designed
    for sparse topologies can "overflood," or carry too many copies of topology and
    reachability information to fabric devices. This results in slower convergence
    times and higher resource utilization. The modifications to the flooding mechanism
    in the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) link state protocol
    described in this document reduce resource utilization significantly, while increasing
    convergence performance in dense topologies. Note that a Clos fabric is used as
    the primary example of a dense flooding topology throughout this document. However,
    the flooding optimizations described in this document apply to any topology.</p>
