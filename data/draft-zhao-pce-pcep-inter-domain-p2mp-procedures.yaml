abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) across multiple domains has
    been identified as a key requirement for the deployment of P2MP services in MPLS
    and GMPLS networks. The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been recognized as
    an appropriate technology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP
    TE LSPs. This document describes the procedures and extensions to the PCE communication
    Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses for the computation of inter-domain
    paths for P2MP TE LSPs.</p>"
