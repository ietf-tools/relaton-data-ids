abstract:
- content: "<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is extensively used and is widely
    believed to provide security that is more than adequate. Several other cipher
    designs have been proposed for use in standards, and new designs continue to be
    developed, while consideration of cost and complexity impels that the number of
    mandatory-to-implement ciphers be minimized. This note outlines an approach to
    the selection of cryptographic algorithms that best serves the needs of the users
    of cryptography: AES should continue in its role as the mandatory-to-implement
    cipher, while other cipher designs should be reviewed with the goal of selecting
    a single standby cipher. If future advances in the science of cryptanalysis uncover
    security issues with the AES, the standby cipher will be ready for adoption as
    its replacement.</p>"
