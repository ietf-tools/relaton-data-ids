abstract:
- content: "<p>The Pay It Proper Protocol (PIPP) is an application-level network protocol
    for inter-process communication that defines a universal Turing machine. PIPP
    uses the concept of a sub stream to the traditional network stream allowing instructions
    and data to be streamed on a single tape. All processes on a sub stream aware
    network are programmable against instruction sets allowing for more expressive
    languages and compilers to be developed. PIPP is designed to be the universal
    bootstrapping protocol and instruction format for the Internet until more advanced
    protocols, compilers and formats are developed. This RFC defines sub streaming
    and the PIPP protocol. A proof of concept has been implemented, and a sample instruction
    format is given.</p>"
