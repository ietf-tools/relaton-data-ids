abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposal in this document is Experimental. While it may be deployed
    in the current Internet, it does not represent a consensus that this is the best
    possible mechanism for the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in TCP
    SYN/ACK packets. This document describes an optional, experimental modification
    to RFC 3168 to allow TCP SYN/ACK packets to be ECN-Capable. For TCP, RFC 3168
    specifies setting an ECN-Capable codepoint on data packets, but not on SYN and
    SYN/ACK packets. However, because of the high cost to the TCP transfer of having
    a SYN/ACK packet dropped, with the resulting retransmission timeout, this document
    describes the use of ECN for the SYN/ACK packet itself, when sent in response
    to a SYN packet with the two ECN flags set in the TCP header, indicating a willingness
    to use ECN. Setting the initial TCP SYN/ACK packet as ECN-Capable can be of great
    benefit to the TCP connection, avoiding the severe penalty of a retransmission
    timeout for a connection that has not yet started placing a load on the network.
    The TCP responder (the sender of the SYN/ACK packet) must reply to a report of
    an ECN-marked SYN/ACK packet by resending a SYN/ACK packet that is not ECN-Capable.
    If the resent SYN/ACK packet is acknowledged, then the TCP responder reduces its
    initial congestion window from two, three, or four segments to one segment, thereby
    reducing the subsequent load from that connection on the network. If instead the
    SYN/ACK packet is dropped, or for some other reason the TCP responder does not
    receive an acknowledgement in the specified time, the TCP responder follows TCP
    standards for a dropped SYN/ACK packet (setting the retransmission timer). This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
