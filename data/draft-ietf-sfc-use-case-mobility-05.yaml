abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides some exemplary use cases for service function
    chaining in mobile service provider networks. The objective of this draft is not
    to cover all conceivable service chains in detail. Rather, the intention is to
    localize and explain the application domain of service chaining within mobile
    networks as far as it is required to complement the problem statement [RFC7498]
    and architecture framework [ietf-sfc-arch] of the working group. Service function
    chains typically reside in a LAN segment which links the mobile access network
    to the actual application platforms located in the carrier's datacenters or somewhere
    else in the Internet. Service function chains (SFC) ensure a fair distribution
    of network resources according to agreed service policies, enhance the performance
    of service delivery or take care of security and privacy. SFCs may also include
    Value Added Services (VAS). Commonly, SFCs are typical middle box based services.
    General considerations and specific use cases are presented in this document to
    demonstrate the different technical requirements of these goals for service function
    chaining in mobile service provider networks. The specification of service function
    chaining for mobile networks must take into account an interaction between service
    function chains and the 3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) environment.</p>"
