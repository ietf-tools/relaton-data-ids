abstract:
- content: "<p>End users with high security and privacy requirements expect their
    data to be transmitted only through trusted devices to mitigate the risk of data
    leakage. Therefore, the development of trustworthy routing mechanisms is anticipated
    to be a key trend in the future evolution of the internet. This specification
    describes a network architecture that supports trustworthy routing and a scheme
    for carrying trustworthy routing information (TRI) using the BGP and BGPsec protocols.</p>"
