abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension of OSPF for IPv6 to support mobile
    ad hoc networks (MANETs). The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new
    OSPF interface type for MANETs. OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset
    of MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.
    The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together
    form a biconnected CDS for robustness. This CDS is exploited in two ways. First,
    to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which
    only (Backup) MDRs flood new LSAs back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding
    is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies. Second, adjacencies are formed
    only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much
    better scaling in dense networks. The CDS is constructed using 2-hop neighbor
    information provided in a Hello protocol extension. The Hello protocol is further
    optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor
    states. Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or
    partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less
    topology information.</p>"
