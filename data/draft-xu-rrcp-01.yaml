abstract:
- content: "<p>Network requirements have evolved from data communications between
    two hosts to large-scale information access through networks. The current Internet
    employs an address-centric network communication model, which is efficient for
    communications between hosts, but not efficient for communications between a host
    and a network. Given this fact, Information-centric Networking (ICN) has become
    a hot spot to meet the new requirement. In ICN there exists a congestion problem
    which hasn't been well solved. We provide a new congestion control protocol, RRCP,
    since the congestion control protocols in IP networks are not suitable for ICN
    transport. RRCP, with XCP and ICN transport characteristics, advances a receiver-driven
    and router- feedback mechanism. RRCP can stay efficient, fair and stable via the
    validation of simulation.</p>"
