abstract:
- content: "<p>The development of new technology is driven by scientific research.
    The Internet, with its roots in the ARPANET and NSFNet, is no exception. Many
    of the fundamental, long-term improvements to the architecture, security, end-to-end
    protocols and management of the Internet originate in the related academic research
    communities. Even shorter-term, more commercially driven extensions are oftentimes
    derived from academic research. When interoperability is required, the IETF standardizes
    such new technology. Timely and relevant standardization benefits from continuous
    input and review from the academic research community. For an individual researcher,
    it can however be quite puzzling how to begin to most effectively participate
    in the IETF and arguably to a much lesser degree, the IRTF. The interactions in
    the IETF are much different than those in academic conferences, and effective
    participation follows different rules. The goal of this document is to highlight
    such differences and provide a rough guideline that will hopefully enable researchers
    new to the IETF to become successful contributors more quickly. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
