abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP) that
    supports unreliable application data transfer from Client to Target. Beyond enabling
    application uses that do not require explicit responses from the Target, such
    as privacy-preserving data collection, this extension allows the Oblivious Relay
    Resource to buffer, batch, and shuffle requests to Oblivious Gateway Resources
    as a way of amplifying end-to-end client privacy protections.</p>"
