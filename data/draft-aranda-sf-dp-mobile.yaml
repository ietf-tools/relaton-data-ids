abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge for the
    infrastructure. The targeted services and the full deployment of virtualization
    in all segments of the network will need service function chains that previously
    resided in the(local and remote) infrastructure of the Network operators to extend
    to the radio access network (RAN). The objective of this draft is to provide a
    non-exhaustive but representative list of service functions in 4G and 5G networks.
    We base on the problem statement [RFC 7498] and architecture framework [SFC-Arch]
    of the working group, as well on the existing mobile networks use cases [SFC-mobile-uc]
    and the requirement gathering process of different initiatives around the world
    [5GPPP, IMT2020, 5G-FK, IMT2020-CN ] to anticipate network elements that will
    be needed in 5G networks.</p>"
