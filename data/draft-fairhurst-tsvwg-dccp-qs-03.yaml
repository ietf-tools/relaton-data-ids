abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by the
    Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). DCCP is a transport protocol that
    allows the transmission of congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams. DCCP is
    intended for applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony, and on-line
    games. In DCCP, an application has a choice of congestion control mechanisms,
    each specified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID). This document specifies
    general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and specific procedures for the
    use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID-2 and CCID-3. Quick-Start enables a DCCP sender
    to cooperate with any Quick-Start routers along the end-to-end path to determine
    an allowed sending rate at the start and, at times, in the middle of a DCCP connection
    (e.g., after an idle or application-limited period). The present specification
    is provided for use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would
    be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.</p>"
