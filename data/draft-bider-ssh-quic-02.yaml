abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) [RFC4251] is widely used for purposes
    including secure remote administration, file transfer using SFTP and SCP, and
    encrypted tunneling of TCP connections. Because it is based on TCP, SSH suffers
    similar problems as motivate the HTTP protocol to transition its transport to
    UDP-based QUIC [QUIC]. These include: unauthenticated network intermediaries can
    trivially disconnect SSH sessions; SSH connections are lost when mobile clients
    change IP addresses; performance limitations in OS-based TCP stacks; and many
    round-trips to establish the connection. This memo specifies SSH key exchange
    over UDP and leverages QUIC to provide a UDP-based transport.</p>"
