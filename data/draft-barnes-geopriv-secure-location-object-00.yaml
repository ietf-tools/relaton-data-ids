abstract:
- content: "<p>Protection of location information is an essential requirement of the
    GEOPRIV architecture. Since using protocols cannot be relied upon to provide adequate
    protections to the location objects they carry, the location objects themselves
    must be secured. This document examines several candidates for a Secure Location
    Object format in the context of GEOPRIV and ECRIT security requirements, including
    both locations by value and by reference.</p>"
