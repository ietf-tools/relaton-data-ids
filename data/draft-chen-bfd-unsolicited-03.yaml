abstract:
- content: <p>For operational simplification of "sessionless" applications using BFD,
    in this document we present procedures for "unsolicited BFD" that allow a BFD
    session to be initiated by only one side, and be established without explicit
    per-session configuration or registration by the other side (subject to certain
    per-interface or per-router policies).</p>
