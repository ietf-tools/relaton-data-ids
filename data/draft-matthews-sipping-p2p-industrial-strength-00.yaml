abstract:
- content: <p>If internet telephony networks based on peer-to-peer and Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) technology are to become as viable as existing centralized telephony
    services, the peer-to-peer SIP technology must offer all the features of existing
    technologies. This draft lists some features which are in some way "challenging"
    for peer-to-peer SIP to support, and proposes a structure for the resulting protocol
    suite.</p>
