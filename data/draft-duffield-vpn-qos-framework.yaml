abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a quality of service (QoS) framework for IP
    based virtual private networks (VPNs). For IP based VPNs to provide a service
    comparable to private line networks it has to provide a number of features including
    closed user groups, security and performance guarantees. This document focuses
    primarily on the issue of performance, and provide a QoS framework which is applicable
    to various VPN solution that have been proposed.</p>"
