abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the problem statement requirements and scenarios
    for MIF. These requirements and use case scenarios are intended to define an approach
    to solving common problems presented in MIF. These MIF requirements and scenarios
    are based around the common and prevalent problem of adaptation of a host to attach
    to multiple networks simultaneously. Such a host not only has to make decisions
    about selection of service parameters but also how to deal with issues relating
    to contradictory configuration objects. These MIF scenarios are intended to be
    part of a set of such scenarios that together define the purpose, scope and requirements
    for proposed and realized capabilities.</p>"
