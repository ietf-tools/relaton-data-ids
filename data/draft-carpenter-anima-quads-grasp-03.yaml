abstract:
- content: "<p>A secure substrate known as the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) is required
    by the Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) used by Autonomic Service
    Agents. This document describes QUADS, a QUick And Dirty Secure ACP using symmetric
    cryptography and preconfigured keys or passwords. It also describes a simplistic
    QUADS Key Infrastructure based on asymmetric cryptography used over insecure instances
    of GRASP to create a QUADS ACP.</p>"
