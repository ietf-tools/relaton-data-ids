abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mobility Management (HMM) in Locator/ID
    Separation Protocol (LISP) networks. The Internet is divided into a number of
    mapping domains (MDs). An Agent Tunnel Router (ATR) as an agent of each MD manages
    the Mobile Node's EID-to- RLOC mapping. For the movement within the MD, the ATR
    keeps the EID- to-RLOC mapping invariable, so it avoids the mapping update in
    the mapping system and the Tunnel Router (TR) of each correspondent node. For
    the handover between different MDs, to support fast update and handover, a united
    mapping table is proposed in the ATR.</p>"
