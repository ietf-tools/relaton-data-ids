abstract:
- content: "<p>A PIM router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream interface and
    router to build forwarding state. When there are equal cost multiple paths (ECMP),
    existing implementations often use hash algorithms to select a path. Such algorithms
    do not allow the spread of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative
    metrics. This usually leads to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources.
    This document introduces the ECMP Assert, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure
    over ECMPs. It allows ECMP path selection to be based on administratively selected
    metrics, such as data transmission delays, path preferences and routing metrics.</p>"
