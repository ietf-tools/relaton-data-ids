abstract:
- content: "<p>The increasing prevalence of cloud computing and micro service architectures
    has led to the rise of complex software functions being built and deployed as
    workloads, where a workload is defined as a running instance of software executing
    for a specific purpose. Workloads need to be provisioned with a unique identity
    when they are started. This information and their security context needs to be
    passed along the call chain. This architecture document discusses the motivation
    for designing and standardizing protocols and payloads for conveying identity
    and security context information.</p>"
