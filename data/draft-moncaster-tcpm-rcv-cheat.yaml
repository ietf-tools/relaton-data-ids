abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timely feedback
    to the sender. Currently the sender has no means to verify that a receiver is
    correctly sending this feedback according to the protocol. A receiver that is
    non-compliant has the potential to disrupt a sender's resource allocation, increasing
    its transmission rate on that connection which in turn could adversely affect
    the network itself. This document presents a two stage test process that can be
    used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant. The tests enshrine the principle
    that one shouldn't attribute to malice that which may be accidental. The first
    stage test causes minimum impact to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance.
    The second stage test can then be used to verify that the receiver is non-compliant.
    This specification does not modify the core TCP protocol - the tests can either
    be implemented as a test suite or as a stand-alone test through a simple modification
    to the sender implementation.</p>"
