abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of Internet technologies for emergency calling creates opportunities
    for fraud, relative to traditional circuit-switched emergency calling. This document
    describes the context for IP-based emergency calling, and the types of fraud which
    are possible within the system. A mitigation strategy for fraud against voice
    service providers is described; techniques for detecting or preventing other types
    of fraud will be incorporated in this document as they are available.</p>"
