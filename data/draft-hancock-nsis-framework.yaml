abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft presents a framework for further development of
    QoS signaling in the Internet. We give a basic model for the entities involved
    in QoS signaling, which is intended to be applicable to a very wide range of networking
    environments, while still retaining the flexibility to allow lightweight implementations
    in particular environments and incremental deployment in the Internet as a whole.</p>"
