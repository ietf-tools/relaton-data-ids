abstract:
- content: "<p>The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in network management
    (NM) solutions is the way to resolve many of the complex management problems arising
    from the adoption of NFV and SDN technologies. The AINEMA framework, as discussed
    in this document, includes the functions, capabilities, and components that MUST
    be provided by AI modules and models to be successfully applied to NM. This is
    enhanced by the consideration of seamless integration of different services, including
    the ability of having multiple AI models working in parallel, as well as the ability
    of complex reasoning and event processing. In addition, disparate sources of information
    are put together without increasing complexity, through the definition of a control
    and management service bus. It allows, for instance, to involve external events
    in NM operations. Using all available sources of information --- namely, intelligence
    sources --- allows NM solutions to apply proper intelligence processes that provide
    explainable results instead of simple AI-based guesses. Such processes are highly
    based in reasoning and formal and target-based intelligence analysis and decision
    --- providing evidence-based conclusions and proofs for the decisions --- in the
    form of AI method outputs with explanations. This will allow computer and network
    system infrastructures --- and user demands --- to grow in complexity while keeping
    dependability.</p>"
