abstract:
- content: "<p>Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers, service
    vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability, there is
    need for a standard protocol for exchanging service information. This draft describes
    requirements for such a protocol. Current cloud implementations expose application
    level APIs, which are not syntactically and semantically compatible with each
    other. One approach to interoperate cloud services is to standardize the protocol
    while leaving the API definition implementation specific. Standard protocols have
    been used widely in the Internet and can be extended to cloud. Use of such protocols
    is compatible with existing cloud APIs, which can exchange information in a standard
    protocol. New APIs may also be developed using a standard protocol. By this, it
    would be possible to interoperate diverse APIs across service providers, service
    vendors and service users.</p>"
