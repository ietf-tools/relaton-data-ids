abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose a guideline for an improved version of router
    handling procedures in RFC 2461 that allow for improved default router acquisition
    performance when an active IP host moves from one subnet to the other using the
    Path Computation Element Metric Protocol (PCEMP). Router handling procedures can
    be improved by a soft configuration of PCEMP support in the context of real-time
    data driven strategy on individual PCE nodes and this draft shows how PCEMP can
    support that. This draft is an informational draft that shows a guideline to specifications
    of modifying existing protocols to facilitate communication between LSRs and PCEs,
    and between a PCE and other PCEs. This can also be a guideline for mobile PCE
    nodes changing respective PCEDAs and thus needing fast advertisements to the corresponding
    LSRs and other PCE peers using IPv6 schemes.</p>"
