abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) profile
    for Discard Origin Authorizations (DOAs), for use with the Resource Public Key
    Infrastructure (RPKI). A DOA is a digitally signed object that provides a means
    of verifying that an IP address block holder has authorized an Autonomous System
    (AS) to originate routes to one or more prefixes within the address block tagged
    with a specific set of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Communities, to signal a
    request to discard IP traffic destined towards the tagged IP prefix.</p>"
