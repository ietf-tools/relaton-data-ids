abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless OAM
    protocols. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs
    for connectionless protocols. The Base model presented here can be extended to
    include technology specific details. This is leading to uniformity between OAM
    protocols and support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at
    different or same levels through a unified interface).</p>"
