abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a base YANG Data model for the management of
    Operations Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols that use Connectionless
    Communications. The data model is defined using the YANG, as specified in RFC7950
    data modeling language. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key
    OAM constructs for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication. The base
    model presented here can be extended to include technology-specific details. There
    are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM
    protocols. And second, it support both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing
    OAM functions at different or same levels through a unified interface) as well
    as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through
    a unified interface).</p>"
