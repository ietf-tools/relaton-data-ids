abstract:
- content: <p>For some time, Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) have been used in
    the delivery of some Internet services (e.g. delivery of websites, software updates
    and video delivery) as they provide numerous benefits including reduced delivery
    cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experience for end users and increased
    robustness of delivery. In order to derive the optimal benefit from a CDN it is
    preferable to deliver content from the servers (caches) that are "closest" to
    the End User requesting the content, where "closest" may be as simple as "geographical
    or network distance" combined with CDN server load within a location, but may
    also consider other more complex combinations of metrics and CDN or Network Service
    Provider (NSP) policies. There are a number of different ways in which a CDN may
    obtain the necessary network topology and/or cost information to allow it to serve
    End Users from the most optimal servers/locations, such as static configuration,
    passively listening to routing protocols directly, active probing of underlying
    network(s), or obtaining topology and cost by querying an information service
    such as the ALTO map &amp; cost services. This document describes the use cases
    for a CDN to be able to obtain network topology and cost information from an ALTO
    server(s).</p>
