abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of Mobile IP in a wide area network presents several
    challenges, not the least of which is how to provide subscribers with secure access
    to remote private networks. This draft outlines mechanisms whereby the home and
    visited network may negotiate the use of IP transforms, such as IP Security ESP
    and AH protocols, on the Mobile IP redirection tunnels. These mechanisms allow
    for the secure distribution of both keys and policies through a DIAMETER AAA infrastructure,
    obviating the need for other forms of key distribution or policy negotiation.
    The mechanisms are extensible to other kinds of IP transforms, such as IP Compression.</p>"
