abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed standard REST API for obtaining
    access to TURN services via ephemeral (i.e. time-limited) credentials. These credentials
    are vended by a web service over HTTP, and then supplied to and checked by a TURN
    server using the standard TURN protocol. The usage of ephemeral credentials ensures
    that access to the TURN server can be controlled even if the credentials can be
    discovered by the user, as is the case in WebRTC where TURN credentials must be
    specified in Javascript.</p>"
