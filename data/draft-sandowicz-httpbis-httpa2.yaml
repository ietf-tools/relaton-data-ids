abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Attestable version 2 (HTTPA/2) is an
    HTTP extension. It is a transaction-based protocol agnostic to Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) in which the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is considered
    a new type of requested resource over the Internet. The original Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol Attestable (HTTPA) (referred to as HTTPA/1 in the rest of the document)
    includes remote attestation (RA) process onto the HTTPS protocol in the assumption
    of using Transport Layer Security (TLS) across the Internet. In contrast, the
    design of HTTPA/2 could establish a trusted (attested) and more secure communication
    without dependence on TLS. The definition of Attestation for the purposes of this
    draft: The process of vouching for the accuracy of TEE based services, configuration,
    and data where the TEE conveys Evidence about its environment, roots of trust
    and protected functions. The Evidence is a digital expression of TEE trustworthiness.</p>"
