abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical to QUIC
    version 1 except for some trivial details. Its purpose is to combat various ossification
    vectors and exercise the version negotiation framework. Over time, it may also
    serve as a vehicle for needed protocol design changes. Discussion of this work
    is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org or on the
    GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/martinduke/draft-duke-quic-v2.</p>"
