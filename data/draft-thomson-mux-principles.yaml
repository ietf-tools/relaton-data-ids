- content: "<p>The existence of protocols that rely on multiplexing of different protocols
    could be used to justify the imposition of constraints on the operation of other
    protocols. The existence of a multiplexed protocol does not inherently justify
    constraints on protocols that participate or might participate in the protocol.</p>"
