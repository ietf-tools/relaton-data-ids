abstract:
- content: <p>DNS Error Reporting is a lightweight error reporting mechanism that
    provides the operator of an authoritative server with reports on DNS resource
    records that fail to resolve or validate, that a Domain Owner or DNS Hosting organization
    can use to improve domain hosting. The reports are based on Extended DNS Errors
    [RFC8914]. When a domain name fails to resolve or validate due to a misconfiguration
    or an attack, the operator of the authoritative server may be unaware of this.
    To mitigate this lack of feedback, this document describes a method for a validating
    recursive resolver to automatically signal an error to an agent specified by the
    authoritative server. DNS Error Reporting uses the DNS to report errors. Another
    lack of feedback occurs when validation was successful, or when there is no error
    to report. This positive feedback may be helpful to show that a deployment was
    successful. This document introcudes an extended DNS error "NO ERROR".</p>
