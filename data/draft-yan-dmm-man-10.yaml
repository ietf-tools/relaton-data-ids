abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility support is an important network capability for mobile node,
    and 5G introduces the Mobility Pattern used by the Access and Mobility Management
    Function (AMF) to optimize mobility support provided to the UE. More specific,
    The AMF determines and updates Mobility Pattern of the UE according to the subscription
    of the UE, statistics of the UE mobility, network local policy, and the UE assisted
    information, or any combination of them with the help of Network Data Analytics
    Function (NWDAF). Based on different requirements, multiple mobility management
    protocols have been developed under IPv6. However, different protocols have different
    functional requirements on the network element or the host and then a scheme should
    be used in order to support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility
    management protocol when a host (or UE) accesses to a new network. Besides, Mobility
    restrictions should also be considerred especially in 5G. In this draft, this
    issue is analyzed.</p>"
