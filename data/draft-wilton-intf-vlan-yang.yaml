abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG configuration data model for the management
    of VLAN sub-interfaces that augments the generic interfaces data model defined
    in RFC 7223 [RFC7223]. It provides support for basic tag matching to allow termination
    of an L2 VLAN segement into L3 services. It also provides support for flexible
    matching and rewriting of L2 header fields for L2 services. The model differs
    from an IEEE 802.1Q VLAN derived model in that the configuration is interface/sub-interface
    based as opposed to being VLAN based.</p>"
