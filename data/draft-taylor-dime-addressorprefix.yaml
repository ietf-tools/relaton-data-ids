abstract:
- content: "<p>Section 4.3.1 of the Diameter base specification [RFC6733] defines
    a number of derived AVP data formats. This collection includes the Address format,
    which is suitable for encoding complete addresses. In some potential applications,
    however, there is a requirement to encode a prefix rather than a complete address.
    This document defines the AddressOrPrefix derived AVP data format, modelled after
    the Address format defined in [RFC6733], but allowing the same AVP to represent
    a prefix of any length up to a full address. This document updates RFC 6733.</p>"
