abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Access Identifier (NAI) is an identifier used by access networks
    for identifying users requesting access to the network. A user may access the
    network using more than one device, but all using the same NAI and the associated
    credentials. There are various use- cases where an access network needs to unambiguously
    identify a device used for accessing the network, and NAI is not sufficient for
    such determination. This document describes a device identifier structure and
    also identifies the potential stable identifiers that are present on a dual-radio
    device which can be used as a device identifiers. This document also describes
    mechanisms where the device can generate device identifiers using cryptographic
    methods. These generated identifiers are transient in nature and are unique to
    a given access network. Device identifier is intended to be shared only with a
    trusted access network which holds the user's network access credentials and for
    which the identifier was generated.</p>"
