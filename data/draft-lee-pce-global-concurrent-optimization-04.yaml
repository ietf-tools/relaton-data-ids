abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a network component, application,
    or node that is capable of performing path computations at the request of Path
    Computation Clients (PCCs). The PCE is applied in Multiprotocol Label Switching
    Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) networks and in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks
    to determine the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) through the network. The
    Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is specified for communications
    between PCCs and PCEs, and between cooperating PCEs. When computing or re-optimizing
    the routes of a set of LSPs through a network it may be advantageous to perform
    bulk path computations in order to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more
    optimal network- wide solutions. Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent
    Optimization (GCO). A Global Concurrent Optimization is able to simultaneously
    consider the entire topology of the network and the complete set of existing LSPs,
    and their respective constraints, and look to optimize or re-optimize the entire
    network to satisfy all constraints for all LSPs. The Global Concurrent Optimization
    (GCO) application is primarily an NMS based solution. This document provides application-specific
    requirements and the PCEP extensions in support of a global concurrent optimization
    (GCO) application.</p>"
