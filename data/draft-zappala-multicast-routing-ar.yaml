abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for interdomain multicast routing
    support of integrated services networks. The key features of this architecture
    are a multicast route setup protocol and local route construction agents. Together,
    these two components enable multicast routing to install alternate paths and pinned
    routes on behalf of receivers that request these services.</p>"
