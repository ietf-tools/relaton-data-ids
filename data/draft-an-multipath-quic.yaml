- content: "<p>This document specifies multipath extension for the QUIC protocol to
    enable the simultaneous usage of multiple paths for a single connection. The extension
    is compliant with the single-path QUIC design. The design principle is to support
    multipath by adding limited extension to QUIC-Transport [I-D.ietf-quic-transport].</p>"
