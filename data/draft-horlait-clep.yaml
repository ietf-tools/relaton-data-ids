abstract:
- content: "<p>There are various aspects in Quality of Service management. In this
    draft, we address the problem of bandwidth allocation and reservation over shared
    media (e.g. an Ethernet network). In order to do so, we define a protocol (CLEP:
    Controlled Load Ethernet Protocol) in charge of the management, allocation and
    fair sharing of the available bandwidth among users of the network.</p>"
