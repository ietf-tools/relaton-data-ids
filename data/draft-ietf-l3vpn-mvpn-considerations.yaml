abstract:
- content: "<p>More that one set of mechanisms to support multicast in a layer 3 BGP/MPLS
    VPN has been defined. These are presented in the documents that define them as
    optional building blocks. To enable interoperability between implementations,
    this document defines a subset of features that is considered mandatory for a
    multicast BGP/MPLS VPN implementation. This will help implementers and deployers
    understand which L3VPN multicast requirements are best satisfied by each option.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
