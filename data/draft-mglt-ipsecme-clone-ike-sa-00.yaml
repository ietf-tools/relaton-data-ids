abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers a VPN End User setting a VPN with a security
    gateway where at least one of the peer has multiple interfaces. With the current
    IKEv2, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are determined by those used by IKEv2
    channel. As a result using multiple interfaces requires to set an IKEv2 channel
    on each interface, or on each paths if both the VPN Client and the security gateway
    have multiple interfaces. Setting multiple IKEv2 channel involves multiple authentications
    which MAY each require multiple round trips and delay the VPN establishment. In
    addition multiple authentications unnecessarily load the VPN client and the authentication
    infrastructure. This document presents the Clone IKE_SA extension, where an additional
    IKEv2 channel is derived from an already authenticated IKEv2 channel. The newly
    created IKEv2 channel is set without the IKEv2 authentication exchange. The newly
    created IKEv2 channel can then be assigned to another interface using MOBIKE.</p>"
