abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User
    Information (UUI) data during session establishment. This information, known as
    call control UUI, is a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating
    the session, and utilized by an application accepting the session. This data is
    opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function. Several
    approaches to transporting call control UUI in SIP have been proposed. As networks
    move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue
    to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN
    service for end-to-end transparency. This document discusses three mechanisms
    to meet the requirements defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI
    document. A new SIP header field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.</p>"
