abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication
    describes a mechanism for a User Agent Client (UAC) to publish event state information
    to a User Agent Server (UAS). Generally, the UAC is free to monitor certain resources
    at a certain rate and publish changes of their event state, for instance with
    the presence event package. However, for a UAC on a mobile device, this can be
    very costly in terms of battery, computing, and network resources. Although some
    mechnisms exist for a UAC to deduce whether event state publication is needed
    and at what rate publish messages may be sent, these are rather coarse and reactive
    in nature. This memo defines a solution for a UAS to regulate monitoring and publications
    by providing detailed information to the UAC regarding which resources to monitor,
    at what rate, whether urgent and with what delta.</p>"
