abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobile users and their traffic demands are expected to be ever-
    increasing in future years, and this growth will impose a limitation for deploying
    current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized, e.g.,
    Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6. This evolution in user traffic demand can be tackled
    by a different approach for IP mobility, called Distributed Mobility Management,
    which is focusing on moving the mobility anchors from the core network and pushing
    them closer to the users, at the edge of the network. Following this idea, in
    our proposal, the central anchor is being deployed in the access router of the
    mobile node(MN). That is, the first elements that provide IP connectivity to a
    set of MNs are also the mobility managers for those MNs. In the following, we
    will call MAAR (Mobility anchor and Access Router). This draft strictly abides
    by the three principles: (1) The MN doesn't participate in any mobility-related
    signaling.MAAR and AAA are responsible for managing IP mobility on behalf of the
    host. (2) The MN's movement is transparent to the communication node (CN).The
    Home Address (HoA) and Care-of address (CoA) are not for users but for specific
    sessions in this draft.A MN initiates a session by using the MN's address assigned
    by a MAAR which the MN is registered as the HoA for this session.The MN's address
    assigned by a new MAAR which the MN moves to its access link as the CoA for the
    session. (3) The MN can directly forward packages to the CN and the packages don't
    need to pass the home mobility anchor. It can reduce the heavy burdens on home
    mobility anchor and maintain all the continuity of the conversation.</p>"
