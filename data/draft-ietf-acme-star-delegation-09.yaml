abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management
    Environment (ACME) protocol by which the holder of an identifier (e.g., a domain
    name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate
    subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds
    to a private key controlled by the third party. A primary use case is that of
    a Content Delivery Network (CDN), the third party, terminating TLS sessions on
    behalf of a content provider (the holder of a domain name). The presented mechanism
    allows the holder of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and
    revoke it at any time. Importantly, this mechanism does not require any modification
    to the deployed TLS clients and servers.</p>"
