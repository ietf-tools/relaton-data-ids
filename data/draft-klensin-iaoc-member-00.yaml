abstract:
- content: "<p>The original specification of the membership of the IAOC included the
    IETF and IAB Chairs as voting members. While probably desirable initially, this
    has turned out to have unfortunate side effects. This document discusses those
    side effects and replaces those specific individuals with liaisons from the IAB
    and IESG.</p>"
