abstract:
- content: <p>This document aims to standardize the validation of mutual TLS authentication
    between servers (server-to-server). It outlines recommended validation flows as
    well as provides practical design recommendations. Basically the EKU id-kp-clientAuth
    and id-kp- serverAuth get more precisely defined to represent their common understanding
    by issuing CAs and browsers. id-kp-clientAuth aka. "TLS WWW client authentication"
    SHOULD mean authentication of a natural or legal entity. id-kp-serverAuth aka.
    "TLS WWW server authetnication" SHOULD mean authentication of a device. When two
    id- kp-clientAuth certificates are used this means E2E authentication between
    two users. Where as two id-kp-serverAuth certificates being used means server-to-server
    authentication. And one user and one server certificate within one TLS connection
    means client-to-server (or technically also server-to-client). The term "TLS-Client"
    SHOULD no longer be used and mean the party sending the initial package while
    establishing a TLS connection. This helps to avoid design issues moving forward
    as currently some people thought TLS-Client auth was only ever used in "client-to-server"
    and never within "server-to-server" context. Which sparked the demand for this
    document to begin with to keep server-to-server auth with public trusted certificates
    working.</p>
