abstract:
- content: "<p>The JOSE set of standards established JSON-based container formats
    for signatures (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7515/) over a content payload
    using established algorithms (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7518/). Newer
    algorithms are emerging which allow for additional operations on content, such
    as a party (other than the signer) choosing not to disclose some of the integrity-protected
    content. However, these algorithms often support granularity at the individual
    message level, creating a need to define a way to support expressing multiple
    content payloads as part of a single message. This document defines a new operational
    mode for JSON Web Signatures that operates on a protected header and multiple
    binary content payloads to provide the expressivity needed for this class of algorithm.
    It also describes how multiple content payloads can be expressed in a manner compatible
    with pre-existing algorithms, albeit without the operational capabilities of newer
    algorithms.</p>"
