abstract:
- content: "<p>As increasing number of tunnels are deployed in a Provider core, there
    is a need for improving the efficiency and ease of tunnel establishment. OSPF
    running as the IGP in a Provider core, can act as the signalling agent for the
    Tunnel endpoints. OSPF can carry tunnel endpoint information in the intra-AS scope,
    easing BGP of the extra burden of signalling within the core.</p>"
