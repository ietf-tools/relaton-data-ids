abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes dataplane triggered Tree Notifications to support
    multicast fast reroute for PIM and mLDP. These Tree Notifications are initiated
    by a node detecting the failure to a Repair Node downstream. A Repair Node is
    a node that has a pre-built backup path that can circumvent the failure. Using
    this mechanism, a Repair Node has the ability to learn about non-local failures
    quickly without having to wait for the IGP to convergence. This draft also covers
    an optional method to avoid bandwidth usage on the pre-built backup path.</p>"
