abstract:
- content: "<p>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) guides an application,
    especially a Peer to Peer (P2P) application, to select hosts from its candidate
    set. ALTO is a promising technique for future network, as it is able to jointly
    optimize network resource utilization and application performance. The ALTO protocol
    is Client-Server based. Applications work as ALTO clients to fetch PID information
    from the ALTO server, but the ALTO server can't send the notification to ALTO
    clients, even if there is a major change to the networks. This draft discusses
    the requirements for server initialized notification, and proposes one mechanism
    to enable the ALTO server notification.</p>"
