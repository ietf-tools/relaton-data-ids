abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet model has traditionally avoided the complication of an
    explicit session layer, in favor of having applications and transports divide
    the relevant work between them. While this has been a successful strategy when
    the packet flows from two hosts all take the same path, there may be advantages
    in using a session-layer strategy when a host initiates related flows from multiple
    interfaces in independent routing domains (e.g. a 3G or 4G interface and a WiFi
    interface). This draft discusses an approach re-using the security association
    mechanisms present in DTLS [RFC4347] to create a simple session layer.</p>"
