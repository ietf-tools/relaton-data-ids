abstract:
- content: "<p>5G support new emerging high reliability and low-latency services by
    Mobile Edge Computing. Multiple instances of the same service can be deployed
    over different edge sites to enable high availability, scalability and better
    response time. However, due to different computing loads and network resources
    overtime, a specific edge site might not always guarantee service quality. Routing
    user traffic to an overloaded edge site can significantly affect user service
    experiences. Current 5G mobile network does not have a method to dynamically steer
    traffic to an optimal service instance based on network status and edge sites'
    computing resources availability. This document describes solutions to provide
    computing-aware traffic steering methods for the 5G mobile user plane using Segment
    Routing. The solution explains how to use Segment Routing to deliver mobile user
    traffic dynamically to the best edge site destination based on both computing
    and networking resource information in the mobile user plane.</p>"
