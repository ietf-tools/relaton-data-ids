abstract:
- content: "<p>With the open and standard programmatic interface and the flexibility
    of controlling network, Software Defined Network (SDN) can obviously simplify
    and integrate operation and business support systems. As a consequence, to satisfy
    the rising switching demand in the data center network, it is a good option to
    adopt SDN technology. In addition, current architecture of data center network
    is far from ideality, which results in the low utilization rate in bandwidth resource.
    For example, mice flow cannot be well effectively served in the conventional Wavelength
    Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical network with at least 50GHz spectrum interval.
    From a data center network perspective, it is necessary to further improve the
    resource utilization efficiency and the flexibility of coping with different traffic.
    This document described an optical data center interconnect, which comprises both
    the fixed and flexible grid transceivers. A traffic monitor is implemented in
    the SDN-based data center network to evaluate the coming traffic demands and allocate
    appropriate spectrum for the request. For instance, mice flow can be served by
    fixed grid transceivers, well the elephant flows can be transmitted by the flexi-grid
    transceiver using multiple subcarriers to form a superchannel. Thus, spectrum
    efficiency is optimized and bandwidth utilization is improved dramatically.</p>"
