abstract:
- content: "<p>The QoS Policy schema refines the concepts in the Policy Framework
    Core Information Model and Schema documents ([PFCORE] and [PFSCHEMA], respectively)
    in order to extend this generalized policy model to represent network Quality
    of Service (QoS) policy information. This information is typically used by QoS
    Policy Servers to configure network devices according to prescribed QoS Policies.
    The schema presented here is based on, and derived from, the Policy Framework
    LDAP Core Schema, version 4. This document will be updated shortly to reflect
    the latest changes of the Policy framework LDAP Core Schema draft.</p>"
