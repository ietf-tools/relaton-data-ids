abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip is an internet protocol that scales efficiently encodes policy.
    It facilitates many advanced features, such as mobility and multiple defaults
    routing, and has a well-bounded routing table lookup, and is therefore fast. Pip
    is proposed as an alternative to the two 'medium term' proposals that emerged
    from the Road (Routing and Addressing) group to deal with the dual IP problems
    of scaling and address depletion.</p>"
