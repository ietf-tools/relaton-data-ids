abstract:
- content: "<p>Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an important
    role in external BGP [RFC4271] peering relations. The most common tool used today
    to attach various information about routes is realized with the use of BGP communities
    [RFC1997]. Such information is important for the peering AS to perform some mutually
    agreed actions without the need to maintain a separate offline database for each
    pair of prefix and an associated with it requested set of action entries. This
    document proposes to establish a new IANA maintained registry of most commonly
    used Wide BGP Communities by network operators. Such public registry will allow
    for easy refernece and clear interpretation of the actions associated with received
    community values.</p>"
