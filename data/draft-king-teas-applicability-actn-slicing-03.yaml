abstract:
- content: "<p>Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network
    domain to select network resources by policy to obtain a view of potential connectivity
    Network slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on the concept
    of network abstraction to provide programmability, flexibility, and modularity.
    It may use techniques such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) to create multiple logical (virtual) networks, each tailored
    for a set of services that are sharing the same set of requirements, on top of
    a common network. These logical networks are referred to as transport network
    slices. A transport network slice does not necessarily represent dedicated resources
    in the network, but does constitute a commitment by the network provider to provide
    a specific level of service. The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered
    Networks (ACTN) defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts
    of network and service abstraction to detach network and service control from
    the underlying data plane. This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to
    transport network slicing in an IETF technology network. It also identifies the
    features of network slicing not currently within the scope of ACTN, and indicates
    where ACTN might be extended.</p>"
