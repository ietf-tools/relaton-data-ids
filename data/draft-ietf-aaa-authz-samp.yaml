abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes several examples of applications requiring authorization.
    Each application is described in terms of a consistent framework, and specific
    authorization requirements of each application are given. This material was not
    contributed by the working groups responsible for the applications and should
    not be considered prescriptive for how the applications will meet their authorization
    needs. Rather the intent is to explore the fundamental needs of a variety of different
    applications with the view of compiling a set of requirements that an authorization
    protocol will need to meet in order to be generally useful.</p>"
