abstract:
- content: <p>The specification of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) permits a
    user agent (UA) that receives a call to generate a response in the "6xx class"
    that not only rejects the call but also requires the termination of all attempts
    to route the call to alternative destinations. As the call may have reached the
    UA through multiple forwardings whose meanings cannot be known by the UA, the
    global termination of alternative routing can only rarely be correctly requested
    by the UA. Because such responses are almost never appropriate, ability of a UA
    to generate such responses is harmful, and all 6xx class responses should be replaced
    with 4xx class responses with similar meanings. However, there is no 4xx class
    response similar to "603 Decline", and so one needs to be created.</p>
