abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of certificates for authenticating the creation of IPsec security
    associations has long been fraught with difficulty. The specifications in IKE
    version 1 are sometimes ambiguous about important issues, and developers of IPsec
    systems are often unprepared to deal with the complexities of PKIX certificates
    and certificate handling. This document is a profile of certificate use in IPsec
    whose primary goal is to greatly increase interoperability while maintaining high
    security.</p>"
