abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent work on Locator/ID Separation has focused primarily on the control
    plane protocols concerned with finding Identifier-to-Locator mappings. However,
    experience gained with a trial deployment of a system designed to implement Locator/ID
    Separation has revealed two general classes of problems which must be resolved
    after the mapping is found: The Locator Path Liveness Problem and the State Synchronization
    Problem. These problems have implications for the data plane as well as the control
    plane.</p>"
