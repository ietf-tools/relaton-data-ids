abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set Intersection
    (ECDH-PSI) for 2 participants. It instantiates the classical Meadows match-making
    protocol with standard elliptic curves and hash-to-curve methods, enabling the
    participants to find common records in a privacy-respecting way. In ECDH-PSI,
    records are encoded to points on an elliptic curve, and masked by the private
    keys of both participants. To compute the intersection, a participant only uses
    the jointly masked datasets and its original dataset locally, which prevents its
    partner from learning the private records not in the intersection.</p>"
