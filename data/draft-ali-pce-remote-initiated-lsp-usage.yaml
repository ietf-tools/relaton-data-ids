abstract:
- content: "<p>When active stateful PCE is used for managing PCE-initiated LSP, PCC
    may not be aware of the intended usage of the LSP (e.g., in a multi-layer network).
    PCEP Extensions for PCE-initiated MPLS and GMPLS LSP Setup specifications do not
    address this requirement. This draft addresses the requirement to specify on how
    PCC should use the remote initiated LSPs.</p>"
