abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces an interworking function between shared backbone
    multicast domain and VPN multicast domain. The architecture that follows is similar
    to Multicast Border Router functionality, however the mapping is defined not as
    a mapping between two different multicast protocols, but two different multicast
    topologies the under assumption that the shared backbone multicast topology will
    be shared between VPNs for carrying the traffic. The main assumption made in this
    draft is that multicast packets are replicated on PE device (router) for scalability
    and performance reasons. However, it is possible to extend the solution and replicate
    packets on CE devices. The proposed mapping of addresses to topology solves the
    issue of scalability of multicast addresses to state knowledge in the core. This
    draft also identifies three types of multicast capabilities for the core.</p>"
