abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on simplified
    layer 3 routing. Furthermore, requirements for operational simplicity have led
    many of these MSDCs to converge on BGP as their single routing protocol for both
    their fabric routing and their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing. This document
    describes extensions to BGP to use BGP Link-State distribution and the Shortest
    Path First (SPF) algorithm used by Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF.
    In doing this, it allows BGP to be efficiently used as both the underlay protocol
    and the overlay protocol in MSDCs.</p>"
