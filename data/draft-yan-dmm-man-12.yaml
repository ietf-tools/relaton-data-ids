abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile peers exchange signals with networks, for both IP and wireless
    domains, to negotiate capabilities for mobile registration, connection management,
    session establishment, service provisioning, etc. Generally, mobility capabilities
    include the supported and provisioned resources along with associated protocols
    for certain mobility management scenarios. While devices in the mobile IP domain
    would mostly focus on the IP-related negotiation, devices in the wireless domain,
    e.g., the 5G system (5GS), embrace both mobile IP- related resources as well as
    wireless-specific capabilities. Regarding both the mobile-IP and wireless domains,
    we have generalized two protocol categories for mobility capability negotiation
    &amp; management, i.e., the host-initiated category that involves the direct &amp;
    active engagement of mobile end devices vs. the network-based category over which
    mobile endpoints play almost no role in the process. The classification and then
    the application of the two categories help us analyze the mobility capability
    negotiation for both the mobile IPv6 and the 3GPP 5G system. The comparison of
    the capability negotiation under both the Home-Routed (HR) and the Local BreakOut
    (LBO) roaming cases in 5GS further reflects the feasibility of the protocol dichotomy.</p>"
