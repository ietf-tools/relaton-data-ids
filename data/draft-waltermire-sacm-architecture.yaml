abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies the architectural components, data flows,
    and the supporting standards needed to define an interoperable automation infrastructure
    required to support timely, accurate and actionable situational awareness over
    an organization's IT systems. This architecture is based on previous use case
    and requirements analysis. Automation tools implementing the continuous monitoring
    approach described in this document will utilize this infrastructure together
    with existing and emerging event, incident and network management standards to
    provide visibility into the state of assets, user activities and network behavior.
    Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant
    security and operational data to understand the organizations security posture,
    quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational
    objectives while protecting critical information. Organizations will be able to
    use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate
    with partners to identify and mitigate threats. Other automation tools will be
    able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions
    to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</p>"
