abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines dynamic attributes and the fashion in which they
    are being set and used on entries in the directory. This document builds heavily
    on the dynamic extensions to LDAP infrastructure as defined in [1]. The Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [2] supports lightweight access to static directory
    services, allowing relatively fast search and update access. Static directory
    services store information about people that persists in its accuracy and value
    over a long period of time. The dynamic extension to LDAP as defined in [1] added
    the concept of dynamic entries that only persist in the directory, when they are
    periodically refreshed. This document takes this approach one step farther and
    defines how dynamic attributes can be used, on either static or dynamic entries,
    to handle up-to-date and dynamic information about an entry in the directory.
    An example use will be a client or a person that has a static entry in the directory
    and sometimes goes online, which is reflected in the 'online' attribute for the
    entry. To specify whether this person is online or offline - an attribute that
    changes frequently, a client application will have to modify this attribute relatively
    frequently. The current location of a person is another attribute that may change
    frequently. Dynamic attributes must be periodically refreshed. Otherwise, they
    will disappear from the directory over time.</p>"
