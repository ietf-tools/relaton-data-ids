abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal which partitions an in-situ OAM
    (iOAM) domain into multiple segments in order to control the iOAM data overhead,
    adapt to the path MTU limitations, and enable new applications. We discuss several
    use cases to motivate our proposal and base the necessary modifications on the
    current in-situ OAM header format specification.</p>"
