abstract:
- content: <p>The cellular telephone industry has defined a service known as the Multimedia
    Messaging Service (MMS). This service uses formats and protocols that are similar
    to, but differ in key ways from, those used in Internet mail. One important difference
    between MMS and Internet Mail is that MMS uses headers that start with "X-Mms-"
    to carry a variety of user agent- and server-related information elements. This
    document specifies how to exchange messages between these two services, including
    mapping information elements as used in MMS X-Mms-* headers as well as delivery
    and disposition reports, to and from that used in SMTP and Internet message headers.
