abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the use of two DNS record types for storing BGP
    routing information in the reverse DNS. The RLOCK record allows prefix owners
    to indicate whether the DNS is being used to publish routing data. The SRO record
    allows operators to indicate whether an IPv4 or IPv6 prefix ought to appear in
    global routing tables and identifies authorized origin Autonomous System Number(s)
    for that prefix. The resulting published data can be used in a variety of contexts
    from routing security to address ownership.</p>"
