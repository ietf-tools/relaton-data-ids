abstract:
- content: <p>The CDNI Metadata specification describes generic CDNI metadata objects
    and properties as well as mechanisms to extend the generic/ base objects and properties
    to support additional standardised and/or proprietary capabilities. This document
    is intended to "test" the extensibility of the CDNI Metadata protocol by defining
    CDNI Metadata for delivery of content over HTTPS that extends the existing generic
    CDNI Metadata.</p>
