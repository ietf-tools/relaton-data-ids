abstract:
- content: "<p>The Segment Routing mechanism can be leveraged to realize the service
    path layer functionality of the Service Function Chaining (i.e, steering traffic
    through the service function path). The link-state IGPs (i.e., IS-IS and OSPF)
    have been extended to advertise service information including services and the
    corrresponding service segment identifiers. For the purpose of building service
    function paths which span across IGP areas, or even across ASes, this draft defines
    extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family to carry service information including
    services and the corrresponding service segment identifiers.</p>"
