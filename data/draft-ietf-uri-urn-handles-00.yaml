abstract:
- content: "<p>The Handle System provides identifiers for digital objects and other
    resources in distributed computer systems. These identifiers are known as handles.
    The system ensures that handles are unique and that they can be retained over
    long time periods. Since the system makes no assumptions about the characteristics
    of the items that are identified, handles can be used in a wide variety of systems
    and applications. The handle system has the following components: naming authorities,
    handle generators, the global handle server, local handle servers, caching handle
    servers, client software libraries, proxy servers, and administrative tools. For
    reasons of performance and availability, the global, local, and caching servers
    are implemented as distributed systems comprising many server computers. All components,
    except the local handle server, have been implemented and are available for general
    use by the research community. The handle system provides all the capabilities
    listed in RFC1737, K. Sollins, L. Masinter, 'Functional Requirements for Uniform
    Resource Names', 12/20/1994.</p>"
