abstract:
- content: "<p>Provider Portal for Network Applications (P4P) is a framework that
    enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network application software developers
    to work jointly and cooperatively to optimize application communications. The
    goals of this cooperation are to reduce network resource consumption and to accelerate
    applications. To achieve these goals, P4P allows ISPs to provide network information
    and guidance to network applications, allowing clients to exchange data more effectively.
    This document specifies the P4P protocol operations and message formats. The goal
    is provide a formal specification for developers to create inter-operable implementations.</p>"
