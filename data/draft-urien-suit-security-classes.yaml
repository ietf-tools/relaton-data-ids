abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft attempts to define security classes for devices targeted
    by SUIT protocols. A device security is characterized by five Boolean security
    attributes: firmware loader (FLD), one time programmable memory (OTP), secure
    firmware loader (FLD-SEC), tamper resistant key (TRT-KEY) and diversified key
    (DIV-KEY). This classification creates 18 device classes.</p>"
