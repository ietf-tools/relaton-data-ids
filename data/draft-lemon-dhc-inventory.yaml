abstract:
- content: "<p>In the years since DHCPv4 gained widespread popularity, one of the
    uses to which organizations have put it is inventory tracking: associating identifiers
    scanned from packaging with records in an inventory database. This document describes
    various means for accomplishing the same purpose using DHCPv6. This document also
    updates RFC3315 by clarifying the meaning of some normative language regarding
    the DUID-LL and DUID-LLT DUID types.</p>"
