abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements, and
    captures design aspects for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 (L7) Location Configuration Protocol
    (LCP). This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information,
    by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located
    in the access network. The obtained location information can then be used for
    a variety of different protocols and purposes. For example, it can be used as
    input to the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol or to convey location
    within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to other entities. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
