abstract:
- content: "<p>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) Protocol can
    use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
    as its underlying transport layer. But it permits TCP to be used as a transport
    protocol for RADIUS only when a transport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides
    confidentiality and security. QUIC inherently supports encryption (using TLS 1.3),
    which could provide a higher level of security. And QUIC supports multiple streams
    over a single connection, enhancing throughput and efficiency. This document defines
    RADIUS over the QUIC transport protocol, named RADIUSoQUIC.</p>"
