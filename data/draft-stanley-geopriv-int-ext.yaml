abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the definition of Interior Location defined in
    draft-rosen-geopriv-pidf-interior to include a set of registered elements that
    allow for the expression of relative location. The expression of relative location
    enables LAN technologies that have such capability to provide a more accurate
    location description than normally allowed using [RFC4776] [RFC5139]. By registering
    the elements described here, interoperability between applications and vendors
    is enabled.</p>"
