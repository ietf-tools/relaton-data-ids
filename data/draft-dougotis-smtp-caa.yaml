abstract:
- content: <p>The helo/ehlo domain reported by a client at the beginning of an SMTP
    [RFC2821] session has largely been ignored without reliable means to verify this
    information. To properly recognize a domain sending mail, the domain of the client
    must be verifiable. This document utilizes a DNS SRV record that extends the definitions
    for fields of this record as defined in [RFC2782] where the label becomes unique
    by appending a label of "__caa" following the Proto field. Server verification
    of permitted client addresses becomes possible as a method to confirm the domain
    of a client without having prior information shared. Cooperation between client
    and server domains utilizing this method exclude third party masquerades as originating
    from within cooperative domains. Initially only a notice of Unknown or Unconfirmed
    will be added to mail from uncooperative domains unless the domain is determined
    to be not valid, where then the mail will be refused. This added notice provides
    assurance the server is checking client domains in addition to alerting users
    to the level of mail compliance on received mail. Once use of this method is common
    practice in conjunction with other means for confirming the client domain, mail
    may be refused if the client and/or domain fails these confirmation checks.</p>
