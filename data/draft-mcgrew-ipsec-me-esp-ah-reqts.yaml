abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft is an individual submission that proposes an update
    to the Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP and AH; it
    also adds usage guidance to help in the selection of these algorithms. The Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH) protocols makes use of various
    cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality and/or data origin authentication
    to protected data communications in the IP Security (IPsec) architecture. To ensure
    interoperability between disparate implementations, the IPsec standard specifies
    a set of mandatory-to- implement algorithms. This document specifies the current
    set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms for ESP and AH, specifies algorithms
    that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future
    time, and also recommends against the implementation of some obsolete algorithms.
    Usage guidance is also provided to help the user of ESP and AH best achieve their
    security goals through appropriate choices of cryptographic algorithms.</p>"
