abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signalling monitoring tools to diagnose user reported
    problems and for regression testing if network or user agent software is upgraded.
    As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks,
    it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signalling will take between
    user agents, and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signalling end-to-end. This
    document describes an indicator for the SIP protocol which can be used to mark
    signalling as of interest to logging. Such marking will typically be applied as
    part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular
    user agent signalling. However, such marking can be carried end-to-end including
    the SIP user agents, even if a session originates and terminates in different
    networks.</p>"
