abstract:
- content: "<p>Network services become increasingly multifarious. To efficiently guarantee
    the quality of services and fully utilize the network resources, network operators
    need to process the traffic flows through more fine-grained way. It is a promising
    way to deploy a series of middleboxes integrating various functions. However,
    this results in two challenges: 1) how to control such increasingly different
    middleboxes; 2) how can networks provide a common joint control scheme for both
    the middleboxes and forwarding elements. This document proposes a common joint
    scheme for middleboxes and forwarding elements. This scheme adopts logically centralized
    control method and utilizes standard control interfaces, which makes it flexible
    and efficient for the networks to determine the most optimizing path and the most
    appropriate functions in the middleboxes for traffic flows. It guarantees the
    quality of services and significantly improves resource utilization.</p>"
