abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the transport of call control User-to-User
    Information (UUI) using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and develops several
    requirements for a new SIP mechanism. Some SIP sessions are established by or
    related to a non-SIP application. This application may have information that needs
    to be transported between the SIP User Agents during session establishment. In
    addition to interworking with the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) UUI
    Service, this extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints requiring application
    UUI. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
