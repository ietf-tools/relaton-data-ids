abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes protocol independent methods called Explicit
    Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques that can be applicable to transport-layer
    protocols between client and server. These methods employ just a few marking bits
    inside the header of each packet for performance measurements and require collaborative
    client and server. Both endpoints cooperate by marking and, possibly, mirroring
    information back and forward on the round-trip connection. The techniques are
    especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport headers,
    since they enable loss and delay measurements by passive on-path network devices.
    Different techniques are considered within this document.</p>"
