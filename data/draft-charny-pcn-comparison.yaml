abstract:
- content: "<p>Several, sometimes conflicting proposals have been offered for the
    consideration of the PCN WG regarding PCN internal node and PCN edge node behaviors.
    Based on the WG charter, the WG needs to make a decision on which of the proposed
    PCN-interior-node and PCN-boundary- nodes behaviors to endorse. The primary goal
    of this draft is twofold. First, we attempt to summarize the functional differences
    between the proposed alternatives. Second, we provide a brief summary of performance
    evaluation results. Finally we propose a view on how a (parameterized) specification
    of the PCN-interior-node metering and marking function can be described to enable
    several of the proposed behaviors. We argue that if this parameterized specification
    is used for specifying the PCN-interior-node behavior, then it can support a range
    of behaviors at the PCN-boundary-node. The decision on which of the PCN-boundary-node
    behaviors to choose can then be considered separately. We also discuss complexities
    associated with choosing such uniform approach.</p>"
