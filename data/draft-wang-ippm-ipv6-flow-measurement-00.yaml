abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) need carrying
    necessary measurement information in the packet while the packet transverses a
    path between two points in the network to mark the packet. The Alternate-Marking
    is a kind of marking method and is presented in RFC 8321, Alternate-Marking Method
    for Passive and Hybrid Performance Monitoring, and RFC 8889, Multipoint Alternate-
    Marking Method for Passive and Hybrid Performance Monitoring. This document describes
    how to deploy in-situ flow performance measurement based on Alternate-Marking
    method in IPv6 domain.</p>"
