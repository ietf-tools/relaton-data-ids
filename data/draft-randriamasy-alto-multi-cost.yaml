abstract:
- content: <p>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer traffic
    Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an "Endpoint Cost Service"
    and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and thus incentives for application clients
    to connect to ISP preferred Endpoints. These services provide a view of the Network
    Provider (NP) topology to overlay clients. The present draft proposes a simple
    way to extend the information provided by the current ALTO protocol in two ways.
    First, including information on multiple Cost Types in a single ALTO transaction
    provides a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the growing diversity
    of Content and Resources Networking Applications and to the network conditions.
    Second, one ALTO query and response exchange on N Cost Types is faster and more
    efficient than N single cost transactions. All this also helps producing a faster
    and more robust choice when multiple Endpoints need to be selected. Last, the
    draft proposes to enrich the filtering capabilities by allowing constraints involving
    several metrics combined by several types of logical operators. This allows the
    applications to set finer requirements and above all to include compromises on
    those requirements.</p>
