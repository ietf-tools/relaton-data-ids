abstract:
- content: "<p>Content publishers are increasingly using multiple CDNs to publish
    content to the consumers. It is important to take into account their specific
    requirements with respect to workflow restrictions with respect to content licensing
    rules. Also, certain content applications have specific delivery requirements
    that need to considered while negotiating or signaling inter-CDN arrangements.
    This contribution highlights some of these use cases to help motivate discussion.</p>"
