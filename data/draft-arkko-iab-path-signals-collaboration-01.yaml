abstract:
- content: "<p>Encryption and other security mechanisms are on the rise on all layers
    of the stack, protecting user data and making network operations more secured.
    Further, encryption is also a tool to address ossification that has been observed
    over time. Separation of functions into layers and enforcement of layer boundaries
    based on encryption supports selected exposure to those entities that are addressed
    by a function on a certain layer. A clear separation supports innovation and also
    enables new opportunities for collaborative functions. RFC 8558 describes path
    signals as messages to or from on-path elements. This document states principles
    for designing mechanisms that use or provide path signals and calls for actions
    on specific valuable cases.</p>"
