abstract:
- content: "<p>Path Computation Element (PCE) is proposed for path computation in
    multi-layer and multi-domain networks where PCE can be implemented in either centralized
    method or distributed method. In the former case, PCE can serve tens or hundreds
    of nodes simultaneously, while in the later case, each node is equipped with a
    PCE, which can be regarded as a distributed routing controller (DRC) in GMPLS
    networks and each one of those provides similar path computation capability. PCE
    and DRC have different advantages in path computation respectively. PCE is suitable
    for cross-layer and cross-domain path computation, especially in multi-constraints
    environment. But distributed routing controller is good at path computation in
    parallel ways and distributed network control in local domain. A cooperative path
    computation architecture named Dual Routing Engine (DRE) is necessary to be used
    in the future networks, for it based on the ideas of the cooperation of these
    two types of path computation engines and can take the advantages of both centralized
    and distributed method by which the PCE is implemented. The corresponding PCE
    communication protocol extension and other protocol requirements for cooperation
    between PCE and distributed routing controller are listed in this document to
    recommend the standard interfaces between different components in DRE architecture.</p>"
