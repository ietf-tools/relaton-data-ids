abstract:
- content: <p>The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
    (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control
    Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/ AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile
    for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF). This document provides guidelines for payload
    type number usage policy when dynamic payload type allocation is used. Also this
    document updates closed IANA registry "RTP Payload types (PT) for standard audio
    and video encodings".</p>
