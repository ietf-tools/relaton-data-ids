abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers are starting to deploy computing capabilities across
    the network for hosting applications such as AR/VR, vehicle networks, IoT, and
    AI training, among others. In these distributed computing environments, information
    about computing and communication resources is necessary to determine both the
    proper deployment location of each application and the best server location on
    which to run it. This information is used by numerous different implementations
    with different interpretations. This document proposes an initial approach towards
    a common understanding and exposure scheme for metrics reflecting compute capabilities.</p>"
