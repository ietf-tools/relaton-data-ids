abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use case of providing IPsec-based flow
    protection by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller (aka. Security
    Controller) and establishes the requirements to support this service. It considers
    two main well-known scenarios in IPsec: (i) gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-host.
    This document describes a mechanism based on the SDN paradigm to support the distribution
    and monitoring of IPsec information from a SDN controller to one or several flow-based
    Network Security Function (NSF). The NSFs implement IPsec to protect data traffic
    between network resources with IPsec. The document focuses in the NSF Facing Interface
    by providing models for Configuration and State data model required to allow the
    Security Controller to configure the IPsec databases (SPD, SAD, PAD) and IKE to
    establish security associations with a reduced intervention of the network administrator.
    NOTE: State data model will be developed as part of this work but it is still
    TBD.</p>"
