abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the multipath ChaMeLeon (M-CML) routing protocol
    designed for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). M-CML is a multi-path, hybrid routing
    protocol operating within a defined area denoted as the Critical Area (CA) in
    which the MANET is temporarily deployed during the post-disaster phase. The main
    concept behind M- CML is the adaptability of its routing mechanisms towards changes
    in the physical and logical state of a MANET. For autonomous communications in
    MANET, it is likely that the network size varies whenever additional devices join
    or subset of them leave the network. In addition, battery depletion of lightweight
    mobile communication devices will stipulate another reason for changes in the
    network size. As a result, the M-CML approach adapts its routing mechanism according
    to changes in the network scenario within a predefined CA. For small networks,
    M-CML routes data proactively using the Optimized Link State Routing version v2
    (OLSRv2) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the reactive Ad hoc
    On- Demand Distance Vector Version 2 (AODVv2) Routing protocol. The oscillation
    phase is the intermediate phase in which the transition of routing protocol occurs.
    M-CML creates multi-path routes for nodes with disjoint paths which increases
    the network reliability.</p>"
