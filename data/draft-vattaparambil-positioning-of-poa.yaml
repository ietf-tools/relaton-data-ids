abstract:
- content: "<p>Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization is a generic and decentralized
    subgranting based authorization technique. In this, a principal can grant limited
    credibilities for an agent to act on its behalf for some limited time and context.
    This can be used in both constrained and non-constrained environments. PoA is
    a self- contained document that a principal sign and directs to an agent, thereby
    providing it the power to execute user actions on behalf of the principal for
    a predefined time. In this document, we compare PoA based authorization with different
    existing internet protocols for authorization and the relation with existing identity
    solutions.</p>"
