abstract:
- content: "<p>The Seamoby Working Group has been working toward specification of
    an IP-level protocol for Dormant Mode Host Alerting (DMHA), sometimes known as
    IP-paging or simply paging (the terms IP-DMHA, DMHA, IP Paging, and Paging will
    be used interchangeably in this document). A problem statement and requirements
    have been developed, and in response to a request for protocol submissions, five
    protocols were submitted.</p>"
