abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a proposal for a multi-purpose Generic Control
    Protocol (IGCP) for IP based networks. There is a growing need for a generic control
    protocol framework that can be further customized to specific usage contexts in
    which certain types of control information exchange messages and behavior among
    some functional entities hosted by different nodes or devices is desired. For
    example, the growing area of self-management, self-organization and autonomic
    networking introduces functional entities into the node/device and network architectures
    that need to exchange control information in order to implement self-adaptive
    behavior by dynamically configuring and optimizing the network. In this Draft
    we capture a number of control message exchange types of contexts (semantics)
    that can be selectively applied in the exchange of control information, which
    can form the basis of a generic control protocol, while at the same time defining
    the part in the message format that can be further customized according to the
    needs of specific functional entities designed to use the generic control protocol
    for exchanging control information. In this Draft, we present our proposal for
    such a generic control protocol, whose message format is divided into two parts:
    a Common Part and a Generic Data Part. The Common Part defines a set of a variety
    of selectable control semantics (e.g. simple one-way control information flow,
    indications of whether an acknowledgement is needed or not, solicitations for
    information or push/pull behaviors, negotiations for parameter value settings,
    etc). The Generic Data Part can be further customized and structured according
    to some specific use case of conveying control information carried by the Data
    Part that need to be parsed and used by some entities designed to interpret the
    Data Part according to their own specific customization and structuring of the
    Data Part. We also give an example domain of application of the IGCP, namely the
    domain of autonomic adaptive control of network behaviours, of which we illustrate
    further by providing an example Use Case that customizes the Data Part of the
    IGCP for use by special functional entities residing in different nodes in exchanging
    information using the IGCP messages.</p>"
