abstract:
- content: "<p>SIPNAT has been proposed as an effective method for enabling global
    Internet access to IPv6-only domains. New methods have been devised for accurate
    delivery of packets from the global Internet into the internal domain of destinations
    that do not share a common address space with the majority of the global Internet.
    These improvements can be used to augment Source-IP NAT so that perfect accuracy
    can be achieved in many common cases of interest.</p>"
