abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE), as described in
    RFC 2516, mandates a maximum negotiated Maximum Receive Unit (MRU) of 1492. This
    document outlines a solution that relaxes this restriction and allows a maximum
    negotiated MRU greater than 1492 to minimize fragmentation in next-generation
    broadband networks. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
