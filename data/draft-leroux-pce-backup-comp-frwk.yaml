abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a framework for the use of Path Computation
    Elements (PCE) to compute bypass tunnels paths, in the context of the MPLS-TE
    Fast Reroute, while allowing bandwidth sharing between bypass tunnels protecting
    independent resources. Both a centralized and a distributed PCE scenarios are
    described. The corresponding required Routing and signalling extensions are beyond
    the scope of this framework and will be addressed in separate documents.</p>"
