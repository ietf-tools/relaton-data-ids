abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem (GGIE).
    The GGIE goal is to improve how the Internet is used for all video, both amateur
    and professional, reflecting that the line between amature and professional video
    technology is increasinly blurred. As the Glass to Glass (camera lens to viewing
    screen) name implies GGIE's scope is from the original recording by a lens, through
    the steps of editing, packaging, distributed and searching, and finally viewing.
    GGIE is not a complete end to end architecture or solution, it is use cases and
    technical specifications that can serve as foundational building blocks for new
    Internet video innovation. This is a companion effort to the GGIE W3C Taskforce
    in the W3C Web and TV Interest Group. This document is being discussed on the
    ggie@ietg.org mailing list.</p>"
