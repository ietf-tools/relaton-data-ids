abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on many live deployments, including the Sochi Winter Olympics
    2014 network and multiple interoperability events, this document provides advice
    to network operators about best practices when implementing IEEE 802.1aq Shortest
    Path Bridging (SPB) networks. It is principally addressed to system integrators
    and solution providers, including those that do not yet support SPB. Some advice
    to protocol implementers is also provided. The intention of the advice is to facilitate
    multi vendor network deployments as well as provide guidance for new installations.</p>"
