abstract:
- content: "<p>DiffServ architecture provides a set of 'user plane' tools for IP QoS.
    Deployment of DiffServ is starting with static, single-domain solutions. Dynamic
    QoS and multi-domain QoS are still open issues, as witnessed by the activity of
    the IETF NSIS WG, related to the 'signaling plane'. In order to realize true end-to-end
    QoS services in the Internet, spanning multiple administrative domains, efficient
    and scalable signaling and resource control mechanisms are needed. This document
    describes a scalable inter-domain resource control architecture for DiffServ networks.
    The architecture is called BGRP Plus, as it extends the previously proposed BGRP
    framework.</p>"
