abstract:
- content: "<p>PAWS provides protection against old duplicated segments caused by
    wrapped sequence or earlier incarnated connections. One drawback of PAWS is that
    it requires to place timestamp option in all segments, which consumes 10-12 bytes
    in the option space of TCP. In addition, since PAWS just checks if timestamps
    is older or not, the protection logic is not very strong against malicious attacks
    or cannot work properly in some situations. On the other hand, some other technologies
    which can provide stronger protections than PAWS are becoming available these
    days. In this document, we propose to utilize other protection mechanisms as replacements
    of PAWS when they are available.</p>"
