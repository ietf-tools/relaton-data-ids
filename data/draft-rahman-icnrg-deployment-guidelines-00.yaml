abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides technical deployment guidelines for the ICN
    community. First, the possible deployment configurations for ICN are described
    including overlay and underlay approaches. Then proposed deployment migration
    paths for these configurations are outlined to address the major issues facing
    ICN such as application migration, and core and edge network migration. Next,
    selected ICN trial experiences are summarized. Finally, recommendations are given
    for protocol areas that require further standardization to facilitate future ICN
    interoperable deployments.</p>"
