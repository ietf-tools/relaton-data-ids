abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP is an authentication protocol which supports multiple authentication
    mechanisms. EAP typically runs directly over the link layer without requiring
    IP and therefore includes its own support for in-order delivery and re-transmission.
    While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is also now in use with
    IEEE 802. This document defines the One Time Password (OTP) and Generic Token
    Card EAP methods.</p>"
