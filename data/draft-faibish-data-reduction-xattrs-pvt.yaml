abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extending NFSv4 operations to enable file extended
    attributes or xattr to be used in the protocol to provide information about the
    data reduction properties of files. New xattrs are proposed to allow the client
    application to communicate to the NFSv4 server data reduction attributes associated
    with files and directories using opaque metadata, not interpreted by the file
    system, but communicated to the Block Storage data reduction engines. Corresponding
    new file attributes are proposed to allow clients and client applications to query
    the server for data reduction xattr support and allow to get and set data reduction
    xattrs on files and directories. Such data reduction metadata is used as hints
    to the file server about what type of data reduction to apply. The proposed data
    reduction attributes include achievable ratios for compression and deduplication
    plus whether each data reduction technique applies to the file.</p>"
