abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework that describes a solution space
    for the control and management of optical interfaces according to the Black Link
    approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU.G698.2] and further revisions. In particular,
    it examines topological elements and related network management measures. Optical
    Routing and Wavelength assignment based on WSON is out of scope. This document
    concentrates on the management of optical interfaces. The application of a dynamic
    control plane, e.g. for auto-discovery or for the distribtion of interface parameters,
    is complementary. Anyway, this work is not in conflict with WSON but leverages
    and supports related work already done for management plane and control plane.
    The framework document will not address the client mapping into G.709. This document
    only addresses the lower layers. Furthermore, support for Fast Fault Detection,
    to e.g. trigger Protection Switching is provided by the WDM interface capability
    of the client interface (e.g. ITU-T G.709) is out of scope for this work. Additionally
    the wavelength ordering process and the process how to determine the demand for
    a new wavelength from A to Z is out of scope.</p>"
