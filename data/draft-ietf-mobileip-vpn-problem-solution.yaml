abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the proposed solution for the Mobile IPv4 and
    IPsec coexistence problem for enterprise users. The solution consists of an applicability
    statement for using Mobile IPv4 and IPsec for session mobility in corporate remote
    access scenarios, and a required mechanism for detecting the trusted internal
    network securely. The solution requires only changes to the mobile node; changes
    to Mobile IPv4 or IPsec are not required.</p>"
