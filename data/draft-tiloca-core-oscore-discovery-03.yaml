abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    can be secured by means of Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (OSCORE). At deployment time, devices may not know the exact OSCORE groups to
    join, the respective Group Manager, or other information required to perform the
    joining process. This document describes how a CoAP endpoint can use the CoRE
    Resource Directory to discover OSCORE groups and acquire information to join them
    through the respective Group Manager. A given OSCORE group may protect multiple
    application groups, which are separately announced in the Resource Directory as
    sets of endpoints sharing a pool of resources. This approach is consistent with,
    but not limited to, the joining of OSCORE groups based on the ACE framework for
    Authentication and Authorization in constrained environments.</p>"
