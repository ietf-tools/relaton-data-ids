abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a BGP-based method to communicate source IP
    reverse-path reachability for sources of multicast IP traffic which is available
    via AMT (RFC 7450). This document defines a new SAFI (Subsequent Address Family
    Identifier) Parameter type for MBGP which declares the next hop for RPF (Reverse
    Path Forwarding) of a source IP to be the AMT tunnel discovered via an explicitly
    provided anycast IP address for AMT Relay Discovery.</p>"
