abstract:
- content: "<p>Large-scale supercomputing and AI data centers utilize multipath to
    implement load balancing and/or improve transport reliability. Adaptive routing
    (AR), widely used in direct topologies such as dragonfly, is growing popular in
    commodity data centers to dynamically adjust routing policies based on path congestion
    and failures. When congestion or failure occurs, the sensing node can not only
    apply AR locally but also send the congestion/failure information to other nodes
    in a timely and accurate manner to enforce AR on other nodes, thus avoiding exacerbating
    congestion on the reported path. This document specifies Adaptive Routing Notification
    (ARN), a general mechanism to proactively disseminate congestion detection and
    congestion elimination information for remote nodes to perform re-routing policies.</p>"
