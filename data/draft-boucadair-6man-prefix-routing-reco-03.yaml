abstract:
- content: "<p>The length of IP prefixes is an information used by forwarding and
    routing processes is policy-based. As such, no maximum length must be assumed
    by design. Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing revealed a need
    for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used by forwarding decision-making
    processes. This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding
    and routing designs with regards to the prefix length. The aim is to avoid hard-coded
    routing and forwarding designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</p>"
