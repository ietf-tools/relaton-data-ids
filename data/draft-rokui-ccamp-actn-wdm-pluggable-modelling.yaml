abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft outlines the modeling of optical pluggables within a host
    packet device in the context of a packet over optical network. The model encompasses
    all pertinent properties of the pluggable for various packet over optical use
    cases and is partitioned into three primary areas: the optical media side, the
    electrical plug to host interconnect, and the physical equipment of the pluggable.
    Included in the model are representations of configuration, states, and telemetry
    data, as well as of profiles and coherent plug capabilities. Emphasizing the importance
    of considering both vendor- agnostic and vendor-specific attributes in modeling
    coherent pluggables. Drawing from existing IETF models and potentially complementing
    that with input from other standard or industrial forum models (ITU-T, OpenConfig,
    ONF TAPI etc.), this model offers enhanced uniform structuring and naming. This
    draft introduces the concept of "Coherent Pluggable Manifest", where it represents
    the capabilities of pluggable, maintained in a repository. This document also
    covers gap analysis of current IETF drafts and other SDOs on coherent Pluggable
    attributes and provides the complete lifecycle of a coherent pluggable from operators''
    approval through viability assessment to deployment. This document also covers
    an analysis of the gap between current IETF drafts and the corresponding works
    in other standards bodies and industry. The lifecycle of a coherent pluggable
    from operators'' approval, viability assessment to deployment and monitoring is
    also covered.</p>'
