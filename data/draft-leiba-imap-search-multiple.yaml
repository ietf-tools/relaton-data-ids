abstract:
- content: "<p>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected mailbox.
    A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a client that wishes to support
    this must issue a series of SELECT and SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete
    before moving on to the next. This extension allows a client to search multiple
    mailboxes with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various searches
    to complete. This also introduces named searches, allowing a client to pipeline
    the searches if it chooses.</p>"
