- content: "<p>NFS Version 4 [RFC3010] provided support for client/server interactions
    to support replication and migration, but left unspecified how replication and
    migration would be done. This document is an initial draft of a protocol which
    could be used to transfer filesystem data and metadata for use with replication
    and migration services for NFS Version 4.</p>"
