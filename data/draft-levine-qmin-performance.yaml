abstract:
- content: "<p>QNAME minimization improves DNS privacy by truncating query names sent
    to authoritative name servers. While it works well when there is a zone cut between
    each label in a name, when a zone includes more than one level of labels, it can
    cause multiple redundant queries to the same server, significantly increasing
    the load on that server without additional privacy benefits. This document describes
    some situations where minimization causes load problems and potential ways to
    fix the problem.</p>"
