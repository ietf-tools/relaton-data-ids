abstract:
- content: "<p>While both ForCES and OpenFlow follow the basic idea of separations
    of forwarding plane and control plane in network elements, they have some technical
    differences. This document analyzes the differences between OpenFlow and ForCES
    technically from the aspects of goals, architecture, forwarding model and protocol
    interface. The two techniques can learn much from each other in their standardization
    process.</p>"
