abstract:
- content: "<p>Rules for validating identifier labels and alternate representations
    of those labels (variants) are known as Label Generation Rulesets (LGRs); they
    are used for the implementation of identifier systems such as Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs). This document describes ways to design LGRs to support variant
    labels. In designing LGRs, it is important to ensure that the label generation
    rules are consistent and well behaved in the presence of variants. The design
    decisions can then be expressed using the XML representation of LGRs that is defined
    in RFC 7940.</p>"
