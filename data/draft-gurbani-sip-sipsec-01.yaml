abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), there does not
    exist any means for a user agent client (UAC) to signal to the destination user
    agent server (UAS) that an end-to-end secure channel is to be established. Instead,
    what is prevalent today in the protocol is a hop-by-hop security model, wherein
    intermediaries forward a request towards the destination without the UAC knowing
    whether or not the intermediary behaved in a trusted manner (i.e., it did not,
    unknown to the UAC, downgrade the security of the downstream channel from the
    intermediary onwards). This document discusses the security properties of a hop-by-hop
    model; and in doing so, formulates requirements an for an end-to-end security
    model and a solution that satisfies these requirements.</p>"
