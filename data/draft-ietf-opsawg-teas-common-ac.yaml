abstract:
- content: "<p>The document specifies a common Attachment Circuits (ACs) YANG module,
    which is designed with the intent to be reusable by other models. For example,
    this common model can be reused by service models to expose ACs as a service,
    service models that require binding a service to a set of ACs, network and device
    models to provision ACs, etc.</p>"
