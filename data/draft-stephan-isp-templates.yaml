abstract:
- content: "<p>Flows and packets observations require several levels of aggregations.
    Currently switchs and routers analyse flows and export flow information using
    Netflow. Aggregators are starting to use Netflow or IPFIX to collect basic information
    and to export aggregated information. In this context, this memo presents potential
    interoperability issues and proposes to standardize a set of templates to facilitate
    the exchange of flows and measurements information between ISP.</p>"
