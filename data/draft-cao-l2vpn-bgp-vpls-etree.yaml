abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum
    (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service using BGP for auto-discovery
    and signaling [RFC4761]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking pseudowire
    between Leafs to fulfill the specific E-Tree requirement: Leaf cannot communicate
    with Leaf. Backward compatibility is also considered.</p>"
