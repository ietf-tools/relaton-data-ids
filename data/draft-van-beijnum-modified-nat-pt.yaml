abstract:
- content: "<p>A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all hosts
    are upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6- only, or that
    there be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk to IPv4-only hosts. Expecting
    the former within a reasonable timeframe isn't realistic, based on current adoption
    of dual stack combined with the latest projections for the IPv4 depletion that
    point to a date early in the next decade. And the IETF has recently deprecated
    the main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT. This document proposes modifications
    to NAT-PT that address the reasons why the mechanism was deprecated. This should
    allow future deployment of the modified NAT-PT as an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism,
    giving operators the option of running their networks largely IPv6-only.</p>"
