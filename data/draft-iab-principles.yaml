abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion
    from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution
    is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems
    useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.
    This is intended for general guidance and general interest, and is in no way intended
    to be a formal or invariant reference model. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
    kind.</p>"
