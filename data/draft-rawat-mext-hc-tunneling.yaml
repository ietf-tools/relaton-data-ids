abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP tunneling mechanisms have important applications in network
    solutions and are widely used in numerous contexts such as security (VPN), IPv4
    to IPv6 transition, and mobility support (MobileIP and NEMO). However, these tunneling
    mechanisms induce a large overhead resulting from adding several protocol headers
    in each packet. This overhead deteriorates performance on wireless links which
    are scarce in resources. Header compression methods are often used on connection
    oriented communication (e.g., UMTS networks) to reduce the overhead on the wireless
    part. These header compression methods can be used on tunnel headers to reduce
    the protocol header overheads, independent of the payload type. Although, several
    header compression methods exist, the header compression profiles defined by them
    are not adapted to the characteristics of IP tunneling. This document specifies
    a tunneling header compression protocol for IP tunneling mechanisms.</p>"
