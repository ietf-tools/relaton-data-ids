abstract:
- content: "<p>With the growth and commercialization of the Internet, the need for
    secure IP multicast is growing. In this draft we present a taxonomy of multicast
    security issues. We first sketch some multicast group parameters that are relevant
    to security, and outline the basic security issues concerning multicast in general,
    with emphasis on IP multicast. Next we suggest two 'benchmark' scenarios for secure
    multicast solutions. Lastly we review some previous works.</p>"
