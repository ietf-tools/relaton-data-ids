abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a data model and JSON representation of
    calendar data that can be used for storage and data exchange in a calendaring
    and scheduling environment. It aims to be an alternative and, over time, successor
    to the widely deployed iCalendar data format. It also aims to be unambiguous,
    extendable, and simple to process. In contrast to the jCal format, which is also
    based on JSON, JSCalendar is not a direct mapping from iCalendar but defines the
    data model independently and expands semantics where appropriate. This specification
    obsoletes [RFC8984].</p>"
