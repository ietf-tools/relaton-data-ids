abstract:
- content: "<p>Data aggregation is a key energy saving functionality in wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) for both data gathering applications and event-based applications,
    since the communication cost is often the higher order of the computation cost.
    Through data aggregation, we can reduce the scale of data while maintaining the
    correctness of data for a set of symmetric functions called divisible perfectly
    compressible (DPC) functions. Also the achievable minimum data rate among all
    sensor nodes is limited for random WSNs if we insist data from ALL sensors should
    be collected. Hence we use gathering efficiency to indicate the number of nodes
    whose data are gathered. It is intuitive that there exists a tradeoff between
    the aggregation throughput and gathering efficiency. This document introduces
    adaptive data aggregation schemes for WSN to consider the tradeoffs between the
    aggregation throughput and gathering efficiency. Specifically, the adaptive data
    aggregation schemes includes two protocols, Single-Hop-Length (SHL) Scheme and
    Multiple-Hop-Length (MHL) Scheme, for different gathering efficiency requirements.</p>"
