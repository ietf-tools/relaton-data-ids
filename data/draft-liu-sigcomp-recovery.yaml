abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a recovery mechanism for signaling compression
    (SigComp). It allows a decompressor to signal to its peer compressor in case it
    has lost synchronization with the compressor. The compressor can thereafter take
    appropriate recovery actions. The signals are carried using the state announcement
    mechanism as defined in SigComp.</p>"
