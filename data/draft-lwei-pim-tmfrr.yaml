abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines simple extensions to PIM to support Tunnel
    based Multicast Fast Reroute (TMFRR) utilizing different tunnel technologies.
    This mechanism allows protection of native IP multicast traffic against link or
    node failures, with minimal traffic interruption, compared with situations relying
    on unicast and multicast route convergence. The repair for link or node failure
    happens locally near the point of failure. This version of specification addresses
    PIM-SM and SSM traffic protection.</p>"
