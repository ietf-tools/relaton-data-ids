abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose an extension to RSVP-TE for setting up and maintaining Bi-directional
    Optical Switched Paths (BOSPs) in optical networks with symmetric traffic patterns.
    The requirement for wavelength continuity for some types of optical networks with
    no (or partial) wavelength conversion is also supported. It follows the framework
    of MPLS and extends the RSVP-TE to support the signaling for the provisioning
    of BOSPs. We introduce a new c-types for bi-directional LSPs in both Label Request
    object and Label object. Each LSR (OXC), upon receiving an RESV message for a
    BOSP, will allocate a pair of labels. One label is for the incoming port from
    the next hop and the other is for the incoming port from the previous hop. The
    labels here include fiber ID, wavelength ID and sub-channel ID (if applicable).
    This extension requires a minimum change to the existing RSVP-TE protocol. It
    avoids the problem of contention where two OXCs assign the same wavelength on
    a uni-directional link for two different sessions. This contention arises in both
    [4] and [5]. As a result, no additional mechanism for contention resolution is
    needed.</p>"
