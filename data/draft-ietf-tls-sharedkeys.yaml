abstract:
- content: "<p>The TLS handshake requires the use of CPU-intensive public-key algorithms
    with a considerable overhead in resource-constrained environments or ones such
    as mainframes where users are charged for CPU time. This document describes a
    means of employing TLS using symmetric keys or passwords shared in advance among
    communicating parties. No modifications or alterations to the TLS protocol are
    required for this process.</p>"
