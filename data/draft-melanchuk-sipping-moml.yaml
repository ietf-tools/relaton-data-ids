abstract:
- content: "<p>The Media Objects Markup Language (MOML) is a modular and extensible
    language to define media processing objects which execute on media servers. The
    base language defines a set of primitive media objects (called primitives) and
    provides tools to group primitives together and specify how they interact with
    each other. Clients use the base MOML, or extend MOML, to create precisely tailored
    media processing objects which may be used as parts of application interactions
    with users or conferences or to transform media flowing internal to a media server.
    IVR is an example of an application interaction with a user.</p>"
