abstract:
- content: "<p>A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path computations,
    for instance calculating a diverse working and protected path do not share common
    network points, would need to synchronize the computations in order to increase
    the probability of meeting the working and protected path disjoint objective and
    network resource optimization objective. When a PCE computes multiple sets of
    dependent path computation requests concurrently, it is required to use Synchronization
    VECtor (SVEC) list for association among the sets of dependent path computation
    requests. This document describes the usage of multiple SVECs in the SVEC list
    and its processing guideline, for the synchronized computation of dependent paths.</p>"
