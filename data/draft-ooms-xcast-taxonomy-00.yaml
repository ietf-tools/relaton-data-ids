abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better
    with the number of multicast sessions than traditional multicast does (DCM [BLAZ],
    SGM [BOIV], Somecast [HELD], MDO6 [IMAI], CLM [OOMS], ERM [SHAN], REUNITE [STOI]).
    These proposals are also known as Explict Multicast (xcast; explicit list of destinations)
    or Small Group Multicast (sgm; the main application being few-to-few communication).
    To stimulate and streamline the discussion this draft is an attempt to make a
    taxonomy of these mechanisms.</p>"
