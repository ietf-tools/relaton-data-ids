abstract:
- content: "<p>Delivery status notifications (DSNs) are critical to the correct operation
    of an email system. However, the existing Draft Standards (RFC 3461, RFC 3464,
    RFC 6522) are presently limited to ASCII text in the machine-readable portions
    of the protocol. This specification adds a new address type for international
    email addresses so an original recipient address with non-ASCII characters can
    be correctly preserved even after downgrading. This also provides updated content
    return media types for delivery status notifications and message disposition notifications
    to support use of the new address type. This document extends RFC 3461, RFC 3464,
    RFC 3798, and RFC 6522. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
