abstract:
- content: "<p>Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route
    leaks are provided in [RFC7908]. This document describes a new well- known Large
    Community that provides a way for route leak prevention, detection, and mitigation.
    The configuration process for this Community can be automated with the methodology
    for setting BGP roles that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.</p>"
