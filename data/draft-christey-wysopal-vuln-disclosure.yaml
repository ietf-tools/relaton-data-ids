abstract:
- content: "<p>New vulnerabilities in software and hardware products are discovered
    and publicized on a daily basis. The disclosure of vulnerability information has
    been a divisive topic for years. During the process of disclosure, many vendors,
    security researchers, and other parties follow a variety of unwritten or informal
    guidelines for how they interact and share information. Some parties may be unaware
    of these guidelines, or they may intentionally ignore them. This state of affairs
    can make it difficult to achieve a satisfactory outcome for everyone who uses
    or is affected by vulnerability information.</p>"
