abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures and protocol extensions for the
    use of Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in
    Multiprotocol Label Switching-Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) packet networks and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) packet and non-packet networks to support the establishment
    and maintenance of Label Switched Paths that cross domain boundaries. For the
    purpose of this document, a domain is considered to be any collection of network
    elements within a common realm of address space or path computation responsibility.
    Examples of such domains include Autonomous Systems, Interior Gateway Protocol
    (IGP) routing areas, and GMPLS overlay networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
