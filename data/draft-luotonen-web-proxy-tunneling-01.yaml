abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a generic tunneling mechanism for TCP based
    protocols through Web proxy servers. This tunneling mechanism was initially introduced
    for the SSL protocol [SSL] to allow secure Web traffic to pass through firewalls,
    but its utility is not limited to SSL. Earlier drafts of this specification were
    titled 'Tunneling SSL through Web Proxy Servers' &lt;draft-luotonen-ssl-tunneling-XX.txt&gt;.
    Implementations of this tunneling feature are commonly referred to as 'SSL tunneling',
    although, again, it can be used for tunneling any TCP based protocol. A wide variety
    of existing client and proxy server implementations conform to this specification.
    The purpose of this specification is to describe the current practice, to propose
    some good practices for implementing this specification, and to document the security
    considerations that are involved with this protocol.</p>"
