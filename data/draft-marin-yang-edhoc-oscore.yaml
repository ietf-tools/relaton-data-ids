abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines YANG data models which allow a Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) Controller (Controller) using NETCONF, RESTCONF or CORECONF to
    provide configuration and monitoring Internet-of-Things devices (Things) that
    support Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) and/or OSCORE. In particular,
    a YANG data model defines the required configuration parameters to perform EDHOC
    between two Things (EDHOC case). Another YANG data model is to configure the OSCORE
    contexts directly into the Thing (OSCORE case). The service described in this
    document allows the configuration and monitoring of Things that supports EDHOC
    and OSCORE or only OSCORE by allowing a protected Thing-to-Thing communication
    based on CoAP. This document focuses on providing YANG data models for configuring
    EDHOC or OSCORE. This allows OSCORE establishment with minimal intervention by
    the network administrator.</p>"
