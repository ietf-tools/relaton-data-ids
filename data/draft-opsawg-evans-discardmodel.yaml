abstract:
- content: "<p>Router reported packet loss is the primary signal of when a network
    is not doing its job. Some packet loss is normal or intended in TCP/ IP networks,
    however. To minimise network packet loss through automated network operations
    we need clear and accurate signals of all packets which are dropped and why. This
    document defines an information model for packet loss reporting, which classifies
    these signals to enable automated network mitigation of unintended packet loss.</p>"
