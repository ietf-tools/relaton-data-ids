abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) Map-Versioning
    mechanism, which provides in-packet information about Endpoint ID to Routing Locator
    (EID-to-RLOC) mappings used to encapsulate LISP data packets. The proposed approach
    is based on associating a version number to EID-to-RLOC mappings and the transport
    of such a version number in the LISP-specific header of LISP-encapsulated packets.
    LISP Map-Versioning is particularly useful to inform communicating Ingress Tunnel
    Routers (ITRs) and Egress Tunnel Routers (ETRs) about modifications of the mappings
    used to encapsulate packets. The mechanism is optional and transparent to implementations
    not supporting this feature, since in the LISP- specific header and in the Map
    Records, bits used for Map-Versioning can be safely ignored by ITRs and ETRs that
    do not support or do not want to use the mechanism.</p>"
