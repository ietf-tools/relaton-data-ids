abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has defined a standard format for exchanging calendaring and
    scheduling data, called iCalendar. This format is useful for exchange of personal
    calendar data across the Internet, as well as in non- Internet environments. In
    a number of environments where the iCalendar will be used, the format type and
    version needs to be identified. For example, when registering the iCalendar as
    a format for memory-based 'clipboard' or 'drag/drop' user interface interactions.
    For these cases, a definitive formal public identifier (FPI) for the iCalendar
    will be required. This memo defined the FPI to be used when referring to the version
    2.0 (the value in the 'VERSION' property) of the iCalendar format.</p>"
