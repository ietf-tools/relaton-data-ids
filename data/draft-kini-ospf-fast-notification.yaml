abstract:
- content: "<p>The current OSPF link-state database (LSDB) flooding mechanism involves
    control-plane processing and forwarding at each hop. The delay due to the involvement
    of the control-plane adversely affects OSPF convergence. This document describes
    a mechanism to transmit link-state advertisements (LSA) multiple hops away without
    involving control-plane processing at the intermediate routers. This helps to
    achieve faster convergence. It complements the current LSDB flooding mechanism.</p>"
