- content: "<p>This draft describes implementation codepoints within IS-IS [ISO90,
    Cal90a, Cal90b ] used today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds. IS-IS
    is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI and used with
    IP extensions as IGP. This draft summarizes all TLV codepoints that are being
    used by the protocol and its pending extensions.</p>"
