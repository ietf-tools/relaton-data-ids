abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoRE set of protocols, in particular the CoAP protocol, is defined
    in draft-ietf-core-coap in conjunction with a number of specifications that are
    currently nearing completion. There are also several dozen more individual Internet-Drafts
    in various states of development, with various levels of WG review and interest.
    Today, this is simply a bewildering array of documents. Beyond the main four documents,
    it is hard to find relevant information and assess the status of proposals. At
    the level of Internet-Drafts, the IETF has only adoption as a WG document to assign
    status - too crude an instrument to assess the level of development and standing
    for anyone who does not follow the daily proceedings of the WG. With a more long-term
    perspective, as additional drafts mature and existing specifications enter various
    levels of spec maintenance, the entirety of these specifications may become harder
    to understand, pose specific implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.
    The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as well as provide
    specific advice how to use these specifications in combination. In certain cases,
    it may provide clarifications or even corrections to the specifications referenced.
    This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e. a long- lived Internet-Draft,
    to be updated whenever new information becomes available and new consensus on
    how to handle issues is formed. Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC
    4815, it might be published as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance
    curve of the specifications. This document does not describe a new protocol or
    attempt to set a new standard of any kind - it mostly describes good practice
    in using the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging consensus
    where a correction needs to be made. The current version -00 of this document
    is an early draft that is intended to spark the further collection of relevant
    information.</p>"
