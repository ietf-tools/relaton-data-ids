abstract:
- content: "<p>Chinese can be written in 2 different scripts, traditional Chinese
    and simplified Chinese, that cannot be distinguished by many people of certain
    background/cultures/groups who use them interchangeably. As a result, users of
    Chinese Domain Names (CDN) have special needs that can only be satisfied by adding
    a label to CDNs that distinguish a CDN with traditional characters from a CDN
    with simplified characters. This labeling is an entire system that can be accomplished
    with SLDs or by creating a new type of TLD called Language Script TLD (lsTLD).
    This draft describes the benefits that the system will provide and the techniques
    involved in implementing it.</p>"
