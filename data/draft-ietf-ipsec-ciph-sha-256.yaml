abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunction
    with the SHA-256 algorithm as an experimental authentication mecha- nism within
    the context of the IPsec AH and ESP protocols. This algo- rithm is intended to
    provide data origin authentication and integrity protection. Given the current
    lack of practical experience with SHA-256, implementations based on this document
    will be experimental in nature, and implementation is not required in order to
    claim com- pliance with the IPsec proposed standards. The version of the HMAC-
    SHA-256 authenticator described in this document specifies truncation to 128 bits,
    and is therefore named HMAC-SHA-256-128.</p>"
