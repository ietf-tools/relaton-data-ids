abstract:
- content: "<p>While TCP has enjoyed many enhancements over the decades, it is useful
    to allow applications to use new transports, such as SCTP. It is inefficient to
    naively probe the server using the new transport protocol. This document proposes
    a new DNS resource record which provides an efficient way to query which protocols
    are supported by a server. The presence of this record will allow the client to
    avoid the excessive probing.</p>"
