abstract:
- content: "<p>The document ``MHS Use of Directory to support MHS Routing'' describes
    a comprehensive approach to MHS use of directory to support routing. This document
    defines a strict subset of this document, which is intended to solve the most
    pressing problems. It also defines a practical first step for implementation,
    such that this subset can be deployed prior to fuller implementation. This document
    does not repeat information in the other document. Duplication would only lead
    to the possibility of inconsistency. WARNING: This document must be read in the
    contex of the document it profiles. It is meaningless as a standalone document.
    This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a protocol standard.
    Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Please send comments to the author or
    to the discussion group &lt;mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com&gt;.</p>"
