abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is standardized to provide network-based mobility
    management for a regular IPv6 mobile node, the Binding Cache Entry is built based
    on the HNP. If the MN is a multiple interfaces MN, these interfaces will get the
    different HNPs from the LMA and several BCEs are built for one MN. This will cause
    the invalidation of multihoming. This document introduces an extension to Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 for multihoming MN. Through extending the binding relationship between
    HNP and MAG in BCE, and synchronizing this information between LMA and MAGs, LMA
    can deliver data through multiple MAGs. Thus the MN attaching in a PMIPv6 domain
    can receive data packets with the same destination through its multiple network
    interfaces attaching to different MAGs simultaneously.</p>"
