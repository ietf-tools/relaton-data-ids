abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography will
    come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives. For example;
    when will RSA and ECC fall? Are Lattice schemes as strong as we believe? The cryptographic
    community is calling for hybrid schemes that combine classic and post-quantum
    crypto in ways that remain strong so long as at least one of the algorithms used
    remains strong. This document defines the problem statement for digital signatures
    in PKIX protocols, and gives an overview of the general families of solutions.</p>"
