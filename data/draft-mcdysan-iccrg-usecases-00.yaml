abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes some use cases for consideration by the iccrg.
    These use cases are in addition to and/or complement those described by the conex
    working group[UseCases]. The conex working group had determined that these use
    cases were out of scope of the current charter, and/or could potentially be built
    out of the conex abstract mechanism. The focus of the use cases in this draft
    is on forms of congestion exposure that involve resources other than queues and
    timeframes other than real-time. Background and motivation for these use cases
    is first discussed. Expanded material on the usage tier/volume use case is also
    provided.</p>"
