abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
    format for the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) Enhanced Full Rate
    (EFR) speech codec. The EFR speech codec RTP payload format specified in this
    document closely resembles the EFR speech codec RTP payload format defined in
    TS 101 318 'Using GSM Speech Codecs Within ITU-T Recommendation H.323'. It is
    designed specifically to optimally interoperate with existing (i.e., legacy) GSM
    circuit-switched transceiver equipment in the sense that it supports the following
    EFR speech codec circuit-switched domain functionality in the packet- switched
    domain: error concealment of lost speech frames and SIlence Descriptor (SID) frames.
    The EFR speech codec RTP payload format defined in TS 101 318 does not support
    this functionality. A MIME type registration for the EFR speech codec is also
    included.</p>"
