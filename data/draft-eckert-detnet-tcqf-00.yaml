abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a forwarding method for bounded latency for Deterministic
    Networks. It uses cycle tagging of packets for cyclic queuing and forwarding with
    multiple buffers (TCQF). This memo standardizes tagging via the MPLS packet Traffic
    Class (TC) field for MPLS links and the IP/IPv6 DSCPfield for IP/IPv6 links. The
    short- hand for this mechanism is Tagged Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF).
    Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease of high- speed hardware
    implementation, optional ability to support large number of flow in large networks
    via DiffServ style aggregation by applying TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead
    of each DetNet flow individually, and support of wide-area DetNet networks with
    arbitrary link latencies and latency variations.</p>"
