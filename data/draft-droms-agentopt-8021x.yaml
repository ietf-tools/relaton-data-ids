abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides authenticated layer 2 network access.
    As part of the authentication for 802.1X, a device such as a switch or a wireless
    LAN access point can receive credentials from the authentication authority identifying
    the user of a device requesting access. These credentials can then be used by
    a DHCP server in the selection of an IP address for assignment to the device through
    its DHCP client. The 802.1X Credentials sub-option allows an access device that
    implements 802.1X and that can create DHCP Relay Agent options to pass along credentials
    for the user of a device received during 802.1X authentication to a DHCP server.</p>"
