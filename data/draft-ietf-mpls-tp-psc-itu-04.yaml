abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes alternate mechanisms to perform some of the
    functions of MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection defined in RFC
    6378, and also defines additional mechanisms. The purpose of these alternate and
    additional mechanisms is to provide operator control and experience that more
    closely models the behavior of linear protection seen in other transport networks.
    This document also introduces capabilities and modes for linear protection. A
    capability is an individual behavior, and a mode is a particular combination of
    capabilities. Two modes are defined in this document: Protection State Coordination
    (PSC) mode and Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode. This document describes
    the behavior of the PSC protocol including priority logic and state machine when
    all the capabilities associated with the APS mode are enabled. This document updates
    RFC 6378 in that the capability advertisement method defined here is an addition
    to that document.</p>"
