abstract:
  content: "<p>The QUIC transport protocol preserves its future extensibility partly
    by specifying its version number. There will be a relatively small number of published
    version numbers for the foreseeable future. This document provides a method for
    clients and servers to negotiate the use of other version numbers in subsequent
    connections and encrypts Initial Packets using secret keys instead of standard
    ones. If a sizeable subset of QUIC connections use this mechanism, this should
    prevent middlebox ossification around the current set of published version numbers
    and the contents of QUIC Initial packets, as well as improving the protocol's
    privacy properties.</p>"
