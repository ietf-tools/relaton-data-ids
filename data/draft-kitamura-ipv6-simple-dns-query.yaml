abstract:
- content: '<p>This document discusses a simplified regular DNS query (resolving from
    a domain name to IP address(es)) method under IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment. With
    current DNS query method under IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment, it requires for a
    client to issue Two pairs of DNS query/response messages (one for A(IPv4) record,
    the other for AAAA(IPv6) record) to obtain all of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the
    node with its One domain name argument. It is clear that the current method (that
    requires to issue Two pairs of DNS query/response messages for One domain name
    resolving) is not sophisticated and not optimized for current IPv4/IPv6 mixed
    environment. The method was designed at the initial stage of IPv6 deployment (when
    IPv6 was minority). At that time, it was a best practical solution. However, now
    IPv6 is widely spreading. The current DNS query method is getting problematic
    and will never last to the future IPv6 fully deployed environment. Goals of this
    document are: 1. to clarify the problems of current regular DNS query method 2.
    to propose a simplified regular DNS query method: ("One pair of DNS query/response
    messages for One domain name resolving") that is suitable for current IPv4/IPv6
    mixed environment.</p>'
