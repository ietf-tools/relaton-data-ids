abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a new response mode for RFC6749 that uses
    HTML5 Web Messaging (a.k.a window.postMessage()) instead of the redirect for the
    Authorization Response from the Authorization Endpoint. It defines two modes:
    simple mode and relay mode. Relay mode can be used to protect the access token
    in the implicit grant case by confining it within the origins of authorization
    server or resource server and preventing it from being read by the client.</p>"
