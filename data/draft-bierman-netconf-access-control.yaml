abstract:
- content: "<p>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with
    the NETCONF protocol requires a structured and secure operating environment, which
    promotes human usability and multi-vendor interoperability. There is a need for
    standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF protocol access for particular users to
    a pre- configured subset of all available NETCONF operations and content. This
    document discusses requirements for a suitable access control model, and provides
    one solution which meets these requirements.</p>"
