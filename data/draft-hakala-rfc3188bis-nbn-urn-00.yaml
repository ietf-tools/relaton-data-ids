abstract:
- content: <p>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the national
    libraries and other organizations in order to identify various resources such
    as monographs pre-dating the emergence of the ISBN system or still images. As
    a rule, NBNs are applied to all kinds of resources that do not have an established
    identifier system of their own. Since 2001, there has been a URN (Uniform Resource
    Names) namespace for NBNs, and during 2001-2009 millions of URN-based unique and
    persistent NBNs have been assigned. The namespace registration was performed in
    RFC 3188 and applied to the NBNs known at that point. No URN:NBN resolution services
    existed at the time when the RFC was written. Since then several countries have
    started using URN:NBNs to identify electronic resources and to provide persistent
    links to them. To this end, many countries have established URN:NBN resolution
    services that supply URN - URL linking. This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines
    how NBNs can be supported within the URN framework. An updated namespace registration
    (version 4) is included. Discussion This document is an outcome of work performed
    in 2009-2010 as a part of the project PersID (http://www.persid.org) revising
    the basic URN RFCs, in order to bring them in alignment with the current URI Standard
    (STD 63, RFC 3986), ABNF, and IANA guidelines, and to establish a modern URN resolution
    system for bibliographic identifiers. This work is being brought to the IETF,
    and the intent is to establish a "URNbis" (or similar) working group in the Applications
    Area as soon as possible, which will then target this and related work. Comments
    are welcome on the urn@ietf.org or the urn-nid@ietf.org mailing list (or sent
    to the authors). Interested parties are also invited to contribute to the WG formation
    process being discussed on the former list.Status of This Memo This Internet-Draft
