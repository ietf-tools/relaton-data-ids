abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows a group of clients
    to exchange symmetric keys, agree on group state and send application messages.
    The main purpose of an MLS group is thus to facilitate agreement on group state
    and key material between the members of the group. In some cases, however, it
    is useful to share agreement on the (public) group state, as well as key material
    with another party that is not a full member of the group. This document describes
    a safe extension to do just that.</p>"
