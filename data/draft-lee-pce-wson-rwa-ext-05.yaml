abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides the Path Computation Element communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions for the support of Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in
    Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires
    a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process. From a path computation perspective,
    wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength can be used
    on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light
    path computation.</p>"
