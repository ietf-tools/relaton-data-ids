abstract:
- content: "<p>One feature of the Service Location Protocol is that Services may be
    assigned a Service Specific Multicast address to aid in service discovery. Use
    of this address for service discovery will not burden systems which do not advertise
    the service type. Two open questions are answered in the following proposal: How
    are the multicast addresses to be assigned? How are these multicast addresses
    known by SLP Service and User Agents?</p>"
