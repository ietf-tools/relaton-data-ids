abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved in the design
    of a new transport protocol for multiplexed voice within a single packet. The
    intended application is the interconnection of devices which provide 'trunking'
    or long distance telephone service over the Internet. Such devices have many voice
    connections simultaneously between them. Multiplexing them into the same connection
    improves on the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice codecs, and improves
    scalability. Options and issues concerning timestamping, payload type identification,
    length indication, and channel identification are discussed. Several possible
    header formats are identified, and their efficiencies are compared. This document
    is a product of the Audio-Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering
    Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
    mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or to the author(s).</p>"
