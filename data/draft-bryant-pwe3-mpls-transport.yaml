abstract:
- content: "<p>A need has been identified to identify a strict subset of the PWE3
    over MPLS pseudowire functionality suitable for the construction of transport
    networks. This draft describes the IETF recommended profile for such cases. This
    document describes the IETF-recommended profile for such a configuration. In particular
    the profile of an RFC4448 PWE3 Ethernet pseudowire that can be used to address
    these requirements is described.</p>"
