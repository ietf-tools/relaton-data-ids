abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an ESP encapsulation for IPsec, allowing intermediate
    devices to ascertain if ESP-NULL is being employed and hence inspect the IPsec
    packets for network monitoring and access control functions. Currently in the
    IPsec standard, there is no way to differentiate between ESP encryption and ESP
    NULL encryption by simply examining a packet.</p>"
