abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login
    and other secure network services over an insecure network. The Generic Security
    Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) provides security services to
    callers in a mechanism-independent fashion. This memo describes methods for using
    the GSS-API for authentication and key exchange in SSH. It defines an SSH user
    authentication method that uses a specified GSS-API mechanism to authenticate
    a user, and a family of SSH key exchange methods that use GSS-API to authenticate
    a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This memo also defines a new host public key algorithm
    that can be used when no operations are needed using a host's public key, and
    a new user authentication method that allows an authorization name to be used
    in conjunction with any authentication that has already occurred as a side-effect
    of GSS-API-based key exchange. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
