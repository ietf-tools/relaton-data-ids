abstract:
- content: "<p>Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile nodes
    (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling process.
    NEMO Basic support protocol is standardized to provide network mobility support.
    Current mobility management protocols rely on a central mobility anchor in order
    to provide mobility support for the mobile nodes. These centralized approaches
    show some big issues, such as a single point of failure, non-optimal routing,
    and scalability. Ever-increasing demand for the mobile traffic changes the network
    architecture from hierarchical to flat architecture, and distributed mobility
    management (DMM) approaches are being researched to adapt the new flat architecture
    and overcome big above issues. This document presents about detailed protocol
    operation to support network mobility in the DMM domain.</p>"
