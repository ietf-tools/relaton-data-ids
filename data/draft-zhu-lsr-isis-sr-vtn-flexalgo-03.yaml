abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
    underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used as the underlay
    for one or a group of VPN+ services. The topology of a VTN can be defined using
    Flex-Algo. In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique
    Flex- Algo, and the set of network resources of the VTN can be instantiated as
    sub-interfaces or member links of the L3 interfaces. This document describes the
    mechanisms to build the SR based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundle with
    minor extensions.</p>"
