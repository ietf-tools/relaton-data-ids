abstract:
- content: <p>When the procedures per [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-srv6-egress-protection] are
    applied to EVPN services, the egress-protection on PLR is typically more faster
    than the new DF node of the affected ESI is re-elected. As a result of that, replicated
    BUM packets will be sent to the CEs of the affected ES. This draft describes a
    "NDF-bias" mechanism that is used to avoid such excessive BUM packets.</p>
