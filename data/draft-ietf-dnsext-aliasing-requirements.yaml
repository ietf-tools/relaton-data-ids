abstract:
- content: <p>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises from
    the desire to treat a set or group of names as "aliases" of each other, "bundled,"
    "variants," or "the same," which is problematic in terms of corresponding behavior
    for DNS labels and FQDNs. With the emergence of internationalized domain names,
    among other potential use cases, two or more names that users will regard as having
    identical meaning may sometimes require corresponding behavior in the underlying
    infrastructure, possibly in the DNS itself. It's not clear how to accommodate
    this required behavior of such names in DNS resolution; in particular, it's not
    clear when they are best accommodated in registry practices for generating names
    for lookup in the DNS, existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, existing application-layer
    mechanisms and practices, or some set of protocol elements or behavior not yet
    defined. This document attempts to describe some of these cases and the behavior
    of some of the possible solutions discussed to date.</p>
