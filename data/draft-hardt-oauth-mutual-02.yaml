abstract:
- content: "<p>There are times when a user has a pair of protected resources that
    would like to request access to each other. While OAuth flows typically enable
    the user to grant a client access to a protected resource, granting the inverse
    access requires an additional flow. Reciprocal OAuth enables a more seemless experience
    for the user to grant access to a pair of protected resources.</p>"
