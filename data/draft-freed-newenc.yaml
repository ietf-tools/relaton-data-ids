abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two additional content-transfer- encodings, deflate
    and deflate-base64. Adding these CTEs to MIME that provide facilities for loss-less,
    adaptive, general-purpose compression. The first of these, deflate, produces binary
    output, while the second, deflate-base64, produces the same sort of output as
    the base64 content- transfer-encoding defined in [RFC-2045].</p>"
