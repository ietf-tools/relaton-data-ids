abstract:
- content: "<p>By design, Mobile IPv6 does not provide movement information to higher
    layers or applications. However, new breeds of location-sensitive applications
    and technologies would benefit from having access to such information. This document
    outlines how the knowledge of mobility can be usefully harnessed by applications
    which reside in a mobile node as well as a correspondent node. It then defines
    an application-level API to fulfill those needs.</p>"
