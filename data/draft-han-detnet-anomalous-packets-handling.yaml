abstract:
- content: "<p>In deterministic networking (DetNet), there may be resource conflicts
    at the flow aggregation nodes, resulting in network anomalies. The existing mechanisms
    for handling anomalous packets in the data plane are crude, such as discarding
    or processing them as BE flows, so the network performance may be worse than applying
    traditional QoS. Therefore, in order to handle the anomalous traffic, the data
    plane should implement an enhanced handling mechanism. This document proposes
    an anomalous packet handling solution for anomalous traffic in DetNet. This solution
    includes two policies: the packet squeezing policy and the packet degrading policy,
    which can be applied flexibly to a variety of queuing mechanisms, thereby ensuring
    that network traffic for deterministic services is preferentially scheduled in
    anomalous situations.</p>"
