abstract:
- content: "<p>IOAM pre-allocated trace option data fields can be encapsulated in
    IPv6 HbH options header as described in RFC9486. However, due to the potential
    large size of the trace data and the HbH extension header location in the IPv6
    packets, the scheme creates practical challenges for implementation, especially
    when other extension headers, such as a routing header, also exist and require
    on-path processing. We propose two alternative approaches to address this challenge
    in addition to IOAM DEX: separating the IOAM incremental trace data from the IOAM
    instruction header, and applying the segment IOAM trace data export scheme, based
    on the network scenario and application requirements. We discuss the pros and
    cons of each approach in this document.</p>"
