abstract:
- content: <p>The Start of Authority Resource Record in the Domain Name System includes
    various parameters related to the handling of data in DNS zones. These parameters
    are variously used by authority-only servers, caching resolvers and DNS clients
    to guide them in the way that data contained within particular zones should be
    used. One particular field in the SOA RR is known as MNAME, which is used to specify
    the "Primary Master" server for a zone. This is the server to which clients use
    Dynamic Update to send DNS UPDATE messages. Many zones do not support the Dynamic
    Update, and any such DNS UPDATE messages which are received provide no usual purpose.
    For such zones it may be preferable not to receive updates from clients at all.
    This document proposes a convention by which a zone operator can signal to clients
    that a particular zone does not support Dynamic Update.</p>
