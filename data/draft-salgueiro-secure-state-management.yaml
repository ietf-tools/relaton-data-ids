abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtually every application on the web today that allows a user to
    log in or manipulate information stored on a server maintains some form of state
    management information. Usually, the session context is established through the
    use of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) parameter or a Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP) cookie that identifies the session. Without the use of Transport Layer
    Security (TLS), such an information exchange introduces a security risk. For a
    variety of reasons, TLS may not be desired or preferred in all situations and,
    in those cases, users are left vulnerable. This memo provides a simple method
    for enabling secure exchange of state management information through HTTP in situations
    where TLS is not employed.</p>"
