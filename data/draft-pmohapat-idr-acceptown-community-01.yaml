abstract:
- content: "<p>It may be useful for a BGP speaker in an autonomous system to receive
    and accept its own advertised route from a route reflector with more fine-grained
    route control. For example, the route reflector can change certain attributes
    of a route as desired, and then re- advertise it back to the originator. Though
    it is possible to perform such policy control directly at the originator, it may
    be operationally cumbersome in a network with a large number of border routers
    having complex BGP policies. This draft defines a new and well-known BGP community
    value, ACCEPT_OWN, that signals a BGP speaker to accept an UPDATE message and
    process the associated routes even when the ORIGINATOR_ID or the NEXT_HOP matches
    that of the receiving speaker.</p>"
