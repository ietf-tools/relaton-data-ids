abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 1639[Pis94] documents experimental long port (LPRT) and long passive
    (LPSV) commands that many IP Version 6 implementations are using as the replacement
    for the PORT and PASV commands in FTP [PR85]. The author believes that this is
    the incorrect direction to be heading and that the replacement for PORT and PASV
    should carry less information instead of more. The passive command (SPASV) is
    a replacement for the PASV command. It only carries port numbers and does not
    carry addresses. This makes it usable with IPv4 and IPv6. A benefit of not carrying
    addresses is that pure network address translators (NAT) do not have to do a search-and-replace
    on the TCP stream, which is an expensive operation. This also eliminates three-way
    FTP, which is a rarely used mode of operation that leaves most existing FTP servers
    wide open to the FTP Bounce Attack [Hob95]. Because the FTP PORT command is unfriendly
    to some kinds of firewall configurations [Bel94] and that unfriendliness is there
    to support three-way FTP, there is no replacement for the PORT command -- all
    transfers should use passive mode instead. The author's inet6-apps kit (available
    on ftp.ipv6.inner.net and ftp.inner.net) includes a client and server that supports
    the current version of these commands. Those FTP servers implement this command.</p>"
