abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Certificate Management protocol using CMS (CMC).
    This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the Internet PKI community:
    1. The need for an interface to public key certification products and services
    based on [CMS] and [PKCS10], and 2. The need in [SMIMEV3] for a certificate enrollment
    protocol for DSA-signed certificates with Diffie-Hellman public keys. A small
    number of additional services are defined to supplement the core certificate request
    service.</p>"
