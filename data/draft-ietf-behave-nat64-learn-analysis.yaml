abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts and applications may benefit from learning if an IPv6 address
    is synthesized and if NAT64 and DNS64 are present in a network. This document
    analyzes all proposed solutions (known at the time of writing) for communicating
    whether the synthesis is taking place, what address format was used, and what
    IPv6 prefix was used by the NAT64 and DNS64. These solutions enable both NAT64
    avoidance and local IPv6 address synthesis. The document concludes by recommending
    the standardization of the approach based on heuristic discovery.</p>"
