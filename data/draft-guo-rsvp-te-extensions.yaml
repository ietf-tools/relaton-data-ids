abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes two specific extensions to RSVP-TE. The first
    extension is concerned about the scalability of RSVP-TE. It proposes expanding
    the length of tunnel ID in RSVP-TE session object, from 16 bits to 32 bits, in
    order to increase the upper limit of LSPs origin- ated from one node. The second
    extension is to propose a new object for representing a protection group. A protection
    group can tie two or more diverse LSPs between a source-destination pair of nodes.
    This extension is warranted due to the importance and wide-spread appli- cations
    of LSP protection switching mechanisms.</p>"
