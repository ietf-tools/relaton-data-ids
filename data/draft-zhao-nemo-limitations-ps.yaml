abstract:
- content: "<p>There already exist several mobility support solutions and each solution
    uses its own method to achieve specific goals.But different solutions may not
    work properly when they are combined in an integrated application environment
    because network entities have little information about each other.Specially when
    PMIP meet with the Nemo network environment something need to be considered more.
    This document describes several limitations on NEMO application and provides a
    possible solution.</p>"
