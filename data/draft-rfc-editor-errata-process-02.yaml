- content: "<p>This document describes a web-based process for handling the submission,
    verification, and posting of errata for the RFC Series. The main concepts behind
    this process are (1) distributing the responsibility for verification to the appropriate
    organization or person for each RFC stream, and (2) using a Web portal to automate
    the book-keeping for handling errata.</p>"
