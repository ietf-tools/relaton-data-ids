abstract:
- content: <p>This specification define the Archive and Package URI scheme "arcp".
    arcp URIs can be used to consume or reference hypermedia resources bundled inside
    a file archive or an application package, as well as to resolve URIs for archive
    resources within a programmatic framework. This URI scheme provides mechanisms
    to generate a unique base URI to represent the root of the archive, so that relative
    URI references in a bundled resource can be resolved within the archive without
    having to extract the archive content on the local file system. An arcp URI can
    be used for purposes of isolation (e.g. when consuming multiple archives), security
    constraints (avoiding "climb out" from the archive), or for externally identiyfing
    sub-resources referenced by hypermedia formats.</p>
