abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new attributes to facilitate Proxy Mobile IPv6
    operations using the RADIUS infrastructure. The protocol defined in this document
    uses RADIUS-based interfaces of the mobile access gateway and the local mobility
    anchor with the AAA server for authentication, authorization, and policy functions.
    The RADIUS interactions between the mobile access gateway and the RADIUS-based
    AAA server take place when the mobile node (MN) attaches, authenticates, and authorizes
    to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. Furthermore, this document defines the RADIUS-based
    interface between the local mobility anchor and the AAA RADIUS server for authorizing
    received Proxy Binding Update messages for the mobile node's mobility session.
    In addition to the interactions related to mobility session setup, this document
    defines the baseline for the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor
    generated accounting. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
