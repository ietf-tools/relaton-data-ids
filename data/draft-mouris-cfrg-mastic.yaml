abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Plabels, a two-party VDAF for the following
    aggregation task: each Client holds a bit string, and the Collector wishes to
    count how many of these strings begin with a candidate prefix. Such a VDAF can
    be used to solve the heavy hitters problem, where the goal is compute the subset
    of the measurements that occur most frequently. This document also describes various
    modes of operation for Plabels. First, its output type can be enriched to support
    aggregation functions beyond prefix counts. Second, an extension to the aggregation
    phase is described that significantly reduces communication cost compared to existing
    techniques. Third, a three-party variant is described that is robust in the honest
    majority setting.</p>"
