abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the SendHoldTimer and the SendHoldTimer_Expires
    event in the MSDP protocol. The implementation of SendHoldTimer helps to address
    the situation where the local system detects that the remote system has not processed
    MSDP messages but has not terminated the MSDP session. According to this document,
    when the SendHoldTimer expires, the local system should close the MSDP session
    connection, rather than relying on the remote system to initiate the session closure.
    This document updates RFC3618.</p>"
