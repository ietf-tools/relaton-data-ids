abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework for the delivery of Internet Media
    Guides (IMGs). A media guide is a set of information (metadata) describing the
    features of multimedia content in order to subscribe to, manage and exchange multimedia
    content. Several protocols and methods exist that are able to deliver metadata
    over the Internet, giving information on Internet services, media and content.
    This existing knowledge is used to provide a general framework for Internet Media
    Guides and outlines existing scalability and flexibility issues, along with the
    desirable features that can solve these problems.</p>"
