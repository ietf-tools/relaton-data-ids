abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet has recently seen the emergence of applications that involve
    the ongoing transmission, or ''pushing'', of structured data from a server to
    one or more client nodes. Most current applications send this data using unicast
    communications - usually over TCP connections. However, similar applications can
    also be implemented using multicast-based protocols. Multicast not only improves
    the scalability of this particular class of application, but also makes possible
    an additional class of application in which the participants can act as peers
    - sending data as well as receiving. This Internet Draft describes the ''Multicast
    Attribute Framing Protocol'' (MAFP) - a generic, attribute-based data representation,
    intended for a wide variety of multicast-based applications. It is currently being
    used to implement the ''multikit'' generic multicast session browser (http://www.lvn.com/multikit).
    This draft describes an early version of MAFP that is likely to undergo changes
    in the future. However, it is being described now, in the hope that it will promote
    open discussion of this and similar protocols - ideally leading to the adoption
    of an open, interoperable standard for this class of application.</p>"
