abstract:
- content: "<p>PMIPv6 and MIPv6 are respectively the leading protocols for network
    based and client based mobility. As backward compatibility is an important feature,
    IPv4 support for PMIPv6 and MIPv6 becomes mandatory. This document highlights
    some scenarios for PMIPv6-MIPv6 interaction with IPv4 support as well as some
    proposed solutions.</p>"
