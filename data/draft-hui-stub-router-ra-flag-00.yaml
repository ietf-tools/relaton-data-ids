abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Stub Router flag in the Router Advertisement
    message to distinguish configuration information sent by stub routers from infrastructure
    routers. For example, the Stub Router flag allows stub routers to easily identify
    when an infrastructure router is advertising a usable IPv6 prefix, triggering
    the stub router to not advertise its own routable prefix.</p>"
