abstract:
- content: "<p>SPF is a popular tool for managing email blocking issues. It has also
    helped reduce backscatter related with Non-Delivery Notifications as was intended.
    A practically unused feature is the SPF macro capability that SPFbis still in
    part retains. This feature greatly diminishes SPF's utility and actually threatens
    email interchange, especially when used in conjunction with secondary policy layers
    when also ignored by major providers. The macro mechanism is also unable to cope
    with internationalization, and is found in virtually none of the published resource
    records. It is counter productive to retain the largely unused and often unsupported
    macro feature, despite efforts expended to develop the macro language.</p>"
