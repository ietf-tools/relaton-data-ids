abstract:
- content: "<p>For various reasons it may be desirable to separate the functionality
    of a mobility agent, such as the home and foreign agents in Mobile IP [Perkins96],
    from their link-layer presence on a given network. This draft outlines mechanisms
    based on the Tunnel Establishment Protocol [Calhoun98a] for accomplishing this.
    The tunnels so established will not be visible to a mobile node and therefore
    provide a transparent way to build hierarchies of mobility agents, which can lessen
    the frequency of Mobile IP re- registrations.</p>"
