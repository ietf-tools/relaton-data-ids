abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 addresses can differ in a number of properties, such as scope,
    stability, and intended usage type. This document analyzes the impact of these
    properties on aspects such as security, privacy, interoperability, and network
    operations, with the goal of providing guidance about IPv6 address usage. Additionally,
    it identifies challenges and gaps that currently prevent systems and applications
    from leveraging the increased flexibility and availability of IPv6 addresses.</p>"
