abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a base YANG data model for network inventory
    that is application- and technology-agnostic. This data model can be augmented
    with application-specific and technology-specific details in other, more specific
    network inventory data models. This document is meant to help IVY base Network
    Inventory model discussion and ease agreement on a base model that would be flexible
    enough to be augmented with components that are covered by the IVY Charter. The
    hardware components definition are adapted from draft-ietf-ccamp- network-inventory-yang-02.</p>"
