abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a number of changes to TLS and DTLS IANA registries
    that range from adding notes to the registry all the way to changing the registration
    policy. These changes were mostly motivated by WG review of the TLS- and DTLS-related
    registries undertaken as part of the TLS 1.3 development process. This document
    obsoletes RFC8447 and updates the following RFCs: 3749, 5077, 4680, 5246, 5705,
    5878, 6520, 7301.</p>"
