abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a mechanism that allows an incremental deployment
    of IPv6 inside an IPv4 AS. It aims at automatically set up tunnels, using EGP
    standard capabilities, in order to gradually introduce IPv6 connectivity within
    an initially IPv4 AS. From a scope point of view, this technique must be considered
    as an intermediary between ISATAP and interdomain techniques ([6to4], [BGP-tunnel]).</p>"
