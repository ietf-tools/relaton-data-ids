abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft outlines a bunch of the remaining issues in RTCWeb related
    to how the the W3C APIs map to various usages of RTP and the associated SDP. It
    proposes one possible solution to that problem and outlines several chunks of
    work that would need to be put into other drafts or result in new drafts being
    written. The underlying design guideline is to, as much as possible, re-use what
    is already defined in existing SDP [RFC4566] and RTP [RFC3550] specifications.
    This draft is not intended to become an specification but is meant for working
    group discussion to help build the specifications. It is being discussed on the
    webrtc@ietf.org mailing list though it has topics relating to the CLUE WG, MMUSIC
    WG, AVT* WG, and WebRTC WG at W3C.</p>"
