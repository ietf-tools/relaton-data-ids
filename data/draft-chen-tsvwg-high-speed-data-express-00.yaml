abstract:
- content: <p>With the rapid development of AI technology, intelligent computing and
    super-computing services, the demand for wide-area transmission of massive data
    is increasing. This paper makes full use of the advantages of IP network, such
    as statistical reuse and elastic supply, and proposes a reference architecture
    of high elasticity and high throughput data express based on IP network. In order
    to support differentiated data express services and create task-type data express
    services, the "one low and three high" technical system is proposed.</p>
