- content: <p>Some Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) applications
    require the transport of cryptographic keying material; this document specifies
    a set of Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs) providing native Diameter support of cryptographic
    key delivery. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in
    full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. This document may not
    be modified, and derivative works of it may not be created, except to format it
