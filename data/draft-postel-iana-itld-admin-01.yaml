abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a policy, procedure, and control structure
    for the allocation of additional top-level domains The Appendix A.1 of this document
    discusses the issues surrounding additional international top level domains (iTLDs)
    and registries. This document describes policies and procedures to o allow open
    competition in domain name registration in the iTLDs, o and provide the IANA with
    a legal and financial umbrella Note that while cooperation between competing iTLD
    registries is allowed, it is not required. This is specifically not assumed in
    this proposal, and is considered to be an operational aspect of a registry best
    determined, and coordinated, by contractual agreements between private interests.</p>"
