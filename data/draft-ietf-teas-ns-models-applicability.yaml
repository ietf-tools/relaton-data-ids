abstract:
- content: "<p>This document exemplifies how the various data models that are produced
    in the IETF can be combined in the context of Network Slice Services delivery.
    Specifically, this document describes the relationship between the Network Slice
    Service models for requesting Network Slice Services and both Service (e.g., the
    L3VPN Service Model, the L2VPN Service Model) and Network (e.g., the L3VPN Network
    Model, the L2VPN Network Model) models used during their realizations. In addition,
    this document describes the communication between a Network Slice Controller (NSC)
    and the network controllers for the realization of Network Slices. The Network
    Slice Service YANG model provides a customer-oriented view of the intended Network
    slice Service. Thus, once an NSC receives a request for a Slice Service request,
    the NSC has to map it to accomplish the specific objectives expected by the network
    controllers. Existing YANG network models are analyzed against Network Slice requirements,
    and the gaps in existing models are identified.</p>"
