abstract:
- content: "<p>6rd is One of the most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and IPv6
    connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period.
    The DHCP 6rd option has been defined to configure 6rd CPE. But in many networks,
    the configuration information may be stored in AAA servers while user configuration
    is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through DHC protocol. This document
    defines a RADIUS attribute that carries 6rd configuration information from AAA
    server to BNG.</p>"
