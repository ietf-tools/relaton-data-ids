abstract:
- content: "<p>Seeking entries from a directory is a process involving network resources.
    It is assumed that a directory is accessed for reading and searching data more
    than for modification purposes. Under such assumptions, for performance reasons,
    a mechanism for caching as a proxy which caches all entries is desirable. This
    document describes a mechanism for caching directory entries. This document also
    defines one operational attribute and two controls required to be implemented
    for the caching model.</p>"
