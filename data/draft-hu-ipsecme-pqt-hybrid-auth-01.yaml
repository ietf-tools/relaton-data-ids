abstract:
- content: "<p>One IPsec area that would be impacted by Cryptographically Relevant
    Quantum Computer (CRQC) is IKEv2 authentication based on traditional asymmetric
    cryptograph algorithms: e.g RSA, ECDSA; which are widely deployed authentication
    options of IKEv2. There are new Post-Quantum Cryptograph (PQC) algorithms for
    digital signature like NIST [ML-DSA], however it takes time for new cryptograph
    algorithms to mature, so there is security risk to use only the new algorithm
    before it is field proven. This document describes a IKEv2 hybrid authentication
    scheme that could contain both traditional and PQC algorithms, so that authentication
    is secure as long as one algorithm in the hybrid scheme is secure.</p>"
