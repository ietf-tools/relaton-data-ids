abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies modifications required to Dual-Stack Lite (DS-
    Lite) so that both IPv4 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers. The
    DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) proxying
    Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and then tunneling IGMP messages over
    IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to DS-Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR).
    IPv4 multicast data received at AFTR is tunneled over IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire to
    B4 and then delivered to the hosts. This solution integrates well with DS- Lite
    unicast solution by using IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire and works with unicast IPv6 network
    connecting B4 with AFTR.</p>"
