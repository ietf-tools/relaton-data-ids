abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers
    to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet. The Resource reSerVation
    Protocol (RSVP), Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM), the Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), Multicast Router Discovery
    (MRD), and General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) are some of the protocols
    that make use of the IP Router Alert Option. This document discusses security
    aspects and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert Option,
    thereby updating RFC 2113 and RFC 2711. Specifically, it provides recommendations
    against using the Router Alert in the end-to-end open Internet and identifies
    controlled environments where protocols depending on Router Alert can be used
    safely. It also provides recommendations about protection approaches for service
    providers. Finally, it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation
    on routers. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
