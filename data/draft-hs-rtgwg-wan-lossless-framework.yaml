abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a comprehensive framework to address the challenges
    of efficient, reliable, and cost-effective large volume data transmission over
    Wide Area Networks (WANs). The framework focuses on planning and managing traffic
    paths, network slicing, and utilizing multi-level network buffers. It introduces
    dynamic path scheduling and advanced resource allocation techniques to optimize
    network resouce and minimize congestion. By leveraging cross-device buffer coordination
    and real-time adjustments, the framework ensures high throughput and low latency,
    meeting the demands of modern, data- intensive applications while providing a
    robust solution for large- scale data transmission.</p>"
