abstract:
- content: <p>Each I2NSF agent and I2NSF client needs to provide application level
    support for management traffic during periods of DDoS and network security attacks
    to deal with congestion (burst and/or continuous), high error rates and packet
    loss due to the attacks, and the inability to utilize a transport protocol (E.g.
    TCP) due to a specific protocol attack. This application level support needs to
    be able to select the key management system and provide "chunking" of data (in
    order to fit in reduced effective MTUs), compression of data (in order to fit
    into reduced bandwidth), small security envelope )in order to maximize room for
    mangement payload), and fragmentation and reassembly at the application layer
    for those protocols which do not support fragmentation/reassembly (E.g. UDP or
    SMS). The application layer needs to be able to turn off this features if the
    system detects these features are no longer needed. This draft specifies a security
    session layer services(SSLs) which provide these features in terms of an API,
    and the component features (interface to key management systems, data compression,
    chunking of data, secure session envelope (SSE) to send data, and fragmentation
    and reassembly, and ability to detect existence of attack).</p>
