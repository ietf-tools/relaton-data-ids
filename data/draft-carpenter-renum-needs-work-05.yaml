abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the existing mechanisms for site renumbering
    for both IPv4 and IPv6, and it identifies operational issues with those mechanisms.
    It also summarises current technical proposals for additional mechanisms. Finally,
    there is a gap analysis identifying possible areas for future work. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
