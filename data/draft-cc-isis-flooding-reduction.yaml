abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an approach to flood ISIS link state protocol
    data units on a topology that is a subgraph of the complete ISIS topology per
    underline physical network, so that the amount of flooding traffic in the network
    is greatly reduced, and it would reduce convergence time with a more stable and
    optimized routing environment. The approach can be applied to any network topology
    in a single ISIS area.</p>"
