- content: "<p>This document describes Connectivity Verification (CV) Types using
    Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification
    (VCCV). VCCV provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW),
    as well as the corresponding operations and management functions such as connectivity
    verification to be used over that control channel. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
