abstract:
- content: <p>In situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs) to
    a network peer is also a receiver of SETs from the same peer, it is helpful to
    have an efficient way of sending and receiving SETs in one HTTP transaction. In
    many cases, such as when using the OpenID Shared Signals Framework (SSF), the
    situation where each entity is both a transmitter and receiver is getting increasingly
    common. Using current mechanisms such as "Push-Based Delivery of Security Event
    Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP" or "Poll-Based Delivery of Security Event Tokens (SETs)
    Using HTTP" both require two or more HTTP connections to exchange SETs between
    peers. This is inefficient due to the latency of setting up each communication.
    This specification enables bi-directional transmission and reception of multiple
    SETs in one HTTP connection, and enables them to do so over a single HTTP or WebSocket
    connection.</p>
