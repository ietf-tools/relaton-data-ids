abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a control plane based IP Traffic Engineering
    Architecture where path information is kept in the control plane by selected nodes
    instead of being inserted into each packet on ingress of an administrative domain.
    The described proposal is also fully compatible with the concept of network programming.
    It is positioned as a complimentary technique to native SRv6 and can be used when
    there are concerns with increased packet size due to depth of SID stack, possible
    concerns regarding exceeding MTU or more strict simplicity requirements typically
    seen in number of enterprise networks. The proposed solution is applicable to
    both IPv4 or IPv6 based networks. As an additional added value, detection of end
    to end path liveness as well as dynamic path selection based on real time path
    quality is integrated from day one in the design.</p>"
