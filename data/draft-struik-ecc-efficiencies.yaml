abstract:
- content: <p>We discuss several methods that can be used to accelerate the verification
    step of ECC-based signature schemes. These include a 40% efficiency improvement
    of ordinary ECDSA signature verification and even a factor 2.4x efficiency improvement
    when ECDSA certificate verification is combined with the key computation step
    in Diffie- Hellman-based protocols, such as static-ECDH and ECMQV. This challenges
    the conventional wisdom that with ECC-based signature schemes, signature verification
    is always considerably slower than signature generation and slower than RSA signature
    verification. Results apply to all prime curves standardized by NIST, the NSA
    'Suite B' curves, and the so-called Brainpool curves. While the efficiency advantages
    of these methods are most apparent for a slightly modified version of ECDSA, these
    can also be enjoyed if the signer appends a small number of bits ("side information")
    to standardized ECDSA signatures or generates these ECDSA signatures in a particular
    "fast verification friendly" way. Since the latter can be done as a post-processing
    operation by any third party, this does not require changes to the standardized
    specifications of ECDSA (or, e.g., recertification by a Certificate Authority).</p>
