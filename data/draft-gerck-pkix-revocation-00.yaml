abstract:
- content: <p>PKIX certificate revocation protocols are primarily described in RFC3280.
    This Document revisits limitations on determining the revocation status of a certificate.
    Ambiguous aspects of revocation and revocation delegation are resolved. An objective
    point of view is introduced as a reference that does not depend on the observer
    (e.g., the RP). The revocation status of a certificate issued by a conforming
    CA is shown to be always well-defined from a relying party's point of view --
    i.e., it is unambiguous (revoked or not revoked) and ultimately determinable at
    any period in time. The limitations on determining the revocation status of a
    certificate have nothing to do with the eventual result of the determination process
    by a relying party. The limitations have to do with the efforts for that determination,
    which may require a large (actually unspecified) amount of time and work. Some
    practices are also suggested, allowing a relying party to determine the revocation
    status of a certificate with higher reliability in less time. The same considerations
    apply to determinations of status "change" processes, including certificateHold
    and removefromCRL.</p>
