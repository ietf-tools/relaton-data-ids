abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the main challenges hindering the acceptance of VoIP is a standards-based
    solution for traversing middleboxes such as Network Address Translation (NAT)
    and FireWall (FW) boxes. This Internet- Draft presents SAFENeT, a protocol that
    is intended to operate in an enterprise environment and that allows the accommodation
    of real-time services by the call server, internal to the enterprise network,
    to communicate with the NAT/FW to enable the transversal of real-time services
    including VoIP. This document describes the SAFENeT architecture and protocol
    and shows how it overcomes the problems caused by NATs/FWs. The SAFENeT architecture
    also enables security features such as data confidentiality and digital integrity
    to be used for the VoIP traffic traversing the NAT/FW.</p>"
