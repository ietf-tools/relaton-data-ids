abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a multi-point protocol, supporting
    multiple simultaneous sending sources in an RTP session. However, many existing
    RTP endpoints cannot usefully receive more than one simultaneous source. This
    document provides a Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute that allows endpoints
    to indicate the maximum number of sources they can usefully receive.</p>"
