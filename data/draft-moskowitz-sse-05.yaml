abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the details of the Session Security Envelope (SSE).
    SSE is a session protocol aiming to guarantee confidentiality, integrity and authentication
    completely independently by the underlying context, namely network and transport
    layers. A single session using the SEE protocol can include a single transport
    session or multiple transport sessions. This mean that SSE can survive the break-down
    in network and transport layers or to attacks carried against them. SSE is also
    applicable in networks lacking in classic inter-networking and transport protocols
    SSE relies on modern AEAD block cipher modes of operations, a class of block cipher
    modes which allows, at the same time, to authenticate the message while encrypting
    a part of it.</p>"
