abstract:
- content: "<p>Several years have passed since the original protocol for Internationalized
    Domain Names (IDNs) was completed and deployed. During that time, a number of
    issues have arisen, including the need to update the system to deal with newer
    versions of Unicode. Some of these issues require tuning of the existing protocols
    and the tables on which they depend. This document provides an overview of a revised
    system and provides explanatory material for its components. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
