abstract:
- content: "<p>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly
    IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that
    IPv4 continues to provide satisfactory internal routing and addressing services
    for most applications. As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed in the
    Internet, however, end user devices within such sites will increasingly require
    at least basic IPv6 functionality for external access. This document therefore
    provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4
    sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).</p>"
