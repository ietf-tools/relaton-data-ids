abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the development of protocols and solutions for CDNI it will
    be necessary to agree on common mechanisms for how to identify and name the data
    objects that are to be interchanged between interconnected CDNs, as well as how
    to describe which policy should be used when doing so. This document presents
    some thoughts on the naming and referencing of data types/objects within a CDNI
    solution.</p>"
