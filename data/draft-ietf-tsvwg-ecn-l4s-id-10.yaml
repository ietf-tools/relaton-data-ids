abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets
    for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput
    (L4S). It is similar to the original (or 'Classic') Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN). 'Classic' ECN marking was required to be equivalent to a drop, both when
    applied in the network and when responded to by a transport. Unlike 'Classic'
    ECN marking, for packets carrying the L4S identifier, the network applies marking
    more immediately and more aggressively than drop, and the transport response to
    each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to that for drop. The two changes counterbalance
    each other so that the throughput of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a
    non-L4S flow under the same conditions. Nonetheless, the much more frequent control
    signals and the finer responses to them result in much more fine-grained adjustments,
    so that ultra-low and consistently low queuing delay (typically sub-millisecond
    on average) becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization.
    Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very
    low delay at the same time, even during periods of high traffic load. The L4S
    identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly)
    traffic. It gives an incremental migration path so that suitably modified network
    bottlenecks can distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the
    Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and loss of L4S
    traffic. This specification defines the rules that L4S transports and network
    elements need to follow to ensure they neither harm each other's performance nor
    that of Classic traffic. Examples of new active queue management (AQM) marking
    algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time) are
    specified separately.</p>"
