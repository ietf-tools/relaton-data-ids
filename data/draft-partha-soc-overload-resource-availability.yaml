abstract:
- content: "<p>Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
    B2BUA, proxies, and user agents have insufficient resources like CPU, memory,
    DSP, DS0, disk resources or available bandwidth to complete the processing of
    a request. SIP provides limited support for overload handling through its 503
    response code, which tells an upstream element that it is overloaded. This document
    defines explicit SIP based resource monitoring and overload avoidance mechanism
    based on the resource availability of the entity.</p>"
