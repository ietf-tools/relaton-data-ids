abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a new fast handoff mechanism in wireless IP using neighboring
    Foreign Agent information. Our proposal is based on the policy of utilizing, or
    perhaps even wasting, wired bandwidth between Foreign Agents, while minimizing
    rf (radio frequency) bandwidth exchanges, in order that handoff latency is minimized.
    We minimize the handoff latency by initiating data forwarding to the possible
    new foreign agent candidates (i.e., the neighbor foreign agents) immediately when
    the mobile node is about to start the link layer handoff procedure.</p>"
