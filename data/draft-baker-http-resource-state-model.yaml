abstract:
- content: "<p>The documented semantics of HTTP 1.1 methods, in particular POST, are
    not well understood, as demonstrated by debates such as whether IPP should have
    used POST or a new method, how to properly bind SOAP to HTTP, and the ever more
    common use of POST for tunneling new protocols such as XML-RPC. This note attempts
    to define an abstract model for the state of HTTP URI scheme addressable resources
    consistent with HTTP 1.1, but hopefully more descriptive.</p>"
