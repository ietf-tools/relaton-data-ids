abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application layer control
    (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions with one
    or more participants. In the current PSTN, call signaling messages travel through
    switches which act as trusted intermediaries. The signaling messages typically
    include calling party identification information which may be delivered to the
    called party. The calling party is able to suppress the delivery of such information
    to the called party in order to maintain privacy.</p>"
