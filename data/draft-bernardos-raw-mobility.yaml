    key requirements for wireless heterogeneous networks in which connected devices
    might be mobile, such as eXtended Reality (XR). This document discusses and specifies
    control plane solutions to cope with mobility, by proactively preparing the network
    for the change of point of attachment of a connected mobile node. It also defines
