abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism by which two entities can make use
    of SDP arrive at a common view of a multimedia session between them. In the model,
    one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their
    perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their
    perspective. This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where
    information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.
    The offer/answer model is used by protocols like SIP.</p>"
