abstract:
- content: "<p>The first part of this paper describes the benefits of multicasting,
    the MBone, Class D addressing, and the operation of the Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP). The second section explores a number of different techniques
    that may potentially be employed by multicast routing protocols: o Flooding o
    Spanning Trees o Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) o Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting
    (TRPB) o Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM) o ''Shared-Tree'' Techniques The third
    part contains the main body of the paper. It describes how the previous techniques
    are implemented in multicast routing protocols available today (or under development).
    o Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) o Multicast Extensions to
    OSPF (MOSPF) o Protocol-Independent Multicast - Dense Mode (PIM-DM) o Protocol-Independent
    Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) o Core-Based Trees (CBT)</p>"
