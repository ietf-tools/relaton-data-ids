abstract:
- content: "<p>Network survivability refers to the capability of the network to maintain
    service continuity in the presence of faults within the network [1]. This can
    be accomplished by recovering quickly from network failures quickly and maintaining
    the required QoS for existing services. With the increasing sophistication of
    network technologies, survivability capabilities are becoming available at multiple
    layers, allowing for protection and restoration to occur at any layer of the network.
    This makes it important to: scrutinize the recovery features of different network
    layers, understand the pros and cons of performing recovery at each layer, and
    assess how the interactions between layers impact network survivability. With
    these objectives in mind, this draft examines the considerations for network survivability
    at different layers of the network.</p>"
