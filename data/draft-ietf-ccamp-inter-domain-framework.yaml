abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for establishing and controlling
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineered
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain networks. For the purposes of
    this document, a domain is considered to be any collection of network elements
    within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility.
    Examples of such domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous
    Systems (ASes). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
