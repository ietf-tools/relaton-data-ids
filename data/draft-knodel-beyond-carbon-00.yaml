abstract:
- content: "<p>The global internet is comprised of vast interconnected networks spanning
    nearly every surface of planet and sky that, together with user devices, consumes
    energy and emits greenhouse gases. The true scale and proposed mitigations of
    the carbon footprint of the internet are the subject of important research. The
    internet also requires the depletion of other natural resources beyond carbon,
    namely land, water, electromagnetic spectrum and minerals. Electronic waste contributes
    in particularly acute ways to environmental pollution. This document surveys the
    impacts of the internet on the environment and includes, but goes beyond, energy
    use and carbon footprint to look at the consumption of natural resources and environmental
    waste.</p>"
