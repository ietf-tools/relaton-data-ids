abstract:
- content: "<p>Slices in a 5G system should be identified and mapped to the corresponding
    transport network underlay segments to provide the capabilities requested by the
    5G customer. One set of slices in a 5G system correspond to resources and connectivity
    to carry signaling and data plane packets across a distributed infrastructure
    that make up the 5G system, for example, distributed entities of a radio network
    (gNB). Another set of 5G slices represent resource and connectivity capabilities
    offered by the 5G system to its end users (UE) for the lifetime of a session including
    UE mobility. Both depend in part on multiple transport network slice segments
    with requirements that include bandwidth, latency, and criteria such as isolation,
    directionality, and disjoint routes. This document describes how a 5G slice is
    mapped to a slice in IP or Layer 2 transport network for both above cases, including
    scenarios where the 5G customer network is separated from the provider transport
    network by an intermediate network. Mobile slice criteria are mapped to the appropriate
    transport slice and capabilities offered in backhaul, mid-haul and fronthaul connectivity
    segments between radio side network functions and user plane function(gateway).
    Applicability of this framework and underlying transport networks, which can enable
    different slice properties are also discussed. This is based on mapping between
    mobile and transport underlays (L2, Segment Routing, IPv6, MPLS and IPv4).</p>"
