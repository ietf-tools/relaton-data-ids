abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a shared-key authentication mechanism for the
    TLS protocol. It is intended to allow TLS clients to authenticate using a secret
    key (such as a password) shared with either the server or a third-party authentication
    service. The security of the secret authentication key is augmented by its integration
    into the normal SSL/TLS server authentication/key exchange mechanism.</p>"
