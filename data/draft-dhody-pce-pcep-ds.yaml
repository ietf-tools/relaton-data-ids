abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label
    Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement
    for point-to-point (P2P) and point- to-multipoint (P2MP) scenarios. Backward-Recursive
    Path Computation (BRPC) [RFC5441] defines Virtual Shortest Path Tree (VSPT) as
    a default de-facto data structure for path reply message in inter- domain scenarios.
    As Path Computation Element (PCE) will get used in newer scenarios like inter-domain,
    protection, P2MP etc. As well as PCE is being explored to be used in Cross Stratrum
    Optimization (CSO) environment (see [CSO-PCE]) as well as in [ABNO]. Limiting
    PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to just one data structure limits the usage
    of PCEP. Its important to keep PCEP generic enough to use differnt data structure
    and apply different algorithms. This document defines extensions to the PCEP to
    allow multiple data structures. Extensions are defined for PCE to indicate the
    set of Data Structure (DS) it supports; also Path Computation Client (PCC) or
    PCE can indicate in a path computation request the required DS, and a PCE can
    report in a path computation reply the Data Structure that was used in the path
    reply message.</p>"
