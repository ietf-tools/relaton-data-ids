abstract:
- content: "<p>Data-intensive analytics is entering the era of multi-domain, geographically-distributed,
    collaborative computing, where different organizations contribute various resources
    to collaboratively collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts of data.
    Examples of this paradigm include the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A Toroidal
    LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) experiments of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) program.
    Massive datasets continue to be acquired, simulated, processed and analyzed by
    globally distributed science networks in these collaborations. Applications that
    manage and analyze such massive data volumes can benefit substantially from the
    information about networking, computing and storage resources from each member's
    site, and more directly from network-resident services that optimize and load
    balance resource usage among multiple data transfers and analytics requests, and
    achieve a better utilization of multiple resources in clusters. The Application-Layer
    Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can provide via extensions the network information
    about different clusters/sites, to both users and proactive network management
    services where applicable, with the goal of improving both application performance
    and network resource utilization. In this document, we propose that it is feasible
    to use existing ALTO services to provides not only network information, but also
    information about computation and storage resources in data analytics networks.
    We introduce a uniform resource orchestration framework (Unicorn), which achieves
    an efficient multi-resource allocation to support low-latency dataset transfer
    and data intensive analytics for collaborative computing. It collects cluster
    information from multiple ALTO services utilizing topology extensions and leverages
    emerging SDN control capabilities to orchestrate the resource allocation for dataset
    transfers and analytics tasks, leading to improved transfer and analytics latency
    as well as more efficient utilization of multi-resources in sites.</p>"
