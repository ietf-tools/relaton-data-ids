abstract:
- content: "<p>During the last year, participants in the Real-time Applications and
    Infrastructure (RAI) area have been quite active in discussing proposals that
    could improve their way of working. This document is a contribution to that discussion
    and focuses on the reduction of delays experienced in producing specifications.
    We believe that this is one of the main problems in the RAI area (and quite likely
    in other areas of the IETF as well) and it requires attention. A number of side
    effects, caused by the long specification work, are illustrated in this document.</p>"
