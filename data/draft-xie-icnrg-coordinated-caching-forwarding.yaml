abstract:
- content: "<p>Content caching plays an important role in Information-Centric Networking
    (ICN). Many of current ICN designs adopt a limited, en- route hierarchical caching
    mechanism; additionally, caching and forwarding are largely uncoordinated in these
    designs. This draft describes a coordinated caching and forwarding design to improve
    content access cost and cache miss rate of ICN.</p>"
