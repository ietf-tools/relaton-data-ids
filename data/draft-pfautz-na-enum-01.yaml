abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a number of the administrative issues that
    must be resolved before effective deployment of ENUM[2,3] services in complex
    environments with number portability and multiple providers for using DNS for
    translation of E.164 (telephone) numbers. North America is examined critically
    because its environment may be more complex than most and because current deregulation
    trends may drive other countries/regions in similar directions. In particular
    the current mechanisms for number administration and number portability in North
    America will require establishment of a new administrative function for managing
    the domain name entries for ported numbers.</p>"
