abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Discovery Service for STIR Out-of-Band (OOB)
    Call Placement Services (CPS). The Discovery Service enables Authentication Services
    (AS) and Verification Services (VS) to quickly determine which CPS is responsible
    for a given telephone number (TN) or Service Provider Code (SPC), allowing retrieval
    of PASSporTs even when SIP Identity headers are removed by non-IP or hybrid network
    segments. The Discovery Service leverages a CPS URI certificate extension, which
    allows STIR Certificates or Delegate Certificates to embed an HTTPS URI for the
    CPS serving the TNs or SPCs covered by the certificate.</p>"
