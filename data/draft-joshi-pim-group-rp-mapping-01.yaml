abstract:
- content: "<p>Each PIM-SM router in a PIM Domain which supports ASM maintains Group-to-RP
    mappings which are used to identify a RP for a specific multicast group. PIM-SM
    has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings learned
    using various mechanisms. This algorithm does not allow administrator to override
    a specific Group-to-RP mapping with the static Group-to-RP mapping which an administrator
    would want to use. This algorithm also does not consider the PIM mode and the
    mechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned. This document first
    explains the requirements to extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then
    proposes the new algorithm.</p>"
