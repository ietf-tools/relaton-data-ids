abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution provides Designated
    Forwarder election procedures for multi-homing Ethernet Segments. These procedures
    have been enhanced further by applying Highest Random Weight (HRW) Algorithm for
    Designated Forwarded election in order to avoid unnecessary DF status changes
    upon a failure. This draft improves these procedures by providing a fast Designated
    Forwarder (DF) election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with
    the multi-homing Ethernet Segment. The solution is independent of number of EVIs
    associated with that Ethernet Segment and it is performed via a simple signaling
    between the recovered PE and each PEs in the multi-homing group.</p>"
