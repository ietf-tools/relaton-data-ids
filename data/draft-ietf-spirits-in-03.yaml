abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes INAP parameters (IN information and its encoding)
    which the SPIRITS protocol can transport from the PSTN into the IP network. The
    SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through which PSTN can request actions (services)
    to be carried out in the IP network in response to events occurring within the
    PSTN/IN. These services include, but are not limited to: Incoming Call Notification
    (Internet Call Waiting), Internet Caller-Id Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding
    ('Follow Me'). This draft outlines, what INAP parameters are of immediate interest
    to SPIRITS, how they may be extracted and encoded for use within the SPIRITS domain.
    INAP is used as an example protocol to clarify the SPIRITS message encoding process.
    This Internet-Draft has been written in response to the SPIRITS WG Chairs' call
    for SPIRITS Protocol proposals. It may be viewed as being a direct contribution
    to the Informational RFC on the SPIRITS protocol parameters. Among other contributions,
    this I-D is based on: o Informational RFC2995, 'Pre-SPIRITS implementations' o
    SPIRITS Architecture, presented in draft-ietf-spirits-architecture-02, RFC 3136
    o SPIRITS Protocol Requirements, presented in draft-ietf-spirits-reqs-04, current
    candidate for Informational RFC.</p>"
