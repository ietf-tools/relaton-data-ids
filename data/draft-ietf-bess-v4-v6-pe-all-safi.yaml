abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP- BGP)now plays
    an important role in the transition of their Provider (P) core network as well
    as Provider Edge (PE) Inter-AS peering network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators must
    have flexiblity to continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge
    networks migrate to IPv6. As well as must be able to support IPv6 networks in
    cases where operators decide to remain on an IPv4 network or during transition.
    This document details the External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS and PE- CE Edge peering
    IPv4-Only PE design where both IPv4 and IPv6 all supported SAFI NLRI can be advertised
    over a single IPv4 peer and IPv6-Only PE Design where all supported SAFI NLRI
    can be advertised over a single IPv6 peer. This document also defines a new IPv4
    BGP next hop encoding standard that uses an IPv4 address as the next hop and not
    an IPv4 mapped IPv6 address. This document also provides vendor specific test
    cases for the IPv4-Only peering design and IPv6-Only PE design as well as test
    results for the four major vendors stakeholders in the routing and switching indusrty,
    Cisco, Juniper, Nokia and Huawei. With the test results provided for the IPv6-Only
    Edge peering design, the goal is that all other vendors around the world that
    have not been tested will begin to adopt and implement the design.</p>"
