abstract:
- content: "<p>Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates are used for a
    number of purposes, the most significant of which is the authentication of domain
    names. Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify
    that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s)
    in the certificate. Today, this verification is done through a collection of ad
    hoc mechanisms. This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant
    can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance. The
    protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions,
    such as certificate revocation. RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH:
