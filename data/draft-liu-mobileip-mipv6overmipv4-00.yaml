abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for Mobile IPv6 nodes of a 6to4
    site [4] to continue utilizing Mobile IPv6 [5] services when they roam into IPv4
    domains. The mechanism is based on Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 [7] glued together
    naturally by the 6to4 protocol [4] for delivering IPv6 packets between the Mobile
    IPv6 nodes and their Mobile IPv6 home agents. To support the mechanism specified
    in this draft, the Mobile IPv6 nodes MUST be Mobile IPv4 capable and MUST NOT
    utilize Mobile IPv6 route optimization. The 6to4 border router(s) at the 6to4
    site MUST also be capable to act as Mobile IPv4 home agent(s).</p>"
