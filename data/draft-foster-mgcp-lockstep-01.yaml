abstract:
- content: "<p>A Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) endpoint that has encountered
    an adverse failure condition (such as being involved in a transient call when
    a Call Agent failover occurred) could be left in a lockstep state whereby events
    are quarantined but not notified. The MGCP package described in this document
    provides a mechanism for reporting these situations so that the new Call Agent
    can take the necessary fault recovery procedures. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
