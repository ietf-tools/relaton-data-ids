abstract:
- content: "<p>OpenPGP specifies message formats and certificate formats used for
    exchange of encrypted and/or authenticated objects. This document discusses methods
    of extending OpenPGP's message formats to support an authorization system. This
    system would use public key cryptography to authenticate a user to a server and
    establish the user's access permissions. The concept is that the user acquires
    a ticket signed by some issuer that specifies what they are entitled to do. That
    ticket is then submitted to a server. The server uses a challenge/response method
    to verify that the holder really has the matching private key. The server then
    allows the access specified.</p>"
