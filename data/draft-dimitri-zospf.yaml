abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents our thinking to date regarding the use of version
    3 of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol as a mechanism for the autoconfiguration
    of IP routers within an OSPF area. Specifically, a method for the allocation and
    distribution of IPv4 and IPv6 subnet addresses without explicit configuration
    is described. Such a mechanism would be useful in an environment where routing
    is desirable, but the network administration skills necessary to configure IP
    routers are not available. This draft presents zOSPF (zeroconfigutaion OSPF),
    a protocol based on OSFPv3 that will allow routers to self configure and forward
    IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.</p>"
