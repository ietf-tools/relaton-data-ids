abstract:
- content: <p>The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along a
    datapath has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond what the protocol
    designers envisioned, and while the architectural model generalizes well the protocol
    itself has a number of features that limit its applicability to applications other
    than IntServ. Network Layer Signaling uses the RSVP on-path communication model
    and provides a lightweight transport layer for non-QoS signaling applications,
    such as discovery or diagnostics. It is based on a "two-layer" architecture that
    divides protocol function into transport and application. This document describes
    the transport protocol.</p>
