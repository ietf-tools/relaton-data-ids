abstract:
- content: "<p>This document studies the relationships of WebRTC communication users
    with their web Calling Services (CS) and their Identity Providers (IdPs), in order
    to identify requirements for IdP based peer-to-peer authentication. This study
    focuses in particular on issues of privacy, security and trust that are raised
    by the introduction of the IdP into the WebRTC call model, and by a different
    browser-based calling paradigm, compared with Mobile networks or traditional VoIP
    systems. The document lists privacy and trust scenarios for WebRTC authentication
    for individuals as well as organizations. This contribution is proposed to the
    RTCWEB working group.</p>"
