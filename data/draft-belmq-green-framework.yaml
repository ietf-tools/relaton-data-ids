abstract:
- content: "<p>Recognizing the urgent need for energy efficiency, this document specifies
    a management framework focused on devices and device components within, or connected
    to, interconnected systems. The framework aims to enable energy usage optimization
    and ensure interoperability across diverse systems. Leveraging data from existing
    use cases, it delivers actionable metrics to support effective energy management
    and informed decision-making. Furthermore, the framework proposes mechanisms for
    representing and organizing timestamped telemetry data using YANG models and metadata,
    enabling transparent and reliable monitoring. This structured approach facilitates
    improved energy efficiency through consistent energy management practices.</p>"
