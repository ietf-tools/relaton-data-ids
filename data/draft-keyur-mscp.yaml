abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach for solving the 'last-mile' problem
    for multicast, especially SSM-style multicast, called Multicast Signaling Conduit
    Protocol (MSCP). It is intended to facilitate an endnode whose OS does not support
    IGMPv3, or who resides in a portion of the Internet infrastructure without multicast,
    to join multicast groups. It is especially intended for SSM-style groups, although
    it could be adapted for use for other multicast groups.</p>"
