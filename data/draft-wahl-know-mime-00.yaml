abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines directory information profiles for representing directory
    distribution knowledge for an X.500 or LDAP directory system, to be carried in
    an application/directory MIME Content-Type. The profiles consists of type definitions
    and the corresponding format of values that each type is allowed to contain. They
    are designed for simple generation and parsing by programs; the text-based format
    makes it easier for developers and directory administrators to debug problems.
    Additional documents will build on these specifications in defining text-based
    protocols for distributed directory server administration.</p>"
