abstract:
- content: "<p>Being able to securely retrieve information from sensors and control
    actuators while providing guards against distributed denial-of- service (DDoS)
    attacks are key requirements for CoAP deployments. To that aim, a security protocol
    (e.g., DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE) can be enabled to ensure secure CoAP operation, including
    protection against many attacks. This document identifies a set of known CoAP
    attacks and shows that simply using CoAP with a security protocol is not always
    enough for secure operation. Several of the identified attacks can be mitigated
    with a security protocol providing confidentiality and integrity combined with
    the solutions specified in RFC 9175.</p>"
