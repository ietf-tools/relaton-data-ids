abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides framework and requirements for Layer 2 Virtual
    Private Network (L2VPN) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM). The
    OAM framework is intended to provide OAM layering across L2VPN services, pseudowires
    (PWs), and Packet Switched Network (PSN) tunnels. This document is intended to
    identify OAM requirements for L2VPN services, i.e., Virtual Private LAN Service
    (VPLS), Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), and IP-only LAN Service (IPLS). Furthermore,
    if L2VPN service OAM requirements impose specific requirements on PW OAM and/or
    PSN OAM, those specific PW and/or PSN OAM requirements are also identified. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
