abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a simple analysis for the address utilization in
    the MASC architecture and concludes that the number of levels in the hierarchy
    should be kept small. More specifically, we believe that the number of levels
    should not exceed 3 MASC levels. The memo also motivates that MASC should not
    rely on hints from applications for future address requirements, but should rather
    guess future address demand and allocate addresses pro-actively thereby reducing
    the latency for address requests.</p>"
