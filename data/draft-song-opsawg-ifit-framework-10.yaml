abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks increase in scale and network operations become more sophisticated,
    traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include
    proactive and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes, become
    more susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration errors. With the
    advent of programmable data-plane, emerging on-path telemetry techniques provide
    unprecedented flow insight and realtime notification of network issues. This document
    enumerates the key deployment challenges for flow- oriented on-path telemetry
    techniques, especially in carrier operator networks. To address these issues,
    a high-level framework, In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT), is outlined.
    iFIT includes several essential functional components that can be materialized
    and assembled to implement a complete solution for on-path telemetry. This informational
    document aims to clarify the problem domain, and summarize the best practices
    and sensible system design considerations. The iFIT framework helps to guide the
    analysis on the current standard status and gaps, and motivate new works to complete
    the ecosystem. It also helps to inspire innovative network telemetry applications
    supporting advanced network operations. As a reference and open framework, iFIT
    does not specify the implementation of the components and the interfaces between
    the components. The compliance with iFIT framework is not mandatory for telemetry
    applications either.</p>"
