abstract:
- content: "<p>Many systems produce significant volumes of metrics which either are
    not all needed at the same time for consumption by collection/ aggregation endpoints
    or may also compete for bandwidth with the primary application, thus exacerbating
    congestion conditions especially in low-bandwidth networks. Delivering these over
    architectures enabled by publish/subscribe transport like Media Over QUIC Transport
    (MOQT) [I-D.ietf-moq-transport], allows metrics data to be prioritized within
    the congestion context of the primary application as well as enabling local nodes
    to cache the metric value to be later retrieved via new subscriptions. This document
    specifies how to send metrics type information over the Media Over QUIC Transport
    (MOQT).</p>"
