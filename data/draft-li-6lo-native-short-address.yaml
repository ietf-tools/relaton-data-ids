abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Native Short
    Address (NSA) that enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission
    of a full length address may not be desirable. Furthermore, packet forwarding
    is stateless, meaning that no routing table needs to be built, rather, the forwarding
    decision is based solely on the destination address structure. This document focuses
    on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the
    topology is static, where nodes' location is fixed, and the connection between
    nodes is also rather stable. This specifications details the NSA architecture,
    address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design, including length-variable
    fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.</p>"
