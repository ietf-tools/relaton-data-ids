abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 is designed to maintain its connectivity while moving from
    one network to another. It is adopted in 3G CDMA networks as a way to maintain
    connectivity when the mobile node moves between access provider networks. However,
    this handover procedure requires not only movement detection, but also the acquisition
    of a new care-of address and the sending of a binding update message to the home
    agent before the traffic begins to direct to the new location. During this period,
    packets destined for the mobile node will be lost, which may not be acceptable
    for real-time application such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video telephony. This
    document specifies fast handover methods and selective bi-casting methods in the
    3G context in order to reduce latency and packet loss during handover.</p>"
