abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a standard for mapping wallets to domain names
    using TXT records. The goal is to provide a secure and scalable way to associate
    wallets with domain names, enabling seamless lookup as well as assisting in authentication.
    The proposal heavily uses DNSSEC to ensure security. We also will propose a mechanism
    for mapping a wallet back to a domain name.</p>"
