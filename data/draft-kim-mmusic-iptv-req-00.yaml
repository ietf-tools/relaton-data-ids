abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for implementation of Internet
    Media Guide (IMG) over Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) because there are still
    different concepts about applications and technical implementation of IMG. Triple
    Play Services (TPS) for IPTV need more efficient and integrated IMG than existent
    IMG for ordinary TV. Such variations raise not only the question of compatibility
    between different vendors of IMG systems, but bring the confusion at consumer
    side: which one system is most suitable to viewers and what are the criteria for
    suitability of IPTV IMG system for viewers. These requirements are designed to
    guide choice and development of IMG feature.</p>"
