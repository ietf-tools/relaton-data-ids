abstract:
- content: '<p>[Editor''s Note: This version is submitted for review. A final, post-
    review version is anticipated that will supersede this version]. Portions of the
    radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use but are unused or unoccupied
    at specific locations and times are defined as "white space." The concept of allowing
    additional transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is
    a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use. An obvious requirement
    is that these additional transmissions do not interfere with the assigned use
    of the spectrum. One approach to using white space spectrum at a given time and
    location is to verify spectrum availability with a database that manages spectrum
    sharing and provides spectrum-availability information. This document describes
    a number of possible use cases of white space spectrum and technology as well
    as a set of requirements for the database query protocol. The concept of white
    spaces is described along with the problems that need to be addressed to enable
    white space spectrum for additional uses without causing interference to currently
    assigned use. Use of white space is enabled by querying a database that stores
    information about spectrum availability at any given location and time.</p>'
