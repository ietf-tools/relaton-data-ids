abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub networks
    in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer network may have as
    many global unicast addresses as many service providers it will be connected with.
    Users can establish multiple connections through different service providers simultaneously.
    Customer networks can maintain private address space to communicate within its
    users. Customer networks can provide IP mobility services as well.</p>"
