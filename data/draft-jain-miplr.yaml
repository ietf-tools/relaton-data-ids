abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended only to provide information to the Internet
    community. The Mobile IP (MIP) protocol for IP version 4 provides continuous Internet
    connectivity to mobile hosts, without requiring any changes to existing routers
    and higher-layer applications. This document describes an alternative protocol,
    Mobile IP with Location Registers (MIP-LR), where the sender first queries a database,
    called a Location Register, to obtain the recipients current location. MIP-LR
    is designed for operation in tactical military environments, enterprise environments
    or within logical administrative domains, as it requires a sending host to be
    aware which hosts implement the MIP-LR protocol. MIP-LR gives up the transparency
    of MIP for several benefits in the areas of survivability, performance and interoperability.
    MIP-LR improves survivability for situations where the mobile's home network is
    particularly vulnerable (e.g. in the forward area of a battlefield), by allowing
    location registers to be placed and replicated outside the home network. This
    document describes how replicated location registers can be managed by Translation
    Server or Quorum schemes. In terms of performance, MIP-LR avoids triangle routing
    and tunneling, and reduces the load on the home network as well as the home agents.
    MIP-LR provides improved interoperability with protocols such as RSVP for providing
    QoS guarantees. Finally, MIP-LR is interoperable with MIP, such that hosts which
    implement only MIP can continue to operate as expected (provided the provisions
    required by MIP, such as Home and Foreign Agents, are appropriately provided)
    without gaining any of the benefits of MIP-LR. We have developed a working version
    of the MIP-LR protocol running on Linux hosts.</p>"
