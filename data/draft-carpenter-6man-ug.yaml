abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 addressing architecture defines a method by which the Universal
    and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface
    identifier. This document clarifies the status of those bits for interface identifiers
    that are not derived from an IEEE link-layer address, and updates RFC 4291 accordingly.</p>"
