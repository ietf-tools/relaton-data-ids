abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the major applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    is in Internet telephony. In this context it is often useful or convenient for
    a SIP entity to request another SIP User Agent generate some type of tone, without
    generating this tone as part of a session. This document describes how SIP can
    be used without modification to carry such tones and explores issues relating
    to their use. Finally this document defines a new MIME type which is useful for
    conveying computer generated tones.</p>"
