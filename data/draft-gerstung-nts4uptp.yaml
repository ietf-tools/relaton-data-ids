abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the application of Network Time Security, a mechanism
    for using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated Encryption with Associated
    Data (AEAD) to provide cryptographic security for the unicast mode of the Precision
    Time Protocol. It is based on the 'Network Time Security for the Network Time
    Protocol' document RFC8915 and re-uses most of its mechanisms for providing a
    secure and robust key exchange solution for unicast PTP. Due to the different
    modes of operation, additional steps are required to secure unicast PTP communication
    between the PTP clients and unicast PTP servers. In addition to defining the new
    record types and other required values to allow the utilization of the NTS key
    exchange sub protocol, there are a number of additional protocol enhancements
    and server-side requirements which are defined in this memo.</p>"
