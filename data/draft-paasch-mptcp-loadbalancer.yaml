abstract:
- content: "<p>Large webserver farms consist of thousands of frontend proxies that
    serve as endpoints for the TCP and TLS connection and relay traffic to the (sometimes
    distant) backend servers. Load-balancing across those server is done by layer-4
    loadbalancers that ensure that a TCP flow will always reach the same server. Multipath
    TCP's use of multiple TCP subflows for the transmission of the data stream requires
    those loadbalancers to be aware of MPTCP to ensure that all subflows belonging
    to the same MPTCP connection reach the same frontend proxy. In this document we
    analyze the challenges related to this and suggest a simple modification to the
    generation of the MPTCP-token to overcome those challenges.</p>"
