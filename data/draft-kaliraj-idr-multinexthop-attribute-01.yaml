abstract:
- content: <p>Today, a BGP speaker can advertise one nexthop for a set of NLRIs in
    an Update. This nexthop can be encoded in either the BGP-Nexthop attribute (code
    3), or inside the MP_REACH attribute (code 14). For cases where multiple nexthops
    need to be advertised, BGP-Addpath is used. Though Addpath allows basic ability
    to advertise multiple- nexthops, it does not allow the sender to specify desired
    relationship between the multiple nexthops being advertised e.g., relative-preference,
    type of load-balancing. These are local decisions at the receiving speaker based
    on path-selection between the various additional-paths, which may tie-break on
    some arbitrary step like Router-Id. Some scenarios with a BGP-free core may benefit
    from having a mechanism, where egress-node can signal multiple-nexthops along
    with their relationship to ingress nodes. This document defines a new BGP attribute
    "MultiNexthop" that can be used for this purpose. This attribute can be used for
    both labeled and unlabled BGP families. For labeled-families, it is used for a
    different purpose in "downstream allocation" case than "upstream allocation" scenarios.</p>
