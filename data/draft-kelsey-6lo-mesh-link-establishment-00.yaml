abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for
    establishing and configuring secure radio links in IEEE 802.15.4 radio mesh networks.
    MLE extends IEEE 802.15.4 for use in multihop mesh networks by adding three capabilities:
    1) dynamically configuring and securing radio links, 2) enabling network-wide
    changes to radio parameters, and 3) determining link quality prior to link configuration
    MLE operates below the routing layer, insulating it from the details of configuring,
    securing, and maintaining individual radio links within a larger mesh network.</p>"
