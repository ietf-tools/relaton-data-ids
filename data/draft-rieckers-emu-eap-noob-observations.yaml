abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a random list of things the author noticed about EAP-
    NOOB when looking at the draft and running the implementation while capturing
    the packets (https://github.com/Vogeltak/hostap). Most of the statements were
    written down before the author started the implementation. By the time of writing
    this draft, a mostly complete server implementation has been written. The implementation-
    specific remarks are mostly thoughts the author had while planning their own implementation.</p>"
