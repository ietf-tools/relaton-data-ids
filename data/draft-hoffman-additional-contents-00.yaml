abstract:
- content: "<p>Implementers have recently expressed different views on what can appear
    in the Additional section in DNS responses. Proposals for adding functionality
    to the DNS protocol that rely on non-glue records in the Additional section rely
    on having a common understanding of the semantics of the Additional section. This
    document restates what has been said in other DNS standards, and does not update
    any of them.</p>"
