abstract:
- content: <p>Many small inexpensive computing devices like home routers, Rasberry
    Pi etc. do not have a battery to allow clock chip to keep track of time, thus
    the systems have no idea what the current time is upon boot. Number of modern
    services take Time Synchronization for granted, but operating systems do not allow
    the start of these services to be deferred until after accurate clock has been
    confirmed. NTP provides accurate fine grain clock synchronization but in order
    for NTP to succeed DNS needs to work. DNSSEC resolvers will fail if system clock
    is off by more than little bit. This draft proposes a mechanism to offer "reasonable"
    current time to devices upon boot via DHCP, DHCPv6 and ND.</p>
