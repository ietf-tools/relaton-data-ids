abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a minimal implementation of the IP Encapsulation
    Security Payload (ESP) described in RFC 4303. Its purpose is to enable implementation
    of ESP with a minimal set of options that makes the minimal implementation compatible
    with ESP as described in RFC 4303. A minimal version of ESP is not intended to
    become a replacement of the RFC 4303 ESP, but instead to enable a limited implementation
    to interoperate with implementations of RFC 4303 ESP. This document describes
    what is required from RFC 4303 ESP as well as various ways to optimize compliance
    with RFC 4303 ESP. This document does not update or modify RFC 4303, but provides
    a compact description of how to implement the minimal version of the protocol.
    If this document and RFC 4303 conflicts then RFC 4303 is the authoritative description.</p>"
