abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the use of priority zero in VRRP to failover from
    the Master router to one of the Backup routers either by operator input (i.e.
    manual failover) or automatically (e.g. on uplink interface going down). The procedure
    tries to be graceful (i.e. minimize outage) wherever possible. It is especially
    helpful in cases where preemption is disabled to avoid unnecessary churn.</p>"
