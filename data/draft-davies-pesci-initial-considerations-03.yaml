abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a summary of previously identified problems
    with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) process for developing standards
    and other specifications; and then identifies a set of goals to aim at, and guidelines
    that should be followed during any activity seeking to revise and update this
    process. It does not propose specific changes to the process, which should be
    the subject of future documents.</p>"
