abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast
    in 802.11 (wifi) and other local-area wireless environments. This document describes
    the problems of known limitations with wireless (primarily 802.11) Layer-2 multicast.
    Also described are certain multicast enhancement features that have been specified
    by the IETF, and by IEEE 802, for wireless media, as well as some operational
    choices that can be taken to improve the performance of the network. Finally,
    some recommendations are provided about the usage and combination of these features
    and operational choices.</p>"
