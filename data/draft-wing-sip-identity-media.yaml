abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new SIP identity mechanism which operates through
    SBCs and B2BUAs. This new identity mechanism creates a signature over certain
    SIP headers and certain SDP lines. When the SIP body contains SDP, both the SIP
    signaling path and the media path are used to perform the identity function; when
    the SIP body contains non-SDP body parts, they are signed in their entirety.</p>"
