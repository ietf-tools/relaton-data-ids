abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the analysis of the applicability of Abstraction
    and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration (POI)
    to cover multi-layer service assurance scenarios. Specifically, the ACTN architecture
    enables the detection and handling of different failures that may happen either
    at the optical or the packet layer. It is assumed that the underlying transport
    optical network carries end-to-end IP services such as L2VPN or L3VPN connectivity
    services, with specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Existing IETF
    protocols and data models are identified for each multi-layer (packet over optical)
    service assurance scenario with a specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service
    Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers Interface) in the ACTN architecture.</p>"
