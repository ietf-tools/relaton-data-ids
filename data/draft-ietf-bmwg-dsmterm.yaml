abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes terminology for the benchmarking of devices
    that implement traffic control using packet classification based on defined criteria.
    The terminology is to be applied to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate
    IP traffic control mechanisms. Rules for packet classification can be based on
    any field in the IP header, such as the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP),
    or any field in the packet payload, such as port number. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
