abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 prefix sharing in policy for convergence applications makes it
    impossible to track individual quality of service requirements for each host by
    the policy server. In order to enable it, we define a protocol which is based
    on the residential gateway sending some parameters such as IPv6 addresses of each
    host (3GPP UE or fixed host) to the edge router. The edge router in its turn establishes
    IP-CAN sub-session for each host to receive the quality of service parameters.
    The edge router enforces this quality of service which is specific to the host
    on its traffic both uplink and downlink. When the host disconnects or leaves the
    network, IP-CAN sub-session is terminated.</p>"
