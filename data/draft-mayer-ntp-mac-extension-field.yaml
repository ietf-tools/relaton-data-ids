abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4) defines in RFC5905 the
    optional usage of Message Authentication Code (MAC). The MAC is an optional component
    of the NTP packet at the end of the packet. There can only be one MAC segment
    in the packet but there is no way of knowing if the last data segment at the end
    of an NTP packet is a MAC or an extension field, which is also defined in RFC5905.
    This draft defines a MAC extension field which will allow the existing MAC segment
    to be moved into an extension field and have a known length and deprecates the
    existing MAC.</p>"
