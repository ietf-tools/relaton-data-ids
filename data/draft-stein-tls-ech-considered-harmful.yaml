abstract:
- content: "<p>Encrypted Client Hello is designed to enhance personal privacy, in
    particular obstructing the ability of communications service providers (but not
    Over The Top service providers) to map packet flows to applications. While mostly
    ineffective in attaining this goal, it does severely hamper network-based detection
    of malicious flows, thus exposing end-users to various security risks that were
    previously avoidable.</p>"
