abstract:
- content: "<p>Basic Network Address Translation or Basic NAT is a feature by which
    IP addresses are mapped from one group to another, transparent to users. Network
    Address Port Translation, or NAPT is an extension to Basic NAT, in that many network
    addresses and their TCP/UDP ports are translated to a single network address and
    its TCP/UDP ports. Together, these two operations, traditionally referred to as
    NAT, provide a mechanism to connect an isolated routing realm with private unregistered
    addresses to the external routing network with globally unique registered addresses.</p>"
