abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines textual conventions for the constants used in
    MIBs for the IPsec protocols. In particular, it documents those numbers whose
    assignments are managed by the IANA, with new assignments being made over time.
    The textual conventions provide IPsec-related MIBs with clearer documentation,
    and insulate them from having to track new assignments by the IANA. The MIB documented
    by this document will become a separate living document maintained by the IANA,
    and will be the document of record for these assignments.</p>"
