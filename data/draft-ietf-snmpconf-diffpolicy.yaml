abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes a MIB module that provides a conceptual layer between
    high-level "network-wide" policy definitions that effect configuration of the
    Differentiated Services (diffserv) subsystem and the instance-specific information
    that would include such details as the parameters for all the queues associated
    with each interface in a system. This essentially provides an interface for configuring
    differentiated services at a conceptually higher layer than that of the Differentiated
    Services MIB. [PROPOSED STANDARD]</p>
