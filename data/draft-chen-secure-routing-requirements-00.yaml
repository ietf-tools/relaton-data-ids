abstract:
- content: "<p>At present, the routing process is to look up its own routing table
    through the router to realize packet forwarding or data discarding. With the development
    of the network, attention is paid not only to reachability but also to security
    capability in the routing process. With the frequent occurrence of security incidents,
    more and more network devices have security functions, secure routing and secure
    path is required by many scenarios.</p>"
