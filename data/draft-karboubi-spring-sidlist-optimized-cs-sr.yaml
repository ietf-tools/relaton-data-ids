abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers require delivery of circuit-style transport services
    in a segment routing based IP network. This document introduces a solution that
    supports circuit style segment routing policies that allows usage of optimized
    SID lists (i.e. SID List that may contain non-contiguous node SIDs as instructions)
    and describes mechanisms that would allow such encoding to still honor all the
    requirements of the circuit style policies notably traffic engineering and bandwidth
    requirements.</p>"
