abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an method for shortening DES keys from 56 bits
    to 40 bits. The shortened keys are generally known as 'DES-40'. The motivation
    for this weakening is that some localities (such as the United States) give special
    preference to applications that use 40-bit keys. The weakened keys are then used
    with the DES encryption algorithm in the same manner as full-strength keys. There
    are many possible methods for reducing a 56-bit key to a 40-bit key. The method
    in this draft was chosen because one method is needed for interoperability. Further,
    this method has been known to occasionally have been approved for export from
    the United States.</p>"
