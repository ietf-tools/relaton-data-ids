abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet communications and applications have both environmental costs
    and benefits. The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 on exploring and
    understanding these impacts. The role of the workshop was to discuss the impacts,
    discuss the evolving needs from industry, and to identify areas for improvements
    and future work. A key goal of the workshop was to call further attention to the
    topic and to bring together a diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues.
    This report summarises the workshop inputs and discussions.</p>"
