abstract:
- content: '<p>The upstream-assigned label is used to identify the specific multicast
    flow. In MVPN technology RFC6513, it says: "This procedure requires each egress
    PE to support a separate label space for every other PE. The egress PEs creates
    a forwarding entry for the upstream-assigned MPLS label, allocated by the ingress
    PE, in this label space." In common scenario, the "separate label space" is planned
    by network administrator in advance. For the stable network, the method of allocating
    the separate label space is easy and practicable. But when the network changes
    dynamically, it is very hard to allocate the separate label space in advance.
    The planned label space is probably insufficient. That leads to collision when
    PE uses the common label space to allocate upstream-assigned label. Therefore
    we need a flexible solution for the collision of upstream-assigned label in the
    dynamically changing network.</p>'
