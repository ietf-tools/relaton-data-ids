abstract:
- content: "<p>Seamless MPLS architecture is proposed to integrate access and aggregation/core
    networks into a single MPLS domain. Through the separation of the service and
    transport plane Seamless MPLS can provide end to end service independent transport.
    But when the mobile backhaul network is integrated as the access/aggregation network
    with the core network based on Seamless MPLS architecture, it will proposes new
    challenges other than the existing solutions for Seamless MPLS. This document
    introduces the framework of Seamless MPLS to integrate the mobile backhaul network
    and the core network. The possible challenges of Seamless MPLS for mobile backhaul
    networks are identified and new requirements are defined accordingly.</p>"
