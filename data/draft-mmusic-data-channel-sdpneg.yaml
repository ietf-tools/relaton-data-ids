abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communications
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers. For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the
    concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP, where each data channel might
    be used to transport other protocols, called sub-protocols. Data channel setup
    can be done using either the internal in-band band (also referred to as 'internal'
    for the rest of the document) WebRTC Data Channel Establishment Protocol or some
    external out-of-band simply referred to as 'external negotiation' in the rest
    of the document. This document specifies how the SDP offer/answer exchange can
    be used to achieve such an external negotiation. Even though data channels are
    designed for RTCWeb use initially they may be used by other protocols like, but
    not limited to, the CLUE protocol. This document is intended to be used wherever
    data channels are used.</p>"
