abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of IGMP snooping requires the ability to identify the location
    of multicast routers. Since IGMP (and MLD) snooping is not standardized, there
    are many mechanisms in use to identify the multicast routers. However, this scenario
    can lead to interoperability issues between multicast routers and layer-2 switches
    from different vendors. This document introduces a general mechanism that allows
    for the discovery of multicast routers. By introducing these new messages, snooping
    devices have a uniform means of identifying multicast routers without dependency
    on particular routing protocols. These messages may also be used to convey configuration
    parameters to all systems on a network. In addition, other devices that may need
    to discover multicast routers can utilize these messages.</p>"
