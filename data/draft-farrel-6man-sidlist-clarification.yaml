abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is the instantiation of Segment Routing
    (SR) on the IPv6 dataplane. Segments are indicated by Segment Identifiers (SIDs).
    SRv6 utilizes the Segment Routing Header (SRH), an IPv6 extension header, that
    includes a SID list indicating the sequence of segments and any additional processing
    to be performed. This document clarifies the processing of SID list entries. It
    does not change any elements of the SRv6 architecture and makes no technical changes
    to the mechanisms or procedures of SRv6.</p>"
