abstract:
- content: <p>A significant challenge in the widespread adoption of the Automated
    Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] is the trust establishment
    between ACME servers and clients. While ACME clients can automatically discover
    the URL of the ACME server through ACME Auto Discovery [I-D.vanbrouwershaven-acme-auto-discovery],
    they face difficulty in identifying authorized clients. This draft proposes a
    solution to this problem by allowing Certification Authority (CA) customers to
    specify which ACME keys are authorized to request certificates on their behalf
    by simply providing the domain name of the service provider. Specifically, this
    document registers the URI "/.well-known/acme- keys" at which all compliant service
    providers can publish their ACME client public keys. This mechanism allows the
    ACME server to identify the specific service provider, enhancing the trust relationship.
    Furthermore, it provides flexibility to service providers as they can use multiple
    keys and rotate them as often as they like, thereby improving security and control
    over their ACME client configurations while giving CA customers the ability to
    specifically authorize which service providers can request certificates on their
    behalf.</p>
