abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (for NAT with Explicit
    Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6. NAT-XC is distinguished from other
    IPv4/IPv6 translations schemes in that it separates the translation between IPv4
    and IPv6 from the management of address bindings for such a translation; and is
    designed to allow applications to be explicitly aware of, and control, their address
    bindings. NAT-XC can be used by both IPv4 clients wishing to communicate via IPv6,
    and IPv6 clients wishing to communicate via IPv4. NAT-XC appears to be usable
    in a wide variety of scenarios requiring communication across IPv4/IPv6 boundaries.</p>"
