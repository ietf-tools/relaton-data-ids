abstract:
- content: "<p>Middlebox communication (midcom) was conceived to move application
    level gateway (ALG) intelligence out of middleboxes into application specific
    midcom agents. Midcom agents will be assumed to use midcom to control middlebox
    resources so as to permit applications to traverse a middlebox. The scope of the
    middleboxes is limited to NAT and firewall devices. This document defines SNMP
    managed midcom objects to control middlebox resources and justifies adapting SNMPv3
    as the midcom protocol.</p>"
