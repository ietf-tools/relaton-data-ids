abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a quick reconnect IMAP4 extension, which gives
    a mobile client the ability to resume a previously abandoned session, without
    the need to perform a full synchronization sequence. The goal is to minimize the
    amount of data transfered at login after a dropped connection.</p>"
