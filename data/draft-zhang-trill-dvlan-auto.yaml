abstract:
- content: "<p>When RBridges are connected by a bridge LAN link, they need to select
    out a Designated VLAN to be used for PDU exchange and TRILL data forwarding. This
    document specifies an approach for RBridges to automatically determine a Designated
    VLAN on a LAN link for default configured RBridges. When a DVLAN has to be changed
    for the sake of a better connectivity of a LAN link, RBridges can change their
    Designated VLAN with least traffic interruption according to the soft Designated
    VLAN change method.</p>"
