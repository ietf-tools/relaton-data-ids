abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new way of exchanging Host Identities (or
    Host Identity Tags) by means of the Presence Information Data Format [6] using
    the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). A new presence information element is proposed
    as an extension to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF), to include and
    convey the Host Identity that corresponds to the different SIP URI's the node
    may have registered. This automatically creates a list of associations between
    the SIP URI and the Host identity for the different UA instances on the same or
    different node.</p>"
