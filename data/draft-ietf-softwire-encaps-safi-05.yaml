abstract:
- content: <p>In certain situations, transporting a packet from one Border Gateway
    Protocol (BGP) speaker to another (the BGP next hop) requires that the packet
    be encapsulated by the first BGP speaker and decapsulated by the second. To support
    these situations, there needs to be some agreement between the two BGP speakers
    with regard to the "encapsulation information", i.e., the format of the encapsulation
    header as well as the contents of various fields of the header. The encapsulation
    information need not be signaled for all encapsulation types. In cases where signaling
    is required (such as Layer Two Tunneling Protocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) or Generic
    Routing Encapsulation (GRE) with key), this document specifies a method by which
    BGP speakers can signal encapsulation information to each other. The signaling
    is done by sending BGP updates using the Encapsulation Subsequent Address Family
    Identifier (SAFI) and the IPv4 or IPv6 Address Family Identifier (AFI). In cases
    where no encapsulation information needs to be signaled (such as GRE without key),
    this document specifies a BGP extended community that can be attached to BGP UPDATE
    messages that carry payload prefixes in order to indicate the encapsulation protocol
    type to be used. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
