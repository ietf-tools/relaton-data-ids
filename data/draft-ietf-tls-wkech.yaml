abstract:
- content: <p>We propose use of a well-known URI at which an HTTP origin can inform
    an authoritative DNS server, or other interested parties, about this origin's
    Service Bindings, i.e. its "HTTPS" DNS records. These instructions can include
    Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) configurations, allowing the origin to publish and
    rotate its own ECH keys.</p>
