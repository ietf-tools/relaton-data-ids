abstract:
- content: <p>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the
    Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security and Stability
    Advisory Committee have focused on the problems that the DNS is likely to experience
    with top-level domains (TLDs) that contain address records (so-called "dotless
    domains"). In order to help researchers determine the extent of the issues with
    dotless domains, this document lists the current dotless TLDs and gives a script
    for finding them. This document lists data about dotless TLDs but does not address
    the policy and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.</p>
