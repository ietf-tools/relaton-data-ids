- content: "<p>This document presents an object-oriented model of low-level IPsec
    policy designed to: o facilitate agreement about the content and semantics of
    IPsec policy o enable derivations of task-specific representations of IPsec policy
    such as storage schema, distribution representations, and policy specification
    languages used to configure IPsec- enabled endpoints The schema described in this
    document models the IKE phase one parameters as described in [1] and the IKE phase
    two parameters for the IPsec Domain of Interpretation as described in [2, 3, 4,
    5].</p>"
