abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
    link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain
    reachability information. This document updates RFC4861 to allow routers to proactively
    create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node. It
    also updates RFC4861 and recommends nodes to send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements
    upon assigning a new IPv6 address. The proposed change will minimize the delay
    and packet loss when a node initiate connections to off-link destination from
    a new IPv6 address.</p>"
