abstract:
- content: '<p>This document updates the TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) specification
    [ECH-DRAFT] to support an implicit mode in ECH signaled by a new implicit_ech
    extension in ECHConfigContents. Clients that detect this extension override certain
    base ECH rules: * They MAY choose any outer SNI instead of public_name. * They
    MAY choose any value for the config_id without an application profile or being
    externally configured. * They MAY use another value than ECHConfig.contents.public_name
    in the "server_name" extension (rather than they SHOULD use it) Client-facing
    servers that include implicit_ech in the ECHConfig MUST accommodate flexible config_id
    usage as defined in Section 10.4. of [ECH-DRAFT]. This approach enables the removal
    of stable identifiers (fixed config ID and known public_name) that on-path adversaries
    can use to fingerprint a connection. This improves upon the "Do Not Stick Out"
    design goal from Section 10.10.4 of [ECH-DRAFT] by allowing clients to choose
    unpredictable identifiers on the wire in the scenario where the set of ECH configurations
    the client encounters is small and therefore popular public_name or config_id
    values "stick out". Note that this increases CPU usage in multi-key deployments
    because client-facing servers must perform uniform trial decryption to handle
    arbitrary config_id values. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before
    publishing as an RFC. Discussion of this document takes place on the Transport
    Layer Security mailing list (tls@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/tls/.
