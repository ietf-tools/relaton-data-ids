abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key
    management scheme for real-time applications. In this document, we note that the
    currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios
    built around a centralized key management service. Interest in such deployments
    is increasing. Therefore, a set of new MIKEY modes that work well in such scenarios
    are defined. The new modes use a trusted key management service and a ticket concept,
    similar to that in Kerberos. The new modes also support features used by many
    existing applications, where the exact identity of the other endpoint may not
    be known at the start of the communication session. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
