abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 [6TO4] uses automatic IPv6-over-IPv4
    tunneling to interconnect IPv6 networks. The architecture includes Relay Routers
    and Routers, which accept and decapsulate IPv4 traffic from anywhere. There aren't
    many constraints on the embedded IPv6 packets, or where IPv4 traffic will be automatically
    tunneled to. These could enable one to go around access controls, and more likely,
    being able to perform proxy Denial of Service attacks using Relays as reflectors.
    This document discusses these issues and tries to suggest enhancements to alleviate
    the problems.</p>"
