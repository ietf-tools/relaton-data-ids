abstract:
- content: "<p>The continuous increase of flexibility and bit rate in optical networks
    has higher and higher impacts on inter-channel effects (e.g. Cross-phase modulations).
    This effect leads to the introduction of Guard Bands between adjacent light paths
    in order to reduce the inter-channel detrimental effects. This document provides
    requirements for the devolpment of protocol extensions to support Generalized
    Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and Path Computation Element (PCE) management
    of Guard Bands.</p>"
