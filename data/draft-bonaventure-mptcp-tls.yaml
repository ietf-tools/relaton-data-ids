abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) include several
    techniques that improve the reliability and the security of data transfers. In
    this document we propose Multipath TLS (MPTLS), a tighter coupling between TLS
    and Multipath TCP that provides improved security and reliability in the presence
    of adversaries. MPTLS would the resilience of existing TLS applications to attacks.
    It could also serve as a basis for the TCP extension that is being discussed within
    the TCPINC working group to provide unauthenticated encryption and integrity protection
    of TCP streams.</p>"
