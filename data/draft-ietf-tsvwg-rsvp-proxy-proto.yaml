abstract:
- content: <p>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) signaling can be used to make end-to-end
    resource reservations in an IP network in order to guarantee the Quality of Service
    (QoS) required by certain flows. With conventional RSVP, both the data sender
    and receiver of a given flow take part in RSVP signaling. Yet, there are many
    use cases where resource reservation is required, but the receiver, the sender,
    or both, is not RSVP-capable. Where the receiver is not RSVP- capable, an RSVP
    router may behave as an RSVP Receiver Proxy, thereby performing RSVP signaling
    on behalf of the receiver. This allows resource reservations to be established
    on the segment of the end-to- end path from the sender to the RSVP Receiver Proxy.
    However, as discussed in the companion document "RSVP Proxy Approaches", RSVP
    extensions are needed to facilitate operations with an RSVP Receiver Proxy whose
    signaling is triggered by receipt of RSVP Path messages from the sender. This
    document specifies these extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
