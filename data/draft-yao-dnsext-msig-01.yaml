abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC is trying to be deployed everywhere. Many are afraid of DNSSEC
    deployment, which are too heavy to be deployed. There is a huge gap between the
    resources we need to deploy DNSSEC and the benefits or security we can get from
    the DNSSEC. This document proposes a lightweight DNSSEC mechanism to make the
    DNSSEC to be deployed easily while getting the similar security with the heavy
    DNSSEC.</p>"
