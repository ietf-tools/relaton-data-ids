abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests that a link-local address used by a router as
    a source address for Router Advertisement packets is calculated as a function
    of prefixes listed in the Prefix Information Option of the Router Advertisement.
    The proposed approach, combined with the Rule 5.5 of the Default Source Address
    Selection algorithm (RFC6724) improves the robustness of the SLAAC by allowing
    the hosts to detect the IPv6 subnet changes much faster and select the correct
    source address.</p>"
