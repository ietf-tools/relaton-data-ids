abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of limited mobile data plans, it is crucial to manage
    data usage efficiently. This document proposes a method using the HTTP `OPTIONS`
    header to retrieve the size of a file before downloading. By checking the `Content-Length`
    header, users can be informed of the file size and prompted to confirm the download.
    This approach helps users avoid unexpected data consumption and ensures better
    control over their mobile data usage.</p>"
