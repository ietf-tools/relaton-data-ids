abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft presents the multi-hop Backbone Wireless Mesh Network
    scenario, summarising its basic characteristics and describing the requirements
    and desired properties of an IP Autoconfiguration mechanism aimed at being used
    in this kind of networks. Once that the AUTOCONF WG has almost finalised the documents
    that describe the general architecture of MANETs and the IP autoconfiguration
    problem statement in MANETs, the WG is expected to start working on solutions.
    This document describes an ad-hoc scenario that is getting a lot of attention
    from both telecommunication operators and end-users: Backbone/infrastructure Wireless
    Mesh Networking. This document identifies and explains the requirements posed
    by this particular scenario to an IP autoconfiguration mechanism. The goal is
    to help the AUTOCONF WG identify the requirements that need to be taken into account
    when designing IP autoconfiguration solution(s) suitable for this Wireless Mesh
    environment.</p>"
