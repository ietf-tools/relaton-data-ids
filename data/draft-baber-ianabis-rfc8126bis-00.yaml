abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants
    to identify various protocol parameters. To ensure that the values in these fields
    do not have conflicting uses and to promote interoperability, their allocations
    are often coordinated by a central record keeper. For IETF protocols, that role
    is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). To make assignments
    in a given registry prudently, guidance describing the conditions under which
    new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing
    values can be made, is needed. This document defines a framework for the documentation
    of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the provided
    guidance for the IANA Considerations is clear and addresses the various issues
    that are likely in the operation of a registry. This is the fourth edition of
    this document; it obsoletes RFC 8126.</p>"
