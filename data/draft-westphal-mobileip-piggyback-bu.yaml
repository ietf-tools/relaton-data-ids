abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents some simple analytical results with respect
    to the performance improvement brought by piggybacking binding updates (BUs).
    We see that the improvement in term of bandwidth is not significant unless the
    mobile terminal sending BUs moves very fast. We also see on the other hand that
    the improvement in term of jitter is quite significant in most situations.</p>"
