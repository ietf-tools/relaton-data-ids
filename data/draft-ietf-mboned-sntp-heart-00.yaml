abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)
    can be used to provide a multicast heartbeat. Given the current state of the art
    in multicast diagnostics, use of a heartbeat may prove a useful diagnostic tool
    for operators as well as for applications developers. Operators may use the heartbeat
    to alert themselves to losses of multicast connectivity in portions of the network.
    Applications developers may use the heartbeat to determine whether to enable multicast
    features or to default to unicast operation. While it is likely that better diagnostic
    methods will become available in the long term, given the current state of the
    art, SNTP may be usefully employed as a multicast hearbeat.</p>"
