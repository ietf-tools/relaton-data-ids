abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol,
    we have seen a number of transitions from one protocol or technology to another,
    throughout the protocol stack. Many protocols and technologies were not designed
    to enable smooth transition to alternatives or to easily deploy extensions, and
    thus some transitions, such as the introduction of IPv6, have been difficult.
    This document attempts to summarize some basic principles to enable future transitions,
    and also summarizes what makes for a good transition plan.</p>"
