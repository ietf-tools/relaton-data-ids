abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new route propagation and service discovery
    mechanism by proposing BGP extensions for mobile core network service routing.
    The proposed solution introduces a Service Route Address Family, hierarchical
    Network Identifier allocation, and path-aware routing mechanisms that enable scalable
    inter-domain service discovery while preserving compatibility with current 3GPP
    standards. These extensions provide the foundation for efficient service propagation,
    route aggregation, and loop-free routing in large-scale distributed mobile core
    deployments.</p>"
