abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Control Plane of the path-aware, inter-
    domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
    networks). One of the basic characteristics of SCION is that it gives path control
    to SCION- capable endpoints that can choose between multiple path options, enabling
    the optimization of network paths. The Control Plane is responsible for discovering
    these paths and making them available to the endpoints. The main goal of the SCION
    Control Plane is to create and manage path segments which can then be combined
    into forwarding paths to transmit packets in the data plane. This document discusses
    how path exploration is realized through beaconing and how path segments are created
    and registered. Each SCION Autonomous System (AS) can register segments according
    to its own policy and can specify which path properties and algorithm(s) to use
    in the selection procedure. The document also describes the path lookup process
    whereby endpoints obtain path segments - a fundamental building block for the
    construction of end-to-end paths.</p>"
