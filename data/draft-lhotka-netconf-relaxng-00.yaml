abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a schema for NETCONF RPC and protocol operations
    expressed in RELAX NG (compact syntax). The schema is modular and cleanly separates
    the server and client part of the NETCONF vocabulary and also the schema extensions
    provided by optional capabilities. The modular structure improves readability
    but also enables selecting certain modules and assembling them into a grammar
    that can be used for validation of NETCONF protocol data units.</p>"
