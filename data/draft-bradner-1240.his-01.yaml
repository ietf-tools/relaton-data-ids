abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 1240, "OSI connectionless transport services on top of UDP", was
    published as a Proposed Standard in June 1991 but at this time there do not seem
    to be any implementations which follow RFC 1240. In addition there is a growing
    concern over using UDP-based transport protocols in environments where congestion
    is a possibility This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
