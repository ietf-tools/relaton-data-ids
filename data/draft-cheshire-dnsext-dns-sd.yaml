- content: "<p>This document specifies how DNS resource records are named and structured
    to facilitate service discovery. Given a type of service that a client is looking
    for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this mechanism
    allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service,
    using standard DNS queries. This mechanism is referred to as DNS-based Service
    Discovery, or DNS-SD.</p>"
