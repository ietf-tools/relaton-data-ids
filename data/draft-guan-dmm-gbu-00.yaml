abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet of Things (IoT) has been booming with rapid increase of various
    wearable devices, vehicle embedded devices and so on, and providing the effective
    mobility management for these IoT devices becomes a challenge due to the different
    application scenarios as well as the limited energy and bandwidth. Lots of researchers
    have focused on this topic and proposed several solutions based on the combination
    of IoT features and traditional mobility management protocols, in which most of
    these schemes take the IoT devices as mobile networks and adopt the NEtwork MObility
    (NEMO) and its variants to provide the mobility support. However, these solutions
    are in face of the heavy signaling cost problem. Since IoT devices are generally
    combined to realize the complex functions, these devices may have the similar
    movement behaviors. This document, therefore specifies a PMIPv6-based group binding
    update method to reduce the singling cost and improve the scalability for these
    devices.</p>"
