abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire of
    differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the traffic
    steering service under limited network resources and maximize their benefits at
    the same time. This document lists some typical use cases for traffic steering
    services. This document does not attempt to enumerate all kinds of scenarios,
    but rather it describes several key features of these scenarios from which solutions
    may be constructed.</p>"
