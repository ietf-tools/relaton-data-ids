- content: "<p>The proposed path failover mechanism provides a seamless way to recover
    from path failures in Multipath QUIC. It allows the protocol to take advantage
    of multiple paths while maintaining reliability and security. The implementation
    and deployment of this mechanism should be done with careful consideration of
    security and performance.</p>"
