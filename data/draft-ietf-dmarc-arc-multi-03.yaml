abstract:
- content: "<p>The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol creates a mechanism
    whereby a series of handlers of an email message can conduct authentication of
    the email message as it passes among them on the way to its destination. Initial
    development of ARC has been done with a single allowed signing algorithm, but
    parallel work in the DCRUP working group (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dcrup/about/)
    is expanding the supported algorithms. This specification defines how to extend
    ARC for multiple signing algorithms.</p>"
