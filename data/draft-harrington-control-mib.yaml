abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and defines a portion of the Management Information
    Base (MIB) for use with the Simple Network Management Protocol version 2. In particular,
    it defines objects for specifying access to data and protocol operations for specified
    security entities. The method of applying access control is dependent on the security
    model in use, but the specification of access policy is security model independent.</p>"
