abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method to discover a secondary X.509 certificate
    associated with an X.509 certificate to enable efficient multi-certificate handling
    in protocols. The objective is threefold: to enhance cryptographic agility, improve
    operational availability, and accommodate multi-key/certificate usage. The proposed
    method aims to maximize compatibility with existing systems and is designed to
    be legacy-friendly, making it suitable for environments with a mix of legacy and
    new implementations. It includes mechanisms to provide information about the target
    certificate's signature algorithm, public key algorithm and the location of the
    secondary X.509 certificate, empowering relying parties to make informed decisions
    on whether or not to fetch the secondary certificate. The primary motivation for
    this method is to address the limitations of traditional certificate management
    approaches, which often lack flexibility, scalability, and seamless update capabilities.
    By leveraging this mechanism, subscribers can achieve cryptographic agility by
    facilitating the transition between different algorithms or X.509 certificate
    types. Operational redundancy is enhanced by enabling the use of backup certificates
    and minimizing the impact of primary certificate expiration or CA infrastructure
    failures. The approach ensures backward compatibility with existing systems and
    leverages established mechanisms, such as the subjectInfoAccess extension, to
    enable seamless integration. It does not focus on identity assurance between the
    primary and secondary certificates, deferring such considerations to complementary
    mechanisms.</p>"
