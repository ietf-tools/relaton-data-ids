abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a method to carry authentication information over
    TLS between PANA Client (PaC) and PANA Authentication Agent (PAA). PANA over TLS
    uses existing TLS protocol over a reliable transport in order to perform authentication
    information exchange in a secure and reliable manner. The purpose of this document
    is not only to provide a mechanism for carrying the authentication parameters
    but also to address some outstanding issues such as, multiple access routers,
    reauthentication, security threats, etc.</p>"
