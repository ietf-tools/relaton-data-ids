abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic statistics form an important part of operations and maintenance
    data that are used to create demand matrices and for capacity planning in networks.
    Segment Routing (SR) is a source routing paradigm that uses stack of labels to
    represent a path. The SR path specific state is not stored in any other node in
    the network except the head-end node of the SR path. Traffic statistics specific
    to each SR path are an important component of the data which helps the controllers
    to lay out the SR paths in a way that optimizes the use of network resources.
    SR paths are inherently ECMP aware. As SR paths do not have state in the core
    of the network, it is not possible to collect the SR path traffic statistics accurately
    on each interface. This document describes an MPLS forwarding plane mechanism
    to identify the SR path to which a packet belongs and so facilitate accounting
    of traffic for MPLS SR paths. The mechanisms described in this document may also
    be applied to other MPLS paths (i.e., Label Switched Paths) and can be used to
    track traffic statistics in multipoint-to-point environments such as those where
    LDP is in use.</p>"
