abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING)
    architecture describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through
    an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm. A Segment Routed Path
    can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree
    (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE). Since the
    SR does not require signaling, the path maximum transmission unit (MTU) information
    for SR path is not available. This document specify the extension to PCE communication
    protocol (PCEP) to carry path (MTU) in the PCEP messages.</p>"
