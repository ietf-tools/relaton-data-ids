- content: "<p>Drawing from experiences with the TISDAG (Technical Infrastructure
    for Swedish Directory Access Gateways) project, this document outlines an approach
    to providing the necessary infrastructure for integrating such widely-scattered
    servers into a single service, rather than attempting to mandate a single protocol
    and schema set for all participating servers to use. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
