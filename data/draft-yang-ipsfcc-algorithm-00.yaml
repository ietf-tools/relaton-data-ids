abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, an algorithm for intrusion prevention systems based
    on fuzzy connectedness clustering was presented in order to measure the similarity.
    Fuzzy connectedness that was first applied in image segmentation was extended
    to clustering algorithm, and used as the similarity metric between objects to
    be clustered. By a little expert knowledge, starting with at least one seed data
    in each cluster, the similarity between each data in dataset and each seed data
    in each cluster was measured. According to the highest fuzzy connectedness of
    each data, clustering was finished. This algorithm was applied in intrusion prevention
    systems as a tool of detecting intrusion, overcoming some shortcomings of previous
    clustering algorithm.</p>"
