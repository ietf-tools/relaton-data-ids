abstract:
- content: "<p>The first step in creating a secure Internet is to build a model of
    the security requirements of the real world entities involved and how those real
    world entities act on the Internet through the agency of networked computers.
    This document presents a minimal model as a starting point for discussion. In
    this model: o The real world is composed of entities, each being: (a) an independent
    legal entity; or (b) a sub-entity of another entity (creating a multi-level hierarchy).
    o Running code is characterized by: (a) the entity that it acts on behalf of;
    and (b) the entity that controls the environment in which the code executes. o
    The environment can run on a bare unmanaged machine or it can be a virtual environment
    which is code controlled by another entity. o We can model communication between
    machines as a sequence of requests and assertions. The security question becomes:
    which requests to honour. What is known about the provenance of the requests and
    assertions is typically crucial. o Security can take place at different network
    layers and security information must be passed between the layers along with the
    data.</p>"
