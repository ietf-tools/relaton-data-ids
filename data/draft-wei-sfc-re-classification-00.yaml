abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to classify and
    steer a flow via some network service(s). Some traffic flows require re-classification
    to a new service chain. This may be, for example, the result of further analysis
    of initial packets, or detection of multiple types of media. This document discusses
    re-classification scenarios in SFC, and several deployment models for the re-classifier
    and relevant analysis are provided. The proposal will recommend some architectural
    constraints for the SFC design.</p>"
