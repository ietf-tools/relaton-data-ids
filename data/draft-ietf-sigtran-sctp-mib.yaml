abstract:
- content: "<p>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable transport
    protocol operating on top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It is
    designed to transport public switched telephone network (PSTN) signaling messages
    over the connectionless packet network, but is capable of broader applications.
    This memo defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which describes
    the minimum set of objects needed to manage the implementation of the SCTP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
