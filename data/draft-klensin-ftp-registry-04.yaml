abstract:
- content: "<p>Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands,
    with the early ones summarized in RFC 959. RFC 2389 established a mechanism for
    specifying and negotiating FTP extensions. The number of extensions, both those
    supported by the mechanism and some that are not, continues to increase. An IANA
    registry of FTP Command and Feature names is established to reduce the likelihood
    of conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity. This specification establishes
    that registry. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
