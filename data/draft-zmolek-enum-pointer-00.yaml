abstract:
- content: "<p>Current notions of service field tags in ENUM NAPTR records would frame
    the service exposure problem as a tradeoff between the privacy and heft involved
    in revealing detailed service information on the one hand or the arbitrary constraint
    of such information on the other. This draft suggests an alternative approach
    that keeps NAPTR record size small, places service exposure policy and presence
    capabilities in the hands of the ENUM registrant where it belongs, and minimizes
    impact to the ENUM registrar and their respective DNS architecture.</p>"
