abstract:
- content: "<p>Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol. One
    thing which is missing from the dicussion is an evaluation of the scope of IKE,
    identifying which problems it should solve. Once this scoping is done, it becomes
    easier to specify the requirements for the protocol, as well as the protocol itself.
    Sections of this document discuss various scenarios that are considered important
    for IKE; this list needs to be refined by the WG.</p>"
