abstract:
- content: <p>There can be machine-to-machine (M2M) scenarios where server responses
    to client requests are redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no response
    path from the server to the client) may be desired to minimize resource consumption
    in constrained systems while updating many resources simultaneously or performing
    high-frequency updates. CoAP already provides Non-confirmable (NON) messages that
    are not acknowledged by the recipient. However, the request/response semantics
    still require the server to respond with a status code indicating "the result
    of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request", per RFC 7252. This specification
    introduces a CoAP option called 'No-Response'. Using this option, the client can
    explicitly express to the server its disinterest in all responses against the
    particular request. This option also provides granular control to enable expression
    of disinterest to a particular response class or a combination of response classes.
    The server MAY decide to suppress the response by not transmitting it back to
    the client according to the value of the No-Response option in the request. This
    option may be effective for both unicast and multicast requests. This document
    also discusses a few examples of applications that benefit from this option.</p>
