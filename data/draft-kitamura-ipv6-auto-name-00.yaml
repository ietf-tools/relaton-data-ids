abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses notion and actual mechanisms of "Corresponding
    Auto Names" for IPv6 Addresses. With this mechanism, all IPv6 addresses (even
    if they are link-local scoped addresses) can obtain their own Names, and it will
    be able to use Names anywhere instead of IPv6 Addresses. IPv6 address is too long
    and complicated to remember, and it is very nuisance thing to type a literal IPv6
    address manually as an argument of applications. Also, it is very difficult for
    human beings to tell which IPv6 address is set to which actual IPv6 node. In this
    sense, literal IPv6 address information can be called meaningless information
    for human beings. In order to solve above problems and to make the information
    meaningful, mechanisms called Corresponding Auto Names for IPv6 addresses is introduced.
    They will become gentle information for human beings. By applying a simple naming
    rule to the Auto Names (e.g., use the same name-prefix for IPv6 addresses that
    are set to the same interface (node)), this will contribute to help people to
    understand which IPv6 address / Name indicates which actual IPv6 node.</p>
