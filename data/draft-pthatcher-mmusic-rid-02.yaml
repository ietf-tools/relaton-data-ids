abstract:
- content: '<p>In this specification, we define a framework for identifying Source
    RTP Streams with the constraints on its payload format in the Session Description
    Protocol. This framework uses "rid" SDP attribute to: a) effectively identify
    the Source RTP Streams within a RTP Session, b) constrain their payload format
    parameters in a codec-agnostic way beyond what is provided with the regular Payload
    Types and c) enable unambiguous mapping between the Source RTP Streams to their
    media format specification in the SDP. Note-1: The name ''rid'' is not yet finalized.
    Please refer to Section 12 for more details on the naming.</p>'
