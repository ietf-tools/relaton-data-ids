abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for
    SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to determine the reachability
    path of requests to a target. A mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been
    defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated which result in media
    being looped back to the originator. This document describes a means of performing
    hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media- loopback mechanism, in
    order to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.</p>"
