abstract:
- content: "<p>To enable seamless L3 handover of a MN from one subnet to other, the
    MN or the AR is required to anticipate the identity of the target AR prior to
    initiation of the L3 handoff. To anticipate the identity of target AR, the L3
    is required to receive a notification from L2 about the appropriate identity of
    target AP as soon as the L2 handoff is detected. To further optimize the L3 handoff,
    L3 is also required to receive indications about Link Up and Link Down events
    as soon as such events are detected by L2. The Link Down event is detected by
    L2 as soon as the MN loses connection with current AP. Similarly, the Link Up
    event is detected as soon as the MN re-connects with new AP. Depending upon the
    nature of access technologies, some of the various triggers can be available at
    MN, AR or both.</p>"
