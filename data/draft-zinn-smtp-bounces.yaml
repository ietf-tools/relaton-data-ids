abstract:
- content: <p>Current SMTP RFCs are interpreted by some as requiring non delivery
    notice to be sent, even when the "reverse-path" is forged by a virus. Some ISPs
    are now dropping such messages silently. Silent dropping of such messages should
    be encouraged under certain circumstances, however this should not be taken as
    a permananet carte-blanch to silently discard any message that one does not like.</p>
