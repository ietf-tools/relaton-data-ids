abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to OSPF to support the distributed
    computation of Maximally Redundant Trees (MRT). Some example uses of the MRTs
    include IP/LDP Fast-Reroute and global protection or live- live for multicast
    traffic. The extensions indicate what MRT profile(s) each router supports. Different
    MRT profiles can be defined to support different uses and to allow transitioning
    of capabilities. An extension is introduced to flood MRT-Ineligible links, due
    to administrative policy. The need for a mechanism to allow routers to advertise
    a worst-case FIB compute/install time is well understood for controlling convergence.
    This specification introduces the Controlled Convergence TLV to be carried in
    the Router Information LSA.</p>"
