abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-tenant data centers and clouds provide computing, storage and
    network resources dedicated per tenant. The current focus in the evolution of
    multi-tenant data-center and cloud networks is to (1) support a large number of
    tenants with a large number of communicating systems, (2) provide isolation among
    tenant virtual networks, (3) provide for efficient network utilization, and (4)
    support virtual machine mobility and network elasticity that match compute and
    storage elasticity. The NVo3 work effort is initially targeted to identify the
    requirements for large multi-tenant data centers, and develop a framework architecture
    that addresses those requirements. In addition, it is targeted to identify existing
    or evolving solutions used in cloud networking, their applicability to NVo3, and
    any gaps that they may have in addressing the NVo3 requirements. This document
    describes the applicability of existing work in various IETF Working Groups (e.g.,
    RFCs and drafts developed or evolving in IETF L2VPN and L3VPN Working Groups)
    to cloud networking and NVo3, as well as the gaps and problems that need to be
    further addressed.</p>"
