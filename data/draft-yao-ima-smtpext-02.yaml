abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) includes two parts, the local
    part and the domain part. The way email addresses are used by protocols are different
    from the way domain names are used. The most critical difference is that emails
    are delivered through a chain of peering clients and servers while domain names
    are resolved by name servers by looking up their own tables. In addition to this,
    email transport protocols SMTP and ESMTP provide a negotiation mechanism through
    which clients can make decisions for further processing. So IMA is different from
    the internationalized domain name (IDN). IMA can be solved by exploiting the negotiation
    mechanism while IDN can not use the negotiation mechanism. So IMA should be solved
    in the mail transport-level using the negotiation mechanism, which is an architecturally
    desirable approach. This document specifies the use of SMTP extension for IMA
    delivery. It also mentions the backward compatible mechanism for downgrade procedure,
    as specified in an associated specification. The protocol proposed here is MTA-level
    solution which is feasible, architecturally more elegant, and not as difficult
    to deploy in relevant communities.</p>"
