abstract:
- content: "<p>The Web Real-time Communications (WebRTC) provides the communication
    capabilities for real-time and peer-to-peer web-based applications. This draft
    is meant to provide the structure for an idea of how WebRTC works on the desktop
    cloud solution and gives guidance on how to overcome the issues and challenges
    in implementing and deploying. Also as discussed in the mail archive before, the
    use case for desktop cloud or remote desktop sharing is suggested to be delayed
    after WebRTC version 1. So this draft is very early and far from done.</p>"
