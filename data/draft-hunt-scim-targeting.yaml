abstract:
- content: "<p>The core SCIM 1.0 specification is intended to provide updates to a
    single cloud-based application. This extension specifies an extended API definition
    which allows a single SCIM endpoint to support updates to multiple cloud-based
    applications. These extensions enable network relationships such as proxy updates,
    and hub-to-hub-to-spoke relationships in addition to the hub-spoke relationship
    defined in the core SCIM 1.0 specification.</p>"
