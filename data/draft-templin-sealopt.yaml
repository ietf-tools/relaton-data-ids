abstract:
- content: "<p>The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) provides a
    mid-layer header designed for the encapsulation of an inner network layer packet
    within outer network layer headers. SEAL also supports a transport mode of operation,
    where the inner payload corresponds to an ordinary transport layer payload. However,
    SEAL can also provide benefit when used as an IPv6 destination option that contains
    a digital signature inserted by the source. The source can thereafter use the
    signature to verify that any ICMPv6 messages received actually came from a router
    on the path, while destinations that share a secret key with the source can verify
    the signature to ensure data origin authentication.</p>"
