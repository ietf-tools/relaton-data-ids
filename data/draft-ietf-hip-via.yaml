abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies two extensions to the Host Identity Protocol
    (HIP) to implement multi-hop routing. The first extension allows implementing
    source routing in HIP. That is, a node sending a HIP packet can define a set of
    nodes that the HIP packet should traverse. The second extension allows a HIP packet
    to carry and record the list of nodes that forwarded it. This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
