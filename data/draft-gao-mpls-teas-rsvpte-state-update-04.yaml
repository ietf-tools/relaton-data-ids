abstract:
- content: '<p>RSVP-TE has the following advantages: source routing capability, and
    the ability to reserve resources hop by hop along the LSP path. The two advantages
    are used by Deterministic Networking (DetNet) to provide DetNet Quality of Service
    (QoS) in a fully distributed control plane utilizing dynamic signaling protocols
    or in a Combined Control Plane (partly centralized, partly distributed). RSVP
    takes a "soft state" approach to manage the reservation state in routers and hosts.
    The use of ''Refresh messages'' to cover many possible failures has resulted in
    a number of operational problems. One problem relates to scaling, another relates
    to the reliability and latency of RSVP Signaling. This document describes a number
    of mechanisms that can be used to reduce processing overhead requirements of refresh
    messages. These extension present no backwards compatibility issues.</p>'
