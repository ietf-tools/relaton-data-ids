abstract:
- content: "<p>In a transport network scenario, Data Plane connections controlled
    by either a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control Plane (Soft
    Permanent Connections - SPC) or a Management System (Permanent Connections - PC)
    may independently coexist. The ability of transforming an existing PC into an
    SPC and vice versa -- without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried
    over it -- is a requirement. The requirements for the conversion between permanent
    connections and switched connections in a GMPLS Network are defined in RFC 5493.
    This memo describes an extension to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling that enables the transfer of connection ownership
    between the Management and the Control Planes. Such a transfer is referred to
    as a Handover. This document defines all Handover-related procedures. This includes
    the handling of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state.
    A basic premise of the extension is that the Handover procedures must never impact
    an already established Data Plane connection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
