abstract:
- content: '<p>There can be typical M2M scenarios where responses from the data sink
    to the data source against request/ notification from the source might be considered
    redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no reverse path from the sink
    to the source) may be desired while updating resources or notifying about the
    updated status of a resource in constrained systems looking for maximized throughput
    with minimized resource consumption. CoAP already provides a non-confirmable (NON)
    mode of exchange where The receiving end-point does not respond with ACK. However,
    the receiving end-point responds the sender with a status code indicating "the
    result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request". This draft introduces
    a header option: ''No-Resp'' to suppress responses from the receiver and discusses
    exemplary use cases which motivated this proposition based on real experience.
    This option also provides granularity by allowing suppression of a particular
    class or a combination of classes of responses. This option is applicable for
    both request/ response as well as resource-observe mode and may be effective for
    both unicast and multicast scenarios.</p>'
