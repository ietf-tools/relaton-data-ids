abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the introduction of X.400(84), there has been work ongoing for
    defining mappings between MHS and RFC-822. The most recent work in this area is
    RFC-1327 [3], which focuses primarily on translation of envelope and headers.
    This document is complimentary to RFC-1327 as it focuses on translation of the
    message body. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
