abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism to use keying material derived from
    the extensible authentication protocol (EAP) to derive cryptographic keys for
    authentication of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). Keys are derived
    from the EAP extended master session key (EMSK) and are used in a new DHCP authentication
    option based on the DHCP delayed authentication option defined in RFC 3118.</p>"
