abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an end-to-end mechanism to guarantee bandwidth
    and delay into the Differentiated Services mechanism to constant rate traffic
    such as voice and video. The mechanism requires network routers to be able to
    serve packets according to three classes of priority. The needed call admission
    control is performed by an end- to-end signaling procedure that implicitly looks
    for the required bandwidth and seizes it, if available. Short delays are guaranteed
    by the regular structure of constant rate traffic. No entities other than source
    and destination are involved and multicast operation comes at no further cost,
    which makes the mechanism fully scalable and integrable into the existing Internet.</p>"
