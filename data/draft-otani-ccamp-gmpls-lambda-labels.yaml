abstract:
- content: <p>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a consequence
    new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed and is
    currently being deployed. However, RFC 3471 has defined that a wavelength label
    (section 3.2.1.1) "only has significance between two neighbors" and global wavelength
    continuity is not considered. In order to achieve interoperability in a network
    composed of next generation lambda switch-capable equipment, this document defines
    a standard lambda label format, being compliant with ITU-T G.694. Moreover some
    consideration on how to ensure lambda continuity with RSVP-TE is provided. This
    document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
    signaling. It defines the label format when Lambda Switching is requested in an
    all optical network.</p>
