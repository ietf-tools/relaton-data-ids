abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHCP Relay Agent Information Option (RFC 3046) conveys information
    between a DHCP relay agent and a DHCP server. This specification defines two mechanisms
    for securing the messages exchanged between a relay agent and a server. The first
    mechanism defines a new authentication suboption for the Relay Agent Information
    Option that supports source entity authentication and data integrity for relayed
    DHCP messages. The authentication suboption contains a cryptographic signature
    in a payload derived from the option used in DHCP Authentication (RFC 3118). The
    second mechanism uses IPsec (RFC 2041) to protect messages exchanged between relay
    agents and servers.</p>"
