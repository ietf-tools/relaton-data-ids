abstract:
- content: "<p>IPTV providers must serve content to their customers during the period
    of transition from IPv4 to IPv6. During this period, the content provider may
    support only one version of IP while the customer's receiver device supports only
    the other. Likewise, the network between the provider and its customer may include
    segments supporting only one version of IP or another. This document provides
    an overview of the multicast transition problem. It also provides an overview
    of the solution space. The solution space is characterized by an adaptation function
    (AF) that provides an interface between IPv4 and IPv6 multicast domains. This
    document also discusses various multicast use cases which may occur during IPv6
    transitioning. These use cases motivate the solution space discussion and the
    requirements that appear at the end.</p>"
