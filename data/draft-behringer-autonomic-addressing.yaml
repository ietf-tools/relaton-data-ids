abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generic IPv6 addressing scheme which is suitable
    for autonomic nodes, where node addressing must not depend on a centrally managed
    scheme. It assumes a unique domain name and device name, and automatically derives
    a unique IPv6 address from those. The scheme allows for a flat address hierarchy
    as well as optionally, when required, the definition of zones which are aggregatable.
    This document is for discussion right now; the final addressing scheme should
    probably move into [I-D.behringer-anima-reference-model].</p>"
