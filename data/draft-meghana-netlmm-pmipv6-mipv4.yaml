abstract:
- content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol provides mobility management for an
    IPv4-only mobile nodes. It provides network-based mobility management and session
    continuity for the IPv4 mobile node as long as the mobile node is attached to
    the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. The mobile node that attaches to the Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 domain, may also implement Mobile IPv4. When a Mobile IPv4-capable mobile
    node attaches to a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, there are some interactions between
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 that need to be studied. This document looks
    at a particular scenario where the mobile node transitions between using Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4.</p>"
