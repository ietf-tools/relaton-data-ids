abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwarding packets
    that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets, called labels, to determine
    packet nexthops ([MPLS-FRAMEWORK], [MPLS-ARCH]). A fundamental concept in MPLS
    is that two Label Switching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels
    used to forward traffic between and through them. This common understanding is
    achieved by using a set of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by
    which one LSR informs another of label bindings it has made. This document describes
    the applicability of a set of such procedures called LDP (for Label Distribution
    Protocol) [LDP].</p>"
