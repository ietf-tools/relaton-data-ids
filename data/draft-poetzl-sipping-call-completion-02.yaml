abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) for the call completion services provided in the context of ETSI Next Generation
    Networks (NGN). Therefore this document describes a SIP event package that enables
    subscribing to and managing call completion queues. Furthermore this document
    extends the usage of the Allows-events header field to 180 Ringing and 486 Busy
    responses, and specifies an indication used for the prioritization of call-completion
    calls.</p>"
