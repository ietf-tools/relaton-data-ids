abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a methodology for isolating the location and
    reasons for IPv6 Extension Headers blockage in a network where the operator has
    access to install products and run diagnostic tests on both the client and server.
    Neither the client nor the server should be behind a CDN or on a Cloud infrastructure.
    This document is a part of the Deep Dive into EH Testing set of documents.</p>"
