abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different attacks have been reported as part of revelations associated
    with pervasive surveillance. Some of the reported attacks involved compromising
    smart cards, such as attacking SIM card manufacturers and operators in an effort
    to compromise shared secrets stored on these cards. Since the publication of those
    reports, manufacturing and provisioning processes have gained much scrutiny and
    have improved. However, the danger of resourceful attackers for these systems
    is still a concern. This specification is an optional extension to the EAP-AKA'
    authentication method which was defined in RFC 5448. The extension provides Perfect
    Forward Secrecy for the session key generated as a part of the authentication
    run in EAP-AKA'. This prevents an attacker who has gained access to the long-term
    pre-shared secret in a SIM card from merely passively eavesdropping the EAP-AKA'
    exchanges and deriving associated session keys, forcing attackers to use active
    attacks instead.</p>"
