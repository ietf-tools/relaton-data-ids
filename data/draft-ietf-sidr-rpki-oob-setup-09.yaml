abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of
    the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provisioning and publication protocols
    between two parties. The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages,
    which can be passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable means which provides
    acceptable data integrity and authentication. This setup protocol is not part
    of the provisioning or publication protocol; rather, it is intended to simplify
    configuration of these protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging keying
    material used to authenticate those relationships.</p>"
