abstract:
- content: "<p>The US-CERT alert (TA04-111A) shows that the well-known weakness in
    TCP's segment acceptance test is easier to exploit than previously thought. While
    there are already mechanisms, such as RFC 2385 for BGP and IPSEC, to defend against
    this kind of attack, we propose a light weight method making use of TCP timestamp
    (RFC 1323) option as an alternative.</p>"
