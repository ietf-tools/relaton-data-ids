abstract:
- content: <p>Many protocols benefit from "pluggable" authentication choice as a result
    of SASL authentication. In the Session Initiation Protocol, the independent branch
    of HTTP Authentication has been elected. Recent progress has been made in bringing
    SASL to HTTP, but SIP has its own special considerations and needs its own embedding
    to gain the flexibility of SASL.</p>
