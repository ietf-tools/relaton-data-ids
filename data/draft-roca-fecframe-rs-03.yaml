abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two fully-specified simple FEC schemes for
    Reed-Solomon codes that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined
    by the FECFRAME framework. Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance
    Separable (MDS) codes which means they offer optimal protection against packet
    erasures. They are also systematic codes, which means that the source symbols
    are part of the encoding symbols. The price to pay is a limit on the maximum source
    block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity
    higher than that of LDPC codes for instance. The first scheme is for Reed-Solomon
    codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m &lt;= 16 and arbitrary packet flows. The second
    scheme is similar to the first scheme, with the exception that it is restricted
    to a single sequenced flow.</p>"
