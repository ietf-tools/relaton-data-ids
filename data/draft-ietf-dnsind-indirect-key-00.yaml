abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC 2535] defines a means for storing cryptographic public keys in
    the Domain Name System. An additional code point is defined for the algorithm
    field of the KEY resource record (RR) to indicate that the key is not stored in
    the KEY RR but is pointed to by the KEY RR. Encodings to indicate different types
    of key and pointer formats are specified. [This draft is moved from the DNSSEC
    WG as part of that WG's merger into me DNSIND WG. It would have been draft-ietf-dnssec-indirect-
    key-02.txt in the DNSSEC WG.]</p>"
