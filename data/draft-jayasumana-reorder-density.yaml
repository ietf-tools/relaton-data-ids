abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents two improved metrics for packet reordering,
    namely, Reorder Density (RD) and Reorder Buffer-occupancy Density (RBD). A threshold
    is used to clearly define when a packet is considered lost, to bound computational
    complexity at O(N), and to keep the memory requirement for evaluation independent
    of N, where N is the length of the packet sequence. RD is a comprehensive metric
    that captures the characteristics of reordering, while RBD evaluates the sequences
    from the point of view of recovery from reordering. These metrics are simple to
    compute yet comprehensive in their characterization of packet reordering. The
    measures are robust and orthogonal to packet loss and duplication. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
