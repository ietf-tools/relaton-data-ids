- content: "<p>This memo describes the design principles for the Blocks eXtensible
    eXchange Protocol[35] (BXXP). BXXP is a generic application protocol framework
    for connection-oriented, asynchronous request-response interactions. BXXP permits
    multiplexing of independent request/response streams over a single transport connection,
    supporting both textual and binary messages. To subscribe to the Blocks discussion
    list, send e-mail[36]; there is also a developers' site[37].</p>"
