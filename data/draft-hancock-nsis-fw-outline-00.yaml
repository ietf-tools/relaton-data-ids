abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next-Steps-in-Signalling (NSIS) working group of the IETF is considering
    the requirements for QoS signalling protocols [2]. One element of this, and follow
    up work, is to develop a framework within which existing and proposed protocols
    can be analysed, and which captures how QoS signalling protocols should interact,
    both with each other and with other components of the Internet, such as routing
    protocols or AAA mechanisms. Because of this aspect of interactions, the scope
    of an NSIS framework is necessarily broader than the scope of any new NSIS protocol.
    Previous work suggests that a complete QoS signalling framework is a major undertaking.
    This Internet Draft outlines the principal components of such a framework and
    their interrelationships. It could be used as a starting point for more detailed
    investigation of individual components. It could also be used to refine the scope
    of NSIS more precisely, both in terms of what functions are to be considered and
    how many variant approaches are relevant.</p>"
