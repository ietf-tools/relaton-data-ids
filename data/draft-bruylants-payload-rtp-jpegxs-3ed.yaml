abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
    format to be used for transporting video encoded with JPEG XS (ISO/ IEC 21122).
    JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding system. Compared to an uncompressed
    video use case, it allows higher resolutions and video frame rates while offering
    visually lossless quality, reduced power consumption, and encoding-decoding latency
    confined to a fraction of a video frame. This document is a necessary revision
    of [RFC9134] to add support for new features introduced by the 3rd edition of
    JPEG XS. It obsoletes [RFC9134] but the revised payload format is designed such
    that existing compliant implementations of [RFC9134] remain valid to the updated
    payload format. In addition, this document integrates the errata of [RFC9134]
    and provides improvements and clarifications to the text where applicable.</p>"
