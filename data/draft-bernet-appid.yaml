abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP [RFC 2205] signaling messages typically include policy data objects,
    which in turn contain policy elements. Policy elements may describe user and/or
    application information, which may be used by RSVP aware network elements to apply
    appropriate policy decisions to a traffic flow. This informational draft details
    the usage of policy elements that provide application information.</p>"
