abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a syntax for encoding DNS Resource Records in XML,
    and a schema to define that syntax written in XML Schema. It can be used to represent
    all DNS RDATA. This can be used by diverse applications as a common format. DNS
    Resource Records are represented as XML elements with the name of the element
    taken from the mnemonic used to represent the DNS Resource Record in presentation
    format. The RDATA is represented as XML attributes or content of the element.
    The attribute names are taken from the RDATA field names specified in the normative
    RFC.</p>"
