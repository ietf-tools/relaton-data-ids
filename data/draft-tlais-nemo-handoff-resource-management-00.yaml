abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-homed networks based on IPv6 form an important architecture within
    the NEMO (NEtwork MObility) configurations. Mainly in these networks the Mobile
    Router (MR) can appear in the neighbourhood of several Access Routers (ARs). In
    this case, MR has several egress interfaces and can detect several ARs simultaneously.
    This draft introduces a protocol that achieves handoff and resource management
    in a NEMO network in the case of multi-homed MR. We called this protocol an HRMMN
    protocol (Handoff and Resource Management for Multi-homed Networks). We introduce
    into the NEMO architecture an intelligent control entity called Access Router
    Controller (ARC). Based on traffic information transmitted through several ARs
    under the control of specific ARC, this latter is responsible of taking decisions
    about handoff, resource management and maintain of multiple bidirectional tunnels.</p>"
