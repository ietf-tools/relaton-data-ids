abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP, as originally specified, defines an authentication extension
    (the Mobile-Foreign Authentication extension) by which a mobile node can authenticate
    itself to a foreign agent. Unfortunately, that extension does not provide the
    foreign agent any direct guarantee that the protocol is protected from replays
    and does not allow for the use of existing techniques (such as Challenge Handshake
    Authentication Protocol (CHAP)) for authenticating portable computer devices.
    In this specification, we define extensions for the Mobile IP Agent Advertisements
    and the Registration Request that allow a foreign agent to use a challenge/response
    mechanism to authenticate the mobile node. Furthermore, this document updates
    RFC 3344 by including a new authentication extension called the Mobile-Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Authentication extension. This new extension
    is provided so that a mobile node can supply credentials for authorization, using
    commonly available AAA infrastructure elements. This authorization-enabling extension
    MAY co-exist in the same Registration Request with authentication extensions defined
    for Mobile IP Registration by RFC 3344. This document obsoletes RFC 3012. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
