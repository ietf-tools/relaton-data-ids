abstract:
- content: "<p>Facsimile (Fax) has a long tradition of being a telephony application
    from one terminal device to another, where the terminal device consists of a paper
    input device (scanner), a paper output device (printer), and a limited amount
    of processing power. The transmission of data end-to-end is accompanied by negotiation
    (to ensure that the scanned data can be rendered at the recipient) and confirmation
    of delivery (to give the sender assurance that the final data has been received
    and processed.) Over time, facsimile has been extended to allow for PCs connected
    running software to send and receive fax, to send data other than paper images,
    as well as many extensions to the basic image model, e.g., recent ITU fax standards
    for color fax. Other delivery extensions have included sub-addressing (additional
    signals after the call is established to facilitate automated routing of faxes
    to desktops or mailboxes), and enhanced features such as fax-back, polling, and
    even the transfer of binary files. Many mechanisms for sending fax documents over
    the Internet have been demonstrated and deployed and are currently in use. This
    document summarizes the requirements for Internet Fax as discussed in the IETF
    Internet Fax working group. It is an attempt to establish a baseline of agreed-to
    requirements against which any proposal for Internet Fax can be judged. This document
    encompasses the requirements for both 'real-time' fax as well as 'store and forward'
    fax (both terms defined in Section 2).</p>"
