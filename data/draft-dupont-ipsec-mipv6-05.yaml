abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec specifications [1-6] do not work well with any mobility device
    based on addresses [7]. Mobile IPv6 interaction with IPsec is still far from being
    well achieved. This is mainly due to bad interpretations of IPsec specifications.
    HIP (Host Identity Payload) [9] should change this regrettable situation. This
    document specifies some points where improvements can be made in many current
    implementations, on the way of making IPsec more suitable for Mobile IPv6.</p>"
