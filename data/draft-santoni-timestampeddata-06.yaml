abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an envelope that can be used to bind a file
    (not necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) with one or more
    time-stamp tokens obtained for that file, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning
    defined in RFC 3161 or its successors. Additional types of temporal evidence are
    also allowed. The proposed envelope is based on the Cryptographic Message Syntax
    as defined in RFC 5652. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>
