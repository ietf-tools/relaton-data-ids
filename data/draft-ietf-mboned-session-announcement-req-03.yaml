abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [2] was used to announce information
    for all available IP multicast sessions to the prospective receiver in an experimental
    network. It is easy to use, but not scalable and difficult to control the SAP
    message transmission in a wide area network. This document describes the issues
    and the requirements for multicast session announcement in the global Internet.</p>"
