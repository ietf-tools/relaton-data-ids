abstract:
- content: <p>This document will provide guidance on the design of methods to avoid
    congestion collapse and to react to incipient congestion. The present document
    is for discussion and comment by the IETF. If published, it plans to update or
    replace the Best Current Practice in BCP 41, which currently includes "Congestion
    Control Principles" provided in RFC2914. The current recommendations and requirements
    on this topic are distributed across many documents in the RFC series. This document
    therefore seeks to gather and consolidate these recommendations in an annexe.
    Based on these specifications, and Internet engineering experience, the document
    provides input to the design of new congestion control methods in protocols. This
    revision updates the source to a modern XML format, and is for discussion by tsvwg.</p>
