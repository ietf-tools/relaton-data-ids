abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new fast handover mechanism for Mobile IPv6 based
    IEEE 802.16e wireless networks. To implement the proposed mechanism, the IEEE
    802.16e neighbor advertisement message, named MOB_NBR-ADV, sent periodically by
    a serving base station (BS) is assumed to be defined newly by adding a specific
    subfield to the available reserved field. In addition, Router Information Request/Reply
    messages used in the network layer are defined newly. The proposed mechanism provides
    the faster acquisition of new access router's network information than the existing
    one, which might be advantageous for the low handover latency. In addition, the
    proposed mechanism might reduce amount of traffic in comparison with the existing
    one, which might be remarkable when there are many mobile nodes that are now connecting
    to the current access router (AR). Moreover, in the proposed mechanism, a mobile
    node can know whether it changes AR or BS, which can remove redundant traffic
    of the existing one.</p>"
