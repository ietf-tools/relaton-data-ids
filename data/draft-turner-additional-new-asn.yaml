abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) format, and many associated
    formats, are expressed using ASN.1. The current ASN.1 modules conform to the 1988
    version of ASN.1. This document updates some auxiliary ASN.1 modules to conform
    to the 2008 version of ASN.1; the 1988 ASN.1 modules remain the normative version.
    There are no bits- on-the-wire changes to any of the formats; this is simply a
    change to the syntax. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
