abstract:
- content: "<p>The AC-influenced DF Election (AC-DF) per [RFC8584] is too dependent
    on EAD/EVI routes. For example, when no failures occured on an ESI, that AC-DF
    procedures will give incorrect results if no EAD/EVI routes are advertised. But
    in some light-weighted EVPNs (i.e. PBB EVPNs), no EAD/EVI routes will be advertised
    at all. This draft proposes some new extensions to support AC-influenced DF Election
    without any EAD/EVI routes advertised in advance of any &lt;ESI, EVI&gt; failures.</p>"
