abstract:
- content: "<p>When using the Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] to bootstrap
    neighbour discovery for routing protocols there is no indication in the core DLEP
    protocol of the services of the router announced at a destination. This forces
    an implementation to either rely on a priori configuration or use heuristic probing
    of well-known ports to discover potential routing peers. This document defines
    an extension to DLEP to enable a router to advertise its active services to its
    peer modem, allowing a connected remote modem to announce the services of a router
    in a DLEP destination message to its peer, removing the need for service discovery
    between routing peers. The mechanism is designed to be sufficiently generic to
    allow the advertisement of network services beyond routing protocols, enabling
    the fast bootstrapping of other protocols such as messaging protocols or header
    compression.</p>"
