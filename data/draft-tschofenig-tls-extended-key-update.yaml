abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 specification offers a dedicated
    message to update cryptographic keys during the lifetime of an ongoing session.
    It allows the sender to perform an update of the key and initialization vector
    and may trigger the recipient, via the request_update field, to transmit a key
    update message in the reverse direction. In environments where sessions are long-lived,
    such as industrial IoT or telecommunication networks, this key update along is
    insufficient since perfect forward secrecy is not offered via this mechanism.
    Earlier versions of TLS allowed the two peers to perform renegotiation, which
    is a handshake that establishes new cryptographic parameters for an existing session.
    When a security vulnerability with the renegotiation mechanism was discovered,
    RFC 5746 was standardized as a fix. Renegotiation has, however, been removed from
    TLS 1.3. This specification defines an extended key update message that supports
    perfect forward secrecy using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</p>"
