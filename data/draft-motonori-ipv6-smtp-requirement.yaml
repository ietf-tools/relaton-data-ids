abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo lists operational requirements for IPv6 SMTP, and IPv6-capable
    MX DNS records. As we deploy IPv6 SMTP servers, it became apparent that we need
    certain configuration in IPv6-capable MX DNS record, for stable dual-stack (IPv4
    and IPv6) SMTP operations. The document tries to clarify the problems we have
    in transition period between IPv4 SMTP and IPv6 SMTP, and operational requirements
    for stable IPv4/v6 SMTP operation.</p>"
