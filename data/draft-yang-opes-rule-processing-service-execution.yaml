abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes specific architectural components of the Open
    Pluggable Edge Service (OPES) framework [1]. It defines the functionality of the
    OPES Administration Server and the OPES Service Engine and discusses the interaction
    with other OPES components. In particular, the document defines the operational
    flow for downloading rules and proxylets and the content flow for handling web
    requests and responses. A list of protocols and interfaces to be specified within
    the OPES framework is derived from the discussion.</p>"
