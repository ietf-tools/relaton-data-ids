abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the transport of SS7 signalling messages over
    IP in a way that utilizes the existing SS7 network (MTP and SCCP) layers to ensure
    'carrier class' service as expected by existing users of SS7. The transport of
    SS7 user information could use TCP connections or UDP. The SS7 signalling messages
    would include ISUP or SCCP or, if the network services are not needed, could include
    only TCAP. Work should begin to define the necessary adaptation layers to make
    these transport methods possible.</p>"
