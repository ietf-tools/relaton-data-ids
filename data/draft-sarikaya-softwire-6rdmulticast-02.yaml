abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies modifications required to 6rd so that both IPv6
    hosts can receive multicast data from IPv6 servers. In AMT based solution, AMT
    Gateway at the 6rd Customer Edge router uses AMT protocol to establish a tunnel
    interface with AMT Relay at the 6rd Border Relay and this tunnel is used to exchange
    MLD messages to establish multicast state at AMT Relay so that AMT Relay can tunnel
    IPv6 multicast data to IPv6 hosts connected to AMT Gateway. In 6rd Proxy Multicast
    solution, the protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router
    and then tunneling MLD messages to 6rd Border Relays where IPv6 multicast routing
    is supported. Multicast data received at 6rd Border Relay is tunneled to 6rd Customer
    Edge node and then delivered to the hosts. We show that IPv4 multicast and IGMP
    can be supported in a similar way.</p>"
