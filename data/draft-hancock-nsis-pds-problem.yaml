abstract:
- content: <p>The NSIS working group is currently developing a protocol suite for
    signalling which manipulates network state related to data flows. The protocol
    design incorporates the constraint that the signalling protocol will be processed
    on the nodes which also handle the data flows themselves ("path-coupled signalling").
    This document discusses a particular deployment mode for GIST (the common lower
    layer of the NSIS protocol suite) which relaxes this constraint, allowing the
    signalling and data paths to be partially decoupled, without sacrificing the integration
    with routing (e.g. sensitivity to route changes) which is intrinsically provided
    by the baseline path- coupled solution.</p>
