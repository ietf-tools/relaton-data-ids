abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet
    Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet Pseudowires (PWs) connected
    in accordance to the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated
    Ethernet service. This document augments the mapping of defect states between
    a PW and associated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [PW-OAM-MSG- MAP].
    In [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP], Ethernet OAM was not covered due to lack of Ethernet OAM
    maturity. However, since then, [Y.1731] and[802.1ag] have been completed, and
    this document specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet ACs and
    corresponding Ethernet PWs. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119.</p>
