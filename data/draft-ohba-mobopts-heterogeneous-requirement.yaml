abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problem statement and a set of issues and
    requirement specific to heterogeneous handover. Careful consideration needs to
    be given to these set of requirements while designing an optimized handover framework
    in a heterogeneous mobility scenario. These problem statements help determine
    the key functions that are responsible for delay during handover involving interdomain
    and heterogeneous access technology. Analysis of these issues and requirements
    can be applied to any existing mobility optimization framework.</p>"
