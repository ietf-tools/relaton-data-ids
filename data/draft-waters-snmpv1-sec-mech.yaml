abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the primary concerns with SNMPv1 is the lack of security. It
    is the purpose of this memo, Security Mechanisms for SNMPv1, to define a compatible
    method of adding authentication and privacy functions to the SNMPv1 framework.
    This memo is applicable to SNMPv1 and should be applicable to any other SNMP framework
    that uses similar community name based authentication and packet structure as
    SNMPv1.</p>"
