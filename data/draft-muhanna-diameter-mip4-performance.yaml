abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Mobile IPv4 deployments use RADIUS based MIPv4 user authentication
    and authorization. Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application [RFC4004] offers another method
    for MIPv4 authentication, authorization, and dynamic mobility security association
    allocation, e.g. MN-HA SA allocation. Some SDOs are considering the use of Diameter
    Mobile IPv4 Application to replace RADIUS based mechanism. However, these SDos
    use a link layer access authentication mechanism, e.g., using an EAP application,
    to derive the related MIP4 shared keys and security association. This document
    an overview of these respected architectures and their handling to MIP4 security
    association and keys derivation and distribution. It presents an analysis of the
    performance and impact of Diameter MIPv4 Application and RADIUS based solutions
    on the time the mobile node uses during the initial session setup. Some common
    MIPv4 scenarios which require the mobile node to retransmit its initial RRQ message
    have been identified and used. The set of assumptions and requirements used for
    this study has been clearly documented under section 5.</p>"
