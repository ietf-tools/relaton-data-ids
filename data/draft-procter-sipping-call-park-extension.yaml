abstract:
- content: "<p>Call Park and Call Retrieve are useful telephony services that are
    normally found on traditional PBXs. Implementing these services using the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) in the way described in the SIP Service Examples draft
    [1] is straightforward, but suffers from a useability problem when implemented
    using SIP User Agents resembling traditional business telephones. This draft discusses
    a simple extension to cater for this style of endpoint.</p>"
