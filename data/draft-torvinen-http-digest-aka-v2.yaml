abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Digest, as specified in RFC 2617, is known to be vulnerable to
    man-in-the-middle attacks if the client fails to authenticate the server in TLS,
    or if the same passwords are used for authentication in some other context without
    TLS. This is a general problem that exists not just with HTTP Digest, but also
    with other IETF protocols that use tunneled authentication. This document specifies
    version 2 of the HTTP Digest AKA algorithm (RFC 3310). This algorithm can be implemented
    in a way that it is resistant to the man-in-the-middle attack. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
