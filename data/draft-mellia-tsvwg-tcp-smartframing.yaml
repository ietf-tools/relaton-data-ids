abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document we present an enhancement to the TCP protocol, called
    TCP Smart Framing, or TCP-SF for short, that enables the Fast Retransmit/Recovery
    algorithm even when the congestion window is small, i.e., for short-lived flows,
    as most of the current Internet traffic is. Without modifying the TCP congestion
    control based on the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease paradigm, TCP-SF
    adopts a novel segmentation algorithm: while Classic TCP starts sending IW segments,
    a TCP-SF source is allowed to always send an initial window of 4 smaller segments,
    whose aggregate payload is equal to the connection's SMSS. This key idea can be
    implemented on top of any TCP flavor, from Tahoe to SACK, and requires modifications
    to the server behavior only.</p>"
