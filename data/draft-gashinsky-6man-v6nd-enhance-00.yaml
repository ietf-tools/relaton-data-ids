abstract:
- content: <p>In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to cover
    the actual number of machines on the subnet. In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet
    size is a /64, a number so large it covers trillions of addresses, the overwhelming
    number of which will be unassigned. Consequently, simplistic implementations of
    Neighbor Discovery can be vulnerable to denial of service attacks whereby they
    attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned addresses.
    Such denial of attacks can be launched intentionally (by an attacker), or result
    from legitimate operational tools that scan networks for inventory and other purposes.
    As a result of these vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to "join" a
    network, it may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing ipv6 transported
    flows may be interrupted. This document describes possible modifications to the
    traditional [RFC4861] neighbor discovery protocol for improving the resilience
    of the neighbor discovery process as well as an alternative method for maintaining
    ND caches.</p>
