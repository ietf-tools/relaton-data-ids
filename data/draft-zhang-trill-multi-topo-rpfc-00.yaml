abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-homing (RBridge Aggregation) is a promising approach to increase
    the reliability and access bandwidth of TRILL edge. Active- active forwarding
    in multi-homing allows multiple RBridges forward data frames for VLAN-x on a LAN
    link, which creates the possibility that multicast frames from a specific ingress
    RBridge may arrive at multiple incoming ports of a remote RBridge. This violates
    the Reverse Path Forwarding Check and multicast frames arrives at unexpected incoming
    ports will be discarded by this RBridge. This document makes use of multiple topology
    TRILL to solve this problem. Multiple topology TRILL provides physical separation
    of traffic from different members of aggregation. Multicast frames from aggregation
    members comply with the Reverse Path Forwarding Check per topology.</p>"
