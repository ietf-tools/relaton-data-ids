- content: "<p>This document describes a YANG data model for the Consumer-Facing Interface
    between an Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) User and Security Controller
    in an I2NSF system in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment. The
    data model is required for enabling different users of a given I2NSF system to
    define, manage, and monitor security policies for specific flows within an administrative
    domain.</p>"
