- content: "<p>This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice gateway
    that is a data plane function or function group for connecting/disconnecting and
    compose/decompose network slice subnets and providing network slices from end
    to end. The interworkings between management and control elements at the management
    and control planes with the gateway function for controlling and orchestrating
    end-to-end network slices are also presented in this document.</p>"
