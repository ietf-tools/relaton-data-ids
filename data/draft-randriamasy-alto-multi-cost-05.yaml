abstract:
- content: '<p>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer traffic
    Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an "Endpoint Cost Service"
    and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and thus incentives for application clients
    to connect to ISP preferred Endpoints. These services provide a view of the Network
    Provider (NP) topology to overlay clients. The present draft proposes a light
    way to extend the information provided by the current ALTO protocol. The purpose
    is to broaden the possibilities of the Application Clients in two ways. Firstly
    it proposes to include information on multiple cost types in a single ALTO transaction,
    providing a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the growing diversity
    of Content Networking Applications and to the network conditions. Secondly it
    proposes new cost types, that are an abstraction of time-sensitive network information
    as viewed by the Network Provider. All this also helps producing a more robust
    choice when multiple Endpoints must be selected. There are 2 parts in this draft:
    the first part initiates protocol extensions to support requests on multiple Cost
    Types in one single transaction. These first extensions also integrate the discussions
    within the ALTO Working Group. The second part proposes use cases motivating further
    definitions of additional CostTypes and Cost related attributes and capabilities.</p>'
