abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    to carry device information including device status and device profile. Device
    status refers to a set of dynamic attributes that describe device's operating
    state, availability, and location information etc. Device profile on the other
    hand refers to a limited set of static attributes including device type, name,
    format type of status information, and model etc. of a particular device. Device
    status information is particularly important to monitoring applications where
    a user agent would be able to monitor the status of a SIP device from a remote
    location and be notified of the changes of status.</p>"
