abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute
    in simplifying the implementation and configuration of routing policies between
    two or more VPN service providers. It is assumed that RFC2547 has been implemented
    to provide the VPN service although this is not a requirement of this application
    It shows how use of the community attribute along with the setting of a BGP metric
    can be used by customers to select the best gateway between one or more VPN service
    providers. This technique simplifies configuration and management at the provider
    level, and gives the customer the ability to control its own routing policy with
    respect to the selection of gateways between service providers.</p>"
