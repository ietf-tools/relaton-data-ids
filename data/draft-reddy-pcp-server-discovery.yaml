abstract:
- content: "<p>A multihomed network may have a PCP server on each router connecting
    to each upstream network, providing firewall or prefix translation functions to
    hosts in the network. In these networks, a PCP client needs to discover all of
    those PCP servers and then send PCP requests to them individually. This document
    proposes a multicast mechanism to discover PCP servers.</p>"
