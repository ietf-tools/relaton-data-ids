abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a number of mechanisms that reduce the refresh
    overhead of RSVP. The extensions can be used to reduce processing requirements
    of refresh messages, eliminate the state synchronization latency incurred when
    an RSVP message is lost and, when desired, suppress the generation of refresh
    messages. An extension to support detection of when an RSVP neighbor resets its
    state is also defined. These extension present no backwards compatibility issues.</p>"
