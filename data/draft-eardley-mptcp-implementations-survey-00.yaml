abstract:
- content: "<p>This survey gathers information from people who have implemented MPTCP,
    in particular to help progress the protocol from Experimental to Standards track.
    It is currently a draft version, so it should not yet be filled in -- instead,
    we would like feedback (1) from implementers, whether it needs modifying before
    you would be able (or prepared to) fill it in, (2) from the WG, suggestions to
    make it more useful.</p>"
