abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet
    in the real IP world. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy
    can be established in a large address space based on fragmenting it into some
    regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It shows how to make a transition
    from private IP to real IP without making significant changes with the existing
    network. It introduces VLSM tree routing protocol. It introduces another protocol
    for host identification with provider independent address. With the useful works
    done through IPv6, it provides all necessary inputs based on which a specification
    of IP with 64 bit address space may be emerged.</p>"
