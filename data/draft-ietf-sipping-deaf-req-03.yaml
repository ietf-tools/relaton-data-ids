abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to present a set of SIP user requirements that support
    communications for deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals. These
    user requirements address the current difficulties of deaf, hard of hearing and
    speech-impaired individuals in using communications facilities, while acknowledging
    the multi-functional potential of SIP-based communications. A number of issues
    related to these user requirements are further raised in this document. Also included
    are some real world scenarios and some technical requirements to show the robustness
    of these requirements on a concept-level.</p>"
