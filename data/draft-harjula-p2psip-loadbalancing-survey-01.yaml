abstract:
- content: "<p>Load balancing in structured (DHT-based) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems
    has been thoroughly studied during the past years. This draft provides a review
    of the existing and proposed load balancing mechanisms for structured P2P systems,
    categorizes them to four fundamental load balancing models, and introduces their
    main characteristics.</p>"
