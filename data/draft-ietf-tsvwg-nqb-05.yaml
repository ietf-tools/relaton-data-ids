abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non- Queue-Building
    Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB). The purpose of this NQB PHB is to provide a separate
    queue that enables low latency and, when possible, low loss for application-limited
    traffic flows that would ordinarily share a queue with capacity-seeking traffic.
    This PHB is implemented without prioritization and without rate policing, making
    it suitable for environments where the use of either these features may be restricted.
    The NQB PHB has been developed primarily for use by access network segments, where
    queuing delays and queuing loss caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested,
    but its use is not limited to such segments. In particular, applications to cable
    broadband links and mobile network radio and core segments are discussed. This
    document defines a standard Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to identify
    Non-Queue-Building flows.</p>"
