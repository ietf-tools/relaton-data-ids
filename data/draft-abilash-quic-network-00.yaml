abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC aims to improve performance by multiplexing streams and various
    other enhancements [I-D.ietf-quic-transport]. QUIC performs better than existing
    transport protocols in most cases. However, its performance suffers compared to
    HTTP under very high bandwidth when large amounts of data needs to be downloaded
    [MEG2016]. This is because QUIC is an end to end protocol and provides no means
    for the intermediate network elements to contribute to QUIC improvements. This
    draft proposes a change to the QUIC protocol header that will allow session aware
    routers and other middleboxes to prioritize streams in QUIC packets, divert high
    priority streams to low loss paths, and adjust packet pacing on a per stream basis.
    This opens the door to many possible future in-network enhancements.</p>"
