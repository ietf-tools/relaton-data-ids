abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents requirements in several diverse industries to
    establish multi-hop paths for characterized flows with deterministic properties.
    In this context deterministic implies that streams can be established which provide
    guaranteed bandwidth and latency which can be established from either a Layer
    2 or Layer 3 (IP) interface, and which can co-exist on an IP network with best-effort
    traffic. Additional requirements include optional redundant paths, very high reliability
    paths, time synchronization, and clock distribution. Industries considered include
    wireless for industrial applications, professional audio, electrical utilities,
    building automation systems, radio/mobile access networks, automotive, and gaming.
    For each case, this document will identify the application, identify representative
    solutions used today, and what new uses an IETF DetNet solution may enable.</p>"
