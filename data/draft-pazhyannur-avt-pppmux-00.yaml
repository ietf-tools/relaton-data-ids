abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a scheme to increase the capacity of low-speed
    transmission links, T-1/E-1 or smaller, to transport low-bit rate voice applications
    over PPP. Given the relatively small payload size of the voice packets (average
    of 8 bytes for certain cellular networks) protocol overheads due to PPP, IP, UDP,
    and RTP are significant in determining the link capacity. The scheme proposed
    here is to multiplex compressed RTP/UDP packets into a single PPP frame. As a
    result, the PPP overhead (5-7 bytes) is distributed over multiple compressed RTP/UDP
    packets.</p>"
