abstract:
- content: "<p>Communication networks need to support a wide range of applications
    with diverse service quality requirements. The current widespread use of best-effort
    communication also suggests that the overhead for establishing communication both
    in processing and latency needs to be kept at a minimum. With ATM signaling, every
    flow, including a best-effort flow, suffers the overhead of end-to-end connection
    establishment. ATM signaling complexity is further exacerbated by having variable
    length messages with a large number of information elements using a very flexible
    encoding, sent on a single control channel. The inclusion of QoS processing and
    connectivity in the initial setup of a connection requires sequential hop-by-hop
    processing. Variable length messages involves both a single point of resequencing
    as well as relatively slow, software based processing. In recognition of these
    shortcomings, the MPLS working group has opted to use topology driven label distribution
    as its default label distribution mechanism, while at the same time acknowledging
    the possible need for on-demand label distribution. We see these different approaches
    as points on a range of solutions and we do not wish to open a debate concerning
    the relative merits of each approach. However, we believe that if there is a need
    for on-demand label distribution, then there is a need to do this very efficiently.
    In this light we have decided to bring to the MPLS working group our architecture
    for lightweight signaling. While in its current form it is applicable to an ATM
    environment, we believe that it represent a step forward in the evolution of signaling
    for high speed networks. It holds the promise of processing signaling in hardware,
    thereby enabling substantial speed up of connection setup, so as to meet the needs
    of contemporary applications. Our proposed lightweight architecture f</p>"
