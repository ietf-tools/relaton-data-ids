abstract:
- content: "<p>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have
    to support one of the various transition methods that have been or are currently
    being defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6. Work is currently in progress
    to enumerate the information that needs to be provisioned on a customer edge router
    to support a list of transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with
    a view to defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between
    these techniques. To the extent that the provisioning is done dynamically, AAA
    support is needed to provide the information to the network server responsible
    for passing the information to the customer equipment. This document specifies
    Diameter attribute-value pairs to be used for that purpose.</p>"
