abstract:
- content: "<p>Network sustainability is a key issue facing the industry. Networks
    consume significant amounts of power at a time when the cost of power is rising
    and sensitivity about sustainability is very high. As an industry, we need to
    find ways to optimize the power efficiency of our networks both at a micro and
    macro level. We have observed that traffic levels fluctuate and when traffic ebbs
    there is much more capacity than is needed. Powering off portions of network elements
    could save a significant amount of power, but to scale and be practical, this
    must be automated. The natural mechanism for enabling automation would be a Yet
    Another Next Generation (YANG) interface, so this document proposes a YANG model
    for power management.</p>"
