abstract:
- content: "<p>Kerberos[RFC1510] is a protocol for authenticating parties communicating
    over insecure networks. Firewalling is a technique for achieving an illusion of
    security by putting restrictions on what kinds of packets and how these are sent
    between the internal (so called ''secure'') network and the global (or ''insecure'')
    Internet.</p>"
