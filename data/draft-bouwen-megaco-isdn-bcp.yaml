abstract:
- content: "<p>A Media Gateway with ISDN terminations will use both Megaco [1] and
    Sigtran protocols for communication with the Media Gateway Controller. In an ISDN
    Access Gateway the media carrying B-channels are controlled by the Media Gateway
    Controller using Megaco, while the User-to-Network signalling running over the
    D-channels will be relayed to the Media Gateway Controller using Sigtran protocols
    (IUA [3] over SCTP [2]). At the moment, in the absence of appropriate specifications,
    the Megaco and Sigtran protocols may interact in different ways in the Access
    Gateway, leaving room for non-interoperable solutions. This draft proposes a set
    of guidelines for the Megaco-Sigtran interworking, documenting a best current
    practice for ISDN Access Gateways.</p>"
