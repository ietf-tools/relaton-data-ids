abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the new SIP INFO method and a mechanism for defining,
    negotiating and exchanging Info Packages that use the INFO method. Applications
    that need to exchange session-related information within a SIP INVITE-created
    dialog, also known as application level information, use these INFO requests.
    This draft addresses issues and open items from RFC 2976 and replaces it. Conventions
    Used in this Document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. The terminology in this
    document conforms to the Internet Security Glossary [RFC4949]. Be mindful of the
    terms User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC). This document strictly
    follows RFC 3261 [RFC3261]. The UAC issues a SIP request and the UAS responds.
    This terminology may be confusing when one combines the INFO case with the INVITE
    case. For an INVITE, the initiator of the session is the UAC and the target of
    the session is the UAS. However, it is possible for the target UA of the session,
    the UAS of the INVITE transaction, to send an INFO to the initiating UA of the
    session, the UAC of the INVITE transaction. From the perspective of the INFO,
    the target UA of the session (INVITE UAS) is, in fact, the UAC (sender) of the
    INFO request. Likewise, from the perspective of the INFO, the initiating UA of
    the session (INVITE UAC) is the UAS (recipient) of the INFO request. Since this
    document strictly follows RFC 3261, we refer to the UA that issues the INVITE
    as the "initiating UA" and the UA that responds to the INVITE as the "target UA"
    to remove any confusion.</p>
