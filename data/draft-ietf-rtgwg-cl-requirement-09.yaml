abstract:
- content: "<p>There is often a need to provide large aggregates of bandwidth that
    are best provided using parallel links between routers or MPLS LSR. In core networks
    there is often no alternative since the aggregate capacities of core networks
    today far exceed the capacity of a single physical link or single packet processing
    element. The presence of parallel links, with each link potentially comprised
    of multiple layers has resulted in additional requirements. Certain services may
    benefit from being restricted to a subset of the component links or a specific
    component link, where component link characteristics, such as latency, differ.
    Certain services require that an LSP be treated as atomic and avoid reordering.
    Other services will continue to require only that reordering not occur within
    a microflow as is current practice. Current practice related to multipath is described
    briefly in an appendix.</p>"
