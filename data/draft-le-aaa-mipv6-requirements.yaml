abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the motivation why Diameter support for Mobile
    IPv6 is required and needs to be developped. It analyses the requirements expressed
    in RFC 2977 which was written both for MIPv4 and MIPv6; and it finally updates
    the IPv6 requirements for the AAA support for Mobile IPv6 to reflect the latest
    modifications and evolution of the Mobile IP, AAA and other relevant working groups.</p>"
