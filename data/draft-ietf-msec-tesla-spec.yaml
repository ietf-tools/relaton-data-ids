abstract:
- content: "<p>Data authentication is an important component for many applications,
    for example audio and video Internet broadcasts, or data distribution by satellite.
    This document specifies TESLA, a secure source authen足 tication mechanism for
    multicast or broadcast data streams. The com足 panion draft draft-msec-tesla-intro-01.txt
    [1] introduces and describes TESLA in detail, this document specifies the format
    of the TESLA authentication field as it is used within the MESP header [2]. The
    main deterrents so far for a data authentication mechanism for multicast were
    seemingly conflicting requirements: tolerance to packet loss, low per-packet overhead,
    low computation overhead, scal足 ability, no per-receiver state at the sender.
    The problem is particu足 larly hard in settings with high packet loss rates and
    where lost packets are not retransmitted, and where the receiver wants to authenticate
    each packet it receives. TESLA provides multicast source authentication of individual
    data packets, regardless of the packet loss rate. In addition, TESLA features
    low overhead for both sender and receiver, and does not require per-receiver state
    at the sender. TESLA is secure as long as the sender and receiver are loosely
    time synchronized.</p>"
