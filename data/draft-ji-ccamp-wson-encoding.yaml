abstract:
- content: "<p>Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexers(ROADM) featured highly
    asymmetric switching capability, is an essential element in current wavelength
    switched optical network(WSON).Because the multiple degree Reconfigurable add/drop
    optical multiplexer(ROADM) can not only add/ drop wavelength but also switch wavelength,
    it is necessary to know the switch connectivity offered by such a network element.
    With the development of ROADM, the constraint of wavelength and direction is abated,
    so the encoding of the ROADM needs improvement. This memo provides a novel encoding
    for different ROADMs, Which is applicable to the encoding of different kind of
    ROADMs.</p>"
