abstract:
- content: <p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain
    SIP federation. ViPR makes use of the RELOAD protocol to store unverified mappings
    from phone numbers to RELOAD nodes, with whom a validation process can be run.
    This document defines the usage of RELOAD for this purpose. Legal This documents
