- content: "<p>In accordance with rapid increase of data related to IoT and big data,
    techniques to control high capacity data is currently active and vibrant research
    field. Enterprises are trying to manage data on the cloud because of flexibility
    and capability. However, there are some limits to handle data intelligently in
    cloud. The SDS is considered as a good technique regarding this manner. SDS improves
    efficiency, scalability and flexibility in scale-out architecture, as well as,
    provides a cost effective solution using the existing storage resources efficiently.</p>"
