abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource records
    that cover a smaller range of names than called for by [-records]. By generating
    and signing these records on demand, authoritative name servers can effectively
    stop the disclosure of zone contents otherwise made possible by walking the chain
    of NSEC records in a signed zone.</p>"
