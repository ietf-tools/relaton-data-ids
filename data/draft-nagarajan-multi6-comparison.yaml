abstract:
- content: "<p>An IP address serves as a locator and an identifier in the classical
    Internet environment. This dual role of the IP address makes mobility and multihoming
    a challenging task. There have been various proposals to overcome this limitation,
    particularly from the Multi6 working group. This memo makes a comparative analysis
    of these proposals that support a locator/identifier split for multihoming in
    IPv6 from the security point of view. The purpose is also to provide a common
    framework under which future proposals can be compared and chosen for various
    security requirements.</p>"
