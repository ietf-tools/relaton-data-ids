abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a new mechanism for TCP and SCTP that can be
    used to recover lost segments when a connection's congestion window is small.
    The "Early Retransmit" mechanism allows the transport to reduce, in certain special
    circumstances, the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger a fast
    retransmission. This allows the transport to use fast retransmit to recover packet
    losses that would otherwise require a lengthy retransmission timeout.</p>
