abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC 8956,
    and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters
    and actions) distributed via BGP. Multiple applications have used BGP FSv1 to
    distribute traffic filter policy. These applications include the following: mitigation
    of denial of service (DoS), enabling traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNs, centralized
    traffic control of router firewall functions, and SFC traffic insertion. During
    the deployment of BGP FSv1 a number of issues were detected due to lack of consistent
    TLV encoding for rules for flow specifications, lack of user ordering of filter
    rules and/or actions, and lack of clear definition of interaction with BGP peers
    not supporting FSv1. Version 2 of the BGP flow specification (FSv2) protocol addresses
    these features. In order to provide a clear demarcation between FSv1 and FSv2,
    a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2.</p>"
