abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Multicast extension for the Optimized Link
    State Routing protocol(MOLSR). MOLSR is designed for mobile routers, and works
    in a heterogenous network composed of simple OLSR routers, MOLSR routers and hosts.
    In the last part of this document we introduce also a Wireless Internet Group
    Management Protocol (WIGMP). It offers the possibility for OLSR nodes (without
    multicast capabilities) to join multicast groups and receive multicast data.</p>"
