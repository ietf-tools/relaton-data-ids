abstract:
- content: "<p>When path computation is done in the management systems for Layer 1
    Virtual Private Networks (L1 VPNs), it would be important that resource information
    is synchronized between the management systems and the Provider Edge /Provider
    (PE/P). This draft looks at such a scenario from the viewpoint of the Path Computation
    Element Metric Protocol (PCEMP) that acts a generic computation model for path
    based metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer networks. This draft shows
    how PCEMP messages might help preserving the path computational entities in the
    L1 VPN peer nodes. This draft proposes to show how a L1 VPN framework may be included
    within the scope of Path Computation Element architectures and is derived primarily
    from the motivation of per VPN peer service solutions using PCE techniques. PCEMP
    metrics defining path quality measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability
    criteria for L1 VPNs is in line with the functional specifications of Generalized
    Traffic Engineered LSP path computation techniques involving Path Computation
    Element(s) of the PCE WG Charter.</p>"
