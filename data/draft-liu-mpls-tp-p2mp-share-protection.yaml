    WG draft, there are the following requirements: requirement 70: The restored and
    protected paths must be able to share resources.another requirment 67B: MPLS-TP
    must support unidirectional 1:n protection for P2MP,so this document will describle
    and provide two share protection solutions to protect and recovery P2MP services.
    and satisfied and provided unidirectional 1:n and (1:1)^n protection requirement
    for unidirectional P2MP serivce This document is a product of a joint Internet
    Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within
