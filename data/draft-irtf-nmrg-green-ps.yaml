abstract:
- content: <p>Reducing mankind's carbon footprint and making technology more sustainable
    are among the big challenges of our age. While networks are an enabler of applications
    that help to reduce this footprint, they also contribute to this footprint in
    no insignificant way themselves. Methods to make networking technology itself
    "greener" and to manage networks in ways that reduces their carbon footprint without
    impacting their utility therefore need to be explored. This document outlines
    a corresponding set of opportunities, along with associated research challenges,
    for networking technology in general and management technology in particular to
    become "greener", i.e. more sustainable, with reduced greenhouse gas emissions
    and carbon footprint.</p>
