abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Internet protocol that allows mobile nodes
    to move around in a local mobility domain, changing their point of attachment
    within the domain, but without ever being aware at the IP layer that their point
    of attachment has changed, and maintaining seamless communication in the presence
    of such changes. It defines two protocol entities, a Mobile Access Gateway and
    a Local Mobility Anchor, and a set of messages between them, that together make
    these mobility events transparent to the mobile nodes at the IP layer, as long
    as they remain within the local mobility domain.</p>"
