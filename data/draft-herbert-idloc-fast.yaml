abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal provides a method to implement identifier to locator
    mapping in the datapath without the need to access an in-network mapping database
    or cache. Mappings are encoded in Firewall and Service Tickets (FAST) tickets
    as locator information. When a packet is sent by a mobile node, a ticket is attached
    that providers the locator to use in the return path. Peer nodes receive packets
    with these tickets, cache the tickets in a flow context, and then attach them
    to packets they send as reflected tickets. When a packet with a reflected ticket
    enters an identifier-locator domain, the ticket is parsed to extract the locator.
    That locator is then used to send the packet to the appropriate destination over
    a network overlay.</p>"
