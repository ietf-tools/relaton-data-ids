abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol conventions described in this document satisfy some of
    the operational requirements of the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
    This document specifies a protocol useful in determining the current status of
    a digital certificate without the use of CRLs. Additional mechanisms addressing
    PKIX operational requirements are specified in separate documents. Section 2 provides
    an overview of the protocol. Section 3 goes through the functional requirements,
    while section 4 provides the details of the protocol. In section 5 we cover security
    issues with the protocol. Appendix A demonstrates RCSP over HTTP. Please send
    comments on this document to the ietf-pkix@tandem.com mail list.</p>"
