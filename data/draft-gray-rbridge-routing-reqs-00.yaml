abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple
    physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows for zero configuration
    of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise routing, safe forwarding even during
    periods of temporary loops, and the ability to cut down on ARP/ND traffic. The
    design supports VLANs, allows forwarding tables to be based on RBridge destinations
    (rather than endnode destinations, allowing internal forwarding tables to be smaller
    than in conventional bridge systems) and re-uses existing routing protocols (for
    - at least - distribution of reachability of destinations and shortest path computation
    within a campus). In order to accomplish this, the design may impose requirements
    for extensions to existing routing protocols necessary to accomplish the distribution
    and computation processes, as well as specific limits on interactions between
    bridge, R-Bridge and Router instances.</p>"
