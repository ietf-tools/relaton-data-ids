    to access Internet with PMP mode based IP CS. IP CS is a payload of IPv4 packet
    and IPv6 packet over IEEE 802.16 frame. This draft introduces host based packet
    delivery mechanism that can be classified layer 2 forwarding and IP tunnel based
    on public service and trial on IEEE 802.16 network. It describes HBPD on IEEE
