abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the Mobile IP base protocol
    (RFC 2002) to allow Mobile Nodes (Hosts) and Mobility Agents (both home network
    and foreign network) to use X.509 digital certificates, public keys and digital
    signatures as the basis of authenticating Mobile IP control messages in addition
    to secret key authentication. The use of these mechanisms will allow Mobile IP
    to scale from small research environments to potentially millions of mobile nodes
    across thousands of networks owned-operated by different organizations and service
    providers. A Public Key Infrastructure is proposed that focuses specifically on
    authentication of Mobile IP knowledgeable nodes, NOT general use for authenticating
    individuals.</p>"
