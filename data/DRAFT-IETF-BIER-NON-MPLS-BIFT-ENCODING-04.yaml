abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that\n
    \  provides optimal multicast forwarding through a \"multicast domain\",\n   without
    requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state\n   or to engage
    in an explicit tree-building protocol.  The Multicast\n   packet is encapsulated
    using a BIER Header and transported through an\n   MPLS or non-MPLS network.  When
    MPLS is used as the transport, the\n   Bit Indexed Forwarding Table (BIFT) is
    identified by a MPLS Label.\n   When non-MPLS transport is used, the BIFT is identified
    by a 20bit\n   value.  This document describes one way of encoding the 20bit value.\n\n\t
    </p>\n      "
