- content: "<p>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a long-standing protocol for real-time
    chatting. The basic client-server protocol is a very simple text-based protocol
    with no explicit mechanism for introducing or negotiating backwards-incompatible
    extensions. This memo presents a mechanism for negotiation of such extensions.</p>"
