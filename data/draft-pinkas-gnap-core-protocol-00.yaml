abstract:
- content: "<p>This protocol enables an Authorization Server (AS) to issue access
    tokens to permit an end-user using a client software to perform operations on
    a protected resource hosted by a Resource Server (RS). These access tokens allow
    to support capabilities and/or user attributes. The protocol includes means of
    specifying how the end-user can potentially be involved in an interactive fashion
    during the process. The client and/or the RS will use these interaction mechanisms
    to involve the end-user, as necessary, to take decisions. The protocol uses HTTPS
    for all communications between the client and the AS, as well as between the client
    and the RS.</p>"
