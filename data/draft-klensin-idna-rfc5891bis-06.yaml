abstract:
- content: "<p>The IDNA specifications for internationalized domain names combine
    rules that determine the labels that are allowed in the DNS without violating
    the protocol itself and an assignment of responsibility, consistent with earlier
    specifications, for determining the labels that are allowed in particular zones.
    Conformance to IDNA by registries and other implementations requires both parts.
    Experience strongly suggests that the language describing those responsibilities
    was insufficiently clear to promote safe and interoperable use of the specifications
    and that more details and discussion of circumstances would have been helpful.
    Without making any substantive changes to IDNA, this specification updates two
    of the core IDNA documents (RFCs 5890 and 5891) and the IDNA explanatory document
    (RFC 5894) to provide that guidance and to correct some technical errors in the
    descriptions.</p>"
