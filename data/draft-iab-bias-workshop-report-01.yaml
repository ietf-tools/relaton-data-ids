abstract:
- content: "<p>The “Barriers for Internet Access of Services (Bias)” workshop was
    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from January 15-17, 2024 as
    a three-day online meeting. Based on the submitted position papers, the workshop
    covered three areas of interest: the role of community networks in Internet Access
    of Services; reports and comments on the observed digital divide; and measurements
    of censorship and censorship circumvention. This report summarizes the workshop's
    discussion and serves as a reference for reports on the current barriers to Internet
    Access. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.
    The views and positions documented in this report were expressed during the workshop
    by participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB's views and positions.</p>"
