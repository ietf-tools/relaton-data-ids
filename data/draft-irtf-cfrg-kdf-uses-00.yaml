abstract:
- content: "<p>This note surveys the existing designs for Key Derivation Functions
    (KDFs), the purposes for which they are used, and their security and usability
    goals. Importantly, some important protocols use KDFs for multiple purposes. We
    offer conclusions to guide future standards work and research on KDFs.</p>"
