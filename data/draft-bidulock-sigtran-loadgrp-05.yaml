abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes an extension parameter and procedure
    to the Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [IUA], [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [DUA],
    [V5UA], [GR303UA], [ISUA], [TUA], based on the Stream Transmission Control Protocol
    (SCTP) [SCTP] which permits an Application Server Processes (ASP) to indicate
    its placement within a Load Group and permits an Signalling Gateway (SG) to distribute
    traffic over Load Groups under Application Server Process (ASP) control. The described
    procedure provides for Override, Load-share and Broadcast traffic mode operation
    within a Load Group consisting of one or more Application Server Processes (ASPs)
    resulting in a mixture of traffic modes within an Application Server (AS). The
    parameters and procedures described here supplement the UA Load Selection [LOADSEL]
    extension parameters and procedures for improved distribution of traffic over
    ASPs and Signalling Gateway Processes (SGPs).</p>"
