abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a part of the ITU-T Recommendation and ISO/IEC International
    Standard, named the Enhanced Communications Transport Protocol (ECTP), which is
    a multicast transport protocol designed to support Internet multicast applications.
    This third part of ECTP (ECTP-3) describes the protocol specification for the
    duplex multicast transport. In a duplex connection, a single multicast sender,
    named TC-Owner (TO), transmits multicast data to the other group members, while
    some of the participating TS-users may send unicast data to the TO over the reverse
    data channel.</p>"
