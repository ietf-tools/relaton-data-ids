abstract:
- content: "<p>Ad Hoc networks often present a challenging environment for IPv6 addressing
    due to the undetermined neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes
    assign IPv6 addresses to their Ad Hoc networks that must be locally unique. IPv6
    nodes must therefore be able to assign topology-independent addresses when topology-oriented
    IPv6 address delegation services are either absent or only intermittently available.
    This document introduces a new IPv6 address type that a node can autonomously
    assign for each of its Ad- Hoc networks.</p>"
