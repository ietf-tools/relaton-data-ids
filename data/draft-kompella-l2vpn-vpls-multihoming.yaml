abstract:
- content: <p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a Layer 2 Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) that gives its customers the appearance that their sites are connected via
    a Local Area Network (LAN). It is often required for the Service Provider (SP)
    to give the customer redundant connectivity to some sites, often called "multi-homing".
    This memo shows how multi-homing can be offered in the context of BGP-based VPLS.</p>
