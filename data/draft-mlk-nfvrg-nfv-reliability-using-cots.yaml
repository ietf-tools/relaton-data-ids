abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the results of a recent study on the feasibility
    of using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware for virtualized network functions
    in telecom equipment. In particular, it explores the conditions under which the
    COTS hardware can be used in the NFV (Network Function Virtualization) environment.
    The concept of silent error probability is introduced in order to take software
    error or undetectable hardware failures into account. The silent error probability
    is included in both the theoretical work and the simulation work. It is difficult
    to theoretically analyze the impact of site maintenance and site failure events.
    Therefore, simulation is used for evaluating the impact of these site management
    related events which constitute the undesirable feature of using COTS hardware
    in telecom environment.</p>"
