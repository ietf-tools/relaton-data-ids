abstract:
- content: "<p>Demultiplexing and decoding an MPEG2 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS) requires
    the knowledge of specific information about the transport stream, which we refer
    to as the MPEG2-TS Preamble. While this information is spread over different locations
    throughout the transport stream and can be eventually assembled after some time
    a receiver started receiving the MPEG2-TS, the time it takes to retrieve all this
    information (especially in multicast environments) may be long. Instead, having
    this information readily available as a Preamble and sending the Preamble to a
    receiver that will shortly start receiving the transport stream will virtually
    eliminate the waiting time and let the receiver start processing/decoding the
    MPEG2-TS sooner. In this document, we give an overview of the MPEG2-TS and the
    delay components in video systems, and motivate the need for constructing and
    using the MPEG2-TS Preamble for rapidly acquiring the source stream in RTP multicast
    sessions. We also define and register the RTP payload format for the MPEG2-TS
    Preamble.</p>"
