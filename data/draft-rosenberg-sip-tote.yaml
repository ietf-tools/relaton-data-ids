abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a simple protocol - Trivial Object Transfer and
    Exchange (TOTE) - that provides bidirectional exchange of MIME objects over a
    TCP connection. It is used in conjunction with protocols based on the offer/answer
    model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). TOTE can be used for any
    application requiring direct agent-to-agent data communication, such as picture
    exchange or camera controls.</p>"
