abstract:
- content: "<p>In security considerations, identity of a device should be protected
    and cannot be exposed in public in plaintext. The storage and execution of identity
    in device also need to be protected during the lifecycle. Based on this purpose,
    this document uses TEE and EAP-TLS to create a secure and trusted procedure to
    authenticate a device's identity. In this architecture, certificate protection
    and handshake keys generation which are used for EAP-TLS authentication will be
    executed in TEE. Communication establishment with EAP-TLS Server will be executed
    in REE. A middle layer is introduced to communicate between TEE and REE to compose
    the original function of EAP-TLS Client. TEE identification based on EAP-TLS could
    be used in different network layers to implement identity authentication.</p>"
