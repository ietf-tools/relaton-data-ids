abstract:
- content: "<p>Some service providers want to build a service which guarantees QoS
    or bandwidth from a local CE to a remote CE through the network. Today, customers
    expect to run triple play services through BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. As a result, their
    requirements for end-to-end QoS of applications are increasing. Depending on the
    application (e.g., voice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data pipe, etc.), an end-to-end
    native RSVP path and/or an end-to-end MPLS TE LSP are required, and they need
    to meet some constraints. This document describes service provider requirements
    for supporting customer RSVP and RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS VPN</p>"
