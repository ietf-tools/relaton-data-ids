abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPv6 networks are deployed and the network transition is discussed,
    one should also consider how to enable IPv6 support in applications running on
    IPv6 hosts, and the best strategy to develop IP protocol support in applications.
    This document specifies scenarios and aspects of application transition. It also
    proposes guidelines on how to develop IP version-independent applications during
    the transition period. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
