abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the Communication
    Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem
    supplementary service. As part of CDIV, a SIP based Event package framework is
    used for notifying users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of their
    incoming communication sessions. This document proposes a new SIP event package
    for allowing users to subscribe to and receive such notifications. Users can further
    define filters to control the rate and content of such notifications. The proposed
    event package is applicable to the CDIV supplementary service in IMS and may not
    be applicable to the general internet. .</p>"
