abstract:
- content: "<p>The impairment validation of the light path in a Wavelength Switched
    Optical Network (WSON) can be implemented with a distributed hop by hop process
    by signaling protocol. This memo proposes feedback control of some parameters
    related to impairment evaluation results with the extensions to the Resource Reservation
    Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling protocol in order to establish an optical
    path with a higher probability.</p>"
