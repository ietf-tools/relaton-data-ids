abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a proposed replacement for the recommendation
    in draft-carpenter-ip6-nsap-map-00.txt for mapping OSI NSAP addresses into IPv6.
    It carries existing NSAP addresses transparently (without any conversion) and
    conveys any additional bytes which cannot be accommodated in the basic 16 byte
    IPv6 address space in an optional Hop by Hop extension header. It can thus support
    all existing NSAP address schemes which have been defined by The ISO and The ITU-T,
    including those which utilise the full 20 byte maximum address length, and allows
    existing NSAP address schemes which have been deployed globally to be retained
    intact. It can also be extended to cover other addressing schemes, such as IPX.</p>"
