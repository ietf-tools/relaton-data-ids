abstract:
- content: "<p>LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS are existing and widely deployment OAM mechanisms
    for MPLS LSPs. This document describes an ACH encapsulation for LSP-Ping, that
    would enable use of LSP-Ping for networks where IP addressing is not in use. This
    document also clarifies the use of BFD for MPLS LSPs using ACH encapsulation,
    when IP addressing may not be available and/or it may not be desirable to encapsulate
    BFD packets in IP.</p>"
