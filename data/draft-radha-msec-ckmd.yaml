abstract:
- content: "<p>We present our work on efficient scalable solutions to the hierarchical
    key management and distribution problem for secure multicast sessions. We take
    two rooted-tree based schemes that solve hierarchical key management and distribution
    problem and then present ways of making these schemes more efficient by reducing
    the tree center key storage with an upper bound on key update communication. The
    objective of improving efficiency is posed as a constrained optimization problem,
    which we further reduce to a fixed-point equation and find solutions. We also
    provide a tree design algorithm, which allows the designer to specify an upper
    key update communication bound and construct an efficient tree with minimal center
    storage while maintaining pre- existing logarithmic scalability in time and space
    requirements. The choice of update communication bound as a design factor is the
    recent development of multicast communication applications, which have energy
    or bandwidth as constraints, and these in turn being directly related to communication
    bounds.</p>"
