abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is an integral part of IPv6 first-hop. Due
    to limitation of certain L2 media's support to ND, a number of issues can happen
    in certain scenarios. Solutions for these issues have been designed. These issues
    and solutions are summarized in RFC3756, RFC6583, RFC9099. However, there is no
    guideline on how to prevent the issues or how to select the proper solutions.
    This document analyzes the existing solutions and summarizes their wisdoms into
    an insight: isolating hosts into different L2 links or different L3 subnets can
    be effective in preventing ND issues. In deployment scenarios where the ND issues
    can occur, this prevention approach can be more effective than deploying the corresponding
    solutions to solve the issues. Based on this insight, a set of guidelines is proposed
    for future ND deployments. These guidelines describe where to isolate hosts in
    L2 or in subnet to prevent ND issues, and how to select suitable solutions for
    the remaining issues. This will likely simplify ND deployment. The impact of such
    isolation to other components of IPv6 first-hop is also analyzed. The impact appears
    small. Therefore, the guidelines will likely simplify the overall IPv6 first-hop
    deployment.</p>"
