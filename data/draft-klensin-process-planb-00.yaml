abstract:
- content: "<p>One basic model for IETF operations is that the IESG is given general
    guidance in specific procedural documents but sufficient discretion and flexibility
    to adapt the rules and make new ones in order to make the IETF work smoothly.
    This model underlies a number of reform proposals, including recent ones from
    this author. However, there has been an undercurrent of suspicion from some members
    of the community -- suspicion that the IESG is abusive of that discretion and
    cannot be trusted. Those suspicions have, to some extent, been reinforced by questions
    about IESG-adopted procedures that seem to contradict procedures approved by the
    community and documented in BCPs. The community cannot move forward with models
    based on both trust and distrust in the IESG's ability, and level of responsibility,
    to do its job. In an attempt to focus this part of the debate, this document proposes
    to dramatically narrow IESG's scope of authority and discretion. In particular,
    it proposes to move the IESG, procedurally, onto an 'anything not explicitly required
    is forbidden' model, and, indeed, a very narrow and punitive member of that family.
    While the author believes this would be a terrible idea, it appears to be time
    that the community either focuses on it and moves in this direction or stops wasting
    time hinting about it.</p>"
