abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol needs to share its ratchet_tree
    object to welcome new clients into a group and in external joins. While, the protocol
    only defines a mechanism for sharing the entire tree, most implementations use
    various optimizations to avoid sending this structure repeatedly in large groups.
    This draft explores ways to convey these improvements in a standardized way and
    to convey parts of a GroupInfo object that are not visible to an intermediary
    server.</p>"
