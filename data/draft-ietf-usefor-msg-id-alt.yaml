abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC822] and [RFC1036] define so-called 'Message-IDs' that represent
    a unique identifier for email and netnews messages. A similar identifier is also
    used by [RFC2045] for the 'Content-ID' label. For each of these protocols, uniqueness
    of the identifiers generated is more or less essential. Unfortunately, the original
    Message-ID specification requires that the generator have an own, non-temporary
    full qualified domain name available, which does not allow hosts that are connected
    via dialup lines and get dynamically assigned IP addresses (and hostnames) to
    generate unique IDs offline. This memo provides recommendations for the generation
    of such IDs without risking non-uniqueness.</p>"
