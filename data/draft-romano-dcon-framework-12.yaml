abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the framework for Distributed Conferencing (DCON).
    The framework draws inspiration from the work carried out in the XCON working
    group, which has defined a complete architecture for centralized conferencing.
    DCON is based on the idea that a distributed conference can be setup by appropriately
    orchestrating the operation of a number of XCON focus elements, each in charge
    of managing a certain number of participants. Interaction between each participant
    and the corresponding conference focus is based on the standard XCON framework,
    whereas inter-focus interaction is defined in this document.</p>"
