abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a service-agnostic semantics for Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP). It disassociates DSCP from classification of service
    classes. Instead, individual packets are marked dynamically in a Quality-of-Experience
    (QoE)-aware manner. Such a more flexible use of Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
    involves interactions with transport protocols on application hosts. Meanwhile,
    the semantics adds no complexity to traffic conditioning and Per-Hop-Behavior
    (PHB) enforcement within DiffServ network domain.</p>"
