abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3178 [1] describes a solution to provide site multi-homing support
    in IPv6. RFC 3178 multi-homing solution uses tunnels between the different ISPs
    and the multi-homed site to provide alternative paths in case that one of the
    exit links is down, protecting the multi-homed site from outages in the direct
    link with its providers. However, the wide adoption of RFC 3178 multi-homing solution
    implies the manual configuration of numerous tunnels on the ISPs, which may impose
    an important workload in ISP network administrators. This note proposes the usage
    of Multi-Homing Tunnel Brokers to automatically configure the ISP tunnel endpoint
    in order to ease the adoption of the solution.</p>"
