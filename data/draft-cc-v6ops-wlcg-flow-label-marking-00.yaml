abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimentally deployed approach currently
    used within the Worldwide Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid (WLCG) to mark
    packets with their project (experiment) and application. The marking uses the
    20-bit IPv6 Flow Label in each packet, with 15 bits used for semantics and 5 bits
    for entropy. Alternatives, in particular use of IPv6 Extension Headers (EH), were
    considered but found to not be practical. The WLCG is one of the largest worldwide
    research communities and has adopted IPv6 heavily for movement of many tens of
    PB of data annually, with the ultimate goal of running IPv6 only.</p>"
