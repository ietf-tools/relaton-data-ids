abstract:
- content: "<p>This document collects, organizes, and describes the conference variables
    that have been introduced in various protocol drafts of the XCON and SIPPING working
    groups. The goal of this document is to allow the conference control protocols
    to use a unified common conference information data model for XCON. This document
    formally defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema that represents the
    common conference information in a conferencing server. The information is modeled
    as a series of elements, each of which contains a set of children and attributes.</p>"
