abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation and have more stringent
    performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.
    An enhanced VPN may be used for 5G transport network slicing, and will also be
    of use in more generic scenarios. This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with
    necessary extensions to build a set of Segment Routing (SR) based virtual networks
    with customized topology and resource attributes in the network. These virtual
    networks could be used as the underlay of enhanced VPN service. The proposed mechanism
    is applicable to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment
    routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
