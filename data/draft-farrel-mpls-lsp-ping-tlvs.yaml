abstract:
- content: "<p>Techniques for detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) data
    plane failures are described in RFC 4379 and include the definition of a control
    protocol for testing and verifying Label Switched Path (LSP) connectivity that
    is known as LSP Ping. The protocol consists of a set of messages each of which
    contains data encoded as TLVs. The LSP Ping protocol is being extended for several
    related uses. Each extension gives rise to the definition of new TLVs to be carried
    on the existing protocol messages. The LSP Ping specification makes it mandatory
    that all TLVs are understood by each participating Label Switching Router (LSR)
    that receives an LSP Ping message. This makes future extensibility hard without
    upgrading all LSRs in the network. This document defines ranges in the TLV codepoint
    space so that TLVs may be associated with different processing rules within an
    LSR if the TLV is unknown. This will make extensibility more simple.</p>"
