abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a payload format for transporting JPEG 2000
    video streams using RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol). JPEG 2000 video streams
    are formed as a continuous series of JPEG 2000 still images which is next-generation
    still image coding. The JPEG 2000 payload format described in this document has
    three features: (1) Improvement of robustness to packet loss by fragmenting JPEG
    2000 packet units intelligently, (2) Persistency of main header to minimize loss
    effect, (3) Priority information field for scalable delivery from the same codestream.
    These will allow the scalability and robustness of JPEG 2000 to be maximized in
    streaming applications.</p>"
