abstract:
- content: "<p>LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local
    in-network loss recovery. It can be used with tunneling protocols to efficiently
    recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end path instead of leaving
    recovery to the end-to-end protocol, traversing the entire path. Segment Routing
    (SR) leverages the source routing mechanisms and steers the packets through an
    policy instantiated as an ordered list of instructions called segments. LOOPS
    can be embedded in an SR segment to improve the packet recovery. draft-welzl-loops-gen-info
    defines the generic information model, without binding that to any specific protocols,
    to be carried between LOOPS ingress and egress nodes, which can be SR segment
    endpoints. This document specifies the concrete mechanisms to embed LOOPS in SRv6
    segment.</p>"
