abstract:
- content: <p>Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle, plug
    into any point in the processing of an email message. As defined in the base specification,
    it plugs into mail delivery. This document defines how Sieve can plug into points
    in the IMAP protocol where messages are created or changed, adding the option
    of user- defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions,
    features such as notifications).Note This document defines extensions to IMAP
    and Sieve. For now, it is the work of the Lemonade Working Group (Enhancements
    to Internet email to support diverse service environments), but it will be moved
    to the Sieve working group at some point. 1. Discussion of this document should
    be taken to the Sieve mailing list at mailto:ietf-mta-filters@imc.org 2. Subscription
    requests can be sent to mailto:ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org?body=subscribe
    (send an email message with the word "subscribe" in the body). 3. A WWW archive
    of back messages is available at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sieve/index.html
    4. Older messages, which were posted to the lemonade mailing list, are archived
    at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/lemonade/index.html</p>
