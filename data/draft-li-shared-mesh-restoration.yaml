abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient techniques for rapid restoration must be addressed within
    GMPLS. This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling in support of shared
    mesh restoration. Shared mesh restoration describes restoration plans in which
    restoration capacity is shared across multiple independent failures. In particular,
    this document proposes extensions enabling reservation of restoration capacity,
    LSP restoration, LSP reversion and LSP deletion.</p>"
