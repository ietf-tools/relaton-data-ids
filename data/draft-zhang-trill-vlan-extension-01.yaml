abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL is originally designed for customer networks. When it is used
    as a provider network to interconnect multiple separate users, the space of current
    Inner VLAN becomes insufficient. As an easy way, a new VLAN ID field is added
    to the Inner Ethernet frame. The new VLAN ID can be use in conjunction with the
    previous defined Inner VLAN. This mechanism is usually known as stacked VLANs(802.1ad,
    or QinQ). The stacked VLANs mechanism is analyzed in this document. The method
    to introduce a single longer VLAN field to current TRILL header is also analyzed
    in this document. In addition, a novel MAC address rewriting mechanism is also
    brought forward to break the space limitation of the Inner VLAN. The MAC addresses
    of the native frame are not used for forwarding process in transit RBridges. When
    the packet enters the TRILL network, the ingress RBridge (Appointed Forwarder)
    uses a Virtual MAC (VMAC) address to replace the real MAC and embedded the native
    VLAN ID into this virtual MAC address. When a packet egresses from the TRILL network,
    the egress RBridge will use the real MAC address to replace the virtual MAC address
    and deliver it to the destination on the local link.</p>"
