abstract:
- content: <p>Distributed mobility management aims to distribute the mobility anchor
    to the access network level to avoid the centralized mobility anchor problem.
    By distributing the mobility anchor, the traffic can be distributed in an optimal
    way. There are many different proposals for DMM solution, one of those types of
    solution is called "dynamic anchor". This document analyses the limitations of
    current dynamic anchor solution and discusses the possible solution to overcome
    those limitations.</p>
