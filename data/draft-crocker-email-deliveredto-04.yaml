abstract:
- content: <p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the email author. The address used by the email transport service is provided
    separately, through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO" command. Before final delivery,
    handling can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using different
    destination addresses, that lead to the recipient. It can be helpful for a message
    to have a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to include
    each address used for that recipient. This document defines a header field for
    this information. Email handling information is a matter of modifying the email
    infrastructure and possibly creating privacy concerns. A header field such as
    this is not automatically assured of adoption or use. Therefore it is being published
    as an Experiment, looking for constituency and for operational utility. This document
    is produced through the Independent RFC stream and was not subject to the IETF's
    approval process.</p>
