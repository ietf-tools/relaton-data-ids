abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensions are proposed to NFS version 4 which enable it to support
    sessions, connection management, and operation atop RDMA-capable RPC. These extensions
    enable universal support for Exactly-once Semantics by NFSv4 servers, enhanced
    security, and multipathing and trunking of transport connections. These extensions
    provide identical benefit over both TCP and RDMA connection types.</p>"
