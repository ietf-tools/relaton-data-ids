abstract:
- content: "<p>In case a given fixed network is policy converged with the mobile network,
    i.e if Policy for Convergence is deployed, host specific quality of service and
    charging can be applied to the hosts connecting using the wireless local area
    network access or some other means. When local or visiting hosts are assigned
    their addresses using IPv6 prefix sharing, the edge router is unable to provide
    host specific quality of service and charging. We explain both stateless and stateful
    address assignment cases.</p>"
