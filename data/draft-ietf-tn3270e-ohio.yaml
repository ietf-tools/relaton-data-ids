abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses the need for a common, advanced, client programming
    interface to mainframe host data. Application developers, in particular third
    party application vendors, use API's provided by client emulator programs to write
    applications that access host data. Currently, the defacto standard HLLAPI is
    the interface most commonly provided by these programs and the one used by the
    third party application vendors. However, HLLAPI is plagued by the fact that it
    doesn't exploit modern programming techniques and is fragmented by multiple, proprietary
    implementations. Client vendors have, over the last couple of years, developed
    more advanced interfaces that exploit modern programming advances. However no
    effort has been put into standardizing these interfaces and application developers
    have been forced to either chose to stay with HLLAPI or perform costly re-implementation
    of their products to support each competing advanced client API.</p>"
