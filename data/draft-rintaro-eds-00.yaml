abstract:
- content: "<p>In DNS Queries over HTTPS [RFC8484], the port that communicates with
    DNS would change from UDP to TCP 443. This change causes a new problem that makes
    it difficult to identify which is the name resolution request, so it is difficult
    to use web filtering, parental controls and so on. Furthermore, a user-agent in
    a HTTP header that is necessary for HTTPS communications could be a data used
    to track users. In summary, DNS Queries over HTTPS has some problems that affect
    users' security and privacy. This draft proposes a system that is set mediation
    servers between client side and DNS servers. With this proposal, it is expected
    that those two problems will be solved.</p>"
