abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building control
    systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect with each other, forming
    low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). The CoAP and 6LoWPAN standards are emerging
    as the de-facto protocols in this area for resource-constrained devices. Both
    multicast and security are key needs in these networks. This draft presents a
    method for securing IPv6 multicast communication in LLNs based on the DTLS which
    is already available in CoAP devices. This draft deals with the adaptation of
    the DTLS record layer to protect CoAP group communication, assuming that all group
    member devices are already configured with the group security association. The
    DTLS record layer is used to provide authentication and encrypt multicast messages
    using the group keying material before sending the message via IPv6 multicast
    to the group.</p>"
