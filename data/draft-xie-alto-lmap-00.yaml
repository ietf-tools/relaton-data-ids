abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network
    diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public policy. The Large-scale
    Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information model, and
    protocol have been developed for measurement task dissemination, initialization,
    reporting and storing. In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband
    Performance (LMAP), measurement results are currently made available in the repository
    to the public either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of results
    of all individual tests), or in a very high level human- readable format. This
    document uses ALTO protocol to provide access to large-scale network measurement
    results, flexible enough to enable querying of specific and possibly aggregated
    data.</p>"
