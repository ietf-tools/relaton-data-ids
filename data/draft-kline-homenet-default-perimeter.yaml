abstract:
- content: <p>Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a perimeter
    is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses. This document describes
    how to use homenet routing protocol adjacencies as the primary signal of a common
    administrative domain (e.g. "the home"). Classification of interfaces et cetera
    as internal or external follow from this, as do various policy and implementation
    implications. One fundamental implication is that the active definition of a home
    network's interior is no more secure than its policy for forming homenet routing
    protocol adjacencies.</p>
