abstract:
- content: "<p>There are currently significant efforts ongoing in IETF regarding more
    advanced multi-media functionalities, such as the work related to RTCWEB and CLUE.
    This work includes use cases for both multi- party communication and multiple
    media streams from an individual end-point. The usage of scalable encoding or
    simulcast encoding as well as different types of transport mechanisms have created
    additional needs to correctly identify different types of resources and describe
    their relations to achieve intended functionalities. The different usages have
    both commonalities and differences in needs and behavior. This document attempts
    to review some usages and identify commonalities and needs. It then continues
    to highlight important aspects that need to be considered in the definition of
    these usages.</p>"
