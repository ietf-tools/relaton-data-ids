abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the crash recovery mechanism for the Secure Asset
    Transfer Protocol (SATP). The goal of this draft is to specify the message flow
    that implements a crash recovery mechanism. The mechanism assures that gateways
    running SATP are able to recover faults, enforcing ACID properties for asset transfers
    across ledgers (i.e., double spend does not occur).</p>"
