abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by leveraging
    a new type of Routing Extension Header, called Segment Routing Header (SRH). However,
    the overhead introduced by SRH may be a challenge for existing hardware, which
    may influence on the forwarding performance and the payload efficiency. This document
    defines a compressed SRv6 network programming mechanism in order to reduce the
    overhead of SRv6 by introducing the Compressed Segment Identifier (C-SID) and
    the Compressed SRH (C-SRH). The C-SRH can be a new Routing Header or an enhancement
    of SRH.</p>"
