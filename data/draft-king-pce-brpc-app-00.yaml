abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across multiple
    domains in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks presents a problem because no single point of path computation
    is aware of all of the links and resources in each domain. A solution may be achieved
    using the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture. Where the sequence of domains
    is known a priori, various techniques can be employed to derive an optimum path.
    If the domains are simply- connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection
    are also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used. Where there
    are multiple connections between domains and there is no preference for the choice
    of points of interconnection, the Backward Recursive Path Computation Procedure
    (BRPC) can be used.</p>"
