abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the encapsulation and mechanisms that allows
    PPP packets to be transported over low-bitrate links such as modem lines, ISDN
    B-channels, and sub-T1 links with guarantee of quality of service for time sensitive
    services. A mechanism of channel preemption is defined, allowing the immediate
    occupation of the channel with the most priority packet, resuming the transmission
    of the lower priority frame without need to retransmit the octets already sent.
    This mechanism allows a dynamic packet fragmentation, guaranteeing simultaneously
    a low transmission delay for the services more sensitive to transmission delays
    and an efficient channel occupation. It is a recursive mechanism, which means
    that the packet that made the channel preemption can itself be preempted by another
    higher priority packet, and this process can be repeated whenever a higher priority
    packet requests transmission. The proposed mechanism is compatible with existing
    hardware and drivers for asynchronous and synchronous HDLC controllers.</p>"
