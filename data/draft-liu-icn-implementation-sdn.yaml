abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at discussing some research issues about the implementation
    of information-centric network (ICN) architectures. Towards this end, we first
    review the implementation methods employed by various ICNs and discuss the potential
    problems of these implementations. Then we propose a unified framework for ICN
    implementation based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique which can
    facilitate the implementation of any ICN architecture and interoperability among
    different ICN architectures.</p>"
