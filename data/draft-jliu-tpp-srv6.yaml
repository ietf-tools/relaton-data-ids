abstract:
- content: "<p>A trusted network path is desired for source authentication and path
    verification. The emergence of IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) may bring the opportunity
    to assemble trusted network paths with a lightweight IP header. This document
    describes a trusted network path verification mechanism based on SRv6 (Segment
    Routing to enable Trusted and Private Network Paths, SR-TPP), which supports network
    path verification with path information protection. SR-TPP extends SRv6 function
    in protocol header to meet the requirement of path compliance. Path information
    is sequentially encoded into the segment list in SR-TPP so that path information
    is partially visible to each intermediate router. The distributed verification
    of SR-TPP also makes it easier to locate faults.</p>"
