abstract:
- content: "<p>Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host may or may not
    have valid IP configuration for Internet Connectivity. A host may determine whether
    its IP configuration is valid by checking Network Layer link change. With the
    information gathered, a host may decide if their own configuration needs to be
    updated and initiate a new configuration in case of link change. This procedure
    is described as Detecting Network Attachment.</p>"
