abstract:
- content: "<p>For network scenarios such as Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs),
    BGP is extended for Link-State (LS) distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF)
    algorithm based calculation. BGP-LS-SPF leverages the mechanisms of both BGP protocol
    and BGP-LS protocol extensions, with new selection rules defined for BGP-LS-SPF
    NLRI. This document proposes some updates to the BGP-LS-SPF NLRI selection rules,
    so as to improve the route updates and convergence, while consistent SPF computation
    result can still be achieved. This document updates the NLRI selection rules in
    I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf.</p>"
