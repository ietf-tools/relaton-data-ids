abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a strategy for domain name server operators
    to prepare and transition their services for multilingual domain names (IDN –
    Internationalized Domain Names). The IDNX approach accepts that users with non-IDN
    aware applications will be attempting to access multilingual domain names. Hence
    it is the registry or domain operator's responsibility to provide an IDN solution
    that resolves these issues to make it a seamless transition experience for technically
    unsophisticated users. In essence, the IDNX approach embraces a complementary
    server-side implementation to smooth the transition. IDNX compliant domain servers
    will successfully resolve IDN requests sent via non-IDN aware applications, whether
    they are formatted in local encoding, UTF-8 or an identifiable variant. The IDNX
    approach also utilizes a dynamic CNAME mechanism to provision for the sub-delegation
    of multilingual domain names to hosts running non-IDN aware DNS servers.</p>"
