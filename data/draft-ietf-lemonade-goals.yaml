- content: "<p>This document is a history capturing the background, motivation and
    thinking during the LEMONADE definition and design process. The LEMONADE Working
    Group -- Internet email to support diverse service environments -- is chartered
    to provide enhancements to Internet mail to facilitate its use by more diverse
    clients. In particular, by clients on hosts not only operating in environments
    with high latency/bandwidth-limited unreliable links but also constrained to limited
    resources. The enhanced mail must be backwards compatible with existing Internet
    mail. The primary motivation for this effort is -- by making Internet mail protocols
    richer and more adaptable to varied media and environments -- to allow mobile
    handheld devices tetherless access to Internet mail using only IETF mail protocols.
    The requirements for these devices drive a discussion of the possible protocol
    enhancements needed to support multimedia messaging on limited-capability hosts
    in diverse service environments. A list of general principles to guide the design
    of the enhanced messaging protocols is documented. Finally, additional issues
    of providing seamless service between enhanced Internet mail and the existing
    separate mobile messaging infrastructure are briefly listed. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
