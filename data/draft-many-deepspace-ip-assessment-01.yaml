abstract:
- content: "<p>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    is 4-20 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital dynamics.
    Up to now, communications have been done on a layer-2 point to point basis, with
    sometimes the use of relays, therefore no layer-3 networking was possible. RFC4838
    reports an assessment done around 25 years ago concluding that the IP protocol
    stack was not suitable for deep space networking. This result lead to the definition
    of a new protocol stack based on a store-and-forward paradigm implemented in the
    Bundle Protocol(BP). More recently, space agencies are planning to deploy IP networks
    on celestial bodies, such as Moon or Mars, ground, and vicinity. This document
    revisits the initial assessment of not using IP and provides solution paths to
    use the IP protocol stack, from IP forwarding to transport to applications to
    network management, in deep space communications.</p>"
