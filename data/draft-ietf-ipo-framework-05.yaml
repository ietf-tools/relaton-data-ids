abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet transport infrastructure is moving towards a model of high-speed
    routers interconnected by optical core networks. The architectural choices for
    the interaction between IP and optical network layers, specifically, the routing
    and signaling aspects, are maturing. At the same time, a consensus has emerged
    in the industry on utilizing IP-based protocols for the optical control plane.
    This document defines a framework for IP over Optical networks, considering both
    the IP-based control plane for optical networks as well as IP-optical network
    interactions (together referred to as "IP over optical networks"). This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>
