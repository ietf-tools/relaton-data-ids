abstract:
- content: "<p>The Robust Checksum-based header Compression [ROCCO] scheme is a header
    compression scheme designed to work over error prone channels. The scheme is adaptable
    to the characteristics of the link over which it is used and also to the properties
    of the packet streams it compresses. This document describes a number of ROCCO
    profiles designed for conversational video over error prone channels. The profiles
    compress the size of the IP/UDP/RTP header down to a minimum of 2 octets.</p>"
