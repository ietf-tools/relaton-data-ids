abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive
    resolver to use unauthenticated encryption when communicating with authoritative
    servers. The motivating use case for this method is that more encryption on the
    Internet is better, and some resolver operators believe that unauthenticated encryption
    is better than no encryption at all. The method described here is optional for
    both the recursive resolver and the authoritative server. This method supports
    unauthenticated encryption using the same mechanism for discovery of encryption
    support for the server as [FULL-AUTH].</p>"
