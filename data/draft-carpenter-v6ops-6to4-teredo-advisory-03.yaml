abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides advice to network operators about deployment
    of the 6to4 technique for automatic tunneling of IPv6 over IPv4. It is principally
    addressed to Internet Service Providers, including those that do not yet support
    IPv6, and to Content Providers. The intention of the advice is to minimise both
    user dissatisfaction and help desk calls.</p>"
