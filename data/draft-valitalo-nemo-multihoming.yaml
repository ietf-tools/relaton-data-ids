abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes, how NEMO support works with multiple care-of
    addresses, in a multihomed mobile network, when there exists one home agent, one
    mobile router, and one or more mobile network prefixes. Solution to the problem,
    how to register multiple care-of addresses bound to a single home address in a
    NEMO support, is proposed.</p>"
