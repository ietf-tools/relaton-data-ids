abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidelines and requirements for testing Store,
    Carry and Forward (SCF) systems and protocols. The Testing Requirements document
    is one of three that fully describe the SCF system. The other two are the SCF
    Problem Statement and the SCF Requirements and Expectations document. This initial
    document is currently just a skeletal outline, published so the other two SCF
    documents can reference it.</p>"
