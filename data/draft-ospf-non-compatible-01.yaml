abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a generic mechanism that facilitates the deployment
    of non-backward-compatible changes in OSPF protocol. This mechanism allows the
    OSPF routers to advertise the capability of non- backward-compatible functionality
    and to make the functionality operational only when supported by all participating
    routers. Depending on the functionality scope, capability advertisements must
    be propagated across a link, area or autonomous system (AS). For link and area
    scope functionality, Router Information Link State Advertisement (LSA) is utilized
    to propagate the capability information. For the cases when compatibility must
    be maintained across the whole OSPF autonomous system, new Area Information (AI)
    LSA is introduced. The AI LSA is a TLV-based analog of Indication- LSA that is
    used for demand circuit functionality and described in RFC1793.</p>"
