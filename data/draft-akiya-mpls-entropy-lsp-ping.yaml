abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP)
    Ping and Traceroute are used to exercise specific paths of Equal-Cost Multipath
    (ECMP). When LSP is signaled to use Entropy Label (EL) described in RFC6790, the
    ability for LSP Ping and Traceroute operation to discover and exercise ECMP paths
    has been lost in scenarios which LSRs apply deviating load balance techniques.
    One such scenario is when some LSRs apply EL based load balancing while other
    LSRs apply non-EL based load balancing (ex: IP). Another scenario is when EL based
    LSP is stitched with another LSP which can be EL based or non-EL based. This document
    extends the MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute mechanisms to restore the ability of
    exercising specific paths of ECMP over LSP which make use of Entropy Label. This
    document updates RFC4379, RFC6424 and RFC6790.</p>"
