abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to extend Unicast Reverse Path
    Forwarding(uRPF). By associating an uRPF flag with a specific route, uRPF can
    be controlled in a finer granularity than traditional one. It may be used to reduce
    the cost to network devices caused by uRPF.</p>"
