abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a "multicast domain", without requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain any per-flow state or to engage in an explicit tree-building
    protocol. There may be some routers which could not support BIER technology (We
    name them as non-BIER node in this document) in the BIER domain when deployed.
    This document specifies a solution for the BIER packet transiting the non-BIER
    nodes.</p>
