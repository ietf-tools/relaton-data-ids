abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-liu-spring-sr-energy-consumption-00] describes the types of
    energy consumption information, how to collect energy consumption information,
    and the framework for path selection based on energy consumption information.
    This document further details the process of using the PCEP protocol for energy
    consumption based path requests. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) provides mechanisms that enable Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform
    path computations in response to requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs).
    This document describes the extension to PCEP for conveying link energy consumption
    and node energy consumption, allowing path computation based on these energy consumption
    information.</p>"
