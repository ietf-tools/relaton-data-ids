abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys
    (KINK) protocol. KINK defines a low-latency, computationally inexpensive, easily
    managed, and cryptographically sound protocol to establish and maintain security
    associations using the Kerberos authentication system. KINK reuses the Quick Mode
    payloads of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE), which should lead to substantial
    reuse of existing IKE implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
