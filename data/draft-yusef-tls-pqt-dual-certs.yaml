abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the TLS 1.3 authentication mechanism to allow
    the negotiation and use of two signature algorithms to enable dual- algorithm
    hybrid authentication, ensuring that an attacker would need to break both algorithms
    to compromise the session. The two signature algorithms come from two independent
    certificates that together produce a single Certificate and CertificateVerify
    message.</p>"
