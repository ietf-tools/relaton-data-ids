abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Society (ISOC)
    hosted a day-long Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) workshop
    on 18 June 2015 in coordination with the Forum for Incident Response and Security
    Teams (FIRST) Conference in Berlin. The workshop included members of the FIRST
    community, attack response working group representatives, network and security
    operators, Regional Internet Registry (RIR) representatives, researchers, vendors,
    and representatives from standardisation communities. Key goals of the workshop
    were to improve mutual awareness, understanding, and coordination among the diverse
    participating organizations and their representatives. The workshop also aimed
    to provide the attendees with greater awareness of existing efforts to mitigate
    specific types of attacks, and greater understanding of the options available
    to collaborate and engage with these efforts.</p>"
