abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the method and bindings used to convey Evidence
    via Time-based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) in Remote ATtestation procedureS
    (RATS). TUDA does not require a challenge- response handshake and thereby does
    not rely on the conveyance of a nonce to prove freshness of remote attestation
    Evidence. TUDA enables the creation of Secure Audit Logs that can constitute believable
    Evidence about both current and past operational states of an Attester. In TUDA,
    RATS entities require access to a Handle Distributor to which a trustable and
    synchronized time-source is available. The Handle Distributor takes on the role
    of a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) to distribute Handles incorporating Time Stamp
    Tokens (TST) to the RATS entities. RATS require an Attesting Environment that
    generates believable Evidence. While a TPM is used as the corresponding root of
    trust in this specification, any other type of root of trust can be used with
    TUDA.</p>"
