abstract:
- content: "<p>Carrier-grade network management was optimized for environments built
    with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment, integration
    and maintenance efforts from network service providers. The introduction of virtualization
    technologies, from the physical layer all the way up to the application layer,
    however, invalidates several well-established assumptions in this domain. This
    draft opens the discussion in NFVRG about challenges related to transforming the
    telecom network infrastructure into an agile, model-driven production environment
    for communication services. We take inspiration from data center DevOps regarding
    how to simplify and automate management processes for a telecom service provider
    software-defined infrastructure (SDI). Among the identified challenges, we consider
    scalability of observability processes and automated inference of monitoring requirements
    from logical forwarding graphs, as well as initial placement (and re-placement)
    of monitoring functionality following changes in flow paths enforced by the controllers.
    In another category of challenges, verifying correctness of behavior for network
    functions where flow rules are no longer necessary and sufficient for determining
    the forwarding state (for example, stateful firewalls or load balancers) is very
    difficult with current technology. Finally, we introduce challenges associated
    with operationalizing DevOps principles at scale in software-defined telecom networks
    in three areas related to key monitoring, verification and troubleshooting processes.</p>"
