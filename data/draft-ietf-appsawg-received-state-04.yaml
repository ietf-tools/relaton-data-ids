abstract:
- content: "<p>This document registers a trace field clause for use in indicating
    transitions between handling queues or processing states, including enacting inter-
    and intra-host message transitions. This might include message quarantining, mailing
    list moderation, timed delivery, queuing for further analysis, content conversion,
    or other similar causes, as well as optionally identifying normal handling queues.
