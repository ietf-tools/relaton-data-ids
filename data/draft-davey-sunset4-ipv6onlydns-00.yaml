abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain name system (DNS)is a key Internet infrastructure service connecting
    the IP layer and the identifier layer of Internet. This memo describe the behavior
    and inherent limitation of DNS in IPv4 and dual-stack environment. To ease the
    problem as well as bringing some incentive to turn off IPv4 as soon as possible,
    this memo is intended to introduce potential solutions to make some changes on
    DNS protocol and operation practice in the IPv6 only network.</p>"
