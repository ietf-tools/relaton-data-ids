abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the problems with the original SNMPv2 drafts and the USEC version
    of the drafts is the tight coupling of all the features. To implement any feature
    requires all the features. This document proposes a solution to the tight coupling
    of the SNMPv2 features. It allows the developer and the user to choose which features
    are desired and which features are not for a given implementation or network.</p>"
