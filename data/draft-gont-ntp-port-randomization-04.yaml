abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes. Some of these
    modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and therefore require the
    use of a service/well-known port as the local port number. However, in the case
    of NTP modes where the use of a service/well-known port is not required, employing
    such well-known/ service port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers
    to perform blind/off-path attacks. This document formally updates RFC5905, recommending
    the use of port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP service port
    is not required.</p>"
