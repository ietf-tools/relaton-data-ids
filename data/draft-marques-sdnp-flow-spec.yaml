abstract:
- content: "<p>When IP VPNs are used to interconnect end-systems [I-D.marques-l3vpn-
    end-system] it may be desirable to introduce traffic control rules at a finer
    level of granularity than an IP destination address. This document extends the
    end-system IP VPN specification with support for fine grain traffic classification,
    filtering and redirection rules. It applies the existing BGP IP VPN flow specification
    dissemination mechanism [RFC5575] to end-system IP VPNs in order to provide the
    ability to control IP packets that match a specific pattern, which may include
    fields other than the IP destination address.</p>"
