abstract:
- content: <p>A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy, distributing traffic to a
    cluster of multiple downstream servers, can use the DNS SRV mechanism to perform
    load balancing. However, the "weight" field in the DNS SRV mechanism is intended
    for static server selection. Over time, the traffic arriving at the downstream
    SIP servers may cause them to enter an overload condition, adversely impacting
    the throughput of the SIP cluster. This document proposes to impart the dynamic
    load of each SIP server to the load distributing SIP proxy, thereby allowing it
    to load balance the traffic so as to reduce --- or even prevent --- an overload
    condition.</p>
