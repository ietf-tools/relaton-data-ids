abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) in RFC-1661 [1] provides a standard
    method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links, and
    RFCs 1662 [2] and 1619 [3] provide a means to carry PPP over Synchronous Optical
    Network (SONET) [5] and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) [6] circuits. PPP
    over Simple Data Link (SDL) using SONET/SDH with ATM-like framing (PPPEXT WG work
    in Progress) extended these standards to include a new encapsulation for PPP called
    Simple Data Link (SDL) [8]. This document extends the use of SDL over raw lightwave
    channels without an intervening SONET/SDH layer, which are also referred to as
    'dark fiber' or Packet-over-Lightwave' (POL) links</p>"
