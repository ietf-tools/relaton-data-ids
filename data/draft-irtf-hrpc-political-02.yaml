abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on
    networks, but the standards development process in the IETF has a normative effect.
    Among other things, the IETF's work affects what is perceived as technologically
    possible and useful where networking technologies are being deployed, and its
    standards reflect what is considered by the technical community to be feasible
    and good practice. Because the IETF's protocols mediate many aspects of modern
    life, and therefore contribute to the ordering of societies and communities, the
    consideration of the potential social impact of protocols should be part of the
    standardization and development process.</p>"
