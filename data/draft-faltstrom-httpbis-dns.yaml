- content: "<p>This document describes the reasons why it would be a good thing to
    use SRV [RFC2782] or URI [RFC7553] resource records for HTTP protocol instead
    of (as of today) just relying on redirects and other mechanisms in the HTTP protocol
    itself. It also explains how to do it as there are conflicting instructions on
    how to do it.</p>"
