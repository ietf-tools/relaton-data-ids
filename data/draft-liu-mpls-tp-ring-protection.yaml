abstract:
- content: "<p>according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there are two requirements
    : requirement 56.B Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP should be identical
    to simplify implementation and operation.another requirement as section 2.5.6.1
    describles: within the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization
    criteria considered in ring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the number of
    OAM entities that are needed to trigger the recovery operation; 2 Minimize the
    number of elements of recovery in the ring; 3 Minimize the number of labels required
    for the protection paths across the ring; 4 minimize the amount of control and
    management plane transactions during maintenance operation. this decument will
    describle and provide two types of ring protection solutions. both solutions can
    satisfy these requirements of recovery in mpls-tp ring network.</p>"
