abstract:
- content: "<p>The |JSON| authentication scheme provides a mechanism for exchanging
    authentication challenges and credentials as objects in the form of JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON). This scheme offers a secure mechanism of providing authenticated
    access to a set of protected HTTP resources which may be handled by scripting
    utility framework as in XMLHttpRequest calls (AJAX) or directly by the client's
    user agent. This chaining feature is unique to this scheme.</p>"
