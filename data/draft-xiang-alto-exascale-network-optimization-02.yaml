abstract:
- content: "<p>Data-intensive analytics is entering the era of multi-domain, geographically-distributed,
    collaborative computing, where different organizations contribute various resources
    to collaboratively collect, share and analyze extremely large amounts of data.
    Examples of this paradigm include the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) and A Toroidal
    LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS) experiments of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) program.
    Massive datasets continue to be acquired, simulated, processed and analyzed by
    globally distributed science networks in these collaborations, and the volume
    of this data is growing exponentially. Applications that manage and analyze such
    massive data volumes can benefit substantially from the information about networking,
    computing and storage resources from each member sites, and more directly from
    network-resident services that optimize and load balance resource usage among
    multiple data transfer and analytic requests, and achieve a better utilization
    of multi- resources in clusters. Hence this new paradigm calls for a framework
    to manage a large set of distributively owned heterogeneous resources, with the
    fundamental objective of efficient resource utilization, following the autonomy
    and privacy of resource owners. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    protocol can provide via extensions the network information about different clusters/sites,
    to both users and proactive network management services where applicable, with
    the goal of improving both application performance and network resource utilization.
    However, it has been verified in both science networks and commercial data center
    networks that network resource in many cases is not the bottleneck preventing
    the efficiency of large dataset transfer and data-intensive analytics. To achieve
    a greater overall efficiency of the science programs' workflows information about
    different resources, such as computing, storage and networking, should be provided
    to data intensive applications simultaneously. In this document, we propose that
    it is feasible to use existing ALTO services to provides not only network information,
    but also information about computation and storage resources in data analytics
    networks. We introduce a uniform resource orchestration framework (Unicorn), which
    achieves an efficient multi-resource allocation to support low-latency dataset
    transfer and data intensive analytics for collaborative computing. Unicorn provides
    simple APIs for users to submit and manage dataset transfer and analytic requests
    and to monitor the status of each request, along with fine-grained local and global
    network and site state information in real-time. It collects cluster information
    from multiple ALTO services utilizing topology extensions and leverages emerging
    SDN control capabilities to orchestrate the resource allocation for dataset transfers
    and analytic tasks, leading to improved transfer and analytic latency as well
    as more efficient utilization of multi-resources in clusters/ sites.</p>"
