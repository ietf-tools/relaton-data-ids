abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental enhancement of Path MTU Discovery
    that has the potential of reducing loss, speeding up convergence, reducing load
    in routers which would otherwise need to generate a large amount of ICMP messages,
    and alleviating certain additional problems (interactions with tunnels, Black
    Hole Detection). The idea is to use an IP Option which queries routers for their
    MTU before starting a Path MTU Discovery process. The result retrieved in this
    is used as an upper limit for Path MTU Discovery. To this end, it is fed back
    to the source either at the packetization layer (recommended) or at the IP layer.</p>"
