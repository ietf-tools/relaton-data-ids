abstract:
- content: "<p>Although SCTP provides multihoming function, a single point of failure
    may occur due to its lack of source address selection. RFC2960 describes that
    'a host should pick the most divergent source- destination pair.' But, it also
    describes that selecting source address is implementation matter. In RFC3257,
    Coene et al. have claimed that a host must take careful in selectiong its source
    address. In this document, we propose a way of outgoing interface selection and
    its corresponding source address selection in SCTP.</p>"
