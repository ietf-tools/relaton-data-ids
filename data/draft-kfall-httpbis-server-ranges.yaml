abstract:
- content: "<p>This document clarifies the semantics associated with the Content-Range
    HTTP header and associated Partial Content (206) response code. It specifically
    allows a server to produce a Content-Range response whose range is a subrange
    of the corresponding range requested using a previous Range request. The HTTP
    protocol syntax is not modified. Instead, this document clarifies that a server
    responding to a client requesting a range (x-y) may respond with a range ((x+e)-(y-f))
    for nonzero integers e,f such that (x+e) &lt; (y-f). In addition, it clarifies
    the semantics of Request ranges which contain only a starting value.</p>"
