abstract:
- content: "<p>The CBOR Encoded Message (COSE) structure syntax uses the COSE Key
    structure for placing keys in a message. This document extends the way that keys
    can be identified and transported by providing parameters that refer to or contain
    X.509 certificates in messages and in the COSE Key structure. This document defines
    a set of hash algorithms for COSE. These algorithms are needed in order to have
    X.509 certificates referred to by a thumbprint.</p>"
