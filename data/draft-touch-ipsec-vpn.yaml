abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec can secure the links of a multihop network to protect communication
    between trusted components, e.g., for a secure virtual network (VN), overlay,
    or virtual private network (VPN). Virtual links established by IPsec tunnel mode
    can conflict with routing and forwarding inside VNs because IP routing depends
    on references to interfaces and next-hop IP addresses. The IPsec tunnel mode specification
    is ambiguous on this issue, so even compliant implementations cannot be trusted
    to avoid conflicts. An alternative to tunnel mode uses non-IPsec IPIP encapsulation
    together with IPsec transport mode, which we call IIPtran. IPIP encapsulation
    occurs as a separate initial step, as the result of a forwarding lookup of the
    VN packet. IPsec transport mode processes the resulting (tunneled) IP packet with
    an SA determined through a security association database (SAD) match on the tunnel
    header. IIPtran supports dynamic routing inside the VN without changes to the
    current IPsec architecture. IIPtran demonstrates how to configure any compliant
    IPsec implementation to avoid the aforementioned conflicts. IIPtran is also compared
    to several alternative mechanisms for VN routing and their respective impact on
    IPsec, routing, policy enforcement, and interactions with the Internet Key Exchange
    (IKE). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
