abstract:
- content: "<p>Although originally conceived of as a purely IBGP device, in some cases
    a route reflector may function as an EBGP speaker in addition to its role as envisioned
    in RFC 4456. When it does so, just like any other EBGP speaker it must advertise
    its routes to its IBGP peers. This document explains what behavior is required
    of a route reflector that also functions as an EBGP speaker. It also clarifies
    the use of the ORIGINATOR_ID and CLUSTER_LIST attributes in this environment.</p>"
