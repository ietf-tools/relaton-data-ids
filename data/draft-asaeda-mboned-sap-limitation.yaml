abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [2] has historically been used
    to announce information for all available IP multicast sessions to the prospective
    receivers in the experimental MBone. Each receiver can then discover which sessions
    are available and which ones he may want to join. Although SAP is easy to use,
    SAP is not scalable and controlling the SAP message transmission in a wide area
    network is not easy. Therefore this document describes the limitations of SAP
    when used in the global Internet. Furthermore, SAP has recently been used as a
    convenient method for conveying configuration information to a set of receivers
    that are already interested by a multicast session (e.g., to carry FEC Framework
    Configuration Information [7]). This documents describes the limitations of SAP
    for this type of usage, since this latter is rather different from its original
    goals.</p>"
