abstract:
- content: "<p>Other Internet Drafts from the CONNEG working group describe a syntax[SYNTAX]
    and vocabulary[FEATURES] for negotiating media feature sets which can be used
    for transmission of a message. For example, a feature set may specify that full
    color output up to 800x600 pixels is supported, or that output can have up to
    300 dots per inch. These feature sets can be arbitrarily complex, and typical
    feature set expressions may be hundreds of bytes in length. It would be relatively
    costly to transmit such long feature set expressions, and this cost could be a
    significant obstacle to the use of the CONNEG standard to negotiate capabilities
    for Internet transactions. The problem is likely to particularly severe for low-bandwidth
    wireless connections to the Internet. This document describes an extension to
    the CONNEG syntax[SYNTAX] which allows a feature set expression to be represented
    as an absolute URL, which can then be looked up over another channel, which is
    not necessarily the channel between the negotiating parties. By using this extension,
    content negotiation between two parties can proceed with a relatively small exchange
    of data over the channel between them. Of course, the contents of the URL must
    still be found through some channel. However, the channel used to find the contents
    of the URL may have greater bandwidth than the channel between the negotiating
    parties, and may further benefit from HTTP or other caching mechanisms. This extended
    syntax is only applicable when the receiver of the feature set has the capability
    to fetch the contents of absolute URLs. In contrast, the base, unextended syntax[SYNTAX]
    is applicable to any transmission channel, without requiring any external resources
    for the feature set transmitter or the feature set receiver.</p>"
