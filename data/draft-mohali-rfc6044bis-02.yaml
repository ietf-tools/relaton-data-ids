abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the SIP History-Info header field described in RFC 7044 is
    the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header field described,
    as Historic, in RFC 5806 is nevertheless already implemented and used for conveying
    call-diversion-related information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling.
    RFC 7044 obsoletes the original RFC 4244 and redefines the History-Info header
    field for capturing the history information in requests. Since the Diversion header
    field is used in existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion
    information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution
    is needed. This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between
    the Diversion header field and the History-Info header field to handle call diversion
    information. This work is intended to enable the migration from non-standard implementations
    toward IETF specification-based implementations. This document obsoletes RFC 6044,
    which describes the interworking between the Diversion header field defined in
    RFC 5806 and the obsoleted History-Info header field defined on RFC 4244.</p>"
