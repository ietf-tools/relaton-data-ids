abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS Traffic engineering heavily relies on the correct simulation of
    traffic under normal and failure conditions. Currently traffic simulations rely
    on RSVP TE or on SPF routing with ECMP. SR introduces basically a new overlay
    on top of the L3 topology, the SR topology. The SR-topology is demand dependant.
    This document discusses issues, requirements and some solution approaches to combine
    Segment Routing and Traffic Engineering.</p>"
