abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support Fast
    Reroute (FRR) of bidirectional co-routed Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs. These
    extensions enable the re-direction of bi-directional traffic and signaling onto
    bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness of data and signaling paths in the forward
    and reverse directions after FRR. In addition, the RSVP-TE signaling extensions
    allow the coordination of bypass tunnel assignment protecting a common facility
    in both forward and reverse directions prior to or post failure occurrence.</p>"
