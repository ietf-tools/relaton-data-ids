abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal creates a mechanism for managing the ingress or egress
    of IP multicast through a firewall. It does this by defining extensions to the
    existing SOCKS V5 protocol [RFC-1928], which provides a framework for doing user-level,
    authenticated firewall traversal of unicast TCP and UDP traffic. However, because
    the current UDP support in SOCKS V5 has scalability problems as well as other
    deficiencies -- and these need to be addressed before multicast support can be
    achieved -- the extensions are defined in two parts: Base-level UDP extensions,
    and Multicast UDP extensions. Using the SOCKS framework for managing multicast
    flows in/out of an organization, offers numerous security advantages over what
    is possible with a conventional firewall approach. These are spelled out in the
    draft.</p>"
