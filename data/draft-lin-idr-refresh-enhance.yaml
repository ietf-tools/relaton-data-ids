abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain scenarios, a BGP router may not require its peer to update
    all routes within an address family, but rather only the specific routes it needs.
    For example, in an EVPN network, a router might only require updates for all MAC/IP
    Advertisement Routes or all IP Prefix Advertisement Routes, or even just a subset
    of IP Prefix routes. This document presents a method for requesting the update
    of specific routes from a peer, thereby minimizing the impact of additional BGP
    updates.</p>"
