abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric password
    authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual authentication in a client-server
    setting without reliance on PKI and with security against pre-computation attacks
    upon server compromise. Prior aPAKE protocols did not use salt and if they did,
    the salt was transmitted in the clear from server to user allowing for the building
    of targeted pre-computed dictionaries. OPAQUE security has been proven by Jarecki
    et al. (Eurocrypt 2018) in a strong and universally composable formal model of
    aPAKE security. In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy and the ability
    to hide the password from the server even during password registration. Strong
    security, versatility through modularity, good performance, and an array of additional
    features make OPAQUE a natural candidate for practical use and for adoption as
    a standard. To this end, this draft presents several instantiations of OPAQUE
    and ways of integrating OPAQUE with TLS. This draft presents a high-level description
    of OPAQUE, highlighting its components and modular design. It also provides the
    basis for a specification for standardization but a detailed specification ready
    for implementation is beyond the scope of this document. Implementers of OPAQUE
    should ONLY follow the precise specification in the upcoming draft-irtf-cfrg-opaque.</p>"
