abstract:
- content: "<p>Route optimization defines extensions to Mobile IP Registration Requests
    that allow datagrams in flight when a mobile node moves, and datagrams sent based
    on an out-of-date cached binding, to be forwarded directly to the mobile node's
    new binding. These extensions for smooth handoff require a registration key to
    be established between the mobile node and foreign agent. This document defines
    additional extensions to the registration requests to allow for the establishment
    of single-use registration keys between a mobile node and foreign agent.</p>"
