abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped Sequence numbers), defined
    in RFC1323, is to protect a TCP connection against old duplicate segments from
    the same connection. There is a possibility, however, that PAWS may discard valid
    reordered segments. This memo proposes a modification to PAWS to solve this problem.</p>"
