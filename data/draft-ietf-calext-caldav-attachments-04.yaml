abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification adds an extension to the Calendaring Extensions
    to WebDAV (CalDAV) to allow attachments associated with iCalendar data to be stored
    and managed on the server. This specification documents existing code deployed
    by multiple vendors. It is published as an Informational specification rather
    than Standards Track due to its noncompliance with multiple best current practices
    of HTTP.</p>"
