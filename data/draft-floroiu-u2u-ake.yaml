abstract:
- content: "<p>The present draft describes an user-to-user (u2u) authenticated key
    exchange mechanism based on the UMTS AKA mechanism [1]. The proposed scheme is
    based on the generation of security tokens (in fact encrypted public Diffie-Hellman
    keys) by the peer's operator. Such a security token along with credential information
    contained within the peer's AKA Authentication Vector (AV) enables two communicating
    peers to securely derive a shared key.</p>"
