abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS protection
    mechanisms using the terminology defined in [TERMID]. An overview of existing
    MPLS protection terminology and functionality is provided as as background for
    the methodology. The methodology can be applied to any MPLS protection mechanisms
    such as Standby LSP, Fast Reroute Detour Mode, and Fast Reroute Bypass Mode. The
    methodology can also be used to benchmark LSP rerouting due to a Headend Reroute.
    The data plane is measured to obtain the benchmarking metrics. Discussion is included
    to explain the differences between MPLS Protection mechanisms, the network events
    that cause failover, and the benefits of measuring the data plane for black-box
    MPLS Protection benchmarking. Measurements can be used to compare failover performance
    of different Label-Switched Routers and evaluate the different MPLS protection
    mechanisms.</p>"
