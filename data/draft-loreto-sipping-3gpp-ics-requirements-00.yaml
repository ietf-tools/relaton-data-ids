abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing the capability
    to support different communication services on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as
    a SIP infrastructure, such as push-to- talk over cellular (PoC), Multimedia Telephony
    or IMS messaging. As there are different services and is not safe to rely on the
    expressed media as a means to identify the requested communication service because
    the media may be used in different communication services, then there is the need
    to have an unambiguous way of identifying communication services and applications
    utilizing the logic of communication services as explicitly as possible. In this
    document, we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support the identification
    of communication services and applications on a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    infrastructure and IMS applications using them.</p>"
