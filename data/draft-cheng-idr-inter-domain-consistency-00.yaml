abstract:
- content: "<p>The AS_PATH attribute of BGP UPDATE records the AS number that it has
    passed through. Ideally, the traffic to the destination IP prefixes in NLRI of
    BGP UPDATE should be reversely forwarded along the AS path recorded in the AS_PATH.
    However, due to other factors such traffic redirection, traffic engineering, and
    route aggregation, the actual forwarding AS path of the packet is usually different
    from the propagation path of BGP UPDATE. In other words, inter-domain routing
    and forwarding are usually inconsistent, which results in that inter- domain forwarding
    has security risks such as traffic black hole, loop, detour and the malicious
    AS, etc. Consistent inter-domain routing and forwarding greatly contributes to
    enhanced inter-domain forwarding security and visibility, which facilitates the
    long-term evolution of the Internet</p>"
