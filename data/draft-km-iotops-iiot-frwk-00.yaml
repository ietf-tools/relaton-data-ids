abstract:
- content: "<p>Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols
    supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections. These networks are physically
    separated from the enterprise networks and have been slow to adopt the virtualization
    technologies. Virtualization is necessary to remove the boundaries between the
    enterprise and process control networks. This document specifies a framework for
    the converged industrial network. Specifically, it focuses on the virtual PLC
    scenario. It covers transition technologies required for the convergence of industrial
    devices with the enterprise application endpoints.</p>"
