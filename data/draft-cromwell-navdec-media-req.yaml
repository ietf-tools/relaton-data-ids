abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the functional requirements for protocol used
    by a call processing agent in a packet network to control an media services function
    located in the same packet network or at the inter- face of the packet network
    and the traditional telephone network. The primary focus of the protocol is on
    audio, however the protocol could be extended in the future to support other media
    streams such as video. The protocol provides the standard audio operations of
    play audio, collect DTMF, and record speech. It supports direct references to
    simple audio as well as indirect references to simple and complex audio. It provides
    multi-language audio variables, interruptibility of audio, digit buffer control,
    special key sequences, and support for reprompting during data collection. The
    approach used in specifying protocol functionality was to look at several existing
    protocols currently in use in the telephone network, taking the best concepts
    from each and attempting to avoid any limi- tations. The following protocols were
    examined: ITU CS1-R [2], Nor- tel Extended CS1-R [3], Bellcore GR-1129 [4], and
    Bellcore SR-3511 [5]. The protocol described in this document provides at a minimum
    a superset of the functionality of these protocols.</p>"
