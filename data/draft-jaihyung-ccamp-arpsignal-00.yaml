abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, we first discuss some weaknesses of proposals employing
    RSVP in local network, such as RFC2814, 2815, 2816, and propose extension of ARP
    (Address Resolution Protocol) and [LSE] technique for solution to provide QoS
    in Ethernet based Customer Premise Network (ECPN). Framework architecture of LSE
    (Label Switched Ethernet) as a method of GMPLS implementation for Ethernet is
    described in [LSE]. ARP is proposed for integrated signaling and routing protocol
    in ECPN. This document describes overview of ARP extension, procedure for label
    negotiation and method for QoS routing. Major features of this ARP extension are;
    support for label switching, incorporation of routing function, compatibility
    with legacy Ethernet and enhanced security.</p>"
