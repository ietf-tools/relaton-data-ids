abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft specifies an Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) that
    is intended to be version 1.0. This protocol is heavily influence by the semantic
    operations and attributes defined in ISO/IEC 10175 Document Printing Application
    (DPA) parts 1 and 3. It also incorporates some of the implementation and interoperability
    lessons learned from other printing related standards such as POSIX System Administration
    - Part 4 (POSIX 1378.4) and X/Open A Printing System Interoperability Specification
    (PSIS). IPP is defined as a set of abstract data types and operations. The operations
    are implemented using a simple request and response mechanism built on top of
    HTTP. The abstract data types are encoded as simple ASCII text strings. The IPP
    protocol covers only end user operations on basic print service objects. Authentication
    is realized by mechanisms outside the scope of the protocol, but the protocol
    does introduce some access control functionality so that only authorized end users
    are allowed to submit print jobs to printers whose implementation and site policy
    support access control. Also, the Cancel Job operation requires some authentication
    so that jobs can</p>"
