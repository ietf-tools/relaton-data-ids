abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview or 'roadmap' of the work done by
    the IETF PKIX working group. It describes some of the terminology used in the
    working group's documents, and the theory behind an X.509-based Public Key Infrastructure,
    Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI), and Time Stamping and Data Certification
    Infrastructures. It identifies each document developed by the PKIX working group,
    and describes the relationships among the various documents. It also provides
    advice to would-be PKIX implementors about some of the issues discussed at length
    during PKIX development, in hopes of making it easier to build implementations
    that will actually interoperate.</p>"
