abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an opportunistic SRTP key exchange mechanism
    to get the best-case SRTP keys, using a slightly modified version of Security
    Descriptions model [secdes], followed by a second-stage media-plane key exchange
    based on [XXX]. There are several distinct advantages to this mechanism over others;
    these benefits are documented herein. The main goal of this draft is to put forth
    a strawman proposal to perform a 2-stage key-exchange, first via a [secdes] style
    mechanism, then through a media-plane mechanism.</p>"
