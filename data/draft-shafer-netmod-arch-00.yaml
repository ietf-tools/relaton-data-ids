abstract:
- content: "<p>NETCONF and YANG are pieces of an ambitious plan to improve network
    management. NETCONF gives access to native capabilities of the devices within
    a network, defining methods for manipulating configuration databases, retrieving
    operational data, and invoking specific operations. YANG provides the means to
    define the content trafficked via NETCONF, both data and operations. Using both
    technologies, the standards modules can be defined to give interoperability and
    commonality to devices, while still allowing devices to express their unique capabilities.
    This document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build network management applications
    that meet the needs of network services providers. An architecture is described
    which is friendly to both devices and applications, to vendors and standards bodies,
    to young and to old, to red states and to blue states. It's a startling vision,
    coming to networks near you starting August, 2009.</p>"
