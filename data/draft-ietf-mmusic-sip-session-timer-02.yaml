abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the SIP specification. This
    extension adds a new message header that is used to specify the duration of a
    requested session. The session timer can be used to control the duration of a
    session if, for instance, one of the participants in the session wants to limit
    the cost of the session. It can also be used by stateful SIP Proxy Servers to
    track the status of sessions for which session state exists on the servers. Currently
    a stateful SIP Proxy Server that is not handling the media stream(s) for the session
    has no mechanism to definitively determine the state of all sessions for which
    it has state. While the SIP Specification does provide the BYE method for terminating
    the session, there is no mechanism for a SIP Proxy Server to detect the end of
    a session when the BYE message is not sent or is lost due to network problems.</p>"
