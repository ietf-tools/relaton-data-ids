abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, we introduce the generic Route Optimization (RO) model
    that can be used as a framework to evaluate the existing RO models. Then, we analyze
    typical RO problems by virtue of that. And, we discuss on the feasibility of achieving
    a unified RO in NEMO, and enumerate the issues that should be cleared for the
    purpose of that.</p>"
