abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the guidelines for security policy translation
    in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) Framework. When I2NSF User
    delivers a high-level security policy for a security service, Security Policy
    Translator in Security Controller translates it into a low-level security policy
    for Network Security Functions (NSFs). For this security policy translation, this
    document specifies the relation between a high-level security policy based on
    the Consumer-Facing Interface YANG data model and a low-level security policy
    based on the NSF-Facing Interface YANG data model. Also, it describes an architecture
    of a security policy translator along with an NSF database, and the process of
    security policy translation with the NSF database.</p>"
