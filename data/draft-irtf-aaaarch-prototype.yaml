abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document a prototype of an AAA (Authentication, Authorization,
    Accounting) server is presented. The prototype is build in accordance with the
    RFCs 2903, 2904 and 2905. As the AAA concept is a multi-tier concept we have chosen
    for JAVA Enterprise Beans (J2EE) to build the prototype. New techniques and protocols
    supported by the J2EE platform are discussed. Web service standards like SOAP
    are explored. A general architecture of an AAA server is outlined in Enterprise
    JavaBeans (EJB) component architecture.</p>"
