abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to use information associated with a trust
    anchor public key when validating certification paths. This information can be
    used to constrain the usage of a trust anchor. Typically, constraints are used
    to limit the certificate policies and names that can appear in certification paths
    validated using a trust anchor. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
