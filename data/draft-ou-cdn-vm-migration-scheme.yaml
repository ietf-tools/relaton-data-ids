abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual machine migration is a critical requirement in today's data
    centers to support services dynamically deployed in distributed infrastructures.
    To keep the uniform environment required by application software, large number
    of networking based solutions have been presented to provide data center interconnection
    for virtual resource management. Aiming at simplifying networking complexities
    in off-site service deployment, this document presents a framework based on content
    delivery network for supporting virtual machine migration over the legacy wide
    area network.</p>"
