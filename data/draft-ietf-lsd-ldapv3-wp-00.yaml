abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different white pages schema proposals have been published for
    use in LDAPv3 as well as other directory service protocols. While these proposals
    define schema elements that are indeed useful in the deployment of LDAPv3-based
    directory services, there are a few problems common to the set of such proposals
    currently available to implementors: inconsistent semantic and syntactic definitions
    of similar attributes across schema, little or no semantic extensibility of attribute
    definitions without changing source code for deployed implementations, lack of
    standard object class definitions for containing white pages meta schema elements,
    and lack of an attribute grouping method. This document defines an object class
    for holding IWPS attributes as mapped into existing and relatively few newly defined
    extensible attribute types.</p>"
