abstract:
- content: "<p>IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced functions
    (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions). This document defines a
    solution to enforce Service Function Chaining (SFC) with minimum requirements
    on the underlying network. The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding
    (DiffForward): packets are classified and marked at the entry point of an SFC-enabled
    network, and are then forwarded on a per SFC map basis.</p>"
