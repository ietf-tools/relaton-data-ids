abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a notional research agenda for collaborative
    multi-stakeholder research related to a future post-quantum DNSSEC ecosystem.
    It is inspired by the anticipation that adoption of Post- Quantum signature algorithms
    will have enough operational impact on DNSSEC that either DNS protocol enhancements
    will be needed, or DNS will move away from UDP as the prevalent DNS transport,
    or a combination of both will be needed. Some members of the DNS technical community
    have even suggested evaluating alternatives to DNSSEC and potentially adopting
    an alternative protocol or practices to assure the integrity of DNS responses.
    Given the potential impact of such changes on the DNS ecosystem, the authors believe
    collaborative multi-stakeholder research into the impact of proposed changes should
    be performed to inform adoption and standardization activities.</p>"
