abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines two YANG modules, one module to configure a NETCONF
    client and the other module to configure a NETCONF server. Both modules support
    both the SSH and TLS transport protocols, and support both standard NETCONF and
    NETCONF Call Home connections. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This
    draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values
    at the time of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that
    are needed. No other RFC Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document.
    Artwork in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in progress.
    Please apply the following replacements (note: not all may be present): * AAAA
    --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto- types * BBBB --&gt;
    the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-trust- anchors * CCCC --&gt; the
    assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore * DDDD --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client- server * EEEE --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client- server * FFFF --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client- server * GGGG --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-http- client-server * HHHH --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for this draft Artwork in this document contains placeholder values
    for the date of publication of this draft. Please apply the following replacement:
    * 2024-02-04 --&gt; the publication date of this draft The "Relation to other
    RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains the text "one or more YANG modules" and, later,
    "modules". This text is sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how
    many modules a draft defines. The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved
    by stating more directly how many modules are defined. The "Relation to other
    RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains a self- reference to this draft, along with
    a corresponding reference in the Appendix. Please replace the self-reference in
    this section with "This RFC" (or similar) and remove the self-reference in the
    "Normative/Informative References" section, whichever it is in. Tree-diagrams
    in this draft may use the ''\'' line-folding mode defined in RFC 8792. However,
    nicer-to-the-eye is when the ''\\'' line-folding mode is used. The AD suggested
    suggested putting a request here for the RFC Editor to help convert "ugly" ''\''
    folded examples to use the ''\\'' folding mode. "Help convert" may be interpreted
    as, identify what looks ugly and ask the authors to make the adjustment. The following
    Appendix section is to be removed prior to publication: * Appendix A. Change Log</p>'
