abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an attack against SIP networks where a small
    number of legitimate, even authorized, SIP requests can stimulate massive amounts
    of proxy-to-proxy traffic. The document analysis ways to limit the impact of this
    kind of attack, and proposes changes to the SIP protocol to help mitigate the
    risk. The document also proposes ways to improve diagnosis of failures caused
    by the hop limit being reached. The purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion
    of the identified problem and proposed solutions. Much of the proposed solution
    language appears normative, but implementors should not treat the current document
    as such. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working
    group list at 'sipping@ietf.org'.</p>"
