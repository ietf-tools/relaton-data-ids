abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we analyze the point-to-point (P2P) routing performance
    of RPL by comparing the shortest P2P route costs in a sample network topology
    with the corresponding costs when routing along a tree built to minimize the routing
    costs to the tree's root.</p>"
