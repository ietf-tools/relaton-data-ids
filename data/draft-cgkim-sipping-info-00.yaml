abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the INFO usage for IP-surveillance application.
    SIP is used as a means of incorporating terminals of different vendors. In this
    draft, mid-control commands, for example, retrieving server images or saving images
    in the server are defined and delivered as session names of INVITE messages. IN
    addition to that, INFO definitions specific to the application are described.
    For example, camera control like PTZ(Pen, Tilt, Zoom) information is defined for
    the purpose of standardization of controls.</p>"
