abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes operational information for deploying multicast
    network with link layer tunneling mechanism which defined in [RFC3077]. RFC3077
    defines the mechanism which allows a operator to integrate unidirectional link(e.g.
    satellite link etc..) into the network transparently. In some multicast network
    configuration, a certain configuration for unidirectional link are necessary.
    This document clarifies the problem that exist when a operator use a multicast
    routing protocol with link layer tunneling mechanism. It also describes how to
    solve those problem with short term solutions and also long term solutions. This
    document does not define any new protocol.</p>"
