abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a service-identifying label that allows venue-based
    services that are locally offered by the venue owner to be identified. In particular,
    we define labels for the most known and common venue services (e.g. mapping and
    printer). These labels can be used by IEEE 802.11 and service discovery protocols
    to discover the available services specific to the venue and accessible via the
    Wireless LAN.</p>"
