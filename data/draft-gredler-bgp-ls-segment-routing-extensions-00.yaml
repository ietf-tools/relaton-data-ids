abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths within link-state graphs by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths,
    called "segments". The link-state routing protocols (IS-IS, OSPF and OSPFv3) have
    been extended to advertise the segments. But flooding based propagation of path
    segments using IGPs is limited by the perimeter of the IGP domain. For building
    paths which span across IGP domains (e.g. multiple ASes), the Border Gataway Protocol
    (BGP) is better suited as its propagation perimeter is not limited like the IGPs.
    This draft defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family to carry path
    segment information via BGP.</p>
