abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the data model and Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) representation for the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
    (XCCDF) Version 1.1.4. An XCCDF document is a structured collection of security
    configuration rules for some set of target systems. The XCCDF specification is
    designed to support information interchange, document generation, organizational
    and situational tailoring, automated compliance testing, and compliance scoring.
    The specification also defines a data model and format for storing results of
    security guidance or checklist compliance testing. The intent of XCCDF is to provide
    a uniform foundation for expression of security checklists and other configuration
    guidance, and thereby foster more widespread application of good security practices.</p>"
