abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SSTP (Simple SCCP Tunneling Protocol), a protocol
    architecture that provides the support of SCCP and TCAP user applications over
    an IP network. The purpose of SSTP is to provide a standard tunneling protocol
    to convey SCCP messages over an IP based network. Address mapping from PSTN signalling
    to IP is not in the scope of this draft. Therefore SSTP only deals with IP addresses.
    TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages. TCP is used for SCCP class 1, 2
    or 3. SSTP provides seamless connection between nodes implementing SSTP and classical
    SS7 nodes by means of an SSTP gateway. The design of SSTP is oriented to fulfill
    the requirements of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.</p>"
