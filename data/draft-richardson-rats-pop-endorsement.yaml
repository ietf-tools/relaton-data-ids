abstract:
- content: "<p>Some aspects of a device can not be intuited by the device itself.
    For instance, a router platform may have no way to know what color the case is,
    where in a cabinet it is located, or which electrical circuit it is connected
    to. This kind of information must be provided through an Endorsement: a statement
    from a third party. These statements may require human audiitors to inspect the
    device physically. But, which device is really in front of an auditor? This document
    describes a mechanism by which an auditor can make physical contact with a device
    and collect information to identify the device in a cryptographically strong manner.
    This protocol is not designed to run over Internet Protocol cabling, but rather
    over mechanisms such as USB cables, or serial consoles.</p>"
