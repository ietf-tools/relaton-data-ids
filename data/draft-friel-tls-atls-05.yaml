abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how TLS and DTLS can be used at the application
    layer for the purpose of establishing secure end-to-end encrypted communication
    security. Encodings for carrying TLS and DTLS payloads are specified for HTTP
    and CoAP to improve interoperability. While the use of TLS and DTLS is straight
    forward we present multiple deployment scenarios to illustrate the need for end-to-end
    application layer encryption and the benefits of reusing a widely deployed and
    readily available protocol. Application software architectures for building, and
    network architectures for deploying application layer TLS are outlined.</p>"
