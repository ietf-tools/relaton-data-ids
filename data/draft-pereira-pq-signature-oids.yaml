abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 3279 by specifying additional algorithm identifiers
    and ASN.1 encoding rules for the nine selected post- quantum digital signature
    algorithms running in the second round of NIST standardization process when using
    SHA3 or SHAKE as the underlying hashing algorithms. This specification applies
    (but it is not limited to) to the Internet X.509 Public Key infrastructure (PKI)
    and its post-quantum counterpart (not yet standardized), when post- quantum digital
    signatures are used to sign certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).</p>"
