abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Via
    header field parameter, "keep", which allows adjacent SIP entities to explicitly
    negotiate usage of the Network Address Translation (NAT) keep-alive mechanisms
    defined in SIP Outbound, in cases where SIP Outbound is not supported, cannot
    be applied, or where usage of keep-alives is not implicitly negotiated as part
    of the SIP Outbound negotiation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
