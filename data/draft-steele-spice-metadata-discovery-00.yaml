abstract:
- content: "<p>Entities interested in digital credentials need to express and discover
    preferences for working with them. Before issuance, holders need to discover what
    credentials are supported, and issuers need to discover if a holder's wallet is
    safe enough to store their credentials. Before presentation, holder's need to
    discovery verifier's encryption keys, and which presentation formats a verifier
    supports. After presentation, verifiers need to discover any new key material
    or status changes related to credentials. This document enables issuers, holders
    and verifiers to discover supported protocols and formats for keys, claims, credentials
    and proofs.</p>"
