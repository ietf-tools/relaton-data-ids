abstract:
- content: "<p>NICS is a proposed system which meets the requirements of large-scale,
    unique principal identification, for use in conjunction with an arbitrary set
    of security systems such as have been proposed by members of the IETF. This proposal
    outlines the motivation for the development of NICS, and gives a general description
    of its internal workings and interfaces with higher-level protocols. It should
    be emphasized up front that NICS is not a complete security system, nor does it
    aim to replace any existing components of the internet which already work. The
    design draws off the fact that many security systems already have flexible name
    schemes, and are therefore considered components which are used in conjunction
    with NICS to achieve an improved level of service, flexibility and reliability,
    while introducing many desirable features such as anonymous identifiers, self-optimization,
    and low-overhead operation. For the purpose of initial evaluation, the remainder
    of this paper is short and to the point, and requires a little work on the reader's
    side to understand the reasoning. Additional discussion is welcome on the mailing
    list.</p>"
