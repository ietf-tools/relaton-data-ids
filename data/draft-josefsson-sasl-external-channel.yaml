abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to perform client authentication in the
    Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework by referring to the
    client authentication provided by an external security layer. We specify a SASL
    mechanism family EXTERNAL-* and one instance EXTERNAL-TLS that rely on the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This mechanism differs to the existing EXTERNAL
    mechanism by alleviating the a priori assumptions that servers and clients needs
    somehow negotiate out of band which secure channel that is intended. This document
    also discuss the implementation of authorization decisions. See &lt;http://josefsson.org/external-channel/&gt;
    for more information.</p>"
