abstract:
- content: "<p>The primary function of a network is to transport packets and deliver
    them according to a service level objective. Understanding both where and why
    packet loss occurs within a network is essential for effective network operation.
    Device-reported packet loss is the most direct signal for network operations to
    identify customer impact resulting from unintended packet loss. This document
    defines an information model for packet loss reporting, which classifies these
    signals to enable automated network mitigation of unintended packet loss.</p>"
