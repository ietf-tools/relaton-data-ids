abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN (Ethernet VPNs) provides an extensible and flexible multihoming
    VPN solution over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant
    Systems and End Devices that can be physical or virtual. EVPN multihoming with
    Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) is one of the common deployment scenarios.
    There are deployments which requires capability to have multiple subnets designated
    with multiple VLAN IDs in single broadcast domain. EVPN technology defines three
    different types of service interface which serve different requirements but none
    of them address the requirement of supporting multiple subnets within single broadcast
    domain. In this draft we define new service interface type to support multiple
    subnets in single broadcast domain. Service interface proposed in this draft will
    be applicable to multihoming case only.</p>"
