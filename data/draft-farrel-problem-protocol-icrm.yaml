abstract:
- content: "<p>Procedures in place and currently being developed within the IETF encourage
    the development and agreement of clear requirements before the new protocols or
    protocol extensions are accepted as work items. This does not preclude nor prohibit
    individuals from engaging in such protocol work outside of the IETF, but it acknowledges
    that acceptance of the work may be subject to proving the requirements through
    a requirements document or through deployment and usage experience. That work
    within the IETF on a requirements document may change the underlying assumptions
    made by protocol developers and thereby render their work obsolete or risible
    is a risk taken by all who spend their time enhancing the set of available protocols
    without first agreeing the requirements. At the same time, some problem statements
    or requirement documents are very narrowly scoped to address a very specific need.
    There is a risk that the development of a solution to such a precise problem may
    be non-extensible and may make the protocol unusable in a wider context. This
    document examines the need to avoid tying new protocol developments too tightly
    to the problem statement or requirement documents. It uses an example from the
    ITU ASON requirements for signaling protocols within optical networks to illustrate
    how adhering to the requirements statement too zealously may unnecessarily restrict
    the applicability of the protocol in a wider context.</p>"
