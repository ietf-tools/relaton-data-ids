abstract:
- content: "<p>A single JSON document can have multiple logically equivalent physical
    representations. While convenient for human interaction, this flexibility is inconvenient
    for cases where a machine is used to assess the logical equivalence of documents.
    In cases where logical equivalence is useful, an encoder should produce a canonical
    form of a JSON document. For example, since digital signatures demand the same
    physical representation for logically equivalent documents, a canonical physical
    representation would allow the signature to apply to the logical document. This
    internet draft has the goal to define a canonical form of JSON documents. Two
    logically equivalent documents should have same canonical form.</p>"
