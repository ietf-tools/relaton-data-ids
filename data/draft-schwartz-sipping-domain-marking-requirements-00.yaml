abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP as defined in RFC 3261 [1] defines a Via header as a construct
    to be used for upstream response routing and for downstream assistance in loop
    detection. There is an increasing need on downstream administrative domains (ADs)
    to gain visibility into all the ADs in its upstream path. The information needed
    is not IP based as internal architectures at upstream ADs is of no consequence
    to downstream ADs. Logical domain marking, however, is desperately needed for
    any traffic analysis to occur at the receiving side. Gathering AD information
    from Via headers is non obvious and in many instances nearly impossible. This
    documents identifies the requirements for addressing this issue.</p>"
