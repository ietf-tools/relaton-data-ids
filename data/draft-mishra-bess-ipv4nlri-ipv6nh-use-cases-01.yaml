abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport such as MPLS LDPv6, SR- MPLSv6 or SRv6,
    Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of the
    core from IPv4 to IPv6 being able to continue to support legacy IPv4, VPN-IPv4,
    and Multicast VPN IPv4 customers. Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the
    set of usable next-hop address families is determined by the Address Family Identifier
    (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). Historically the AFI/SAFI
    definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a
    Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising IPv4 or VPN-IPv4
    Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI). [RFC5549] specifies the extensions
    necessary to allow advertising IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address
    that belongs to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI
    definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI
    to also belong to the IPv6 Protocol. [RFC5549] defines the encoding of the Next
    Hop to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a
    new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they
    can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop. With this new
    MP-BGP capability exchange allows the BGP peering session to act as a pure transport
    to allow the session to carry Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent
    Address Family Identifier (SAFI) for both IPv4 and IPv6. This document describes
    the critical use case and OPEX savings of being able to leverage the MP-BGP capability
    exchange usage as a pure transport allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 to be carried over
    the same BGP TCP session. By doing so, allows for the elimination of Dual Stacking
    on the PE-CE connections making the peering IPv6-ONLY to now carry both IPv4 and
    IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI). This document also provides
    a possible solution for IXPs (Internet Exchange points) that are facing IPv4 address
    depletion at these peering points to use BGP-MP capability exchange defined in
    [RFC5549] to carry IPv4 (Network Layer Reachability Information) NLRI in an IPv6
    next hop using the [RFC5565] softwire mesh framework.</p>"
