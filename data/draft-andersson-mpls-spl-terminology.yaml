abstract:
- content: '<p>This document discusses and recommends a terminology that may be used
    when MPLS Special Purpose Labels (SPL) are specified and documented. Note: The
    rest of the text in this section is not really part of the abstract even though
    the text is placed here. It is working notes. Note: At least at the moment it
    is not the intention to take this document to an RFC, but it might be polled to
    become a wg document to see if the MPLS working group agree on the proposed terminology.
    Note: The changes we propose are minor, but we might have to progress the document
    to RFC since there is a proposed change to the "Special- Purpose Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Label Values" registry.</p>'
