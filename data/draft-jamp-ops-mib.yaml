    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects used for Flow Through Provisioning from a network management
    system at the Network Operation Center (NOC) of carriers or service providers.
    This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2
    SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions.</p>"
