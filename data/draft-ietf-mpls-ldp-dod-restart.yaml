abstract:
- content: "<p>LDP graceful restart is a mechanism that helps reduce the negative
    effects on MPLS traffic caused by the restart of a Label Switching Router's (LSR's)
    control plane, specifically by the restart of its Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) component [RFC3036], on LSRs that are capable of preserving MPLS forwarding
    state across the restart. [RFC3478] defines procedures for LDP graceful restart
    for downstream unsolicited label distribution but leaves procedures for downstream
    on demand label distribution a subject for future study. This document defines
    graceful restart procedures for downstream on demand label distribution.</p>"
