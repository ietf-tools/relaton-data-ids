abstract:
- content: "<p>With current Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support, all communications
    to and from Mobile Network Nodes must go through the bi-directional tunnel established
    between the Mobile Router and Home Agent when the mobile network is away. This
    sub-optimal routing results in various inefficiencies associated with packet delivery,
    such as increased delay and bottleneck links leading to traffic congestion, which
    can ultimately disrupt all communications to and from the Mobile Network Nodes.
    Additionally, with nesting of Mobile Networks, these inefficiencies get compounded,
    and stalemate conditions may occur in specific dispositions. This document investigates
    such problems and provides the motivation behind Route Optimization (RO) for NEMO.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
