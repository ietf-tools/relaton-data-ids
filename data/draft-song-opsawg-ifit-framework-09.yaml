abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient network operation increasingly relies on data-plane telemetry.
    As networks increase in scale and network operations become more sophisticated,
    traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include
    proactive and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes, become
    more susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration errors. With the
    advent of programmable data-plane, emerging on-path telemetry techniques provide
    unprecedented flow insight and realtime notification of network issues (e.g.,
    jitter, increased latency, packet loss, significant bit error variations, and
    unequal load- balancing). This document enumerates several key deployment challenges
    and requirements for on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier operator
    networks. To address these issues, this document outlines a high-level framework,
    In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT). iFIT provides several essential components
    that can be assembled to achieve a complete and efficient solution for on-path
    telemetry. As a reference and open framework, iFIT only describes the basic functions
    of each identified component and suggests possible applications. It does not specify
    the implementation of the components and the interfaces between the components.
    The compliance of iFIT framework is not mandated either. This informational document
    aims to clarify the problem domain, and summarize the best practices and sensible
    system design considerations. The iFIT framework helps to guide the analysis on
    the current standard status and gaps, and motivate new works to complete the ecosystem.
    It also helps to inspire innovative network telemetry applications supporting
    advanced network operations.</p>"
