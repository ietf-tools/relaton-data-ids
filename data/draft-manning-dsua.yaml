- content: "<p>This document lists most of the existent special use prefixes from
    the IPv4 space that have been registered with the IANA and now RIRs and provides
    some suggestions for operational procedures when these prefixes are encountered.
    This document does not address IPv4 space that is not registered with the IANA/RIRs
    for special use or address space that is reserved for future delegation in the
    operational Internet. Notice is given to prefixes that manufacturers have co-opted.</p>"
