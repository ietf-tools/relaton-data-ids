abstract:
- content: <p>This paper describes an extremely efficient and reliable real-time "Selective
    Repeat" protocol that was implemented as the backbone transmission protocol for
    the largest financial information network in the United States during the 1980's
    and 1990's. The protocol is capable of working efficiently in all environments
    including those with substantial delay and high error or congestion rates, transmitting
    optimally down to the point that there is one error per block, never resending
    a block that has been received correctly and always sending the blocks in an order
    which is optimal for expeditious delivery. This protocol represents a new way
    of looking at "Selective Repeat" protocols and the concepts it introduces have
    wide applicability in other protocols. It works equally well in point to multi-point
    environments as it does point to point ones. It has been used as both a link level
    and a transport level protocol.</p>
