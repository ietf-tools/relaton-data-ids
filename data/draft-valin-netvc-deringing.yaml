abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a deringing filter that takes into account
    the direction of edges and patterns being filtered. The filter works by identifying
    the direction of each block and then adaptively filtering along the identified
    direction. In a second pass, the blocks are also filtered in a different direction,
    with more conservative thresholds to avoid blurring edges. The proposed deringing
    filter is shown to improve the quality of both Daala and the Alliance for Open
    Media (AOM) video codec.</p>"
