abstract:
- content: "<p>With increasing use of DLT (distributed ledger technology) systems,
    including blockchain systems and networks, for virtual assets, there is a need
    for asset-related data and metadata to traverse system boundaries and link their
    respective business workflows. Systems and networks can define and project views,
    or asset states, outside of their boundaries, as well as guard them using access
    control policies, and external agents or other systems can address those views
    in a globally unique manner. Universal interoperability requires such systems
    and networks to request and supply views via gateway nodes using a request-response
    protocol. The endpoints of this protocol lie within the respective systems or
    in networks of peer nodes, but the cross-system protocol occurs through the systems’
    respective gateways. The inter-gateway protocol that allows an external party
    to request a view by an address and a DLT system to return a view in response
    must be DLT-neutral and mask the internal particularities and complexities of
    the DLT systems. The view generation and verification modules at the endpoints
    must obey the native consensus logic of their respective networks.</p>"
