abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer a packet flow along
    any path using a segment list which is referred to as a SR Policy. Intermediate
    per-flow states are eliminated thanks to source routing. The header of a packet
    steered in an SR Policy is augmented with the ordered list of segments associated
    with that SR Policy. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is used to monitor
    different kinds of paths between node. BFD mechanisms can be also used to monitor
    the availability of the path indicated by a SR Policy and to detect any failures.
    Seamless BFD (S-BFD) extensions provide a simplified mechanism which is suitable
    for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a large scale. This
    document describes the use of Seamless BFD (S-BFD) mechanism to monitor the SR
    Policies that are used for Traffic Engineering (TE) in SR deployments.</p>"
