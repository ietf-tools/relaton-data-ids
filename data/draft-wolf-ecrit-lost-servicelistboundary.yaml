abstract:
- content: "<p>LoST maps service identifiers and location information to service contact
    URIs. If a LoST client wants to discover available services for a particular location,
    it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt; query to the LoST server. However,
    the response from the LoST server does not provide information about the geographical
    region for which the returned service list is valid. Therefore, this document
    proposes a ServiceListBoundary to assist the client to not miss a change in available
    services when moving.</p>"
