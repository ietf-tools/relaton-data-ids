abstract:
- content: "<p>IKE SAs may have one or more child SAs that are used for traffic protection.
    This document collects arguments for (and against) having more fine-grained sub-child-SAs.
    They can be used to separate data streams for various technical reasons but share
    the same security properties and traffic selectors. This shall allow for a more
    flexible use of IPsec in multiple scenarios.</p>"
