abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an optimized method that a service provider
    can use to provide MVPN service when using PIM as the MVPN control protocol. As
    in prior MVPN methods, PIM control messages are sent over multicast tunnels through
    the provider network. However, unlike older MVPN methods, the tunnels are only
    created if they are needed to carry multicast data traffic; no tunnels are used
    only for control traffic.</p>"
