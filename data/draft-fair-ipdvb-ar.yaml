abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6
    addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is known as Address
    Resolution (AR), or Neighbour Discovery (ND). Such address resolution complements
    the higher layer resource discovery tools that are used to advertise IP sessions.
    In MPEG-2 networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) and
    a specific Transmission Multiplex The document reviews current methods. It also
    describes the interaction with well-known protocols for address management including
    DHCP, ARP, and NDP, and provides guidance on usage.</p>"
