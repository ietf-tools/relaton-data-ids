abstract:
- content: "<p>SLA is a new IKEv2 exchange that reuses most of the features of the
    IKEv2 Initial (Phase 1) exchange but allows for legacy authentication that is
    not susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. It has a flexible number of messages
    based on the type of authentication being used, and is extensible for new authentication
    mechanisms. SLA will work with remote access configuration in the same way as
    IKEv2's Initial exchange.</p>"
