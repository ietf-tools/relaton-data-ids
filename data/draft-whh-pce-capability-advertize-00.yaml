abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path computation
    requests and responses both between Path Computation Clients (PCCs), Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs) and cooperating PCEs, support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS), Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) and Segment Routing (SR) networks.
    In PCEP, due to the different implementing of PCC tunnel capability, especially
    bidirectional SR tunnels, the PCE can only provides path computation functions
    between the PCCs which adopt identical mechanisms. With the introduction and evolvement
    of 5G and other network scenarios, the scale of bearing and transport network
    has developed to a high level. On the other hand, with the improvement of network
    slicing ability, network equipments can provide network slicing service, such
    as enhanced VPNs (VPN+). Transport network employing time slot isolation technology,
    such as FlexE,MTN,can provide advanced timeslot slicing for the high quality customer
    services. The high quality customer services, for example industry production
    service, demand for superior SLA and end-to-end timeslot service slicing, regardless
    of whether it is across of different network equipment providers or across of
    different regions. Therefore, there is an urgent need of a method to support PCE
    to provide end-to-end path computation and establishment of SR tunnels regardless
    of PCC enables different protocol selections. This document specifies the extensions
    to PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) to carry bidirectional SR tunnel capability
    advertisement information in PCEP message to enhance PCE ability to perceive the
    protocol mechanism supported by PCC.</p>"
