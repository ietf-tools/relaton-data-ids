abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv4, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) commonly provide IN- ADDR.ARPA.
    information for their customers by prepopulating the zone with one PTR record
    for every available address. This practice does not scale in IPv6. This document
    analyzes different approaches for ISPs to manage the ip6.arpa zone for IPv6 address
    space assigned to many customers.</p>"
