abstract:
- content: "<p>Different kinds of relationships can be established among interconnected
    Traffic Engineered Networks. In particular, this document focuses on the case
    where there is a client-server relation between the network domains. The domain
    interconnection is a policy and administrative boundary. This informational document
    collects current terminology and provides a taxonomy for the posible control plane
    based operation models. Each control model defines, on the one hand, the level
    of information that the domain acting as client receives by control plane means
    from the domain acting as server and, on the other hand, the control model will
    determine what can be requested from the client domain to the server domain.</p>"
