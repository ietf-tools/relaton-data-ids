abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document I am providing the outlines for a modified version
    of the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS); the modified version will come
    as a new protocol that will build a secured tunnel between the client and the
    server without the need to involve Certificate Authorities or any other third
    party in this process; it is called User Defined Key Pair protocol(UDKP), and
    is based on the assumption that in most cases there is a registered profile for
    the user on the server; a profile that includes among a lot of things the username
    and the password that the user uses to authenticate to the server, the proposed
    protocol will make use of the username and the password to create a key pair for
    the user on the fly at the client side, and it will use this key pair as the starting
    point for creating the secured tunnel instead of taking the server certificate
    as the starting point. Additionally the proposed protocol has self- protection
    against phishing attacks.</p>"
