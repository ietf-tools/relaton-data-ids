abstract:
- content: <p>SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml] defines a base time attribute and time value
    which is used to determine the time when a value is recorded. In some applications
    a SenML pack will contain a series of records related to a constant sample time
    interval, e.g. once every 60 seconds. This means that the time attribute will
    be required for each record. This document defines a new "time offset" base attribute
    that allows a sender to include the time for the sample interval between records.
    If the "time offset" base attribute is used the sender will not send the time
    attribute for each record, minimising message and storage size.</p>
