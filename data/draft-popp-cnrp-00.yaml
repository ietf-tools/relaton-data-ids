abstract:
- content: "<p>People often refer to things in the world by a common name or phrase,
    e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title. These names are sometimes easier
    for people to remember and enter than URLs; many people consider URLs hard to
    remember or type. This document proposes an abstract protocol for the resolution
    of common names. The protocol is based on XML, RDF and the Dublin Core metadata
    elements. The proposed mechanism allows for a very dynamic resolution process
    where the client has no predefined knowledge of the namespace or the resolution
    service. The protocol supports an extensible query and response interface with
    multiple independent XML vocabularies. Furthermore, it allows for multiple concrete
    implementations (HTTP, LDAP, WHOIS,...). Both the specifics of the query interface
    and the type of implementation can be discovered at runtime by the resolution
    client. This document is intended for discussion at the Common Name Resolution
    Protocol BOF (renamed from Human Friendly Identifier BOF). It may be discussed
    on cnrp-ietf@lists.internic.net. Send in body \\021subscribe cnrp-ietf\\022 to
    listserv@lists.internic.net. The mail archive is at http://lists.netsol.com/lists/cnrp.</p>"
