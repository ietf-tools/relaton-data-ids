abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the trust concept and design of the SCION _Control
    Plane Public Key Infrastructure (CP-PKI)_. SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation
    On Next-generation networks) is a path-aware, inter-domain network architecture
    where the Control Plane PKI handles cryptographic material and lays the foundation
    for the authentication procedures in SCION. It is used by SCION's Control Plane
    to authenticate and verify path information, and builds the basis for SCION's
    trust model based on Isolation Domains. This document describes the trust model
    behind the SCION's Control Plane PKI, including specifications of the different
    types of certificates and the Trust Root Configuration. It also specifies how
    to deploy the Control Plane PKI infrastructure.</p>"
