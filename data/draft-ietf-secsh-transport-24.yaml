abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other
    secure network services over an insecure network. This document describes the
    SSH transport layer protocol, which typically runs on top of TCP/IP. The protocol
    can be used as a basis for a number of secure network services. It provides strong
    encryption, server authentication, and integrity protection. It may also provide
    compression. Key exchange method, public key algorithm, symmetric encryption algorithm,
    message authentication algorithm, and hash algorithm are all negotiated. This
    document also describes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method and the minimal
    set of algorithms that are needed to implement the SSH transport layer protocol.
