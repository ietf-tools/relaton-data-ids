abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 6790 defined the Entropy Label Capability Attribute (ELC); RFC 7447
    deprecated that attribute. This specification, dubbed "Entropy Label Capability
    Attribute version 2" (ELCv2), was intended to be offered for standardization,
    to replace the ELC as a way to signal that a BGP protocol speaker is capable of
    processing entropy labels. Although ultimately a different specification was chosen
    for that purpose, at least one implementation of ELCv2 was shipped by Juniper
    Networks and is currently in use in service provider networks. This document is
    published in order to document what was implemented.</p>
