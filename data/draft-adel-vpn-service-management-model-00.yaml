abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently new services create new opportunities for both network providers
    and service providers. Shared Unified Policy Automation (SUPA) was proposed to
    develop a model that abstracts network resources and services and a methodology
    by which the management and monitoring of network services can be done using standardized
    policy rules. This document defines a VPN service management yang data model and
    gives an example for DDC use case.</p>"
