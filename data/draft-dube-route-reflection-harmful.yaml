abstract:
- content: "<p>Route reflection as defined by [2] is a popular way of reducing the
    full-mesh IBGP peering required by routers running the Border Gateway Protocol
    [1]. There are cases where a topology built using route reflectors produces persistent
    loops or does not produce the same results as what one would expect with a full
    IBGP mesh. This document describes these problems.</p>"
