abstract:
- content: "<p>With the growing requirements for reliable Internet connectivity, increasing
    number of enterprises choose to acquire Internet connectivity from more than one
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for the purpose of connectivity redundancy and
    traffic load distribution. The potential of large number of multi-connection sites
    impose direct challenge on routing aggregation and consequently on scalability
    of the global Internet routing. Hence a solution is highly desirable which provides
    the benefit of multi-connection as well as the better scalability of the global
    routing system. In addition, such solution needs to be simple enough to be operationally
    manageable. With the fast growth of ISP networks as well as enterprise networks,
    network manageability is becoming an increasingly important requirement. This
    document describes a solution which achieves the stated goals.</p>"
