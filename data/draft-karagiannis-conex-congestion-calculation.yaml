abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a procedure that allows receivers to compute
    the congestion from the received congestion information and to communicate this
    information back to the sender using non-TCP based protocols. The main advantage
    of this approach is that applications that are not using the TCP protocol as transport
    protocol could also apply the Conex concept to rely congestion experienced on
    the end-to-end path back into the network.</p>"
