    Architecture Board (IAB) on 'Interconnecting Smart Objects with the Internet'.
    The workshop took place in Prague on 25 March 2011. The main goal of the workshop
    was to solicit feedback from the wider community on their experience with deploying
    IETF protocols in constrained environments. This report summarizes the discussions
    and lists the conclusions and recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task
    Force (IETF) community. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings
    of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this report are those of
    the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.
