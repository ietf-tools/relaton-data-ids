abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of 'content peering' is to allow content providers
    increased control of content presentation in remote networks. In order to provide
    this, simple, commonly accepted implementations are required for content providers
    to originate control messages ('content signals'), for intermediate networks to
    relay them, and for edge networks to receive and act on them. This draft proposes
    such an implementation specifically for the control of HTTP content</p>"
