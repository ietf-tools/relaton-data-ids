abstract:
- content: "<p>Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit rate
    flows (large flow) and huge amount of very low bit flows (small flow), which causes
    uneven load balance over ECMP paths. Differentiating large flow and small flow
    packets in IP/MPLS networks enables enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP applies
    different distribution methods to large flow packets and small flow packets to
    improve the load balance. The classification also enables an effective congestion
    control. This draft proposes large flow classification in IPv6 protocol for this
    purpose.</p>"
