abstract:
- content: "<p>A PANA authentication protocol is under development in the PANA Working
    Group. It will allow hosts to authenticate with PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs).
    The protocol is expected to run over some IP-based transport protocol, such as
    ICMP, UDP, TCP or SCTP. Before a host can authenticate with a PAA, it must obtain
    an IP- address of the PAA. This document specifies such a 'discovery' mechanism
    by defining extensions (or options) to Router Advertisements and DHCP messages
    for both IPv4 and IPv6. Hosts MAY also obtain an identity of a PAA and other information
    during the discovery process. The proposed discovery mechanism makes no assumptions
    about the location of a PAA, and more than one PAA may be discovered.</p>"
