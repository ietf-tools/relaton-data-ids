abstract:
- content: "<p>AI services (e.g. distributed model training, separated storage and
    model training) drive the need to transmit RMDA packets through SRv6 tunnels in
    WAN. RoCEv2 is the most popular open standard for achieving RDMA and network offloads
    over ethernet, with its congestion control based on the combination of PFC and
    ECN. The document defines the fast congestion notification for distributed RoCEv2
    network based on SRv6 tunnels, and further extends PFC and ECN to achieve precise
    flow control and end-to-end congestion control.</p>"
