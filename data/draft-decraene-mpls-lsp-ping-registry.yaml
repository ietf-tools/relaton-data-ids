abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4379 and RFC 6424 created name spaces for Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping. However, those RFC did not create the corresponding
    IANA registries for DS Flags, Multipath Type, Pad TLV and Address Types. There
    is now a need to make further code point allocations from these name spaces. This
    document updates RFC 4379 and RFC 6424 in that it creates the IANA registries
    for that purpose.</p>"
