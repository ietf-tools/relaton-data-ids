abstract:
- content: "<p>Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used extensively
    by the service providers. However, when TE links are bundled, identification of
    label resource in RRO is not enough for the administrative purpose. Network service
    providers would like to know the component link within a TE link that is being
    used by a given LSP. In other words, when link bundling is used, resource recording
    requires mechanisms to specify the component link identifier, along with the TE
    link identifier and Label. As , it is not possible to record component link in
    the RRO, this draft defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473]
    to specify component link identifiers for resource recording purposes. This draft
    also defines the ERO counterpart of the RRO extension. The ERO extensions are
    needed to perform explicit label/ resource control over bundled TE link. Hence,
    this draft defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify
    component link identifiers for explicit resource control and recording over GMPLS
    link bundles.</p>"
