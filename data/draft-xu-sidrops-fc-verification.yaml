- content: "<p>The Forwarding Commitment (FC) is an RPKI object that attests to the
    complete routing intents description which an Autonomous System (AS) would obey
    in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route propagation. This document specifies an
    FC-based AS Path Verification methodology to mitigate, even solve, AS Path forgery
    and route leaks. This document also explains the various BGP security threats
    that FC can help address and provides operational considerations associated with
    FC deployment.</p>"
