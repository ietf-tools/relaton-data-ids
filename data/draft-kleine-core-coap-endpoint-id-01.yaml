abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) (see [RFC7252]), is an
    application layer protocol for constrained devices (e.g.low power, few memory)
    and networks (e.g. lossy, low bandwidth) which relies on UDP on the transport
    layer. With CoAP it is often the case, that message exchanges need to extend the
    common request/response pattern, e.g. for seperate responses. This holds, e.g.
    for CON requests that are confirmed by the server with an empty ACK and answered
    later with a seperate response. According to the CoAP specification the request/response
    matching is realized using a unique pair of the servers IP address and a token
    defined by the client. Due to the mobile nature of some devices. e.g. smartphones,
    they are often assigned new IP addresses because of a network change. Thus, the
    IP address of a CoAP server might change during an ongoing conversation. This
    draft proposes a method to assign each communication partner with an identifier
    (endpoint ID) which replaces the IP address as (partial) key to relate requests
    and responses. Besides the common seperate responses, the proposed method is also
    useful to handle IP address changes, e.g. during an ongoing observation ([observe])
    or a blockwise transfer ([block]).</p>"
