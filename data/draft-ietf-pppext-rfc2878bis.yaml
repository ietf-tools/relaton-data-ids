abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard method for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP defines an extensible
    Link Control Protocol (LCP) and proposes a family of Network Control Protocols
    (NCP) for establishing and configuring different network-layer protocols. This
    document defines the NCP for establishing and configuring Remote Bridging for
    PPP links. This document obsoletes RFC 2878, which was based on the IEEE 802.1D-
    1993 MAC Bridge. This document extends that specification by improving support
    for bridge control packets. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
