abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) enables one-
    way and round-trip measurement of network metrics between IP hosts, and has a
    facility for defining optional extensions. This document updates the definition
    of the Class of Service TLV (originally defined in RFC 8972) to enable the measurement
    of manipulation of the value of the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field
    of the IP header by middleboxes between two STAMP hosts, and to enable discovery
    and measurement of paths that provide differential treatment of packets depending
    on the value of their ECN field.</p>"
