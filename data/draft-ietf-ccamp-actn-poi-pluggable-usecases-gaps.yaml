abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides general overarching guidelines for control and
    management of packet over optical converged networks with coherent pluggables
    and focuses on operators' use cases and network scenarios. It provides a set of
    use cases which are needed for the control and management of the packet over optical
    networks which comprise devices with mixes of packet and optical functions where
    the optical functions may be provided on coherent pluggables. The document provides
    a gap analysis to solve the use cases.</p>"
