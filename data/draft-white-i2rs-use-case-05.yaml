abstract:
- content: "<p>Programmatic interfaces to provide control over individual forwarding
    devices in a network promise to reduce operational costs while improving scaling,
    control, and visibility into the operation of large scale networks. To this end,
    several programmatic interfaces have been proposed. OpenFlow, for instance, provides
    a mechanism to replace the dynamic control plane processes on individual forwarding
    devices throughout a network with off box processes that interact with the forwarding
    tables on each device. Another example is NETCONF, which provides a fast and flexible
    mechanism to interact with device configuration and policy. There is, however,
    no proposal which provides an interface to all aspects of the routing system as
    a system. Such a system would not interact with the forwarding system on individual
    devices, but rather with the control plane processes already used to discover
    the best path to any given destination through the network, as well as interact
    with the routing information base (RIB), which feeds the forwarding table the
    information needed to actually switch traffic at a local level. This document
    describes a set of use cases such a system could fulfill. It is designed to provide
    underlying support for the framework, policy, and other drafts describing the
    Interface to the Routing System (I2RS).</p>"
