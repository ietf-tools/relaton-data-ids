abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet storage services have become more and more popular. They attract
    a huge number of users and produce a significant share of Internet traffic. Most
    existing Internet storage services make use of proprietary sync protocols with
    different capabilities to achieve the data sync. However, a single Internet storage
    service using its proprietary sync protocols has intrinsic limitations on service
    usability and network performance. This document outlines the related problems
    caused by using proprietary sync protocols and missing key capabilities. It also
    shows a demand for designing a standard sync protocol to achieve better usability
    and sync performance.</p>"
