abstract:
- content: "<p>Security of the IP Network is always one of the primary concerns of
    the network design and normally used layered approach. It is recommended not to
    rely on a single layer of defense, but to configure multi-layer security measures.
    The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a simple and effective solution
    to enhance the security of EDGE devices which are connected to external users
    in a Service Provider network. Most Service Providers commonly use ingress filtering
    as one of the methods to filter traffic to secure edge devices of their infrastructure
    from external users. The proposed technique will use a special wildcard mask on
    the network addresses to limit the accessibility of the Service Provider EDGE
    devices from external users. This will greatly enhance the security of the Service
    Provider's edge devices from malicious attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS).</p>"
