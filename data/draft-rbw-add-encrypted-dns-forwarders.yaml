abstract:
- content: "<p>Typical connectivity service offerings based upon on Customer Premise
    Equipment (CPEs) involve DNS forwarders on the CPE for various reasons (offer
    local services, control the scope/content of information in DNS, ensure better
    dependability for local service, provide control to users, etc.). Upgrading DNS
    to use encrypted transports introduces deployment complications as to how to sustain
    current offerings with local services. Solutions are needed to ease operating
    DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of encrypted DNS capabilities.
    This document describes the problem and why some existing solutions can't be used
    for these deployments. For example, Star certificates and name constraints extension
    suffer from the problem of deploying a new feature to CAs, TLS clients, and servers.
    The document also discusses adaptations to some other existing techniques to accomodate
    LAN specifics. The scope of this document is encrypted DNS servers deployed on
    managed CPEs. The document does not focus on generic considerations related to
    deploying DNS proxies. The reader may refer to [RFC5625] for such matters.</p>"
