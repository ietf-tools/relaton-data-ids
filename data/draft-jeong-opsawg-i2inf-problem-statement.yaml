abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the problem statement for Interface to In-
    Network Functions (I2INF) for a user's services involved in both networks and
    applications. In-Network Functions (INF) include In- Network Computing Functions
    (INCF) in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN). They also include In-Network Application Functions (INAF) in Internet-of-
    Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV). Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to realize the user's services
    consisting of a combination of INFs in a target network. This document analyzes
    the gap for an IBN-based system to perform the user's service and specifies the
    requirements for the I2INF for intelligent service provisioning.</p>"
