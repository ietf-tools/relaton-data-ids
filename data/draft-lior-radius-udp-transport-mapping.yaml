abstract:
- content: "<p>The Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) Request For
    Comments (RFC) specify that RADIUS should use retransmit strategy to recover from
    the loss of packets but they do not provide any further guidance. This has resulted
    in implementations lacking support for congestion control. This Internet Draft
    discusses and recommends strategies for measuring, calculating and applying a
    retransmission timer for RADIUS.</p>"
