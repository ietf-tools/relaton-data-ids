abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests a new and enhanced route optimization security mechanism
    for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). The primary motivation for this new mechanism is the
    reduction of signaling load and handoff delay. The performance improvement achieved
    is elimination of all signaling while not moving, and 33% of the per-movement
    signaling.</p>"
