abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide different customers with logically
    separated connectivity over a common network infrastructure. With the introduction
    and evolvement of 5G and also in some existing network scenarios, some customers
    may require network connectivity services with advanced features comparing to
    conventional VPN services. Such kind of network service is called enhanced VPNs.
    Enhanced VPNs can be used, for example, to deliver network slice services. A Network
    Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources and associated policies
    on each of a connected set of links in the underlay network. An NRP could be used
    as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN services. For packet
    forwarding in a specific NRP, some fields in the data packet are used to identify
    the NRP the packet belongs to, so that NRP-specific processing can be performed
    on each node along a path in the NRP. This document specifies a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
    option to carry the NRP related information in data packets, which could be used
    to identify the NRP-specific processing to be performed on the packets by each
    network node along a network path in the NRP.</p>"
