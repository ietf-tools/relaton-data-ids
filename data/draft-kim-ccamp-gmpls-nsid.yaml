abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of requirements of the Network State Information
    Database (NSID) for Traffic Engineering over Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS) in the view of service providers. The Network State Information Database
    is required to implement the network architecture for network models that introduce
    the control element of IP and to optimize the utilization of network resources.
    And this document includes discussion about the considerations and necessity of
    the several attributes to construct NSID for Traffic Engineering over GMPLS that
    are extended from the requirement for Traffic Engineering over MPLS [4]. These
    attributes can be used to maximize the utilization of network resources and to
    enhance resource oriented Traffic Engineering techniques.</p>"
