abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism. MulTFRC
    is derived from TFRC and can be implemented by carrying out a few small and simple
    changes to the original mechanism. Its behavior differs from TFRC in that it emulates
    a number of TFRC flows with more flexibility than what would be practical or even
    possible using multiple real TFRC flows. Additionally, MulTFRC better preserves
    the original features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.</p>"
