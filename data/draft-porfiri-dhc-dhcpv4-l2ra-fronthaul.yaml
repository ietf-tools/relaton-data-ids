abstract:
- content: "<p>The fronthaul portion of a cellular network is the part of the network
    that connects centralized radio controllers and the distributed radio units at
    the edge of the cellular network. A switched fronthaul network is one where the
    connectivity is provided through one or more stages of switches. When performing
    address assignment and configuration tasks in such networks, knowledge of how
    the different devices are connected is beneficial. Networks that employ IPv6 can
    use DHCPv6 to support Relay Agents. However, those networks that continue to be
    based on IPv4 have no easy way to support this, as the DHCPv4 support for relays
    is limited. This document explores how to provide Relay Agent functionality in
    IPv4-based switched fronthaul networks.</p>"
