abstract:
- content: "<p>In any Network-Based VPN (NBVPN) scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) routers
    attached to a common VPN must exchange certain information as a prerequisite to
    establish VPN-specific connectivity. In [RFC2547-bis], VPN-specific routes are
    exchanged, along with the information needed to enable a PE to determine which
    routes belong to which VPNs. In [VPN-VR], VR addresses must be exchanged, along
    with the information needed to enable the PEs to determine which VRs are in the
    same VPN ('membership'), and which of those VRs are to have VPN connectivity ('topology').
    Once the VRs are reachable through the tunnels, routes ('reachability') are then
    exchanged by running existing routing protocol per VPN basis. The purpose of this
    draft is to define a common BGP based auto-discovery mechanism used for both the
    virtual router [VPN-VR] and [RFC2547-bis] architectures. Each scheme uses the
    mechanism to automatically discover the information needed by that particular
    scheme. Interworking scenarios between [RFC2547-bis] and the virtual router models
    are also discussed.</p>"
