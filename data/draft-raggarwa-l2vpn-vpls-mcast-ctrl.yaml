abstract:
- content: "<p>The PEs participating in VPLS need to learn the IP multicast group
    membership information from remote VPLS sites to enable them to send an IP multicast
    packet to only those other PEs in the VPLS that have receivers interested in that
    particular IP multicast packet's multicast source and group. This document describes
    procedures for propagating multicast control information, learned from local Virtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) sites, to remote VPLS sites. IGMP or PIM snooping is
    required only on the customer facing interfaces. The procedures do not require
    IGMP or PIM snooping on the Service Provider backbone links. Instead they use
    reliable protocol messages to exchange multicast control information between the
    PEs.</p>"
