abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines per-flow and per-packet metadata for both network-to-host
    and host-to-network signaling in Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) which
    expresses both CBOR and JSON. The common metadata definition allows interworking
    between signaling protocols with high fidelity. The metadata is also self- describing
    to improve interpretation by network elements and endpoints while reducing the
    need for version negotiation.</p>"
