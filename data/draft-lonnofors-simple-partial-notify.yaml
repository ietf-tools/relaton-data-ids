abstract:
- content: "<p>A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints for
    delivering presence information to devices with low data processing capabilities,
    small display, and limited battery power. Other limitations can be caused by the
    interface between the terminal and the network, i.e. over radio links with high
    latency and low bandwidth. This memo presents a solution that aids in reducing
    the impact of those constrains and increasing efficiency, by introducing a new
    MIME-type ‘partial notifications’ and a Require header extension ‘partial-notification’.</p>"
