abstract:
- content: "<p>Draft [overlay-cp] has introduced some control plan requirements and
    characteristics. From NVE's perspective, this draft describes what assistance
    is needed to make NVE satisfy the requirements and characteristics introduce in
    [overlay-cp]. Not all of these assistance is necessarily achieved by an external
    controller. Some of the assistance requirements can be regarded as a complementarity
    requirements to [overlay-cp]. while others are requirements to an assistance Database.
    This draft also provide considerations on how the network virtualization architecture
    should be like and how these assistance can be fulfilled. The target is to help
    the working group to figure out the architecture of overlay control plane, instead
    of providing solutions.</p>"
