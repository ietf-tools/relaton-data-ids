abstract:
- content: "<p>A Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting
    of one or more segment lists with necessary path attributes. For each SR path,
    it may also have its own path attributes, and Path Segment is one of them. A Path
    Segment is defined to identify an SR path, which can be used for performance measurement,
    path correlation, and end-2-end path protection. Path Segment can be also used
    to correlate two unidirctional SR paths into a bidirectional SR path which is
    required in some scenarios, for example, mobile backhaul transport network. This
    document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR policies carrying Path Segment
    and bidirectional path information.</p>"
