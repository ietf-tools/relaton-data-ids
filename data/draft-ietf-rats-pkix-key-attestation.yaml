abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a vendor-agnostic format for evidence produced
    and verified within a PKIX context. The evidence produced this way includes claims
    collected about a cryptographic module and elements found within it such as cryptographic
    keys. One scenario envisaged is that the state information about the cryptographic
    module can be securely presented to a remote operator or auditor in a vendor-agnostic
    verifiable format. A more complex scenario would be to submit this evidence to
    a Certification Authority to aid in determining whether the storage properties
    of this key meet the requirements of a given certificate profile. This specification
    also offers a format for requesting a cryptographic module to produce evidence
    tailored for expected use.</p>"
