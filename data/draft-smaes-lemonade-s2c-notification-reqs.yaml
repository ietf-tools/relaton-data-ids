abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Lemonade requirements for server to client
    notifications. These server to client notifications provide information on crucial
    changes to a client. This document does not assume how notifications are provided
    to the clients: the client to server notifications may be actively pushed to a
    client through different mechanisms rather than requiring the client to initiate
    contact to ask for state changes; or they may be polled by the client, still avoiding
    that the client performs full state comparisons.</p>"
