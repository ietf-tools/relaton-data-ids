abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for the dynamic determination of
    the upstream interface of a device running IGMP/MLD Proxy, as opposed to manual
    configuration. The learning of the upstream interface is achieved by listening
    for IGMP/MLD General Query messages on the interfaces of the proxy device.</p>"
