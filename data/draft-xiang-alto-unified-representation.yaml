abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO protocol [RFC7285] provides network information to applications
    so that applications can make network informed decisions to improve the performance.
    However, the base ALTO protocol only provides coarse-grained end-to-end metrics,
    which are insufficient to satisfy the demands of applications to solve more complex
    network optimization problems. The ALTO Path Vector extension [DRAFT-PV] has been
    introduced to allow ALTO clients to query information such as capacity regions
    for a given set of flows. However, the current design of this extension has a
    limited expressiveness. The goal of this document is to introduce a unified resource
    representation service as an extension of ALTO (ALTO-UR), which allows the ALTO
    clients to query and get the capacity regions of more complex resource information,
    such as Shared-Risk-Link-Group (SRLG), multi- path routing, multicast and on-demand
    routing, for a given set of flows.</p>"
