abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion
    problem through use of a clever IPv4 options mechanism as a solution. This IPv4
    protocol extension is called enhanced IP (EnIP). Because it is IPv4, it maximizes
    backward compatibility while increasing address space by a factor of 17.9 million.
    Unlike other similar proposals, care was taken to avoid costly changes and requirements
    to the core network and border routers, with the exception that options be passed
    in that equipment as described below. Because it is backward compatible, current
    IPv4 software, network equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection/protection, and
    layer 5 firewalls can be maintained until IPv6 system information security reaches
    acceptable maturity and availability.</p>"
