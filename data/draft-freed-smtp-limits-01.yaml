abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a "Limits" extension for the Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP) and an associated limit registry. This extension provides the
    means for an SMTP server to inform the SMTP client of limits the server intends
    to apply to the protocol during the current SMTP session. The client is then able
    adapt its behavior in order to conform to those limits.</p>
