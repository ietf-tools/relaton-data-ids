abstract:
- content: <p>New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested individuals.
    IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to hold informal get-togethers
    to discuss and develop their ideas. Such side meetings, which are not reflected
    in the IETF meeting agenda and have no official status, are often half-jokingly
    referred to as "bar BOF" sessions to acknowledge that some of them may eventually
    lead to a proposal for an official IETF BOF ("birds of a feather" session) on
    a given topic. During recent IETF meetings, many such "bar BOF" get-togethers
    have been organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly indistinguishable
    from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings. This document
    argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of
    many of these get-togethers, i.e., to efficiently discuss and develop ideas for
    new IETF work. It encourages the organizers to consider the benefits of holding
    them in much less formal settings and to also consider alternative means to develop
    their ideas. This document also recommends that the community abandon the term
    "bar BOF" and instead use other terms such as "side meeting", in order to stress
    the unofficial nature of these get-togethers. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
