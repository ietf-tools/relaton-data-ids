abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6-only provider networks, transporting IPv4 packets encapsulated
    in IPv6 is a common solution to the problem of IPv4 service continuity. A number
    of differing functional approaches have been developed for this, each having their
    own specific characteristics. As these approaches share a similar functional architecture
    and use the same data plane mechanisms, this memo specifies a DHCPv6 option, whereby
    a single instance of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) can interwork with all
    of the standardized and proposed approaches to providing encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6
    services by providing a prioritization mechanism.</p>"
