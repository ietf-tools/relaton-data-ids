abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper create a method using a simple implementation to inform
    the traffic source at a very early stage that the network is becoming overload
    or congested and to ask the source to slow down its transmission rate. For simplicity,
    the network only indicates congesition to the node where data transmission rate
    will be reduced or increased adaptively. For the consideration of asymmetric routing
    and to shorten long control delay time, the congestion notification message generated
    for the incipient congestion in the network should immediately routed back according
    to its source address. Upon receiving this message, the source terminal discards
    this message and immediately initiates its congestion control, then it sends message
    to tell the network node to stop adding it. To improve TCP performance in wireles
    and mobile networks, we assume only this message created in the network can initiate
    congestion window reduction to achieve separation of congestion control and loss
    recovery mechanism. Then, I mention that this Fast Congestion Notification should
    be created once the buffer size exceeds the prefixed threshold and still generated
    though upon packet losses due to congestion until the messages inform the source
    redution of congestion window reache it. However, in traditional fix networks,
    it is no need of the ability of packet losses to initiate congestion control and
    the FCN will not required to be generated after packet losses due to buffer overflow
    occurs for the packet losses are mainly due to congestion in such environment.
    It is most noted that the source address of following Fast Congestion Notification
    messages will remain the same as the first one in a window to avoid reducing the
    transmission rate of multiple TCP connections simultaneously and improve the fairness
    and performance either in wire or in wireless environent.</p>"
