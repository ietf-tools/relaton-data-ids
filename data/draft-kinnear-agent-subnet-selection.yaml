abstract:
- content: "<p>In RFC2131, the giaddr specifies both the subnet on which a DHCP client
    resides as well as an IP address which can be used to communicate with the relay
    agent. The subnet selection option allows these functions of the giaddr to be
    split so that when one entity is performing as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the
    subnet from which to allocate an IP address which is different from the IP address
    with which it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.</p>"
