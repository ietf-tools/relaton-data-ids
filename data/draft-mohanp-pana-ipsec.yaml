abstract:
- content: "<p>The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
    working group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to the access
    network using IP based protocols. The PANA protocol authenticates the client and
    also establishes a PANA security association between the PANA client and PANA
    authentication agent at the end of a successful authentication. But it does not
    specify any mechanism for preventing service theft. This document discusses the
    details for establishing an IPsec security association for securing the link between
    PANA client and the enforcement point, which can be used to prevent service theft.</p>"
