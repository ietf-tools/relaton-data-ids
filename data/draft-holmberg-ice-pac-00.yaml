abstract:
- content: "<p>During the process of creating a peer-to-peer connection, ICE implementations
    can encounter situations where they have no candidate pairs to check, and, as
    a result, conclude that ICE processing has failed. However, because additional
    candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE processing, declaring failure at
    this point may be premature. This document discusses when these situations can
    occur and proposes a way to avoid premature failure.</p>"
