abstract:
- content: "<p>Though quantum error correction assumes localized error model of Shor
    that errors on a qubit are caused by interaction with its local environment, enabling
    essentially classical error correction for unentangled states, the model is applied
    to entangled states improperly without involving local environment states in the
    entanglement. That is, when an entangled state (Q) is represented as superposition
    of unentangled terms (Qi) as Q=Q1+Q2+...+Qn, local environment states around qubits
    are, in general, different term by term. Q will be, with term-specific error operators
    (Ei), E1*Q1+E2*Q2+...+En*Qn, not, with a common error operator (E) assumed by
    Shor, E*(Q1+Q2+...+Qn). A complication is that Shor's error model is a little
    quantum, allowing for two different local environment states around a qubit. As
    such, quantum error correction is applicable to some trivially entangled states
    including states used by Shor code but not to really entangled states.</p>"
