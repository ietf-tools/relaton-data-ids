abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol that uses the iCalendar object specification
    to provide scheduling interoperability between different calendaring systems.
    This is done without reference to a specific transport protocol so as to allow
    multiple methods of communication between systems. Subsequent documents will define
    profiles of this protocol that use specific, interoperable methods of communication
    between systems. The iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol
    (iTIP) complements the iCalendar object specification by adding semantics for
    group scheduling methods commonly available in current calendaring systems. These
    scheduling methods permit two or more calendaring systems to perform transactions
    such as publishing, scheduling, rescheduling, responding to scheduling requests,
    negotiating changes, or canceling. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
