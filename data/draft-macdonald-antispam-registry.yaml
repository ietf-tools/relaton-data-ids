abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes for anti-spam.
    It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that currently use the extended
    SMTP error code 5.7.1. The anti-spam codes were determined by looking at error
    texts produced by major ISPs and finding commonalities. The result is a new set
    of error texts with associated extended SMTP error codes.</p>"
