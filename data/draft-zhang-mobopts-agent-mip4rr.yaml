abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is to propose a more deployable route optimization scheme
    for Mobile IPv4, which is transparent to fixed IPv4 end nodes, and does not need
    any preconfigured security associations. Specifically, we propose to adapt the
    Mobile IPv6 Return Routability Test for Mobile IPv4 route optimization, on the
    basis of an agent- based architecture. In order to achieve this, six new message
    types and formats are defined for Mobile IPv4.</p>"
