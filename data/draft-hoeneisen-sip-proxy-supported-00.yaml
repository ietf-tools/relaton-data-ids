abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that allows
    a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particular protocol extension has
    to be used to process the request. The User Agent Server (UAS) declines the request
    if it does not support the extension. Recently also means have been defined for
    the User Agent Server (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the
    User Agent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring proxy
    servers to understand certain features.</p>"
