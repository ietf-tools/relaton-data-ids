abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC3961 to support encryption mechanisms that
    can authenticate associated data, such as Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) and Galois/Counter
    Mode (GCM). These mechanisms are often more performant and need not expand the
    message as much as conventional modes.</p>"
