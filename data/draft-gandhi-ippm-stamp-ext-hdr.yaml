abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC 8762
    and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 can be used for Edge-To-Edge (E2E)
    active measurement. In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    data fields defined in RFC 9197 can be used for recording and collecting Hop-By-Hop
    (HBH) and E2E operational and telemetry information. This document extends STAMP
    to reflect any IPv6 options and MPLS Network Action Sub-Stacks for hop-by-hop
    and edge-to-edge active measurements, including IOAM data fields.</p>"
