abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData includes the SignerInfo
    structure to convey per-signer information. SignedData supports multiple signers
    and multiple signature algorithms per signer with multiple SignerInfo structures.
    If a signer attaches more than one SignerInfo, there are concerns that an attacker
    could perform a downgrade attack by removing the SignerInfo(s) with the \\'strong'
    algorithm(s). This document defines the multiple-signatures attribute, its generation
    rules, and its processing rules to allow signers to convey multiple SignerInfo
    objects while protecting against downgrade attacks. Additionally, this attribute
    may assist during periods of algorithm migration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
