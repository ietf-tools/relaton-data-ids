abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new diagnostic tool called Extended Ping
    (eping). Network operators execute eping to determine whether a remote interface
    is active. In this respect, eping is similar to ping. Eping differs from ping
    in that it does not require network reachability between itself and remote interface
    whose status is being queried. Eping relies on two new ICMP messages, called Extended
    Echo and Extended Echo Reply. Both ICMP messages are defined herein.</p>"
