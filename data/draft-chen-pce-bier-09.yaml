abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)-TE shares architecture and packet
    formats with BIER as described in [RFC8279]. BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets
    based on a BitString in the packet header, but every BitPosition of the BitString
    of a BIER-TE packet indicates one or more adjacencies as described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].BIER-TE
    Path can be derived from a Path Computation Element (PCE). This document specifies
    extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a PCE to
    compute and initiate the path for the BIER-TE.</p>"
