abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an ESMTP extension by means of which mail agents
    can report capability to retreive message content from remote location specified
    with MIME/External-Body type. This allows to save senders from having to send
    data for content parts that may not be of interest to the recipient and is especially
    useful when content is available in several alternative formats or languages and
    its not known which one recipient prefers.</p>"
