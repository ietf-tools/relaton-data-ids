abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol,
    used for interaction between iSNS servers and iSNS clients, which facilitates
    automated discovery, management, and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel
    devices (using iFCP gateways) on a TCP/IP network. iSNS provides intelligent storage
    discovery and management services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel networks,
    allowing a commodity IP network to function in a capacity similar to that of a
    storage area network. iSNS facilitates a seamless integration of IP and Fibre
    Channel networks due to its ability to emulate Fibre Channel fabric services and
    to manage both iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices. iSNS thereby provides value in
    any storage network comprised of iSCSI devices, Fibre Channel devices (using iFCP
    gateways), or any combination thereof. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
