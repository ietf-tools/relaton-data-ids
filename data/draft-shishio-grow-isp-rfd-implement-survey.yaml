abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route
    stability. It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing CPU load on
    the routers. But it has side-effects. Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use
    Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]). Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD,
    with less aggressive parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable]. This document
    describes results of a survey conducted among service provider on their use of
    BGP Route Flap Damping.</p>"
