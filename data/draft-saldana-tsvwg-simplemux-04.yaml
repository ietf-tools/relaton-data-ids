abstract:
- content: <p>The low efficiency caused by the high amount of small packets present
    in the network can be alleviated by means of packet aggregation. There are some
    situations in which multiplexing a number of small packets into a bigger one is
    desirable. For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between
    a pair of machines if they share a common network path. Thus, the traffic profile
    can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and
    the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers. This document
    describes Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging
    to different protocols into a single packet. It includes the "Protocol" field
    on each multiplexing header, thus allowing the inclusion of a number of packets
    belonging to different protocols (multiplexed packets) on a packet of another
    protocol (tunneling protocol). In order to reduce the overhead, the size of the
    multiplexing headers is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing
    small packets).</p>
