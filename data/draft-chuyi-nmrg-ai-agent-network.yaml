abstract:
- content: "<p>Current advancements in AI technologies, particularly large models,
    have demonstrated immense potential in content generation, reasoning, analysis
    and so on, providing robust technical support for network automation and self-intelligence.
    However, in practical network operations, challenges such as system isolation
    and fragmented data lead to extensive manual, repetitive, and inefficient tasks,
    the improvement of intelligence level is very necessary. This document identifies
    typical scenarios requiring enhanced intelligence, and explains how AI Agents
    and large model technologies can empower networks to address operational pain
    points, reduce manual efforts, and explore impacts on network data, system architectures,
    and interfaces correspondingly. It further explores and summarizes standardization
    efforts in implementation.</p>"
