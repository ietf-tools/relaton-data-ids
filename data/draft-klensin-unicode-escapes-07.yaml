abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a number of circumstances in which an escape mechanism is
    needed in conjunction with a protocol to encode characters that cannot be represented
    or transmitted directly. With ASCII coding, the traditional escape has been either
    the decimal or hexadecimal numeric value of the character, written in a variety
    of different ways. The move to Unicode, where characters occupy two or more octets
    and may be coded in several different forms, has further complicated the question
    of escapes. This document discusses some options now in use and discusses considerations
    for selecting one for use in new IETF protocols, and protocols that are now being
    internationalized. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
