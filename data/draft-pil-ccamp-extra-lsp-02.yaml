abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the problem statement on a extra class LSP ser-
    vice and addresses the issues. The extra class LSP uses the resource reserved
    but not allocated for the protecting LSPs in the pre-planned LSP re-routing without
    extra-traffic (including shared mesh) recovery method. Network utilization is
    improved because the resource reserved for the protecting LSPs are used for the
    extra class LSPs. The extra class LSP is preempted less frequently than the conventional
    priority mechanism using setup and holding priorities because the resource reserved
    for the protecting LSPs is allocated only if the working LSP fails, which is usually
    expected to rarely occur. This document pro- poses the extra class LSP service
    using the resource reserved but not allocated for the protecting LSP at the provisioning
    phase. This docu- ment addresses the issues on the extra class LSP: (1) advertisement
    of available resource, (2) extra class LSP indication in signaling message (3)
    extra class LSP preemption signaling, and (4) preventing unintended connections.</p>"
