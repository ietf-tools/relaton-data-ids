abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    with the lightness and speed necessary for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
    information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which
    can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management
    systems, through extension of its request methods (commands). A feature of HTTP
    is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
    independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide
    Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification reflects preferred
    usage of the protocol referred to as 'HTTP/1.0', and is compatible with the most
    commonly used HTTP server and client programs implemented prior to November 1994.</p>"
