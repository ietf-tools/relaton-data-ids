abstract:
- content: "<p>This Draft describes a general method of determining a caching solution
    adapted to a given traffic. This method uses a simulation software developed at
    France Telecom which allows different existing architectures, protocols and also
    different streams of traffic to be simulated. Using this software, we explain
    how to design completely a new cache mesh and to calculate its parameters in order
    to maximize performances and minimize costs.</p>"
