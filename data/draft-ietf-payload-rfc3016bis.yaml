abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
    formats for carrying each of MPEG-4 Audio and MPEG-4 Visual bitstreams without
    using MPEG-4 Systems. This document obsoletes RFC 3016. It contains a summary
    of changes from RFC 3016 and discusses backward compatibility to RFC 3016. It
    is a necessary revision of RFC 3016 in order to correct misalignments with the
    3GPP Packet- switched Streaming Service (PSS) specification regarding the RTP
    payload format for MPEG-4 Audio. For the purpose of directly mapping MPEG-4 Audio/Visual
    bitstreams onto RTP packets, this document provides specifications for the use
    of RTP header fields and also specifies fragmentation rules. It also provides
    specifications for Media Type registration and the use of the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP). The audio payload format described in this document has some limitations
    related to the signaling of audio codec parameters for the required multiplexing
    format. Therefore, new system designs should utilize RFC 3640, which does not
    have these restrictions. Nevertheless, this revision of RFC 3016 is provided to
    update and complete the specification and to enable interoperable implementations.
