abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data center (DC) networks
    and as the next generation VPN services in service provider (SP) networks. As
    service providers transform their networks in their COs toward next generation
    data center with Software Defined Networking (SDN) based fabric and Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV), they want to be able to maintain their offered services
    including Multicast VPN (MVPN) service between their existing network and their
    new Service Provider Data Center (SPDC) network seamlessly without the use of
    gateway devices. They want to have such seamless interoperability between their
    new SPDCs and their existing networks for a) reducing cost, b) having optimum
    forwarding, and c) reducing provisioning. This document describes a unified solution
    based on RFCs 6513 &amp; 6514 for seamless interoperability of Multicast VPN between
    EVPN and MVPN PEs. Furthermore, it describes how the proposed solution can be
    used as a routed multicast solution in data centers with only EVPN PEs.</p>"
