abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising
    SPF and Sender ID, two proposed email authentication protocols. Both of these
    protocols enable one to publish via the Domain Name System a policy declaring
    which mail servers were authorized to send email on behalf of the domain name
    being queried. There was concern that the two would conflict in some significant
    operational situations, interfering with message delivery. The IESG required the
    publication of all of these documents (RFC4405, RFC4406, RFC4407, and RFC4408)
    with Experimental status, and requested that the community observe deployment
    and operation of the protocols over a period of two years from the date of publication
    to determine a reasonable path forward. After six years, sufficient experience
    and evidence have been collected that the experiments thus created can be considered
    concluded. This document presents those findings.</p>"
