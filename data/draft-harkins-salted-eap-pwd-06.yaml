abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-pwd is an EAP method that uses a shared password for authentication
    using a technique that is resistant to dictionary attack. It included support
    for raw keys and RFC2751-style double hashing of a password but did not include
    support for salted passwords. There are many existing databases of salted passwords
    and it is desirable to allow their use with EAP-pwd.</p>"
