- content: "<p>This memo describes the recommendations for Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping switches. These
    are based on best current practices for IGMPv2, with further considerations for
    IGMPv3- and MLDv2-snooping. Additional areas of relevance, such as link layer
    topology changes and Ethernet-specific encapsulation issues, are also considered.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
