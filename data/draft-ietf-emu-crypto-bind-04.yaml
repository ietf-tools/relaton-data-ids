abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) evolves, EAP peers
    rely increasingly on information received from the EAP server. EAP extensions
    such as channel binding or network posture information are often carried in tunnel
    methods; peers are likely to rely on this information. Cryptographic binding is
    a facility described in RFC 3748 that protects tunnel methods against man-in-the-middle
    attacks. However, cryptographic binding focuses on protecting the server rather
    than the peer. This memo explores attacks possible when the peer is not protected
    from man-in-the-middle attacks and recommends cryptographic binding based on an
    Extended Master Session Key, a new form of cryptographic binding that protects
    both peer and server along with other mitigations.</p>"
