abstract:
- content: "<p>Several industry fora have joined forces and are developing an information
    base from which APIs can be developed. These APIs, exposed to the world in Java
    or OMG IDL, provide access to capabilities of the converged (i.e., packet/circuit,
    wired/wireless) Next Generation Network (NGN) in a network technology independent
    fashion. Additionally, the SPIRITS protocol provides access to these capabilities.</p>"
