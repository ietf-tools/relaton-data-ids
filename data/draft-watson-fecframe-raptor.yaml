abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    Schemes for the Raptor code and its application to reliable delivery of media
    streams in the context of FEC Framework. The Raptor code is a systematic code,
    where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and
    sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent
    to the receiver(s) within a source flow. The Raptor code offers a close to optimal
    protection against arbitrary packet losses at a low computational complexity.
    Two FEC Schemes are defined, one for protection of arbitrary packet flows and
    another for protection of a single flow that already contains a sequence number.
    Repair data may be sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g. UDP) or using
    RTP. An RTP Payload Type is defined for this latter case.</p>"
