abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a first attempt at providing guidance on how to deal with
    the perplexity of new LAN and WAN site installs. Experienced and less experienced
    network engineers often do each installation blindly without any form or fashion.
    This document is an attempt to document specific install issues, practices and
    procedures. It is also intended to be a future installation reference handbook.
    Please email me with any comments or additional items that may have been overlooked.
    Hopefully you will see this as a starting point to collect data for the site installation
    that you are completing.</p>"
