abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification introduces a mechanism in PIM-SM [RFC4601] for the
    Last-Hop-Router (LHR) router to discover the stream information. Once this mechanism
    is available the complications of the shared tree procedures can be avoided. The
    document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport for the information about
    multicast streams active in the network. This specification uses the existing
    PIM reliability mechanisms defined by PIM Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559]. This
    is simply a means to transmit reliable PIM messages and does not require the support
    for Join/Prune messages over PORT as defined in [RFC6559].</p>"
