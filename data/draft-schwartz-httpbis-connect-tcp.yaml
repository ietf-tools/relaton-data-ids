abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP proxying using HTTP CONNECT has long been part of the core HTTP
    specification. However, this proxying functionality has several important deficiencies
    in modern HTTP environments. This specification defines an alternative HTTP proxy
    service configuration for TCP connections. This configuration is described by
    a URI Template, similar to the CONNECT-UDP and CONNECT-IP protocols.</p>"
