abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of routing technologies that address
    the needs of traffic engineering and load balancing, with a focus on fast notification
    for example in adaptive or perceptive routing. As the scale and complexity of
    networks grow, these technologies are becoming increasingly important when fault
    tolerance and rapid convergence are critical. This document explores existing
    solutions from both the IETF and the broader industry, highlighting their applicability
    to various use cases, including AI workloads and general services that demand
    low-latency, fault recovery, and dynamic load distribution across data center
    networks and inter data center. It also offers suggestions for potential IETF
    initiatives to further develop and standardize these techniques.</p>"
