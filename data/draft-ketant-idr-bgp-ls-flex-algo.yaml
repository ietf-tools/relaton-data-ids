abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows routing protocols (viz.
    OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-defined (and hence,
    flexible) constraints and metrics. The computation is performed by routers participating
    in the specific network in a distribute manner using a Flex Algorithm definition.
    This definition provisioned on one or more routers and propagated (viz. OSPF and
    IS- IS flooding) through the network. BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection
    of various topology information from the network. This draft defines extensions
    to BGP- LS address-family to advertise the Flexible Algorithm Definition as a
    part of the topology information from the network.</p>"
