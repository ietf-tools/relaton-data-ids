abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research
    Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as
    an RFC were raised. This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol
    using History of Encounters and Transitivity. PRoPHET is a variant of the epidemic
    routing protocol for intermittently connected networks that operates by pruning
    the epidemic distribution tree to minimize resource usage while still attempting
    to achieve the best case routing capabilities of epidemic routing. It is intended
    for use in sparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully connected
    path between source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional
    routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts. These networks are
    examples of networks where there is a disparity between the latency requirements
    of applications and the capabilities of the underlying network (networks often
    referred to as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant). The document presents an architectural
    overview followed by the protocol specification.</p>"
