abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO (Application Layer-Traffic Optimization) Protocol ([RFC7285])
    defines several services that return various metrics describing the costs between
    network endpoints. An ALTO Server may offer a variety of cost metrics, based on
    latency,bandwidth, hop count, jitter, or whatever else the ALTO Server deems useful.
    For example, when downloading a file that is mirrored on several sites, a user
    application may consider more than one metric, perhaps trading bandwidth for latency
    to determine the most efficient mirror site. While the base ALTO Protocol allows
    an ALTO Client to use more than one cost metric, to do so, the Client must request
    each metric separately. This document defines a new service that allows a Client
    to retrieve several cost metrics with one request, which is considerably more
    efficient. In addition, this document extends the ALTO constraint tests to allow
    a user to specify an arbitrary logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.</p>"
