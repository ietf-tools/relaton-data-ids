abstract:
- content: "<p>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet universal,
    and because an international standard for the internet community should be documented
    and stable, this I-D has been released with the intention of producing an RFC
    to document the character use and naming conventions of the SignWriting community
    on the Internet. The SignWriting Script is an international standard for writing
    sign languages by hand or with computers. From education to research, from entertainment
    to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people are using it to write
    signed languages. The SignWriting Script has two major families: Block Printing
    for the reader and Handwriting for the writer. The script encoding model presented
    in this document evolved from the Block Printing half of the SignWriting Script.
    The SignWriting Text encoding model encompasses the Block Printing family of the
    SignWriting Script. The plain text model has been stable since January 12th, 2012.
    The rich text model is currently approaching a usable beta. The ad hoc graphemes
    of informal SignWriting were first created in 1974. Ad hoc graphemes are still
    used in the handwriting family. The standardized symbols of computerized Block
    Printing text began in 1986. After several generations of writers and standardized
    symbolsets, the ISWA 2010 has been optimized and refined as a 16-bit coded character
    set with several isomorphic encodings based on an ordered hierarchy with 6 degrees
    of significance. The International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 is a mathematical
    symbolset that has been stable since its initial release on May 11th, 2010. The
    SignPuddle Standard for SignWriting Text is an open and freely available encoding
    model for sign language as text. The licenses include the Open Font License for
    the fonts, Creative Commons by-sa (Attribution, Share Alike) for the documentation,
    and the GPL for the software implementation. The technological infrastructure
    is 63% completed and should be fully realized by the time this I-D has become
    an RFC. SignPuddle Online contains almost 1 million examples of 2-dimensional
    signs written by the internet community. Each logogram has a mathematical name
    which describes the freeform placement of the symbols. These strings are the written
    record of the sign. This standard and emerging infrastructure are used for the
    sign language Wikipedia project on Wikimedia Labs. This standard is being integrated
    with the SignTyp linguistic coding system developed by Rachel Channon through
    an NSF grant. This standard was the origin for the alternate Unicode proposals.
    For Unicode, the current use of the Private Use Area font characters is documented.
    A character proposal for plane 1 is included that is isomorphic with the characters
    that are currently used by the community. Three appendices discuss additional
    topics to the standard. The first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and
    example document, stable since January 12, 2012. The second discusses the founding
    principles of Cartesian SignWriting: a script encoding model for SignWriting Block
    Printing. The third discusses a common framework for written sign language grammar.
    This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for the Internet
    community. It is published for reference, examination, implementation, and evaluation.
    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
