abstract:
- content: "<p>Clock synchronization protocols are very widely used in IP-based networks.
    The Network Time Protocol (NTP) has been commonly deployed for many years, and
    the last few years have seen an increasingly rapid deployment of the Precision
    Time Protocol (PTP). As time- sensitive applications evolve, clock accuracy requirements
    are becoming increasingly stringent, requiring the time synchronization protocols
    to provide high accuracy. Slave Diversity is a recently introduced approach, where
    the master and slave clocks (also known as server and client) are connected through
    multiple network paths, and the slave combines the information received through
    all paths to obtain a higher clock accuracy compared to the conventional one-path
    approach. This document describes a multi-path approach to PTP and NTP over IP
    netwokrs, allowing the protocols to run concurrently over multiple communication
    paths between the master and slave clocks. The multi-path approach can significantly
    contribute to clock accuracy, security and fault protection. The Multi-Path Precision
    Time Protocol (MPPTP) and Multi-Path Network Time Protocol (MPNTP) define an additional
    layer that extends the existing PTP and NTP without the need to modify these protocols.
    MPPTP and MPNTP also allow backward compatibility with nodes that do not support
    the multi-path extension.</p>"
