abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] has been proposed as an access
    vehicle for public ATM networks. Support for multicast in this environment via
    either RAS replication, or a adding MARS client side by side with PPP is problematic
    on several fronts. This document describes how an ATM attached system can act
    as a MARS proxy on behalf of a PPP client. This solution circumvents many of the
    associated problems with respect to VC frugality, scalability, and authentication.</p>"
