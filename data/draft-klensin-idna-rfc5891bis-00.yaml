abstract:
- content: "<p>The IDNA specifications for internationalized domain names combine
    rules that determine the labels that are allowed in the DNS without violating
    the protocol itself and an assignment of responsibility, consistent with earlier
    specifications, for determining the labels that are allowed in particular zones.
    Conformance to IDNA by registries and other implementations requires both parts.
    Experience strongly suggests that the language describing those responsibility
    was insufficiently clear to promote safe and interoperable use of the specifications
    and that more details and some specific examples would have been helpful. This
    specification updates the earlier ones to provide that guidance and to correct
    some technical errors in the descriptions. It does not alter the protocols and
    rules themselves in any way.</p>"
