abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a header field
    used to capture email verification results of border receptions. These results
    are then conveyed to Mail User Agents (MUA) and downstream filters. This header
    field is to augment filtering decisions and message annotations that can be made
    visible to recipients. The annotations could affirm originating domains or content
    integrity when based upon Domainkeys or DKIM results, or a domain's authorization
    of a publicly transmitting SMTP client IP address when based upon Sender-ID or
    SPF results, or that the SMTP client IP address maps to a matching domain within
    the DNS reverse namespace. Although the draft acknowledges the conflation of authorization
    with authentication in section 1.5.2, and explicitly declares Sender-ID and SPF
    as the authorization of the transmitting SMTP client, it still fails to offer
    the authenticated entity being trusted in the exchange, the IP address of the
    SMTP client. An authenticated entity is essential for reputation assessments which
    section 4.1 indicates should be made prior to results being revealed. A reputation
    check is often a necessary step to mitigate abuse and fraud. Even so, the header
    offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made, nor does it ensure
    that the trusted entity, the IP address of the SMTP client, can be determined
    by the MUA or downstream filter.</p>"
