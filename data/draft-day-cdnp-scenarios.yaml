abstract:
- content: "<p>In describing content internetworking as a technology targeted for
    use in the 'real world', it's useful to provide examples of the possible sequence
    of events that may occur when two content networks decide to interconnect. The
    scenarios presented here seek to provide some concrete examples of what content
    internetworking is, and also to provide a basis for evaluating content internetworking
    proposals.</p>"
