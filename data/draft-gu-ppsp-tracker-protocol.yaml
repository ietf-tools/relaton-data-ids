abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Peer-to-Peer Streaming Protocol--Tracker
    Protocol (PPSP-TP), an application-layer control (signaling) protocol for the
    exchange of meta information between trackers and peers, such as initial offer/request
    of participation in multimedia content streaming, content information, peer lists
    and reports of activity and status. The specification outlines the architecture
    of the protocol and its functionality, and describes message flows, message processing
    instructions, message formats, formal syntax and semantics. The PPSP Tracker Protocol
    enables cooperating peers to form content streaming overlay networks to support
    near real-time Structured Media content (audio, video, associated text/metadata)
    delivery, such as adaptive multi-rate, layered (scalable) and multi- view (3D),
    in live, time-shifted and on-demand modes.</p>"
