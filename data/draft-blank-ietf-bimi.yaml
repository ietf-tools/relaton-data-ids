abstract:
- content: "<p>Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) permits Domain Owners
    to coordinate with Mail User Agents (MUAs) to display brand- specific Indicators
    next to properly authenticated messages. There are two aspects of BIMI coordination:
    a scalable mechanism for Domain Owners to publish their desired Indicators, and
    a mechanism for Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) to verify the authenticity of the
    Indicator. This document specifies how Domain Owners communicate their desired
    Indicators through the BIMI Assertion Record in DNS and how that record is to
    be interpreted by MTAs and MUAs. MUAs and mail- receiving organizations are free
    to define their own policies for making use of BIMI data and for Indicator display
    as they see fit.</p>"
