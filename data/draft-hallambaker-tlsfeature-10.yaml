abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the TLS feature extension is to prevent downgrade attacks
    that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol. In particular, the TLS feature
    extension may be used to mandate support for revocation checking features in the
    TLS protocol such as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling. Informing
    clients that an OCSP status response will always be stapled permits an immediate
    failure in the case that the response is not stapled. This in turn prevents a
    denial-of-service attack that might otherwise be possible.</p>"
