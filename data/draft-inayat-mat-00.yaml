abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes MAT, a mobile network architecture that allows
    smooth node mobility in wireless IP networks without using any packet intercepter/forwarder.
    The mobility solution is specifically designed for time-sensitive real-time applications,
    particularly the applications where payload tends to be short and packet header
    overhead is very significant. Connections are established as per permanent addresses
    of the nodes but are carried on by the IP layer according to the temporary addresses
    by address translation at the end nodes. The mapping information is maintained
    by database servers, which can be placed in the Internet in a distributed manner.
    TCP connections and security associations can be preserved even if the node moves
    to another subnet or the node changes its active interface in a multi-homed environment
    without modifying TCP or IPsec. In comparison with Mobile IPv4 and IPv6, MAT has
    several advantages in terms of header overhead and fault tolerance.</p>"
