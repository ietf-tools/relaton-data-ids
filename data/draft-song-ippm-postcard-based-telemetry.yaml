abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes an on-path telemetry method using packet- marking,
    referred to as PBT-M. Similar to IOAM DEX, PBT-M does not carry the telemetry
    data in user packets but sends the telemetry data through a dedicated packet.
    However, PBT-M does not require an extra instruction header but claims a bit in
    existing header fields or uses some other equivalent means as a trigger for telemetry
    data processing and collection. Due to this feature, PBT-M raises some unique
    issues that need to be considered for its application in different networks. This
    document describes the high level scheme, summarizes the common requirements and
    issues, and provides recommendations for solutions. PBT-M is complementary to
    the other on-path telemetry schemes.</p>"
