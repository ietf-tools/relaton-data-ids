abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects for information related to a Fibre Channel Zone Server.
    At present, this memo is being proposed to T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan
    is that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.</p>"
