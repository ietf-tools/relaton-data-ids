abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the extension of the format, use and communication
    of authentication names in the AFS-3 protocol to allow for additional authentication
    mechanisms to be represented and mapped to AFS IDs, independent of the AFS usernames
    currently used for management of PRDB entries. The new interface provides mechanisms
    for adding, removing, and listing mappings, and to allow the fileserver to map
    an authentication name to a PTS identity.</p>"
