abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing advice
    that must be followed by the publisher in order to maintain security. Specifically,
    this document describes the math behind the minimum time-length that a DNS zone
    publisher must wait before signing exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs. This
    document also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must
    wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming that all active RFC5011
    resolvers should have seen the revocation-marked key and removed it from their
    list of trust anchors. This document contains much math and complicated equations,
    but the summary is that the key rollover / revocation time is much longer than
    intuition would suggest. This document updates RFC7583 by adding an additional
    delays (sigExpirationTime and timingSafetyMargin). If you are not both publishing
    a DNSSEC DNSKEY, and using RFC5011 to advertise this DNSKEY as a new Secure Entry
    Point key for use as a trust anchor, you probably don't need to read this document.</p>"
