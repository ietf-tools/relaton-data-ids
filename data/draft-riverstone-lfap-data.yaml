abstract:
- content: "<p>The Light-weight Flow Accounting Protocol Data Definition Specification
    defines the data which may be sent via the Light- weight Flow Accounting Protocol
    transport. LFAP transport and LFAP Data Definition, allow an external Flow Accounting
    Service (FAS) to record flow accounting information from a Connection Control
    Entity (CCE), allowing flexible Flow Accounting Services to be deployed by a vendor
    or customer without changes to, or undue burden on, the CCE. Specifically, this
    document specifies the data that may be exchanged between the CCE and the external
    FAS. Using LFAP, a FAS can maintain details of current or historical flows for
    billing, capacity planning and other purposes</p>"
