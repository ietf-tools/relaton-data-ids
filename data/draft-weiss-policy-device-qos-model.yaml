abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to define an information model that describes
    the attributes common to the forwarding characteristics of Differentiated Services
    QoS and RSVP. Once this information model is defined, then a separate draft can
    be written to refine the core information model defined in the Policy Framework
    working group to model policies that control the configuration of DS-capable network
    devices. This approach enables the definition of policies that can be used to
    define Services for DiffServ-capable devices and networks.</p>"
