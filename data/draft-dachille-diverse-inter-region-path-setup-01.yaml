abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end diverse or
    disjoint label switched paths (LSPs) across multiple regions, as required for
    inter-area and inter-AS traffic engineering. The mechanism relies on the joint
    computation, in each region, of the LSP segments of the diversely routed LSPs,
    thereby achieving the simplicity of the per-domain approach with effectively no
    changes to the signaling protocols. This is achieved by the use of a new RSVP-
    TE object, called the Associated Route Object or ARO, which is defined in this
    document and used in the signaling messages in support of the scheme.</p>"
