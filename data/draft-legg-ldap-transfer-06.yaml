abstract:
- content: "<p>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type). A syntax definition specifies
    how attribute values conforming to the syntax are normally represented when transferred
    in LDAP operations. This representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding
    to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values. This document
    introduces a new category of attribute options, called transfer encoding options,
    that can be used to specify that the associated attribute values are encoded according
    to one of these other methods.</p>"
