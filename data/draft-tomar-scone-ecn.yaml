abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the need for defining a new on-path signaling
    mechanism and addresses the question “why can't we use Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN)” for the SCONE use-case. The SCONE objective is to optimize user QoE for
    streaming media/video services through network assisted application-level self-adaptation.
    This requires a Communication Service Provider’s (CSP’s) network device to send
    streaming media/video traffic profile characteristics (e.g. for allowed average
    media/video bit-rate, burst rate etc.) with the client application endpoint to
    enable content self adaptation implementations by content application providers
    (CAPs).</p>"
