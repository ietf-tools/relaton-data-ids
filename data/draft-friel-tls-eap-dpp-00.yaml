abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a TLS extension that enables a server to prove
    to a client that it has knowledge of the public key of a key pair where the client
    has knowledge of the private key of the key pair. Unlike standard TLS key exchanges,
    the public key is never exchanged in TLS protocol messages. Proof of knowledge
    of the public key is used by the client to bootstrap trust in the server. The
    use case outlined in this document is to establish trust in an EAP server.</p>"
