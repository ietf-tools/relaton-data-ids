abstract:
- content: <p>BGP-4 [RFC 4271] has been very successful in being extended over the
    years it has been deployed. A significant part of that success is due to its ability
    to incrementally add new features to its Path Attributes when they are marked
    "optional transitive". Implementations that are ignorant of a feature for an unknown
    Path Attribute that are so marked will propagate BGP routes with such attributes.
    Unfortunately, this blind propagation of unknown Path Attributes may happen for
    features that are intended to be used in a limited scope. When such Path Attributes
    inadvertantly are carried beyond that scope, it can lead to things such as unintended
    disclosure of sensitive information, or cause improper routing. In their worst
    cases, such propagation may be for malformed Path Attributes and lead to BGP session
    resets or crashes. This document calls such inadvertent propagation of BGP Path
    Attributes, "attribute escape". This document further describes some of the scenarios
    that leads to this behavior and makes recommendations on practices that may limit
    its impact.</p>
