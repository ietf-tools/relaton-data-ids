abstract:
- content: "<p>There are use cases, specifically in Internet of Things (IoT) and constrained
    environments that do not require confidentiality, though message integrity for
    all communications and at least server, if not mutual authentication during tunnel
    establishment are both still mandated. Examples of such use cases are given, although
    a threat model is necessary to determine whether or not a given situation falls
    into this category of use cases. In order to serve these use cases, this document
    defines the use of HMAC only cipher suites for TLS 1.3, which provides server
    and optionally mutual authentication and data authenticity, but not data confidentiality.
    The approach described in this document is not endorsed by the IETF and does not
    have IETF consensus, but is presented here to enable interoperable implementation
    of a reduced security mechanism that provides authentication and message integrity
    without supporting confidentiality.</p>"
