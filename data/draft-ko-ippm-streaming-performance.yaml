abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines metrics plus a methodology for post-measurement processing
    of sample metrics to evaluate network path performance relative to streaming video
    traffic. The metrics are based on established methodologies for TCP throughput
    testing. The post- processing methodology is based on a model of streaming traffic
    that allows a given sample metric to be evaluated against multiple sets of parameters
    representing different streaming rates, delays and buffering values. The results
    of the post-processing methodology are derived metrics that are suitable for statistical
    analysis.</p>"
