abstract:
- content: "<p>L2TP is a connection-oriented protocol that has shared state between
    active endpoints. Some of this shared state is vital for operation but may be
    rather volatile in nature, such as packet sequence numbers used on the L2TP Control
    Connection. When failure of one side of a control connection occurs, a new control
    connection is created and associated with the old connection by exchanging information
    about the old connection. Such a mechanism is not intended as a replacement for
    an active fail over with some mirrored connection states, but as an aid just for
    those parameters that are particularly difficult to have immediately available.
    Protocol extensions to L2TP defined in this document are intended to facilitate
    state recovery, providing additional resiliency in an L2TP network and improving
    a remote system's layer 2 connectivity.</p>"
