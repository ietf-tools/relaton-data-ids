abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support a new message
    type called a “Path computation” message. This message is to be used between an
    LSR and a Path Computation Element (PCE), which may be an LSR or a centralized
    path computation tool. An RSVP Path Computation Request message is used by the
    head-end LSR to send its request to the PCE. The PCE in turn sends an RSVP Path
    Computation Reply message containing either: - a positive reply, containing one
    or more paths, if the request can be satisfied. - a negative reply if no path
    obeying the requested constraints can be found. The PCE may also optionally suggest
    new constraint values for which one or several paths could be found. There are
    many situations where a PCE may be used. A typical example is in the context of
    Inter-area MPLS TE. A head-end LSR could request that a PCE compute one or more
    paths obeying a specified set of constraints for a TE LSP spanning multiple areas.
    The PCE could be a centralized path computation Element or an LSR such as an ABR
    or an ASBR. Another example is the use of a PCE to compute diversely routed paths
    between two end points. This may be useful in the context of MPLS TE LSP Path
    protection or GMPLS LSP Path protection. The computation of Multi-constraints
    paths requires intensive CPU resources, and may be yet another usage example.
    Lastly, those protocol extensions could be used as a “UNI” like protocol between
    a CE (Customer Edge equipment) and a PE (Provider Edge equipment) where the CE
    is not part of the PE’s IGP domain.</p>"
