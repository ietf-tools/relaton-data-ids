abstract:
- content: <p>The QUIC extension for one way delay mesurements adds a single timestamp
    to the ACK frame. The timestamp is set to the number of microseconds from the
    beginning of the connection to the time at which the ACK frame is sent. The draft
    defines the "enable_one_way_delay" transport parameter for negotiating the extension,
    and two new frame types for timestamped ACK with or without ECN counts.</p>
