abstract:
- content: "<p>IKE was designed for use with certificates. In a remote access scenario,
    that implies that clients must possess their own certificates. We leverage off
    of work already done to fast-start certificate use with IPsec via the Simple Certificate
    Enrollment Protocol [SCEP]. We use only parts of SCEP over a client authenticated
    TLS/HTTP connection to a CA. By using TLS, the client can trust a CA root certificate
    it receives, without an out-of-band verification and the CA can perform automatic
    enrollment. We replace the out-of-band client identification process for a certificate
    enrollment with a legacy authentication, like RADIUS. Further, since the certificates
    issued here are short-lived, there is no need to support client-based revocation
    or rekeying. Also, there is typically no need for CRL support.</p>"
