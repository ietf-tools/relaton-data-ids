abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model
    for environments in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or
    intermittent connectivity. A Bundle Protocol (BP) has been designed to accommodate
    data communications in such challenging environments through multi-hop store-and-forward
    message propagation, where each hop may be required to store bundles of data for
    long periods of time. It is therefore essential that bundles with corrupted headers
    (e.g., the primary bundle block) be detected as soon as possible in order to avoid
    resource exhaustion due to accidental or malicious factors, and to permit timely
    retransmission. In this document, we discuss the need for a hop-by-hop integrity
    assurance as a means for encouraging suitable solutions.</p>"
