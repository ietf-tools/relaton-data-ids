abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hello message for the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) has
    been defined to establish and maintain basic signaling node adjacencies for Label
    Switching Routers (LSRs) participating in a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    traffic engineered (TE) network. The Hello message has been extended for use in
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) network for state recovery of control channel or nodal
    faults. GMPLS protocol definitions for RSVP also allow a restarting node to learn
    the label that it previously allocated for use on a Label Switching Path (LSP).
    Further RSVP protocol extensions have been defined to enable a restarting node
    to recover full control plane state by exchanging RSVP messages with its upstream
    and downstream neighbors. This document provides an informational clarification
    of the control plane procedures for a GMPLS network when there are multiple node
    failures, and describes how full control plane state can be recovered in different
    scenarios where the order in which the nodes restart is different. This document
    does not define any new processes or procedures. All protocol mechanisms are already
    defined in the referenced documents.</p>"
