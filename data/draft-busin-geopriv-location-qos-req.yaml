abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes requirements for Location Quality of Service
    (QoS) Information that may be carried both in the Geopriv Layer 7 Location Configuration
    Protocol (L7 LPC) and in the Location Dereference Protocol (LDP) requests. The
    Location QoS Information is used for expressing the required or desired level
    of quality, accuracy, response time, and age of requested Location Information.
    The resulting Location Information is conveyed in existing location formats wrapped
    in GEOPRIV privacy extensions to the Presence Information Document Format (PIDF-LO)
    [RFC4119].</p>"
