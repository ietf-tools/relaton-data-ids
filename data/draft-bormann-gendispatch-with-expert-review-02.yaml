abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 8126, adding registry policies that augment
    an existing policy that is based on a review body action with the additional requirement
    for a Designated Expert review. It also updates RFC 7120 with the necessary process
    to perform early allocations for registries with one of the augmented policies.
    To support its objectives for the period of time while the above updates haven't
    been finalized, this document offers text that can be copy-pasted into specifications
    that want to make use of the augmented policies.</p>"
