abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a transformation format of Unicode that contains
    only 7-bit ASCII octets and is intended to be readable by humans in the limiting
    case that the document consists of characters from the US-ASCII repertoire. It
    also specifies how this transformation format is used in the context of MIME and
    RFC 1641, "Using Unicode with MIME". This memo provides information for the Internet
    community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>
