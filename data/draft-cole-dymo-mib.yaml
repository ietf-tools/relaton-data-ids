abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring aspects of the DYMO MANET Routing process
    on a router. The DYMO MIB also reports state information, i.e., Routing Information
    Base entries, performance metrics, i.e., counter of the number Routing Messages,
    and notifications. In addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
    information is useful to management stations troubleshooting routing problems.</p>"
