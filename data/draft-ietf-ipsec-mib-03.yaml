abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines monitoring and status MIBs for IPSec. It does
    not define MIBs that may be used for configuring IPSec implementations or for
    providing low-level diagnostic or debugging information. Further, it does not
    provide policy information. Those MIBs may be defined in later versions of this
    document or in other documents. The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators
    to determine operating conditions and perform system operational level monitoring
    of the IPSec portion of their network. Statistics are provided as well.</p>"
