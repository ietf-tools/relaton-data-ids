abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family
    of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use
    of security features provided by RPC on a per- connection basis. Important aspects
    of the authorization model, related to the use of Access Control Lists, will be
    specified in a separate document. The current version of the document is intended,
    in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4
    security issues and to provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining
    working group consensus regarding necessary changes. When the resulting documents
    (i.e. this document and one derived from the separate ACL specification) are eventually
    published as RFCs, they will, by updating these documents, supersede the description
    of security appearing in existing minor version specification documents such as
    RFC 7530 and RFC 8881,</p>"
