abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP
    LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also leaf
    to root along the co-routed reverse path. That means traffic entering the HSMP
    LSP from application/customer at the root node travels downstream, exactly as
    if it was traveling downstream along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic
    entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the
    root as if it is unicast to the root, except that it follows the path of the tree
    rather than ordinary unicast to the root.</p>"
