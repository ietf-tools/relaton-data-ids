abstract:
- content: "<p>Our combined draft on fast-reroute, draft-ping-rsvp-fastreroute- 00.txt,
    leaves several areas with future work required. One of those areas is the merging
    rules for detour LSPs. This draft describes some of the issues with the merging
    rules presented in draft-ping- rsvp-fastreroute-02.txt and proposes a solution
    which also enhances interoperability.</p>"
