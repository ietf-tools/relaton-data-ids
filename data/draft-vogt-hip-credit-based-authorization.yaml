abstract:
- content: "<p>End-host mobility with the Host Identity Protocol uses IP-address tests
    to protect against malicious packet redirection and third-party flooding. The
    tests cause handover signaling delays to increase by one round-trip time. This
    document proposes a credit-based strategy that allows peers to securely resume
    active communications after handover as soon as possible, and to pursue a concurrent
    IP-address test subsequently. The optimization thus eliminates the additional
    handover delay that IP-address tests entail.</p>"
