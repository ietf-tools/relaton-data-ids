abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane operation
    over an MPLS Packet Switched Networks. This document is a derivative work from
    draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01. Whether this is published as a stand-alone text,
    or serves as a focal point to refine the MPLS design and the key point are subsequently
    re-merged with draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01 is a matter for the DETNET WG, as is
    the editorship of any WG text.</p>"
