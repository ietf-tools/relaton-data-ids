abstract:
- content: "<p>SR Policy candidate paths can be represented in BGP UPDATE messages.
    BGP can then be used to propagate the SR Policy candidate paths to the headend
    nodes in the network. After SR Policy is installed on the ingress node, the packets
    can be steered into SR Policy through route selection. Therefore, route selection
    may be performed on the ingress node of the SR Policy. If there are multiple routes
    to the same destination, the route selection node can select routes based on the
    local policy. The local policy may use the IGP metric of the selected path, which
    is the IGP Metric of the SR Policy. Thus the BGP UPDATE message need carry the
    metric of each segment list of the SR Policy Candidate Path, which can be used
    in path selection of routing.</p>"
