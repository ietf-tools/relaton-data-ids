abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol (LDAP) technical specification. It provides a technical specification
    of attribute types and object classes intended for use by LDAP directory clients
    for many directory services, such as White Pages. These objects are widely used
    as a basis for the schema in many LDAP directories. This document does not cover
    attributes used for the administration of directory servers, nor does it include
    directory objects defined for specific uses in other documents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
