abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes eight Diffie-Hellman groups that can be used
    in conjunction with IETF protocols to provide security for Internet communications.
    The groups allow implementers to use the same groups with a variety of security
    protocols, e.g., SMIME, Secure SHell (SSH), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and
    Internet Key Exchange (IKE). All of these groups comply in form and structure
    with relevant standards from ISO, ANSI, NIST, and the IEEE. These groups are compatible
    with all IETF standards that make use of Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    cryptography. These groups and the associated test data are defined by NIST on
    their web site [EX80056A], but have not yet (as of this writing) been published
    in a formal NIST document. Publication of these groups and associated test data,
    as well as describing how to use Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    for key agreement in all of the protocols cited below, in one RFC, will facilitate
    development of interoperable implementations and support the Federal Information
    Processing Standard (FIPS) validation of implementations that make use of these
    groups. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
