abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes Optimized Route Cache Protocol (ORC) to provide
    route optimization for the NEMO Basic Support protocol. ORC provides a dynamic
    route optimization mechanism, similar to route optimization in Mobile IPv6. The
    ORC aims to manage binding information as if routing information of each mobile
    network are located at special routers called 'Correspondent Router'.</p>"
