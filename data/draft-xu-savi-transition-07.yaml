abstract:
- content: "<p>SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvement) is an excellent mechanism
    for anti-IP-spoofing, which was advocated by IETF but only focused on single-stack
    or simple network scenarios right now. To the best of our knowledge, existing
    studies have not paid attention to the IPv4/IPv6 transition scenarios. However,
    since IPv4/IPv6 transition schemes are plenty and various, one solution cannot
    meet all requirements of them. In this draft, we present a SAVI-based general
    framework for IP source address validation and traceback in the IPv4/IPv6 transition
    scenarios, which achieve this by extracting out essential and mutual properties
    from these schemes, and forming sub-solutions for each property. When one transition
    scheme is composed from various properties, its IP source address validation and
    traceback solution is directly comprised by the corresponding sub-solutions. Thus,
    the most exciting advantage of this framework is that it is a once-and-for-all
    solution no matter how transition schemes change.</p>"
