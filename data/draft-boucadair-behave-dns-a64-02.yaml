abstract:
- content: <p>In the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection (or interworking), several
    solutions have been proposed within IETF. Some of these solutions require the
    definition of a new IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address which is used to represent an IPv4-only
    host in an IPv6 realms and the definition of a new mechanism called DNS64 for
    synthesizing a AAAA record, representing an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address in the
    DNS system, from the A record representing the IPv4 address of the IPv4- only
    host. This IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address, when managed by a translator, is to be
    considered as "fake" address in a DNS system since it is not necessarily assigned
    to any host's interface qualified by the associated name. This document defines
    a new DNS record type and query type to identify IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address from
    native IPv6 ones. The new record type and query type aim at helping the requesting
    party to enforce its policies and avoid crossing NAT64 boxes when possible. Native
    addresses are to be preferred.</p>
