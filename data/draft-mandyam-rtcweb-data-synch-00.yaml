abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTCWeb working group in the IETF is tasked with developing standards
    that will ensure interoperability between web browsers establishing rich communications
    sessions. This working group is tasked with delivering the specifications necessary
    to establish real-time transport sessions between browsers (e.g. those based on
    real-time protocol, i.e. RTP). Moreover, the group is also tasked with providing
    a means for application data streaming between browsers (i.e. opaque data streaming).
    Much like RTP synchronization sources (SSRC's) can be temporally synchronized,
    there are use cases that require opaque data stream synchronization with the real-time
    communications stream between browsers in an RTCWeb session. This document provides
    some options for temporally associating an opaque data stream with a voice/video
    stream as part of RTCWeb communications.</p>"
