abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the use of RTCP-based feedback to reduce end-to-
    end delay through the use of time alignment between the source and receiver. Time
    alignment is useful, for example, in certain gateway-to-gateway scenarios and
    certain gateway-to-VoIP-terminal scenarios. It is the ability for a receiver to
    request that the sender shift the time reference for packetization by a specified
    amount. When a receiver with strict packet timing limitations, e.g., due to a
    3G UMTS Iu interface, is connected to an sender at a peer endpoint capable of
    responding to time alignment requests, e.g., with an AMR encoder associated with
    a PCM interface to the PSTN, this allows the endpoints to reduce delay in the
    speech path by as much as the 20 ms frame-block duration, depending on the degree
    of misalignment in the time reference.</p>"
