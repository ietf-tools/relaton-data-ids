abstract:
- content: <p>[RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that
    have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster convergence on topology
    change. The procedure also removes the MAC addresses in the VPLS that does not
    require relearning due to such topology change. This document defines an extension
    to MAC Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], which enables
    a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses that needs to be relearned.
    Conventions used in this document In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent
    by the client and server respectively. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
