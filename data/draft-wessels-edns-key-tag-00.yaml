abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain-of-trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This
    document specifies a way for validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server
    which keys are referenced in their chain-of-trust. The extensions allow zone administrators
    to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC- signed zone.</p>"
