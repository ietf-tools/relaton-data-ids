abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the protocol instantiations the RMT WG is chartered to create
    is a TRee-based ACKnowledgement protocol (TRACK). Rather than create a set of
    monolithic protocol specifications, the RMT WG has chosen to break the reliable
    multicast protocols in to Building Blocks (BB) and Protocol Instantiations (PI).
    A Building Block is a specification of the algorithms of a single component, with
    an abstract interface to other BBs and PIs. A PI combines a set of BBs, adds in
    the additional required functionality not specified in any BB, and specifies the
    specific instantiation of the protocol. For more information, see the Reliable
    Multicast Transport Building Blocks and Reliable Multicast Design Space documents
    [2][3].</p>"
