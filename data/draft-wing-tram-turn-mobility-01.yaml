abstract:
- content: "<p>It is desirable to minimize traffic disruption caused by changing IP
    address during a mobility event. One mechanism to minimize disruption is to expose
    a shorter network path to the mobility event so only the local network elements
    are aware of the changed IP address but the remote peer is unaware of the changed
    IP address. This draft provides such an IP address mobility solution using TURN.
    This is achieved by allowing a client to retain an allocation on the TURN server
    when the IP address of the client changes.</p>"
