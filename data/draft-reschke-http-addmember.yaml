abstract:
- content: "<p>Frequently, servers may want to allow resource creation through HTTP,
    but are not able to support HTTP's PUT method for creating new resources, as resource
    names are completely controlled by the server. This document proposes a new HTTP
    method called 'ADDMEMBER' with semantics similar to those of PUT, except for the
    fact that the server chooses the URI for the newly created resource.</p>"
