abstract:
- content: <p>Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) is a protocol that allows for an element
    behind a NAT or firewall to receive incoming data over TCP or UDP connections.
    It is most useful for elements behind symmetric NATs or firewalls that wish to
    be on the receiving end of a connection to a single peer. TURN does not allow
    for users to run servers on well known ports if they are behind a nat; it supports
    the connection of a user behind a nat to only a single peer. In that regard, its
    role is to provide the same security functions provided by symmetric NATs and
    firewalls, but to "turn" them into port- restricted NATs.</p>
