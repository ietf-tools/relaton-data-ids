abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo investigates a scheme to organize registry entries, especially
    those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Working Group
    of the IETF, and applicable to all IETF metrics. Three aspects make IPPM metric
    registration difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion to allow users to specify
    their own packet types. (2) Use of flexible input variables, called Parameters
    in IPPM definitions, some which determine the quantity measured and others which
    should not be specified until execution of the measurement. (3) Allowing flexibility
    in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a stream of measurement packets.
    Specifically, this memo proposes a way to organize registry entries into columns
    that are well- defined, permiting consistent development of entries over time.
    Also, this fosters development of registry entries based on existing reference
    RFCs for performance metrics, and requires expert review for every entry before
    IANA action. This version contains an example registry entry for a passive endpoint
    metric based on RFC7003, an example active metric entry based on RFC3393 and RFC5481,
    and an example pure passive metric based on RFC5472. Also, this version *continues*
    to allow blank entries in columns which have no applicability to a specific metric,
    or class of metrics. This is preferred to more general registry organization because
    each column serves as a check-list item and helps to avoid omissions during registration
    and expert review.</p>"
