abstract:
- content: "<p>This text formulates a specialized network concept to support communication
    constraints in automated systems. These specialized networks, formulated as Operations
    and Control networks (OCN), are significant to many application scenarios involving
    the control and monitoring of mechanical and digital devices. The document defines
    the OCN reference model, describing the associated components, interfaces, and
    reference points. The reference model is independent of any specific technology.
    Standardized mechanisms will facilitate large-scale machine-to-machine communication
    and help with the integration between OCN and the Internet.</p>"
