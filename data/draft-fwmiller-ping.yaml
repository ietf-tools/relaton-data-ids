abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has the potential for long periods
    of time to elapse when no signaling traffic is sent between a User Agent Client
    (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS). There are situations when it may be necessary
    for some signaling traffic to flow periodically between these endpoints or to
    have a quick, lightweight check for whether a UAS is alive. The PING method is
    proposed that can be used for these purposes.</p>"
