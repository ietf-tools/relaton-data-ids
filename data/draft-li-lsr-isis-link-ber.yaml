abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, network-performance criteria (e.g., latency) are
    becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics. This document describes
    extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric Extensions (RFC 8570). This
    draft provides the necessary IS- IS extensions about the link bit error ratio
    (LBER) that need to be used to describe network-performance.</p>"
