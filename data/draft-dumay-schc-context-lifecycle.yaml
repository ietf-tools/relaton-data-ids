abstract:
- content: '<p>Static Context Header Compression and fragmentation (SCHC) framework
    provides both a header compression mechanism and an optional fragmentation mechanism.
    SCHC operation is based on a common static Context stored at the two (or more)
    ends of a communication. As the scope of SCHC becomes broader, the static Context
    needs to evolve towards a more dynamic Context. This purpose of this document
    is to initiate a discussion on the lifecycle of a Context. It describes the main
    steps in the lifecycle of a SCHC Context, and more broadly, it aims at documenting
    the related Requirements and Terminology for the proper use of SCHC. These goals
    are in line with the Working Group''s objectives, as set out in the Charter: *
    "Produce an informational document describing how a carried protocol can use SCHC",
    * "Produce Standard Track documents for SCHC Rule Discovery and Parameter Negotiation",
    * "Produce Standard Track documents for SCHC Rule Provisioning".</p>'
