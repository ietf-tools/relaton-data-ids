abstract:
- content: "<p>IPFIX supports the concept of a Mediator, a device that receives, transforms,
    and exports data streams using IPFIX. One of the most important requirements is
    the reduction of the volume of IPFIX traffic by aggregating and discarding received
    information. This document introduces a number of extensions to the IPFIX Information
    Model that support the export of aggregated IPFIX data, introducing abstract data
    types and Information Elements that optimize the transport of descriptive information
    in terms of flow records' amount and size. All extensions are directly applicable
    to the IPFIX Mediator but can be used in many different applications as well.</p>"
