abstract:
- content: "<p>The Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working
    group is defining mechanisms to monitor network performance of large- scale networks.
    The use case will describe how very large enterprise networks are not very different
    from the networks considered by other LMAP use cases and that most measurements
    are useful to both use cases. In addition this use case will state the need for
    the ability to have finer grained observation related to User Experience potentially
    on a per application basis.</p>"
