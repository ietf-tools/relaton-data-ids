abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines recommendations to be implemented in mail based
    servers in the Internet and GO-MHS e-mail communities. The requirements only affect
    the basic behaviour of servers, i.e. it mainly deals with how header fields are
    handled. Although there is also a clear need for recommendations in the field
    of end user requirements, such as command syntaxes for archive servers, automatic
    distribution list subscription, etc., such issues are considered more suitable
    to be dealt with in a separate document. It is highly desirable that other e-mail
    networks connected to the Internet also implement these recommendations.</p>"
