abstract:
- content: "<p>A significant fraction of Web content is often exactly duplicated under
    several different URIs. This duplication can lead to suboptimal use of network
    bandwidth, and unnecessary latency for users. Much of this duplication can be
    avoided through the use of a simple mechanism, described here, which allows a
    cache to efficiently substitute one byte-for-byte identical value for another.
    By doing so, the cache avoids some or all of the network costs associated with
    retrieving the duplicate value.</p>"
