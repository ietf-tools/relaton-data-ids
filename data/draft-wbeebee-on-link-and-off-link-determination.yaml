abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 specifies a model of a subnet that is different than the IPv4
    subnet model. The subtlety of the differences has turned out to cause interoperability
    problems. This note spells out the most important difference; that an IPv6 address
    isn't automatically associated with an IPv6 on-link subnet prefix.</p>"
