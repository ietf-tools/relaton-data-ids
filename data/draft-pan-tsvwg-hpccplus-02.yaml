abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,
    high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks. However, the existing
    high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations for reaching these goals. In this
    document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion Control), a new high-speed
    CC mechanism which achieves the three goals simultaneously. HPCC++ leverages inband
    telemetry to obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely.
    By addressing challenges such as delayed inband telemetry information during congestion
    and overreaction to inband telemetry information, HPCC++ can quickly converge
    to utilize free bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and can maintain near-zero
    in-network queues for ultra- low latency. HPCC++ is also fair and easy to deploy
    in hardware, implementable with commodity NICs and switches.</p>"
