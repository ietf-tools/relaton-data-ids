abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extensible mechanism to support multiple
    topologies (MT) in OSPFv3. These topologies can be used within the same address
    family in order to compute different paths for different classes of service, or
    belong to different address families allowing an integrated definition of address
    family with OSPFv3. The extension described in this document can further facilitate
    any future extensions of OSPFv3.</p>"
