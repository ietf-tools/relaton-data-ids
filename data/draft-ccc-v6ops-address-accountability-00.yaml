abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts in IPv4 networks typically acquire addresses by use of DHCP,
    and retain that address and only that address while the DHCP lease remains valid.
    In IPv6 networks, hosts may use DHCPv6, but may instead autoconfigure their own
    global address(es), and potentially use many privacy addresses over time. This
    behaviour places an additional burden on network operators who require address
    accountability for their users and devices. There has been some discussion of
    this issue on various mail lists; this text attempts to capture the issues to
    encourage further discussion.</p>"
