abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a historical as well as practical overview of
    the implementation of Number Portability (NP) Administration in the United States
    (U.S.). There are various regulatory constraints that establish relevant parameters
    for NP implementation, most of which are not network technology specific. This
    document describes the NP business model and the architecture for NP administration
    in the North America. It also briefly discusses the functions performed by the
    NP administrator and the cost recovery mechanism.</p>"
