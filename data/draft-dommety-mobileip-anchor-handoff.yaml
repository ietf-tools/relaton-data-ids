abstract:
- content: "<p>In wide area deployment, the handoff latencies due to latencies in
    Mobile IP registrations, delay incurred due to setting up of dynamic keys, and
    latencies in setting up secure Tunnels could be high. This document proposes enchantments
    to reduce the latencies involved in such handoffs. It proposes enhancements to
    facilitate local registration, anchoring, and global indirect registration.</p>"
