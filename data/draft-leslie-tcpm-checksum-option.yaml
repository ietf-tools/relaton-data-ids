abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a number of situations in TCP where middleboxes are known
    to change TCP-layer data; and it would be helpful for endpoints to detect such
    changes. TCP-Checksum is a TCP option to pass checksums over particular fields
    from sender to receiver, which can detect such changes by legacy middleboxes.
    This document also sets a rule for future middleboxes which insist upon modifying
    these checksums.</p>"
