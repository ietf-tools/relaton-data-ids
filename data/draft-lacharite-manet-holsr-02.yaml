abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Hierarchical Optimized Link State Routing
    (HOLSR) mechanism for heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks. In this specification
    a heterogeneous mobile ad hoc network is defined as a network of mobile routers
    that are characterized by different communication capabilities, such as communication
    channels, processing powers or energy levels. The HOLSR mechanism is an extension
    to the OLSRv2 protocol. HOLSR takes advantage of the router's distinct communications
    capabilities to reduce the routing control overhead in large heterogeneous ad
    hoc networks, thus improving the performance of the routing mechanism. More precisely,
    HOLSR defines a hierarchy in the network and presents a routing scheme for this
    hierarchical structure with a better scalability.</p>"
