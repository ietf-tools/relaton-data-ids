abstract:
- content: "<p>P4P is a framework that enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and
    network application software distributors to work jointly and cooperatively to
    optimize application communications. The goals of this cooperation are to reduce
    network resource consumption and to accelerate network applications. In this document,
    we specify how P4P allows ISPs to provide network guidance to applications, allowing
    clients to exchange data more effectively. The applications we focus on are those
    that can have a choice in connection patterns, in particular peer-to-peer (P2P)
    applications.</p>"
