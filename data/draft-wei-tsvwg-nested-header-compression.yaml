abstract:
- content: "<p>The appearance of wireless technologies in cellular network attracts
    the attentions to compress at least two layers of nested compression headers.
    This document describes a nested compression scenario, by coordinating the header
    fields that have similar functions or even are repeated in layers of nested compressed
    packet, to reduce processing latency, packet header payload and increase the compression
    efficiency.</p>"
