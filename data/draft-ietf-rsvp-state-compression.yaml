abstract:
- content: "<p>As a soft-state protocol, RSVP specifies that each RSVP node sends
    peri- odic RSVP messages for each existing RSVP session. The overhead due to such
    periodic state refreshes goes up linearly with the number of active RSVP sessions.
    One can reduce the overhead by using a longer refresh period, which unfortunately
    leads to longer delays in re-synchronizing RSVP state in face of packet losses.
    To overcome the dilemma, this specification describes the use of a 'state-compression'
    approach to soft-state protocol refreshes. In the absence of state changes this
    compression mechanism has a constant message overhead while retaining the soft-state
    nature of RSVP.</p>"
