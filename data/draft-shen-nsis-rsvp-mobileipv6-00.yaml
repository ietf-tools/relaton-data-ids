abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo first gives a brief review of a RSVP and Mobile IPv6 interoperation
    framework proposed in [1] and compared its features with the Performance Requirements
    set forth by Requirements of a QoS Solution for Mobile IP [2]. The subsequent
    part of the memo presents specification details including message formats, processing
    rules and algorithms that form the framework. The vast majority of these specifications
    has been verified by a prototype implementation. It is expected that this work
    could serve as a useful input in dealing with NSIS protocol and mobility issue.</p>"
