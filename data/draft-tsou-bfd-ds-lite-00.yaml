abstract:
- content: "<p>In DS-Lite, the tunnel is not associated with any state information,
    which makes it difficult to manage and diagnose. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) can be used in this case to detect the state of the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel
    by creating a BFD session between the DS-Lite CPE and the Address Family Transitional
    Router (AFTR).</p>"
