- content: "<p>This document is intended to provide information of interest to developers
    of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) specifications and products. It
    is intended to provide background information and to facilitate discussion within
    IETF Working Groups, most notably LDAPbis. This Internet-Draft highlights decisions
    made by group attending the ITU-T and ISO/IEC JTC1 Collaborative Meeting on the
    Directory in London in February 2003 for inclusion in an upcoming Proposed Draft
    Amendment (PDAM) to the ITU-T X.500 / IS 9594 Specification. It also identifies
    issues that the X.500 group would like to bring to the attention of the LDAPbis
    Working Group at the upcoming IETF meeting in March.</p>"
