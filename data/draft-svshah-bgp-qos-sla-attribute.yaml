abstract:
- content: "<p>Out-of-band manual learning of SLA details and provisioning them in
    general can be complex work for network administrators. For example, Enterprise
    network administrators not only have to know what is their SLA, for voice, video
    etc application traffic, with their Provider, but they also require translating
    application groups to Classifier groups as per provider's definition as well translate
    SLA to vendor specific provisioning language. An in-band method of QoS signaling
    can help to simplify some of the complexities. An optional transitive BGP attribute
    proposed in this document intends to signal SLA details in-band, across administrative
    boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up
    some of the complex tasks. Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is
    explicitly defined in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited
    to this use-case only.</p>"
