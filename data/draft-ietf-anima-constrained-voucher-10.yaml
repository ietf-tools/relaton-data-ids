abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to an owner
    and to enroll it into the owner's network. The protocol uses an artifact that
    is signed by the Pledge's manufacturer. This artifact is known as a "voucher".
    This document builds upon the work in [RFC8366] and [BRSKI], but defines an encoding
    of the voucher in CBOR rather than JSON, and enables the Pledge to perform its
    transactions using CoAP rather than HTTPS. The use of Raw Public Keys instead
    of X.509 certificates for security operations is also explained.</p>
