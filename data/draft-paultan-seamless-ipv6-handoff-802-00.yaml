abstract:
- content: "<p>To achieve seamless layer 3 handover, mobile nodes must be able to
    perform movement detection and neighborhood candidate access routers discovery
    quickly and efficiently. In this document, we present a conceptual overview on
    how to extend the IEEE 802.11 Management frames to carry extensible application-
    specific Information Element, which allow access points to advertise the capabilities
    information of its associated network/provider and to improve movement detection.
    We believe that mobile nodes can thus dynamically discover neighboring candidate
    access routers or networks more quickly and efficiently, and also to obtain valuable
    capabilities information so as to select the 'best' target access router to initiate
    seamless handover.</p>"
