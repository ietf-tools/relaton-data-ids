abstract:
- content: "<p>With today's peer-to-peer applications, more and more content is available
    from multiple sources. In tomorrow's Internet hosts will have multiple paths to
    reach one destination host with the deployment of dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 hosts,
    but also with new techniques such as shim6 or other locator/identifier mechanisms
    being discussed within the IRTF RRG. All these hosts will need to rank paths in
    order to select the best paths to reach a given destination/content. In this draft,
    we propose an informed path selection service that would be queried by hosts and
    would rank paths based on policies and performance metrics defined by the network
    operator to meet his traffic engineering objectives. A companion document describes
    a protocol that implements this service.</p>"
