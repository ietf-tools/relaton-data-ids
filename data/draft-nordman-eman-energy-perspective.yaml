abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses applicability for energy management features to
    various types of devices and buildings. It describes the variety of applications
    that can use the EMAN energy framework and associated MIB modules. P otential
    examples are building networks, home energy gateway, etc. Finally, the document
    will also discuss relationships of the framework to other architectures and frameworks
    (such as smartgrid). The applicability statement will explain the relationship
    between the work in this WG and the other existing standards such as those from
    the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.</p>"
