    as routers, switches, DWDM systems, Add-Drop Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic cross-connects
    (PXCs) or optical cross- connects (OXCs), etc that will use Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    to dynamically provision resources and to provide network survivability using
    protection and restoration techniques.</p>"
