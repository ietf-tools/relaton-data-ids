abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an extension to the Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol, which enables announcements of the composition modes
    of multiple cost map services. Specifically, the composition mode defines how
    the results of multiple cost map services are combined to get the final prediction
    between two network endpoints. This extension allows ALTO servers to improve the
    accuracy of the prediction model at similar map sizes, and to efficiently enable
    differentiated services.</p>"
