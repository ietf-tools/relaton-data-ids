abstract:
- content: "<p>LWAPP defines the interactions of wireless lan infrastructure components,
    including access points (APs) and access routers (ARs). The AR represents a centralized
    point of management control in such infrastructures, implying critical control
    signalling between APs and ARs. Given the open nature of WLANs, a careful analysis
    of security threats is required, and appropriate security countermeasures must
    be defined. This document provides a security analysis and makes recommendations
    for securing LWAPP</p>"
