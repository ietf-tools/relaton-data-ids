abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) specification
    describes how to process domain names that contain characters outside the ASCII
    repertoire. A user who has a non-ASCII domain name may want to use it in an Internet
    mail address that contains non-ASCII characters not only in the domain part but
    also in the local part (the part to the left of the '@'). This document describes
    how to use non-ASCII characters in local parts. It defines internationalized local
    parts (ILPs), internationalized mail addresses (IMAs), and a mechanism called
    IMAA for handling them in a standard fashion.</p>"
