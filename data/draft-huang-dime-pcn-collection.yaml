abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoS
    for inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain. The PCN architecture requires that egress
    nodes send regular reports of PCN-defined measurements to a decision point. It
    requires further that the decision point occasionally be able to request certain
    measurements from ingress nodes. The decision point can be located in different
    places in the network. This memo defines a Diameter application to support communications
    between the ingress and egress nodes and a Diameter server acting as a PCN decision
    point.</p>"
