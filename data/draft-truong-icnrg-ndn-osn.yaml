abstract:
- content: "<p>Online Social Networking (OSN) applications have attracted millions
    of people over the last few years. Their traffic represents a large part of the
    traffic of the Internet. For instance, Facebook represents near 25 percent of
    the Internet traffic [14][15], and a part of this traffic is exchanged amongst
    groups of end-users which are located in the same geographic area. In this document,
    we introduce a Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture to improve the delivery
    of OSNs contents requested by end-users in the neighbourhood of the publishers:
    Having the knowledge of the social network graph and the end-users network location,
    a SDN-based NDN controller dynamically configures the NDN routers to route the
    interest requests directly between the end-users.</p>"
