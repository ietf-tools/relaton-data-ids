abstract:
- content: "<p>This document argues that security functions should be implemented
    on each layer as needed. Especially security functions should not be separated
    in its own layer. Having security scoped to the needs of each layer makes it possible
    to separate different functions correctly without the risk of impacting security
    on another layer. Note that this does not mean that each layer needs to maintain
    and negotiate it's on security context.</p>"
