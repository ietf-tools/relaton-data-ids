abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an individual contribution to the IETF ROHC WG. The document
    proposes a format for the initialization headers that establish the static (and
    dynamic) part of ROHC context. The method is intended to be general and extensible,
    and to deal well with IPv6 extension headers, headers used by Mobile IP, and IPSEC
    headers. All these headers must be dealt with according to the ROHC requirements,
    but are not handled by existing proposals. Comments should be sent to the ROHC
    WG, rohc@cdt.luth.se</p>"
