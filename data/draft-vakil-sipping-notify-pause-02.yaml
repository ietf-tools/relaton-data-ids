abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables a subscriber
    to receive asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents.
    It defines mechanisms to create, refresh, terminate subscriptions. This framework
    also defines mechanism to fetch (poll) an event state of a resource without creating
    persistent subscriptions. There is no mechanism to temporarily pause the notifications,
    while still maintaining a subscription on the server. This lack of functionality
    sometime results in a lot of superfluous notification traffic, and put unnecessary
    load on the server. This draft defines an extension to SIP events that allows
    the subscriber to pause, un-pause notifications, and be able to perform fetch
    (poll) subscriptions within an established (created) subscription dialog.</p>"
