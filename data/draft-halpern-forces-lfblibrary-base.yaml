abstract:
- content: "<p>The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working group
    is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the behavior
    of a Forwarding Element (FE). The manipulations used by this protocol operate
    in terms of adjustments to Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) whose structure is defined
    my a model RFC produced by the working group. In order to build an actual solution
    using this protocol, there needs to be a set of Logical Function Block definitions
    that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs. This document provides
    an initial set of such definitions. It is anticipated that additional defining
    documents will be produced over time.</p>"
