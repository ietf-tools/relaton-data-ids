abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the
    space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two use
    cases: network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these use
    cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few common building blocks
    in common. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to
    the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non- federated access
    management, including the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
    the Generic Security Service (GSS), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The architecture addresses
    the problem of federated access management to primarily non-web-based services,
    in a manner that will scale to large numbers of identity providers, relying parties,
    and federations.</p>"
