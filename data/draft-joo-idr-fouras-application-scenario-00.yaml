abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is designed to help organizations in their use of 4-
    octet AS numbers in the future by checking the possibility of interaction between
    2-octet AS numbers and 4-octet AS numbers for each scenario, based on the compatibility
    of heterogeneous equipment used in the actual network related to 4-octet AS numbers,
    and by verifying the interoperability of networks specified in each scenario -
    before using 4-octet AS numbers, before applying 4-octet AS numbers, as well as
    the influence on service traffic at the time of interaction.</p>"
