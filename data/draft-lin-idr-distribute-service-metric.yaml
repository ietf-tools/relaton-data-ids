abstract:
- content: "<p>When calculating the path selection for service traffic, it is important
    to consider not only network metrics, but also the impact of service Metric. Therefore,
    it is necessary to transmit service Metric information from the server site to
    the user access site, in order to facilitate path selection for service traffic
    at the access router. This document describes an approach for using the BGP Control
    Plane to steer traffic based on a set of metrics that reflect the underlying network
    conditions and other service-specific state collected from available service locations.</p>"
