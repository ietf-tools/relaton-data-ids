abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2119 defines words that are used in IETF standards documents to
    indicate standards compliance. These words are fine for defining new protocols,
    but there are certain deficiencies in using them when it comes to protocol maintainability.
    Protocols are maintained by either updating the core specifications or via changes
    in protocol registries. For example, security functionality in protocols often
    relies upon cryptographic algorithms that are defined in external documents. Cryptographic
    algorithms have a limited life span, and new algorithms regularly phased in to
    replace older algorithms. This document proposes standard terms to use in protocol
    registries and possibly in standards track and informational documents to indicate
    the life cycle support of protocol features and operations.</p>"
