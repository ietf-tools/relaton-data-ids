abstract:
- content: "<p>Bufferbloat is a phenomenon where excess buffers in the network cause
    high latency and jitter. As more and more interactive applications (e.g. voice
    over IP, real time video streaming and financial transactions) run in the Internet,
    high latency and jitter degrade application performance. There is a pressing need
    to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and jitter;
    and hence provide desirable quality of service to users. We present here a lightweight
    design, PIE(Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control
    the average queueing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical
    analysis and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency
    and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design
    does not require per-packet timestamp, so it incurs very small overhead and is
    simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</p>"
