abstract:
- content: "<p>It has become a common practice to use symbolic names (usually CNAMEs)
    in the Domain Name Service (DNS - [RFC-1034, RFC-1035]) to refer to network services
    such as anonymous FTP [RFC-959] servers, Gopher [RFC- 1436] servers, and most
    notably World-Wide Web HTTP [RFC-1945] servers. This is desirable for a number
    of reasons. It provides a way of moving services from one machine to another transparently,
    and a mechanism by which people or agents may programmatically discover that an
    organization runs, say, a World-Wide Web server. Although this approach has been
    almost universally adopted, there is no standards document or similar specification
    for these commonly used names. This document seeks to rectify this situation by
    gathering together the extant 'folklore' on naming conventions, and proposes a
    mechanism for accommodating new protocols. This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.</p>"
