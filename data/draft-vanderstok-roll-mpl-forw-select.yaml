abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Forwarder Selection (MPLFS) protocol for
    the Multicast Protocol for Low-Power and lossy Networks (MPL) to reduce the density
    of forwarders such that the number of forwarded messages is reduced. The protocol
    uses Trickle to distribute link- local information about the identity of the neighbours
    of the nodes that have MPL-enabled interfaces. In the end-state all nodes are
    connected to a minimum number, N_DUPLICATE, of forwarders, where N_DUPLICATE is
    application dependent, and there is a path between any two forwarders.</p>"
