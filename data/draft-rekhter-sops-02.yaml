abstract:
- content: "<p>The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track documents
    and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs). The intent of the standards
    track documents is clear, and culminates in an official Internet Standard. Informational
    RFCs can be published on a less formal basis, subject to the reasonable constraints
    of the RFC editor. Informational RFCs are not subject to peer review and carry
    no significance whatsoever within the IETF process.</p>"
