abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bundle Protocol (BP) was designed to enable end-to-end communication
    in challenged networks. The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which was
    designed for constrained-node networks, may be a suitable application-layer protocol
    for the scenarios where BP is used. This document specifies how CoAP is carried
    over BP.</p>"
