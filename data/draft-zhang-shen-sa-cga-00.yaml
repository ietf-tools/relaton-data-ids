abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an approach to negotiate ESP SA when both sides
    are using CGAs as IP address. The solution provides as an alternate solution of
    IKE when CGAs are available. One round of message exchanges is described in order
    to take place of the initial exchanges of IKEv2 or the phase 1 exchange of IKE.
    A new IPv6 extension header, CGA extension header, is described in order to carry
    CGA related payloads.</p>"
