abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite and 6RD so that
    both IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6 servers. The
    DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) proxying
    IGMP and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS- Lite Address Family Transition Router
    element (AFTR). IPv4 multicast data received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then
    delivered to the hosts. IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar way.
    The 6RD protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6RD Customer Edge and then tunneling
    MLD messages to 6RD Border Relays where IPv6 multicast routing is supported. Multicast
    data received at 6RD Border Relay is tunneled to 6RD Customer Edge node and then
    delivered to the hosts. We show that IPv4 multicast and IGMP can be supported
    in a similar way.</p>"
