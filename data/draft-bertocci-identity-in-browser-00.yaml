abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational document aims to gather in a single place all the
    most important scenarios in which identity protocols in current use leverage web
    browser features to achieve their goals and deliver their intended user experience.
    The purpose of compiling this scenario collection is to make it easier for the
    identity community to engage with the browser vendors, and in particular to preserve
    (or enhance) user experience and expressive power of the identity protocols in
    mainstream use as browsers introduce new privacy preserving restrictions and new
    identity tailored features. By providing a single artifact, listing scenarios
    in a consistent format, we hope to anchor the conversation on concrete outcomes
    and impact of changes on end users, developers, providers and in general everyone
    contributing to identity in the industry.</p>"
