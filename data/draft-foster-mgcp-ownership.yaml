abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Media Gateway Control Protocol Specification [2], there is nothing
    preventing multiple Call Agents talking to the same endpoint. However, this can
    present a problem if they are both trying to control the endpoint at the same
    time. The packages defined in this document solve this problem and provide new
    (and better) mechanisms for endpoint ownership control.</p>"
