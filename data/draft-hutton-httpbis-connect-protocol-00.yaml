abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to enable HTTP Clients to provide
    an indication within a HTTP Connect request as to which protocol will be used
    within the tunnel established to the Server identified by the target resource.
    The tunneled protocol is declared using the Tunnel- Protocol HTTP Request header
    field. Label usage relating to the use of HTTP Connect by WebRTC clients (e.g.
    turn, webrtc) are described in this document.</p>"
