abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered
    replication and forwarding for "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER, RFC8279)
    packets. It is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used
    as the path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER. BIER-TE introduces
    a new semantic for "bit positions" (BP). They indicate adjacencies of the network
    topology, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate "Bit-Forwarding Egress
    Routers" (BFER). A BIER-TE packets BitString therefore indicates the edges of
    the (loop- free) tree that the packet is forwarded across by BIER-TE. BIER-TE
    can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co- existence of BIER
    and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible, for example by using separate
    BIER "sub-domains" (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE
    does not require a BIER routing underlay, and can therefore operate without depending
    on an "Interior Gateway Routing protocol" (IGP).</p>
