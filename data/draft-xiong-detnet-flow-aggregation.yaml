- content: "<p>This document describes the flow aggregation scenarios and proposes
    a method by aggregating DetNet flows based on DetNet flow-specific classification
    in enhanced DetNet and the flow identification of aggregated-class can be used
    to indicate the required treatment and forwarding behaviors in scaling networks.</p>"
