abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a multicast routing algorithm for multicast
    groups that are densely distributed across an internet. The protocol is unicast
    routing protocol independent. It is based on the PIM sparse-mode [PIMSM] and employs
    the same packet formats. This protocol is called dense-mode PIM. The foundation
    of this design was largely built on [Deering91].</p>"
