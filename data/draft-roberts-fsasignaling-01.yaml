abstract:
- content: "<p>The concepts in this document are based on work on Q.Flowstatesig in
    the ITU SG11/Q5. Flow State Aware Signaling has been worked on in the ITU for
    the past 13 years. However, this document stands on its own since no IETF compatible
    format has yet been adopted. The goal of this protocol is to provide (1) a technique
    to have network nodes provide available rate flows (like TCP) rapid and periodic
    feedback to the sender as to the maximum rate they should send and (2) to provide
    network feedback to fixed rate flows (like UDP voice) if the peak rate they require
    can be statistically assured. Network traffic using this protocol should experience
    reduced response time, less queuing delay and less packet discards. The use of
    this protocol is limited to bounded subnets at the network edge and is to be converted
    to and from standard IP flows at the subnet boundaries.</p>"
