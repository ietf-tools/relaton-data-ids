abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast Supporting is one of the most important issues in Network
    Mobility Environment, because some killer applications related to multicast service
    need to be provided on Next Generation Network. However, current NEMO technique
    based on basic support protocol have got many problems to support the service
    such as route optimization, pinball route, mass of multicast problem, etc. the
    most signficant problem of the service in NEMO environment is that Mobile Network
    cannot be sure that multicasting from parent mobile networks is possible when
    the network is nested, Moreover, even though the best case that all mobile networks
    have its own multicast router is supposed and multicasting is working well, the
    multicast route tree can not be optimized due to different MNPs of the multicast
    routers in each nested network. This document defines additional functions of
    each component to enable dynamic multicast tree construction for multicast service
    in Mobile Network.</p>"
