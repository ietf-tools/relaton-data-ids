abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols such
    as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP. Over the years, the industry has witnessed
    several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly
    used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document provides the latest
    recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and
    DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases. An earlier
    version of this document was published as RFC 7525 when the industry was in the
    midst of its transition to TLS 1.2. Years later this transition is largely complete
    and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance given the
    new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, the document updates RFC
    5288 and RFC 6066 in view of recent attacks.</p>"
