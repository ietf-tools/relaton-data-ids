abstract:
- content: "<p>Bundled exchanges provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP request+response
    pairs to transmit or store them together. They can include multiple top-level
    resources with one identified as the default by a manifest, provide random access
    to their component exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.</p>"
