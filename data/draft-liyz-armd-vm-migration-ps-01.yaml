abstract:
- content: "<p>VM migration is one of the key features provided by larger scaled virtualized
    data center. Various optimizations for address resolution in such network are
    expected to be provided by ARMD. This draft describes the problems that are introduced
    by VM migration. It is expected that solutions provided by ARMD would address
    these problems.</p>"
