abstract:
- content: "<p>Advanced networks, including the Internet, will utilise an increasing
    amount of Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) infrastructure. NTNs include Low Earth
    Orbit (LEO) satellites, High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aviation, and High-Altitude
    Platform Stations (HAPS). In addition, NTN infrastructure will facilitate the
    deployment of advanced 5G use cases and services. NTNs infrastructure is typically
    mobile, with various links and nodes operating at different altitudes and latencies.
    Some NTN nodes and links are temporal and need to be scheduled and established
    at specific times based on line-of-sight availability, traffic demand and power
    budgets. This document summarises time variant NTN requirements and challenges
    not met by existing routing and traffic engineering techniques.</p>"
