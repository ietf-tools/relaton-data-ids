abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Distribution Protocol (DDP) provides a fault tolerant data transfer
    mechanism over IP networks. DDP uses a name-based addressing model which isolates
    a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating
    the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es)
    which normally constitutes a single point of failure. In addition, DDP defines
    each logical communication destination as a named group, providing full transparent
    support for server-pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability
    - members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting
    the service. DDP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy
    provided by the Simple Transmission Control Protocol (SCTP) [1]. But it can also
    use other transport protocol like TCP. Internally, DDP is made up of two parts,
    namely the Data Distribution Control Part (DDCP) and the Endpoint Name Resolution
    Part (ENRP). DDCP provides the user interface for name to address translation,
    load sharing management, and fault management. ENRP defines the fault tolerant
    name translation service.</p>"
