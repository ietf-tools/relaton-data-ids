abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the high-level requirements for Internet Voice
    Mail (IVM) and establishes a baseline of desired functionality against which proposed
    MIME profiles for Internet Voice Messaging can be judged. IVM is an extension
    of the Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM) version 2 designed to support interoperability
    with desktop clients. Other goals for this version of VPIM include expanded interoperability
    with unified messaging systems, conformance to Internet standards, and backward
    compatibility with voice messaging systems currently running in a VPIM enabled
    environment. This document does not include goals that were met fully by VPIM
    version 2. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
