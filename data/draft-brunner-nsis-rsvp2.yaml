abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a first step towards the design of RSVP Version 2. We
    take RSVP Version 1 as a basis of this work. RSVP has been criticized mainly because
    of its complexity and poor scalability among others. We present the first steps
    towards the definition of a new version of RSVP. The goal is to provide a more
    'light' approach that can help improve handling reservations in the network by
    means of a simplified behavior. This proposal for RSVP Version 2 is not meant
    as a complete replacement of RSVP Version 1 but is meant to coexist with Version
    1. For some scenarios such as receiver orientation and multicasting we assume
    that RSVP version 1 works fine.</p>"
