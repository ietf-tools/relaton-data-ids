abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing that enables
    multiple, cooperating servers to decide which one should service a client, without
    requiring participating servers to exchange information. It proposes a computable
    server selection mechanism for the DHCP or DHC Failover Protocol. In addition,
    it provides for the use of the same mechanism to govern the target server selection
    of a forwarding agent such as a BOOTP relay.</p>"
