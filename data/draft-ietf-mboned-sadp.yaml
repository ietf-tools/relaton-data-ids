abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an application-layer protocol, the Scoped Address
    Discovery Protocol (SADP), for discovering the scoped multicast address(es) associated
    with a session at particular scopes within a hierarchically nested set of multicast
    scopes. SADP is designed to work within the context of Multicast Address Allocation
    Architecture [MAAA]. It is intended that SADP will provide the necessary general
    services for reliable multicast and searching applications to use expanding-scope
    searches in lieu of the well known, but less efficient expanding-ring search.</p>"
