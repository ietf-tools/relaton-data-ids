abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests the necessity for an architectural framework
    to address network telemetry and articulates the categories and components of
    such a framework. The requirements, challenges, existing solutions, and future
    directions are discussed for each category of the framework. The framework for
    network telemetry helps to set some common ground for the collection of related
    works and put future developments into perspective.</p>"
