abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) for publishing event state used within the framework for SIP Event Notification.
    The first application of this extension is targeted at the publication of presence
    information. The mechanism described in this document can be extended to support
    publication of any event state, for which there exists an appropriate event package.
    It is not intended to be a general-purpose mechanism for transport of arbitrary
    data, as there are better suited mechanisms for this purpose (FTP, HTTP, etc.)</p>"
