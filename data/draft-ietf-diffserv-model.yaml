abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an informal management model of Differentiated
    Services (Diffserv) routers for use in their management and configuration. This
    model defines functional datapath elements (e.g., classifiers, meters, actions,
    marking, absolute dropping, counting, multiplexing), algorithmic droppers, queues
    and schedulers. It describes possible configuration parameters for these elements
    and how they might be interconnected to realize the range of traffic conditioning
    and per-hop behavior (PHB) functionalities described in the Diffserv Architecture.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
