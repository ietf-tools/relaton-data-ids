abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
    make provision for optional trailing data. However, Route Monitoring messages
    (which provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer
    Down messages (which indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting
    optional data in TLV format across all BMP message types allows for a homogeneous
    and extensible surface that would be useful for the most different use-cases that
    need to convey additional data to a BMP station. While it is not intended for
    this document to cover any specific utilization scenario, it defines a simple
    way to support optional TLV data in all message types.</p>"
