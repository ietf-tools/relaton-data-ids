abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network
    Interconnection (CDNI). The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall
    picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the
    various components necessary to interconnect CDNs. CDNI requires the specification
    of interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing, distribution
    metadata exchange, and logging information exchange across CDNs. The intent of
    this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish and to describe
    how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed
    specification to other documents. This document, in combination with RFC 6707,
    obsoletes RFC 3466.</p>"
