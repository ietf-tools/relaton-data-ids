abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends NFSv4 to allow clients to directly access
    file data on the storage used by the NFSv4 server. This ability to bypass the
    server for data access can increase both performance and parallelism, but requires
    additional client functionality for data access, some of which is dependent on
    the class of storage used. The main pNFS operations draft specifies storage-class-independent
    extensions to NFS; this draft specifies the additional extensions (primarily data
    structures) for use of pNFS with block and volume based storage.</p>"
