abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a new IKE authentication method ([HC98]) which
    provides for mutual authentication when one side is using a legacy- based secret-key
    authentication technique such as RADIUS, SecurID, or OTP and the other side is
    using public-key authentication, with optional digital certificates. The generic
    protocol described herein is an open-ended IKE phase 1 exchange ([HC98]). The
    result of this exchange is a mutually authenticated IKE security association ([HC98]).
    The keys that are derived from this SA are also authenticated and thereby convey
    this state to any SA's created from it for any other security service, such as
    IPsec [Pip98].</p>"
