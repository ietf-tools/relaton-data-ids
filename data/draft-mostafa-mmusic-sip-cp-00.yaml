abstract:
- content: "<p>The NextGen video conferencing clients require multiple concurrent
    video streams to provide a User eXperience (UX) in which multiple participants
    can be viewed at the same time, this user experience is called Continuous Presence
    (CP) video. The multi-stream CP video provides more client control of the UX and
    less processing on the conference server since the video streams are relayed by
    the server rather than mixed to compose a CP video stream. The client CP layout,
    processing power and bandwidth limitations require a per stream bandwidth and
    resolution to be negtiated in the SIP Offer/ Answer with the conference server.
    Standard methods are used to achieve this negotiation in addition to a new SDP
    parameter. This document explains the methodology and solution to achieve this
    in SIP and SDP.</p>"
