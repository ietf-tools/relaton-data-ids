abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising
    SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols. Because of possible
    interoperability issues, particularly but not only those created by simultaneous
    use of the two protocols by a receiver, the IESG was unable to determine technical
    consensus and decided it was best to publish all of RFC4405, RFC4406, RFC4407
    and RFC4408 as Experimental documents. The IESG invited the community to observe
    their deployments for a period of time, and expressed hope for later convergence
    of opinion. After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been collected
    that the experiment thus created can be considered concluded, and a single protocol
    can be advanced. This document presents those findings.</p>"
