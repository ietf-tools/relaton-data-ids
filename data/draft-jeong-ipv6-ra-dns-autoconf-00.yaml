abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the steps a node takes in deciding how to autoconfigure
    its domain name per interface in IP version 6 and the address of recursive DNS
    server. The autoconfiguration process includes a node's creating a domain name
    for its global address, verifying the uniqueness of the name in the domain where
    it is placed and registering both the regular domain name and inverse domain name
    information of the node with DNS server automatically. Also, it autoconfigures
    the address of recursive DNS server for DNS name resolution.</p>"
