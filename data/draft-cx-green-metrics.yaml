- content: <p>This document explains the need for network instrumentation that allows
    to assess the power consumption, energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated
    with a network, its equipment, and the services that are provided over it. It
    also suggests a set of related metrics that, when provided visibility into, can
    help to optimize a network's energy efficiency and "greenness".</p>
