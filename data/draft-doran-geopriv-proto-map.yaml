abstract:
- content: "<p>There are currently several protocols developed by different standards
    organizations that implement a basic design pattern where a client requests location
    from a location server and the server responds with location information. This
    document defines the Common Location Interoperability Framework (CLIF), a general
    data model for such protocols, and describes how some existing geolocation protocols
    can be mapped into this unified model.</p>"
