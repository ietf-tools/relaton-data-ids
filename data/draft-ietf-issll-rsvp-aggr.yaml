abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of a single RSVP (Resource ReSerVation
    Protocol) reservation to aggregate other RSVP reservations across a transit routing
    region, in a manner conceptually similar to the use of Virtual Paths in an ATM
    (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network. It proposes a way to dynamically create
    the aggregate reservation, classify the traffic for which the aggregate reservation
    applies, determine how much bandwidth is needed to achieve the requirement, and
    recover the bandwidth when the sub-reservations are no longer required. It also
    contains recommendations concerning algorithms and policies for predictive reservations.
