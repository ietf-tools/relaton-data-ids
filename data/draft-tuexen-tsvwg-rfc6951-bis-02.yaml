abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple method of encapsulating Stream Control
    Transmission Protocol (SCTP) packets into UDP packets and its limitations. This
    allows the usage of SCTP in networks with legacy NATs that do not support SCTP.
    It can also be used to implement SCTP on hosts without directly accessing the
    IP layer, for example, implementing it as part of the application without requiring
    special privileges. Please note that this document only describes the functionality
    needed within an SCTP stack to add on UDP encapsulation, providing only those
    mechanisms for two end-hosts to communicate with each other over UDP ports. In
    particular, it does not provide mechanisms to determine whether UDP encapsulation
    is being used by the peer, nor the mechanisms for determining which remote UDP
    port number can be used. These functions are out of scope for this document. This
    document covers only end-hosts and not tunneling (egress or ingress) endpoints.</p>"
