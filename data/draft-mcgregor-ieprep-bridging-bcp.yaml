abstract:
- content: "<p>An Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) telephony service IP Bridging
    topology using Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) should provide Emergency
    Telecommunications Service (ETS) using a) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Priority
    header value of 'emergency', b) Session Description Protocol (SDP) attribute experimental
    parameters to designate the call (session) as either a National Emergency call,
    International Emergency call, or both, c) MEGACO context descriptors of priorities
    1-6 and emergency indication, and d) MPLS E-LSPs with a dedicated codepoint specifying
    application of ETS Per-Hop Behavior (PHB). IP Differentiated Services marking
    should use specified code points allocated from the Experimental and Local Use
    pool (pool 2) to designate the traffic as either National Emergency or International
    Emergency for corresponding PHB use. Signaling between the Signaling Gateway (SG)
    and Media Gateway Controller (MGC) should apply the MTP3 SS7 protocol over the
    M2UA adaptation protocol for use of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
    Support is suggested for work in progress on defining a SIP Resource Priority
    header and defining a SIP telephone url extension for calling party category designation.</p>"
