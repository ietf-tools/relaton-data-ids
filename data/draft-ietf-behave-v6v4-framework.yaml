abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation. This is
    in the context of replacing Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation
    (NAT-PT), which was deprecated by RFC 4966, and to enable networks to have IPv4
    and IPv6 coexist in a somewhat rational manner while transitioning to an IPv6
    network. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
    published for informational purposes.</p>"
