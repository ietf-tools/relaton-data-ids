abstract:
- content: "<p>Many enhancements to the email service have appeared since its basic
    format and protocol were defined. However, the lines between these are sometimes
    blurred as a result of the evolution of the software that implements them. This
    document provides observations about these points and some clear guidelines for
    those interested in developing further enhancements.</p>"
