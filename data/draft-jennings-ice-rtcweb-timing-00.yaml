abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft summarizes the results in some experiments looking at the
    impact of proposed changes to ICE based on the latest consumer NATs. It looks
    and the amount of non congestion controlled bandwidth a browser can use and the
    impacts of that on ICE timing. This draft is not meant to become an RFC. It is
    purely information to help guide development of other specifications.</p>"
