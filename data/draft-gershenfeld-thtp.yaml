abstract:
- content: "<p>THTP, the Trivial Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an implementation
    of HTTP over UDP transport. THTP is designed for environments with limited computational
    power or bandwidth and single-packet exchanges. As such, THTP is best suited for
    the emerging class of applications running on embedded devices and sensor networks.
    THTP decouples HTTP from TCP and provides a subset of HTTP's functionality, in
    particular leveraging HTTP's URI naming scheme. This document describes the THTP
    protocol.</p>"
