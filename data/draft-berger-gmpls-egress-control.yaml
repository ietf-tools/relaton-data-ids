abstract:
- content: "<p>This note clarifies the procedures for the control of a label used
    on an egress output/downstream interface. Such control is also know and 'Egress
    Control'. Support for Egress Control is implicit in Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. This note does not
    modify GMPLS signaling mechanisms and procedures and should be viewed as an informative
    clarification of [RFC3473].</p>"
