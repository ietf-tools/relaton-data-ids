abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines the scenarios in which IPv6 transition mechanisms
    are to be used in unmanaged networks. In order to evaluate the suitability of
    these mechanisms, we need to define the scenarios in which these mechanisms have
    to be used. One specific scope is the "unmanaged network", which typically corresponds
    to a home or small office network. The scenarios are specific to a single subnet,
    and are defined in terms of IP connectivity supported by the gateway and the Internet
    Service Provider (ISP). We first examine the generic requirements of four classes
    of applications: local, client, peer to peer and server. Then, for each scenario,
    we infer transition requirements by analyzing the needs for smooth migration of
    applications from IPv4 to IPv6. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>'
