abstract:
- content: '<p>This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
    to resolve some errata that was reported, and which has proven to have interoperability
    when RFC7030 has been extended. This document deprecates the specification of
    "Content-Transfer- Encoding" headers for EST endpoints, providing a way to do
    this in an upward compatible way. This document additional defines a GRASP discovery
    mechanism for EST endpoints, and specifies requirements for them. Finally, this
    document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that was presented.</p>'
