abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol systems are a vital tool for achieving interoperability
    in today's heterogeneous communication networks. An important aspect of these
    systems is the need to determine which of the multiple available protocols will
    be used to carry out a given communication task; an uninformed choice can result
    in failure to communicate when communication should be possible. In this document
    we consider ways to make information about hosts' supported protocol configurations
    available through the Domain Name System. We discuss various representation approaches,
    and describe their use with multiprotocol applications. We present the use of
    our approach with an example multiprotocol system incorporating IPng protocols.</p>"
