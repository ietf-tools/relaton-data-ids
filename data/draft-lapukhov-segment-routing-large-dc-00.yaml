abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses ways in which segment routing (aka source routing)
    paradigm could be leveraged inside the data-center to improve application performance
    and network reliability. Specifically, it focuses on exposing path visibility
    to the host's networking stack and leveraging this to address a few well-known
    performance and reliability problems in data-center networks.</p>"
