abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes mechanisms needed to address issues associated
    with connection oriented packet networks such as an ATM network or an IP network
    which use some form of network path reservation. These issues are to: - allow
    for determination of which Media Gateway (MG) should initiate the creation of
    the network connection path and correlation of the network connection path between
    MGs, - allow for a wait state while an end-to-end network path between MGs is
    being established to effect the ADD of an connection oriented ephemeral termination,
    for example, UNI/PNNI setup of an ATM SVC, - allow for recognition and generation
    of events and signals to support access/use of a connection oriented packet based
    network. First, this document contains a proposal for use of a unique identifier
    to be passed between the two MGs that allows for correlation of a network path
    with a specific request or call attempt.</p>"
