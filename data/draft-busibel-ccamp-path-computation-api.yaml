abstract:
- content: "<p>There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical SDN context, in which
    an orchestrator may not have detailed information to be able to perform an end-to-end
    path computation and would need to request lower layer/domain controllers to calculate
    some (partial) feasible paths. Multiple protocol solutions can be used for communication
    between different controller hierarchical levels. This document assumes that the
    controllers are communicating using YANG-based Application Programming Interface
    (APIs). This document describes some use cases for an Application Programming
    Interface for path computation. A related yang model will be proposed in a next
    version or in another document.</p>"
