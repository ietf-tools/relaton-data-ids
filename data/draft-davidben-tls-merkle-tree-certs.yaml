abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Merkle Tree certificates, a new certificate
    type for use with TLS. A relying party that regularly fetches information from
    a transparency service can use this certificate type as a size optimization over
    more conventional mechanisms with post- quantum signatures. Merkle Tree certificates
    integrate the roles of X.509 and Certificate Transparency, achieving comparable
    security properties with a smaller message size, at the cost of more limited applicability.</p>"
