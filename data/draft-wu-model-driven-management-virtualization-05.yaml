abstract:
- content: "<p>Data models for service and network management provides a programmatic
    approach for representing (virtual) services or networks and deriving configuration
    information that will be forwarded to network and service components that are
    used to build and deliver the service. Data Models can be used during various
    phases of the service and network management life cycle, such as service instantiation,
    service provisioning, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic. Also, data models
    are are instrumental in the automation of network management. They also provide
    closed-loop control for the sake of adaptive and deterministic service creation,
    delivery, and maintenance. This document provides a framework that describes and
    discusses an architecture for service and network management automation that takes
    advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This framework is drawn from a network
    provider perspective irrespective of the origin of a data module andcan accommodate
    even modules that are developed outside the IETF. The document aims to exemplify
    an approach that specifies the journey from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific
    actions.</p>"
