abstract:
- content: "<p>The basic objectives of future Internet are to increase the network
    capacity, to offer a practical real-time service, and to develop a feasible charging
    scheme. These objectives introduce very strict requirements for the traffic control
    system. This paper presents a new simple approach for traffic management: Simple
    Integrated Media Access (SIMA) service. According to the SIMA concept each customer
    shall define only two issues before a connection establishment: a nominal bit
    rate (NBR) and the selection between real-time and non-real-time service classes.
    NBR has two purposes: it forms the basis of charging, and it defines how the network
    capacity is divided among different connections during overload situations. Simplicity
    means that, on the one hand, the network operator does not guarantee the continuous
    availability of network operator does not guarantee the continuous availability
    of nominal bit rate, and on the other hand, the user is allowed to send data with
    any bit rate independently of the NBR. However, the bit rate of transmission defines
    the cell loss probability in the case of network congestion. In this way a simple,
    but effective, self-regulation of traffic can be</p>"
