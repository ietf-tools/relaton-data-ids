abstract:
- content: "<p>The procedures in BGP Route Reflection (RR) spec [RFC4456] primarily
    deal with scenarios where the RR is not in forwarding path, and is reflecting
    BGP routes with next hop unchanged. These procedures can sometimes result in traffic
    forwarding loops in deployments where the RR is in forwarding path, and is reflecting
    BGP routes with next hop set to self. This document specifies approaches to minimize
    possiblity of such traffic forwarding loops. One of those approaches updates path
    selection procedures specified in Section 9 of BGP RR. [RFC4456]</p>"
