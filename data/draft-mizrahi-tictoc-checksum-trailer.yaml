abstract:
- content: "<p>Various time synchronization and delay measurement protocols are transported
    over UDP, e.g., PTP, NTP, and OWAMP/TWAMP. These protocols use timestamped packets
    that often have to be modified by intermediate nodes in the network. In such cases
    the UDP checksum field must be updated to reflect these modifications. The IEEE
    1588 standard suggests to append 2 octets to every protocol message, allowing
    intermediate nodes to reflect the checksum modification in the last 2 octets rather
    than in the UDP checksum field. This document generalizes this concept, and defines
    a UDP Checksum Trailer for NTP and for OWAMP/TWAMP.</p>"
