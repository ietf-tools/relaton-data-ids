abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a lightweight binding mechanism that allows
    NFS clients to obtain service from WebNFS-enabled servers with a minimum of protocol
    overhead. In removing this overhead, WebNFS clients see benefits in faster response
    to requests, easy transit of packet filter firewalls and TCP-based proxies, and
    better server scalability.</p>"
