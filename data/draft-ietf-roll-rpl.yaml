abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of network in which
    both the routers and their interconnect are constrained. LLN routers typically
    operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).
    Their interconnects are characterized by high loss rates, low data rates, and
    instability. LLNs are comprised of anything from a few dozen to thousands of routers.
    Supported traffic flows include point-to-point (between devices inside the LLN),
    point-to-multipoint (from a central control point to a subset of devices inside
    the LLN), and multipoint-to-point (from devices inside the LLN towards a central
    control point). This document specifies the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
    and Lossy Networks (RPL), which provides a mechanism whereby multipoint-to-point
    traffic from devices inside the LLN towards a central control point as well as
    point-to-multipoint traffic from the central control point to the devices inside
    the LLN are supported. Support for point-to-point traffic is also available. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
