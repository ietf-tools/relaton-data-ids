abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS over TCP and traditional HTTP are both stream-oriented, client-
    speaks-first protocols. They can both be run over a stream-based security protocol
    like TLS. A server accepting a stream-based client can distinguish between a valid
    stream of DNS queries and valid stream of HTTP requests by simple observation
    of the first few octets sent by the client. This can be done without any external
    demultiplexing mechanism like TCP port number or ALPN. Implicit multiplexing of
    the two protocols over a single listening port can be useful for obscuring the
    presence of DNS queries from a network observer, which makes it relevant for DNS
    privacy.</p>"
