abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new network quality framework named Quality
    of Outcome (QoO). The QoO framework is unique among network quality frameworks
    because it is designed to meet the needs of application developers, users and
    operators. This is achieved by basing the framework on Quality Attenuation, defining
    a simple format for specifying application requirements, and defining a way to
    compute a simple and intuitive user-facing metric. The framework proposes a way
    of sampling network quality, setting network quality requirements and a formula
    for calculating the probability for the sampled network to satisfy network requirements.</p>"
