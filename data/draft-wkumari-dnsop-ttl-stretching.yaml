abstract:
- content: '<p>The TTL of a DNS Resource Record expresses how long a record may be
    cached before it should be discarded. This document discusses the possibility
    of "stretching TTLS" (using them past their expiration) if they cannot be refreshed.
    This works on the assumption that stale data may be better than no data. PLEASE
    NOTE: This document is a strawman to drive discussion. It may or may not be a
    good idea; this document documents the idea so that there is something concrete
    to throw tomatoes at. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,
    etc. They will be removed before publication. This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft- wkumari-dnsop-ttl-stretching.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</p>'
