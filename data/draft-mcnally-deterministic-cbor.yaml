abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of determinism is to ensure that semantically equivalent
    data items are encoded into identical byte streams. CBOR (RFC 8949) defines "Deterministically
    Encoded CBOR" in its Section 4.2, but leaves some important choices up to the
    application developer. The CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE) Internet Draft
    builds on this by specifying a baseline for application profiles that wish to
    implement deterministic encoding with CBOR. The present document provides an application
    profile "dCBOR" that can be used to help achieve interoperable deterministic encoding
    based on CDE for a variety of applications wishing an even narrower and clearly
    defined set of choices.</p>
