- content: "<p>Signature is adopted as the fundamental function in Content-Centric
    Networking (CCN) / Named Data Networking (NDN). Its service and performance rely
    heavily on the key management (KM) schemes, which are the processes to generate,
    deliver, store, protect, update, and revoke cryptographic keys. This document
    describes the use scenarios and further requirements for KM schemes in CCN/NDN.</p>"
