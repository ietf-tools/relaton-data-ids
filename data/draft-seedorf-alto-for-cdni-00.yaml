abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy
    Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks. As a consequence of this
    development, there is a need for interconnecting these local CDNs. The necessary
    interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs are currently being defined in the Content
    Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNi) WG. This document focusses on the Request
    Routing Interface of CDNi, and more specifically on how the solutions currently
    being defined in the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG can improve
    CDNi request routing. The overall intention behind this document is to foster
    discussions (in the CDNi as well as in the ALTO WG) regarding a) if, b) how, and
    c) under what conditions ALTO can be useful to optimize CDNi request routing.
    As basis for this discussion, this document provides concrete examples of how
    ALTO can be integrated within CDNi request routing. The examples in this document
    are based on the use cases and examples currently being discussed in the CDNi
    WG.</p>"
