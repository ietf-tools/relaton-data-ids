abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
    (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 to support the reporting of phishing events, which
    is a particular type of fraud. These extensions are flexible enough to support
    information gleaned from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle
    -- from receipt of the phishing lure to the disablement of the collection site.
    Both simple reporting and complete forensic reporting are possible, as is consolidating
    multiple incidents. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
