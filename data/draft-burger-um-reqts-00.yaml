abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Unified Messaging brings together the body of work done in
    VPIM, FPIM, IMAPEXT, and other IETF work groups. The goal is to provide a single
    infrastructure, mailbox, and set of interfaces for a user to get, respond to,
    and manipulate all of their messages, no matter what the media or source. This
    document describes the requirements for providing such a service.</p>"
