abstract:
- content: "<p>A destination node may be unreachable due being in sleep mode that
    lasts longer than is feasible to buffer a packet in a network or at the last hop
    entity, such as a router of a link. In such scenarios the originator of the packet
    can be better off knowing destination's sleep being the cause of destination unreachable
    ICMPv6 message emitted by the entity dropping the packet. This document defines
    an ICMPv6 Code value for indicating Destination Unreachable due sleep.</p>"
