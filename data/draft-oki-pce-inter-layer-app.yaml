abstract:
- content: "<p>A network may comprise of multiple layers. It is important to globally
    optimize network resources utilization, taking into account all layers, rather
    than optimizing resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows
    better network efficiency to be achieved through a process that we call inter-layer
    traffic engineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool
    to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering. This document describes the applicability
    of the PCE-based path computation architecture to inter-layer MPLS and GMPLS traffic
    engineering. It provides suggestions for the deployment of PCE in support of multi-layer
    networks. This document also describes network models where PCE performs inter-layer
    traffic engineering, and the relationship between PCE and a functional component
    called the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM).</p>"
