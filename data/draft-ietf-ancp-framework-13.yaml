abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access
    Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node
    (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service
    reference architecture in order to perform operations related to service, quality
    of service, and subscribers. The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that
    the transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct element
    managers but rather uses a direct device-device communication. This allows for
    performing access-link-related operations within those network elements, while
    avoiding impact on the existing Operational Support Systems. This document first
    identifies a number of use cases for which the Access Node Control Mechanism may
    be appropriate. It then presents the requirements for the Access Node Control
    Protocol (ANCP) that must be taken into account during protocol design. Finally,
    it describes requirements for the network elements that need to support ANCP and
    the described use cases. These requirements should be seen as guidelines rather
    than as absolute requirements. RFC 2119 therefore does not apply to the nodal
    requirements. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
