abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the interface (protocol) requirements between
    the components of the NEA (Network Endpoint Assessment) conceptual architecture.
    NEA provides owners of networks (e.g. an enterprise offering remote access) a
    mechanism to learn the operational state or posture of a system requesting network
    access and then apply this knowledge to the network admission decision. In this
    case, operational posture refers to information about the configuration and use
    of hardware and software capabilities available or running on the system. This
    information is frequently useful for detecting systems that are lacking (or have
    out of date) security protective mechanisms (e.g. anti-virus, firewall.) In order
    to provide context for the requirements, a conceptual architecture and terminology
    is introduced. This architecture is provided for informational purposes but is
    based on the models used by NAC[9], NAP[10] and TNC[8].</p>"
