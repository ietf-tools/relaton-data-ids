abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new method - PXP- to connect IPvX islands
    together over IPvY network and reduce the reliance on the relays of existing transition
    mechanisms by shifting the burden to edge gateways on each island. In this method,
    direct tunnels are set up between the IPvX islands, and a P2P overlay network
    is maintained between their gateways to propagate information of tunnel end points.</p>"
