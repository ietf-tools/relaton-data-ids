abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposal to the IETF/IAB and ISO/ITU to permit the
    current address administration and registration facilities of the ISO/ITU to assist
    in deploying some of the IP6 and Internet address forms. It is desired that the
    next generation Internet architecture and IP6 can be deployed uniformly with other
    internetworking standards across the world. It has also been desirable that in
    the process of developing IPng that harmonisation of the OSI and IP internetworking
    technologies and their addressing schemes occur.</p>"
