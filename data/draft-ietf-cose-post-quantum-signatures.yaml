abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes JSON and CBOR serializations for several post
    quantum cryptography (PQC) based suites including CRYSTALS Dilithium, Falcon,
    and SPHINCS+. This document does not define any new cryptography, only seralizations
    of existing cryptographic systems. This document registers key types for JOSE
    and COSE, specifically LWE, NTRU, and HASH. Key types in this document are specified
    by the cryptographic algorithm family in use by a particular algorithm as discussed
    in RFC7517. This document registers signature algorithms types for JOSE and COSE,
    specifically CRYDI3 and others as required for use of various post quantum signature
    schemes.</p>"
