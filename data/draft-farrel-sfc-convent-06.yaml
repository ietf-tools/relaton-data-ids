abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a network that supports Service Function Chaining
    (SFC) using the Network Service Header (NSH) with no payload data and carrying
    only metadata. This is achieved by defining a new NSH "Next Protocol" type value
    of "None". This document illustrates some of the functions that may be achieved
    or enhanced by this mechanism, but it does not provide an exhaustive list of use
    cases, nor is it intended to be definitive about the functions it describes. It
    is expected that other documents will describe specific use cases in more detail
    and will define the protocol mechanics for each use case.</p>
