abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a stateless transport mechanism and message content
    between an Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) and its UAS Service Supplier (USS) for
    Network Remote ID (Net-RID) messages. It leverages the Broadcast Remote ID (B-RID)
    messages as constructed by the UA, or constructed by the Ground Control Station
    (GCS) from the Command-and-Control (C2) messages that are then sent directly over
    UDP from the UAS. These messages are authenticated by the DRIP Authentication
    messages if originating from the UA. When originating from the GCS, CBOR Web Tokens
    (CWT) signed by the GCS's DRIP Entity Tag (DET), are used. Transport privacy is
    out-of-scope in this approach per the stateless design. Some proposals are offered
    for data privacy that require some minimal state.</p>"
