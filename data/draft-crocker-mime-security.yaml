abstract:
- content: "<p>MIME is the preferred Internet mechanism for labeling and aggregating
    bulk data objects, such as for email and the web, and it is essential to have
    useful, MIME-based mechanisms. Indeed, two standards have existed for some years:
    OpenPGP and S/MIME. A current IESG policy for new application protocols requires
    that they mandate conforming implementations to support a single security mechanism.
    For applications using MIME security, this means that the specification is required
    to choose between S/MIME and OpenPGP. Although well-intentioned, the policy is
    at least useless and at worst counter-productive. This note discusses the problem
    and suggests returning to the previously acceptable policy that better reflects
    the lack of market resolve for MIME security.</p>"
