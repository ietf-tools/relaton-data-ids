abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a way that floating point values may be represented
    as directory (ASCII) strings such that standard ordering rules can be used to
    sort the strings into the correct collating sequence for their numeric value.
    The representation is intended for use in X.500 like directories, and has been
    developed to support mapping of the DMTF Common Information Model.</p>"
