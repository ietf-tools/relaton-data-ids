abstract:
- content: <p>Although there are many perceived benefits to Network Address Translation
    (NAT), the primary benefit of "amplifying" available address space is not needed
    in IPv6. In addition to its many serious disadvantages there is a perception that
    other benefits exist, such as a variety of management and security reasons that
    could be useful for an Internet Protocol. IPv6 does not support NAT by design
    and this document shows how Network Architecture Protection (NAP) using IPv6 can
    provide the benefits without the need for NAT.</p>
