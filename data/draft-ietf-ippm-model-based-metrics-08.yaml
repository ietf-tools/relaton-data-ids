abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target Transport
    Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths.
    The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to key infrastructure, such
    as interconnects or even individual devices, to accurately detect if any part
    of the infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting the Target
    Transport Performance. For Bulk Transport Capacity, the IP diagnostics are built
    on test streams that mimic TCP over the complete path and statistical criteria
    for evaluating the packet transfer statistics of those streams. The temporal structure
    of the test stream (bursts, etc) mimic TCP or other transport protocol carrying
    bulk data over a long path but are constructed to be independent of the details
    of the subpath under test, end systems or applications. Likewise the success criteria
    evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the subpath against criteria determined
    by protocol performance models applied to the Target Transport Performance of
    the complete path. The success criteria also does not depend on the details of
    the subpath, end systems or application. Model Based Metrics exhibit several important
    new properties not present in other Bulk Transport Capacity Metrics, including
    the ability to reason about concatenated or overlapping subpaths. The results
    are vantage independent which is critical for supporting independent validation
    of tests by comparing results from multiple measurement points. This document
    does not define the IP diagnostic tests, but provides a framework for designing
    suites of IP diagnostic tests that are tailored to confirming that infrastructure
    can meet the predetermined Target Transport Performance.</p>"
