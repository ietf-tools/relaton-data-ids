abstract:
- content: "<p>While traditional mobility support deals with providing continuous
    Internet connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support), network mobility
    support means dealing with situations where an entire network changes its point
    of attachment to the Internet. Such a network is called a mobile network. This
    document identifies architectural entities of network mobility and nested network
    mobility.</p>"
