abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard
    ITU-T Recommendation H.265 and ISO/IEC International Standard 23008-2, both also
    known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) [HEVC], developed by the Joint Collaborative
    Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC). The RTP payload format allows for packetization
    of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload,
    as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets. Furthermore,
    it supports transmission of an HEVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP
    flows. The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet
    video streaming, and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.</p>"
