abstract:
- content: "<p>iCAN (instant Congestion Assessment Network) is a set of mechanisms
    running directly on network nodes: o To adjust the flows paths based on real-time
    measurement of the candidate paths. o The measurement is to reflect the congestion
    situation of each path, so that the ingress nodes could decide which flows need
    to be switched from a path to another. This is something that current SDN and
    TE technologies can hardly achieve: o SDN Controller is slow and far from the
    data plane, it is neither able to assess the real-time congestion situation of
    each path, nor able to assure the data plane always go as expected (especially
    in SRv6 scenarios). However, iCAN can work with SDN perfectly: controller planning
    multi-path transmission, and iCAN does the flow optimization automatically. o
    Traditional TE is not able to adjust the flow paths in real-time.</p>"
