abstract:
- content: "<p>IPFIX protocol has been used to carry Information Elements, which are
    defined to measure the traffic information and information related to the traffic
    observation point, traffic metering process and the exporting process. Network
    or device status are checked through analysing neccessary observed information.
    Although most of the existing Information Elements are useful for network security
    inspection, they are still not sufficient to determine the reasons behind observed
    events such as for DDOS attack, ICMP attack, and fragment attack. To allow administrators
    making effective and quick response to the attacks, this document extends the
    standard Information Elements and describes the formats for inspecting network
    security.</p>"
