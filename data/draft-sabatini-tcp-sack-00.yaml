abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo expands on the Selective Acknowledgement Protocol described
    in RFC2018 to improve its performance and efficiency while reducing the delay
    involved in recovering lost segments. This leads to very reliable and efficient
    communications regardless of transit delay or high levels of lost segments due
    to noise or congestion. It introduces a fundamentally new way of looking at Selective
    Acknowledgement and uses this concept to improve the performance of the RFC2018
    protocol. This memo proposes an implementation of the improved SACK and discusses
    its performance and related issues.</p>"
