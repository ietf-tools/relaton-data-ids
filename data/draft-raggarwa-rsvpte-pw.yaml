abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures for using Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) for signaling Pseudowires (PWs). One motivation is the signaling
    of PW QoS. The other is the setup of a multi-hop PW, for example, to span multiple
    domains. RSVP-TE provides mechanisms for QoS signaling and these can be leveraged
    for signaling PW QoS. It also provides the ability to signal bi-directional MPLS
    Label Switched Paths (LSP) with explicit routes. This can be used for signaling
    multi-hop PWs that require explicit routing. RSVP-TE also provides the ability
    to establish non- adjacent or targeted signaling sessions.</p>"
