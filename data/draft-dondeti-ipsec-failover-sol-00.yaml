abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec gateways and servers maintaining SAs with large number of clients
    can quickly recover from failover using the protocols and procedures specified
    in this document. These techniques also facilitate IPsec clients to move from
    one gateway to another and resume operation without having to rerun IKEv2. The
    idea is to maintain IKEv2 and IPsec SA state at either the client or one or more
    backup servers to reduce the communication and computation overhead associated
    with reestablishing the SAs from scratch. Client to server SA state storage retrieval
    mechanisms and client-initiated or server-initiated failover recovery protocols
    are specified. This document, however, does not define an inter-gateway transport
    mechanism to transfer the state across entities at the backend.</p>"
