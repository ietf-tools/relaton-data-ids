abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has defined a wide range of transport protocols over the past
    three decades. However, the majority of these have failed to find traction within
    the Internet. This has left developers with little choice but to use TCP and UDP
    for most applications. In many cases the developer isn't interested in which transport
    protocol they should use. Rather they are interested in the set of services that
    the protocol provides to their application. TCP provides a very rich set of transport
    services, but offers no flexibility over which services can be used. By contrast,
    UDP provides a minimal set of services. As a consequence many developers have
    begun to write application- level transport protocols that operate on top of UDP
    and offer them some of the flexibility they are looking for. We believe that this
    highlights a real problem: applications would like to be able to specify the services
    they receive from the transport protocol, but currently transport protocols are
    not defined in this fashion. There is an additional problem relating to how to
    ensure new protocols are able to be adopted within the Internet, but that is beyond
    the scope of this problem statement.</p>"
