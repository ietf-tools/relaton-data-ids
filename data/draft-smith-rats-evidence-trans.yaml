abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
    the trustworthiness of a remote Attester to decide if continued interaction is
    warrented. Evidence structures can vary making appraisals challenging for Verifiers.
    Verifiers need to understand Evidence encoding formats and some of the Evidence
    semantics to appraise it. Consequently, Evidence may require format transformation
    to an internal representation that preserves original semantics. This document
    specifies Evidence transformation methods for DiceTcbInfo, concise evidence, and
    SPDM measurements block structures. These Evidence structures are converted to
    the CoRIM internal representation and follow CoRIM defined appraisal procedures.</p>"
