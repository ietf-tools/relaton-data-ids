abstract:
- content: "<p>The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols such as Bundle
    Protocol and Licklider. The specifications of these protocols contain fields that
    are subject to a registry. For the purpose of its research work, the group created
    adhoc registries[DTNRGREG]. As the specifications are stable and have multiple
    interoperable implementations, the group would like to handoff the registries
    to IANA for official custidy. This document describes the actions needed to be
    executed by IANA.</p>"
