abstract:
- content: "<p>If the Internet is accessed via cellular networks, the Point-to-Point
    protocol (PPP) is most commonly used for configuration of the circuit-switched
    or packet-switched link. Thus, this PPP configuration time comes in addition to
    the usual call-setup time for the cellular connection. In many cases this will
    result in a fairly long 'wait time' as perceived by end users before actual application
    data can be transmitted. This proposal describes a solution in which the PPP configuration
    time can be significantly reduced (on the order of seconds) in cases where both
    peer protocol entities can be modified according to this proposal, which involves
    modifying standard PPP. In cases where one PPP peer is modified and the other
    utilizes only standard PPP, the modified peer can fallback to standard PPP operation.
    This fallback mechanism will not noticeably affect the PPP setup time, and serves
    to ensure interoperability.</p>"
