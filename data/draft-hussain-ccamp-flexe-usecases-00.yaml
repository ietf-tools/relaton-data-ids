abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates
    of the Ethernet PHY(s). OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was the first
    step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY rates. OIF has recently
    approved another implementation agreement [OIFFLEXE1] which allows complete decoupling
    of the MAC data rates and the Ethernet PHY(s) that support them. This includes
    support for (a) MAC rates which are greater than the rate of a single PHY (satisfied
    by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC rates rates which are less than the rate
    of a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple FlexE client signals carried over
    a single PHY, or over a collection of bonded PHY(s). This draft catalogs the usecases
    that are encountered when these Flexible rate Ethernet client signals are transported
    over OTN networks.</p>"
