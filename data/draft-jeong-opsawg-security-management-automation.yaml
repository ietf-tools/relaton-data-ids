abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Framework for Interface to Network Security
    Functions (I2NSF) in [RFC8329] for Security Management Automation (SMA) in Cloud-Based
    Security Systems. This security management automation facilitates Closed-Loop
    Security Control, Security Policy Translation, and Security Audit. To support
    these three features in SMA, this document specifies an extended architecture
    of the I2NSF framework with new system components and new interfaces. Thus, the
    SMA in this document can facilitate Intent-Based Security Management with Intent-Based
    Networking (IBN) in [RFC9315].</p>"
