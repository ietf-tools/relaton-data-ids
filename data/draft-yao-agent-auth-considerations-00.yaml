- content: "<p>Agent Communication Network(ACN) is becoming a promising and fundamental
    infrastructure for most vertical industries. To construct and build a scalable
    and trustable ACN, authentication and authorization of AI agents are some of the
    most important issues that need to be solved. This document extends the model
    of OAuth 2.0 and proposes new workflows for AI agent authentication and authorization.</p>"
