abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes to use COPS for the communication between a Label
    Switching Router (LSR) and a Path Computation Server (PCS). Path computation is
    in much regard a complex function and might be out- sourced. For this reason a
    protocol between an LSR and a Path Computation Server is needed. This memo proposes
    to use COPS as a base protocol for that task.</p>"
