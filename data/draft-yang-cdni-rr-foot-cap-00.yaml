abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of the Footprint and Capability Interface of CDNi is
    to allow a dCDN to expose information to a uCDN so that the uCDN can select a
    set of dCDN(s) to delivery contents for content publishers. In this draft, we
    propose a flexible approach for a dCDN to expose its footprint and capabilities
    based on a generic concept called Service Access or Anchor Point.</p>"
