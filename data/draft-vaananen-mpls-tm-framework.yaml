abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been recognised that the success of the MPLS depends on the
    ability to better support the multiservice traffic integration with some levels
    of service guarantees, which are not feasible to implement with the current destination
    prefix only based packet forwarding paradigms. The efficient support for these
    services throughout the network is expected to be possible using label based forwarding
    paradigm in the network. However, the service categories and the enabling mechanisms
    to support those service categories are not well addressed in the current proposals
    for the MPLS working group; the effort has mostly concentrated on the handling
    of the best effort traffic and associated scalability and routing related issues.
    The goal of this document is to define a framework for traffic management in MPLS
    networks. We discuss the set of mechanisms that have been proposed for enabling
    the implementation of the more advanced services than pure best-effort packet
    forwarding, and the impact of those mechanisms with respect to MPLS network environments
    and MPLS protocol implementation. The document describes the mechanisms and their
    application with the intent to approach the level of the traffic management capabilities
    that are currently available in hybrid router/ATM or frame relay networks using
    the MPLS. The approach taken is that no modifications are required in the end
    station protocol or application software in the first phase of deployment, while
    this might be allowed later, if deemed necessary. This document concentrates on
    the issues from the public network operators point of view, although most of the
    discussion applies as well in the local network environments. Concepts and mechanisms
    described in this document are based on the previous work done in the subject
    on various working groups of IETF and other standardisation bodies. It has been
    attempted to use applicable concepts and terminology from previous work as</p>"
