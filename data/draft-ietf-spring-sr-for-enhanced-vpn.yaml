abstract:
- content: <p>Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced characteristics,
    such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter, etc., so as to support customers
    requirements on connectivity services with these enhanced characteristics. Enhanced
    VPN requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset
    of the network resources and associated policies on each of a connected set of
    links in the underlay network. An NRP could be used as the underlay to support
    one or a group of enhanced VPN services. Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source
    routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions,
    called "segments". A segment can represent topological or service based instructions.
    A segment can further be associated with a set of network resources used for executing
    the instruction. Such a segment is called resource-aware segment. Resource-aware
    Segment Identifiers (SIDs) may be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved
    network resources. In addition, a group of resource-aware SIDs may be used to
    build SR based NRPs, which provide customized network topology and resource attributes
    required by one or a group of enhanced VPN services. This document describes an
    approach to build SR based NRPs using resource-aware SIDs. The SR based NRP can
    be used to deliver enhanced VPN services in SR networks.</p>
