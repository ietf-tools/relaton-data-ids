abstract:
- content: "<p>Saratoga is a data transfer protocol designed to carry potentially
    large volumes of data over difficult network paths, often including only a single
    high-rate link and only one application flow. As the requirements for use vary
    across deployment environments, the base Saratoga specification only assumes that
    an implementation will be able to clock packets out at a configurable rate, and
    beyond this specifies no inherent or particular congestion-control behaviour.
    The design of Saratoga deliberately supports the integration of congestion-control
    algorithms without modification to the base protocol. This document describes
    how congestion control can be supported in the Saratoga transfer protocol. Saratoga
    is intended for use in private networks, where its use is engineered as a single
    flow to fill a link. However, as Saratoga is implemented over UDP, it can be multiplexed,
    and can be run across the public Internet, in which case congestion control in
    accordance with the UDP Guidelines becomes necessary.</p>"
