abstract:
- content: "<p>Post-compromise security is one of the core security guarantees provided
    by the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol. MLS provides post-compromise security
    for a member when the member's leaf node in the MLS ratchet tree is updated, either
    by that member sending a Commit message, or by an Update proposal from that member
    being committed. Unfortunately, Update proposals can only be committed in the
    epoch in which they are sent, leading to missed opportunities for post-compromise
    security. This document defines a Replace proposal that allows the fresh leaf
    node in an Update proposal to be applied in a future epoch, thus enabling post-
    compromise security for the affected member even if their Update proposal is received
    too late to be committed.</p>"
