abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP protocol is heavily used in Service Provider networks both
    for Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services. For resiliency purposes, redundant routers
    and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce the consequences of an AS Border Router
    or BGP session breakdown on customers' or peers' traffic. However simply taking
    down or even up a BGP session for maintenance purposes may still induce connectivity
    losses during the BGP convergence. This is no more satisfactory for new applications
    (e.g. voice over IP, on line gaming, VPN). Therefore, a solution is required for
    the graceful shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the amount
    of traffic loss during a planned shutdown. This document expresses requirements
    for such a solution.</p>"
