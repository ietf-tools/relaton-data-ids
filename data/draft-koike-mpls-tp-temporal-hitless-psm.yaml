abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
    carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet network deployments.
    Among the most attractive features of MPLS-TP are OAM functions, which enable
    network operators or service providers to provide various maintenance characteristics,
    such as fault location, survivability, performance monitoring, and preliminary
    or in-service measurements. One of the most important mechanisms which is common
    for transport network operation is fault location. A segment monitoring function
    of a transport path is effective in terms of extension of the maintenance work
    and indispensable particularly when the OAM function is effective only between
    end points. However, the current approach defined for MPLS-TP for the segment
    monitoring (SPME) has some fatal drawbacks. This document elaborates on the problem
    statement for the Sub-path Maintenance Elements (SPMEs) which provides monitoring
    of a portion of a set of transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Based on the problems,
    this document specifies new requirements to consider a new improved mechanism
    of hitless transport path segment monitoring. This document is a product of a
    joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications
    Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
