abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance
    of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) that traverse multiple
    regions, where a region could be an IGP Area or an Autonomous System or a GMPLS
    overlay network. This document also outlines different mechanisms that an operator
    could employ within his region to facilitate the setup of these inter-region TE
    LSPs.</p>"
