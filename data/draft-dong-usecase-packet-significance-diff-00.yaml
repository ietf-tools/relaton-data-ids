abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces a use case of packets' significance difference
    embedded with media scalability. With the dominance of video traffic on the Internet,
    selectively dropping packets or parts of packets from competing media streams
    becomes a complementary mechanism when dealing with network congestion. The document
    describes the characteristics of media scalability, some limitations of existing
    end-to-end congestion control mechanisms through rate control and adaptation,
    explains why current ways of entire packet dropping at the traffic class level
    using in-network active queue management are not most appropriate to meet end
    users' Quality of Service expectations. The document identifies that there exists
    "significance difference" among packets or even among parts of the packets within
    a flow, and brings out a new set of requirements for application and network to
    support packet significance difference to improve the Quality of Experience of
    end users.</p>
