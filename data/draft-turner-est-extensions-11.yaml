abstract:
- content: "<p>The EST (Enrollment over Secure Transport) protocol defines the Well-Known
    URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) -- /.well-known/est -- along with a number of
    other path components that clients use for PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) services,
    namely certificate enrollment (e.g., /simpleenroll). This document defines a number
    of other PKI services as additional path components -- specifically, firmware
    and trust anchors as well as symmetric, asymmetric, and encrypted keys. This document
    also specifies the PAL (Package Availability List), which is an XML (Extensible
    Markup Language) file or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object that clients
    use to retrieve packages available and authorized for them. This document extends
    the EST server path components to provide these additional services.</p>"
