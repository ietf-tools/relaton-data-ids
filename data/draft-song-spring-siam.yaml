abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an active measurement method for SRv6 which can
    support segment-by-segment and end-to-end measurement on any SRv6 path using existing
    protocols such as IOAM. A packet containing an SRH uses a flag bit to indicate
    the packet is an active probing packet and requires segment-by-segment processing.
    The measurement information, such as the IOAM header and data, is encapsulated
    in UDP payload, indicated by a dedicated port number. The probing packet originates
    from a segment source node, traverses an arbitrary segment path, and terminates
    at a segment endpoint node, as configured by the segment list in SRH. Each segment
    node on the path, when detecting the flag, shall parse the UDP header and the
    payload. In the case of IOAM, the node shall process the IOAM option conforming
    to the standard procedures defined in the IOAM documents. The method is compatible
    with some other SRv6 active measurement proposals and support multiple applications.</p>"
