- content: "<p>Servers often need to collect data from clients that can be privacy-
    sensitive if the server is able to associate the collected data with a particular
    user. In this document we describe STAR, an efficient and secure threshold aggregation
    protocol for collecting measurements from clients by an untrusted aggregation
    server, while maintaining K-anonymity guarantees.</p>"
