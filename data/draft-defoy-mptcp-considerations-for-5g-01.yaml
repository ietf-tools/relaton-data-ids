abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes scenarios where the behavior of the 5G mobility
    management framework is different from earlier cellular generations, and describes
    how it may benefit from some form of adaptation of MPTCP implementations and protocol
    aspects in the 5G system. This document also describes how MPTCP may be leveraged
    in 5G system specifications.</p>"
