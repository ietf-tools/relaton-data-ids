abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
    a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic
    demands. The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination
    of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs). PCE
    was developed to derive paths for MPLS P2MP LSPs, which are supplied to the head
    end (root) of the LSP using PCEP. PCEP has been proposed as a control protocol
    to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. A PCE-based central
    controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane
    by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing
    it. Thus, the P2MP LSP can be calculated/setup/initiated and the label forwarding
    entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
    devices along the P2MP path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as
    much as possible. This document specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions
    for using the PCE as the central controller for P2MP TE LSP.</p>"
