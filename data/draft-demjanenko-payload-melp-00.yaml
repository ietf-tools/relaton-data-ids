abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the RTP payload format for the Mixed Excitation
    Linear Prediction Enhanced (MELPe) speech coder algorithm developed by Atlanta
    Signal Processing (ASPI), Texas Instruments (TI), SignalCom (now Microsoft) and
    Thales Communications with noise preprocessor contributions from AT&amp;T under
    contract with NSA/DOD as international NATO Standard STANAG 4591. All three different
    speech encoding rates and sample frames sizes are included. Comfort noise procedures
    and packet loss concealment are detailed. Also, within the document there are
    included necessary details for the use of MELP with SDP.</p>"
