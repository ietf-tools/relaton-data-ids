abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy. This
    document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for running two servers
    on the same network with capability for either server to take over clients' leases
    in case of server failure or network partition. This is a DHCPv6 Failover design
    document, it is not protocol specification document. It is a second document in
    a planned series of three documents. DHCPv6 failover requirements are specified
    in [requirements]. A protocol specification document is planned to follow this
    document.</p>"
