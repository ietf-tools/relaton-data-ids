abstract:
- content: <p>In the spirit of simple, incremental improvement, we describe a whitelist-based
    revocation mechanism called the "Certificate Manifest Register". This is a list
    of all potentially-valid certificates which are (as of the date of production)
    known to have been legitimately issued by the CA and how they are to be treated
    by the client. This permits certificates which are checked against it to be presumed
    invalid unless listed. Several recent events have cast doubt on the sufficiency
    of blacklist-based PKIX certificate revocation mechanisms. At least one publicly-trusted
    Certification Authority was recently found to have been penetrated by a state-backed
    attacker, which issued itself several certificates valid for a particular global
    web search and email provider and then removed the records that it had done so.
    In effect, the attacker was able to cause the CA to sleepwalk. There was nothing
    that the client software developers could do to protect their users and themselves
    except remove the trust in that CA's root. This event directly caused that particular
    CA's insolvency. The Certificate Revocation List format and definitions (X.509v2
    as described in RFC 5280, its predecessors, and possibly its successors) are used
    and adapted whole-hog, with no data format changes and the alteration of one rule
    and one semantic to support whitelist-based processing. CMR is defined to use
    version integer 3 (v4) to differentiate its processing path from v2 CRL. The changes
    from the CRL Profile are so minor, though, that they potentially might be implemented
    without a version bump, without disruption to current v2 CRL consumers.</p>
