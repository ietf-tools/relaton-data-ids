abstract:
- content: <p>The "BTNS" (Better Than Nothing Security) protocols specifies how to
    use IKEv1 and IKEv2 to do unauthenticated IPsec. This document explains in the
    abstract (no language bindings are provided) how an application may learn that
    BTNS IPsec has been applied to a conversation, such that the application can plan
    to do it's own authentication using a channel binding. In addition, applications
    can use this API (Application Programming Interface) to request BTNS treatment
    of the applications' connections.</p>
