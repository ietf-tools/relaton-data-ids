abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a proposal for a different method of validation
    for DNSSEC aware resolvers. The key change is that by changing from a model of
    one Key Signing Key, KSK, at a time to multiple KSKs it will be possible to increase
    the aggregated trust in the signed keys by leveraging from the trust associated
    with the different signees. By having multiple keys to chose from validating resolvers
    get the opportunity to use local policy to reflect actual trust in different keys.
    For instance, it is possible to trust a single, particular key ultimately, while
    requiring multiple valid signatures by less trusted keys for validation to succeed.
    Furthermore, with multiple KSKs there are additional redundancy benefits available
    since it is possible to roll over different KSKs at different times which may
    make rollover scenarios easier to manage.</p>"
