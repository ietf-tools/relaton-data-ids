abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a submission to the Internet Printing Protocol Working
    Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This document is intended
    for eventual publication as an IETF Informational RFC. Comments should be submitted
    to the ipp@pwg.org mailing list. This document specifies an OPTIONAL mapping of
    IPP notifications over SNMP via new service and job trap extensions to the original
    Job Monitoring MIB [RFC-2707]. This mapping may be used to deliver printer notifications
    for any printer (not just IPP-capable ones) and also to deliver job notifications
    for any job (not just ones submitted via IPP). This document specifies (4) new
    object groups and (4) new SNMP traps for addition to the Job Monitoring MIB [RFC
    2707]. A working copy of these extensions inserted in the original Job Monitoring
    MIB ASN.1 is at: ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/ipp/new_NOT/jmp-trap-000808.mib</p>"
