abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism that
    provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a variety of increasingly
    common denial-of-service and amplification / forgery or cache poisoning attacks
    by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of NAT, NAT-PT, and anycast and
    can be incrementally deployed.</p>"
