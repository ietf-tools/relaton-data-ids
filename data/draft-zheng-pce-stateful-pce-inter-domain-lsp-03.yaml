abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains the information
    of Label Switched Path (LSP) and resource availability within a domain. Multiple
    stateful PCEs are able to provide traffic engineering inter-domain LSPs through
    cooperating with each other. This document introduces the applicability of cooperative
    stateful PCE for establishing inter-domain inter-vendor LSPs which are initiated
    by PCE.</p>"
