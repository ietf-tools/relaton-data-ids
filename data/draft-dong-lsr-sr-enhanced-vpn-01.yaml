abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation and have more stringent
    performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.
    An enhanced VPN may form the underpin of 5G transport network slicing, and will
    also be of use in its own right. This document describes how Multi- Topology Routing
    (MTR) as described in RFC 5120, RFC 4915 and RFC5340, can be extended to signal
    the network resources allocated in the underlay network to construct the customized
    virtual networks for enhanced VPN services, together with the Segment Routing
    Identifiers (SIDs) used to identify and access the network resources allocated
    for each virtual network in the data plane.</p>"
