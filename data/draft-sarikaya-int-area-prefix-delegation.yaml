abstract:
- content: <p>According to IPv6 operation in cellular networks, one prefix can only
    be assigned to one interface of a mobile node by an access router and different
    mobile nodes can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MN interface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at the access router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6
    servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in
    which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes
    to an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6 server. The access router next advertises the prefix
    information to the mobile node with a Router Advertisement message. When the mobile
    node hands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We also describe
    how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft
