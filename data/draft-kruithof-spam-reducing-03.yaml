abstract:
- content: "<p>A highly spam resistant protocol is shown, which could be implemented
    for negligible costs. Accepted email's do the sender not cost money, not accepted
    ones do. A decentralized server for keeping track of money and information is
    needed. The protocol, in which encryption naturally appears and can be used transparently
    aside of the existing mail protocol, allows to freely distribute your emailadress.
    The protocol avoids the micro payment problem.</p>"
