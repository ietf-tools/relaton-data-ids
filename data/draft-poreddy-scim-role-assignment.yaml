abstract:
- content: <p>SCIM 2.0 defines "roles" and "entitlements" attributes on the User resource,
    but it lacks a standardized way to bind roles to specific scopes such as projects,
    tenants, or groups. This gap forces organizations to rely on group sprawl or non-standard
    encodings, preventing true interoperability. This document introduces a new SCIM
    resource type, _RoleAssignment_, which models scoped role bindings as first-class
    records, enabling portable provisioning, lifecycle governance, and compliance
    visibility.</p>
