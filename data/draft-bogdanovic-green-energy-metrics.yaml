abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of energy efficiency metrics to assess
    and optimize the energy consumption of data networks. These metrics enable network
    administrators and designers to identify opportunities for energy savings, optimize
    network performance, and reduce the environmental impact of network operations.
    The proposed metrics Power Consumption per Data Rate (PCDR), Power Usage Effectiveness
    (PUE), Network Equipment Energy Efficiency (NEEE), and Energy Proportionality
    Coefficient (EPC).</p>"
