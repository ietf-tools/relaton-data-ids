abstract:
- content: "<p>Service establishment in the Open Grid Protocol is the process of creating
    an application layer association between a client application and a remote service
    responsible for managing an end entity's identity. Before a service may be used,
    the requesting party must present credentials, handle any per-entity authentication-
    time maintenance requirements, and request capabilities the client intends to
    use. Peer hosts to be authenticated include end users and remote domain hosts.
    Multiple mechanisms are defined for authentication, but all authentication and
    service establishment requests follow the same pattern.</p>"
