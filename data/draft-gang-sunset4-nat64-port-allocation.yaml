abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enumerates methods of port assignment in Carrier Grade
    NATs (CGNs), focused particularly on NAT64 environments. A theoretical framework
    of different NAT port allocation methods is described. The memo is intended to
    clarify and focus the port allocation discussion and propose an integrated view
    of the considerations for selection of the port allocation mechanism in a given
    deployment.</p>"
