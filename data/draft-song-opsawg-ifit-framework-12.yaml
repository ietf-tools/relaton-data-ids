abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks increase in scale and network operations become more sophisticated,
    traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include
    proactive and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes, are no
    longer sufficient to meet the monitoring and measurement requirements. Emerging
    on-path telemetry techniques which provide high-precision flow insight and real-time
    issue notification are required to ensure suitable quality of experience for users
    and applications, and identify faults or network deficiencies before they become
    critical. This document outlines a high-level framework to provide an operational
    environment that utilizes existing and emerging on-path telemetry techniques to
    enable the collection and correlation of performance information from the network.
    The framework identifies the components that are needed to coordinate the existing
    protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses key deployment challenges
    for flow-oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier networks.
    The framework is informational and intended to guide system designers attempting
    to use the referenced techniques as well as to motivate further work to enhance
    the ecosystem .</p>"
