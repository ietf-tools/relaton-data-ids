abstract:
- content: "<p>In theory routing decisions on the Internet and by extension within
    ISP networks should always use hot-potato routing to reach any given destination.
    In reality operators sometimes choose to not use the hot-potato paths to forward
    traffic due to a variety of reasons, mostly motivated by traffic engineering considerations.
    For prefixes carrying anycast traffic in virtually all situations it is advisable
    to stick to the hot-potato principle. As operators mostly don't know which prefixes
    are carrying unicast or anycast traffic, they can't differentiate between them
    in their routing policies. To allow operators to take well informed decisions
    on which prefixes are carrying anycast traffic this document proposes a well-known
    BGP community to denote this property.</p>"
