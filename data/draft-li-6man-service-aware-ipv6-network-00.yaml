abstract:
- content: "<p>A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
    varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss, etc. Some
    applications such as online gaming and live video streaming have very demanding
    network requirements thereof require special treatments in the network. However,
    since the current network is lack of enough information of service requirements
    of such applications it is difficult to guarantee the SLA or it may take long
    time to provide such guarantee. This document proposes the solution to make use
    of IPv6 extensions header to convey the service requirement information along
    with the packet to the network to facilitate the service deployment and network
    resource adjustment to guarantee SLA for applications. Then it defines the service-aware
    options which can be used in the different IPv6 extension headers for the purpose.</p>"
