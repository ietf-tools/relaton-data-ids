abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)
    do provision for optional trailing data; however Route Monitoring message (to
    provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer Down message
    (to indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting optional
    data in TLV format across all BMP message types allows for an homogeneous and
    extensible surface that would be useful for the most different use- cases that
    need to convey additional data to a BMP station. While this document does not
    want to cover any specific utilization scenario, it defines a simple way to support
    optional TLV data in all message types.</p>"
