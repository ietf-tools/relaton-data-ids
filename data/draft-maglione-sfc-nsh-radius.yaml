abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Service Header (NSH) protocol defines the Service Function
    Chaining (SFC) encapsulation required to support the Service Function Chaining
    (SFC) Architecture. One of the components of the Network Service Header (NSH)
    protocol is the Service Path Identifier (SPI), which identifies a service path,
    another important element of the NSH protocol is the Service Index (SI), which
    provides location within the Service Path. When Service Providers would like to
    deliver customized services offers requiring Service Functions Chains, a different
    service chain may be required for each subscriber or group of subscribers. In
    order to simplify the service provisioning in this scenario, it would be useful
    to be able to associate the Service Path Identifier (SPI), identifying the service
    chain, and the appropriate Service Index (SI), identifying the location in the
    service path, with the customer profile. In some Broadband networks, the customer
    profile information may be stored in Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
    (AAA) servers. This document specifies two new Remote Authentication Dial- In
    User Service (RADIUS) attributes to carry the Service Path Identifier (SPI) and
    the Service Index (SI).</p>"
