abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol defines a request/response
    protocol used for the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
    a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. PCEP employs Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) as the transport layer protocol by using a registered TCP
    port. This document proposes the possibility of employing UDP as the transport
    layer protocol instead of TCP. UDP is a connectionless protocol within TCP/IP
    protocol suite that corresponds to the transport layer in the ISO/OSI reference
    model. UDP converts data messages generated by an application into packets to
    be sent through IP. The reliability is not guaranteed by UDP and should be ensured
    by the application that generates the data message. The PCECP application is flexible
    to ensure the reliability of PCECP messages. This document explains on how the
    reliability of the PCECP messages can be achieved by means of PCECP, while operating
    PCECP over UDP.</p>"
