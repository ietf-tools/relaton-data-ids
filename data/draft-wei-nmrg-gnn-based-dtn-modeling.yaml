abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces the scenarios and requirements for performance
    modeling of digital twin networks, and explores the implementation methods of
    network models, proposing a network modeling method based on graph neural networks
    (GNNs). This method combines GNNs with graph sampling techniques to improve the
    expressiveness and granularity of the model. The model is generated through data
    training and validated with typical scenarios. The model performs well in predicting
    QoS metrics such as network latency, providing a reference option for network
    performance modeling methods.</p>"
