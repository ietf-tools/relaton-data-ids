abstract:
- content: "<p>As the increment of network scale, optical networks need to be partitioned
    into multi-layer and multi-domain networks for the purpose of better management.
    Meanwhile, as the variety of user requests, different LSPs need to be established.
    In order to meet different requirements of users, the LSP establishment performance
    is necessary to be measured in multi-layer and multi-domain networks. For this
    reason, typical performance measurement metrics need to be proposed. In this document,
    the LSP establishment delay and bit error ratio (BER), which are both as the performance
    measurement metrics, are illustrated, and the definition and methodologies are
    proposed.</p>"
