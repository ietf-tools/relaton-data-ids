abstract:
- content: "<p>Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant detrimental
    impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP association. The throughput achievable
    over an SCTP association also is negatively impacted by the occurence of T3-Retransmissions.
    Loss Recovery by Fast Retransmission operation is in most situations superior
    to T3-Retransmission from a latency and a throughput perspective. The present
    SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as specified by [RFC4960] are not able to adequately
    or timely recover losses in certain situations, thus resorting to loss recovery
    by lengthy T3-Retransimissions or by non-timely activation of Fast Recovery. In
    this document we propose for a number of enhancements to the SCTP Loss Recovery
    algorithms aimed to amend some of these deficiencies with a particular focus on
    Loss Recovery for drops in Traffic Tails. The enhancements supplements the existing
    algorithms of [RFC4960] with proactive probing and timer driven accelerated activation
    of the Fast Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of the
    Fast Retransmission algorithm in itself are proposed. The enhancement are proposed
    as supplements to the Loss Recovery algorithms of [RFC4960] and as such they do
    not deprecate or replace any of the mechanisms defined by [RFC4960]. The solution
    proposed draws on prior art in the area of SCTP and TCP Loss Recovery improvements.
    The mechanisms proposed include the adjustment to SCTP Fast Retransmission of
    certain improvements specified for TCP Fast Retransmission by [RFC6675] as well
    as the proposal embeds SCTP Early Retransmit [RFC5827] in a delayed variant. The
    proposal heavily draws on the ideas put forward for TCP by [DUKKIPATI01] for proactive
    probing and timer driven entering of Fast Recovery procedures. The proposal embeds
    certain aspects from [HURTIG] when applicable. The procedures proposed are sender-side
    only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.</p>"
