abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation
    functionality for very low bandwidth networks. These techniques are specially
    tailored for Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). The Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC) offers a great level of flexibility when processing the header fields.
    SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in a LPWAN device
    and in the network. Static context means that the stored information does not
    change during packet transmission. The context describes the field values and
    keeps information that will not be transmitted through the constrained network.
    SCHC must be used for LPWAN networks because it avoids complex resynchronization
    mechanisms, which are incompatible with LPWAN characteristics. And also, because
    with SCHC, in most cases IPv6/UDP headers can be reduced to a small identifier
    called Rule ID. Even though, sometimes, a SCHC compressed packet will not fit
    in one L2 PDU, and the SCHC fragmentation protocol defined in this document may
    be used. This document describes the SCHC compression/decompression framework
    and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies a fragmentation
    and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over
    LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is mandatory for IPv6 datagrams that, after
    SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply such compression, still
    exceed the L2 maximum payload size. Similar solutions for other protocols such
    as CoAP will be described in separate documents.</p>"
