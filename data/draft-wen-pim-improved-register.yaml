abstract:
- content: "<p>In [PIM-SM], Register procedure needs to be triggered by multicast
    packets in the data-plane/forwarding-plane. The dependences of the control-plane
    on the data-plane/forwarding-plane to build control- plane state does not scale
    well. And also the encapsulation at the Designated Router and decapsulation at
    the Rendezvous Point are relatively expensive operations for routers. To solve
    the above- mentioned problems, this document proposes new mechanisms to make a
    clear separation of the control-plane and the data-plane/fowarding- plane for
    PIM register procedure.</p>"
