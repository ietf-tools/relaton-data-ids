abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an operational technique that uses BGP communities
    to remotely trigger black-holing of a particular destination network to block
    denial-of-service attacks. Black-holing can be applied on a selection of routers
    rather than all BGP-speaking routers in the network. The document also describes
    a sinkhole tunnel technique using BGP communities and tunnels to pull traffic
    into a sinkhole router for analysis. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
