abstract:
- content: "<p>In-network storage systems store redundancy to compensate for the data
    loss incurred by hardware failures or other reasons. This document introduces
    a practical work of router-supported data regeneration in in-network storage systems
    to maintain the amount of redundancy. This proposed regeneration process can exploit
    the bandwidth diversity in the network, and the corresponding protocol enables
    supporting routers work transparently to support the regeneration process.</p>"
