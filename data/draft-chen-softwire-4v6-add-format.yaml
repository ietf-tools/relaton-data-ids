abstract:
- content: "<p>There are heated discussion over the unified address format and mapping
    algorithm. In order to converge the solutions, it is desirable to discuss the
    requirements and principles for the design. This document tries to propose practical
    principles for 4v6 deployment. The requirements have been derived from this deployment
    consideration. Based on that, a unified address format has been proposed for easying
    4v6 solution implementation.</p>"
