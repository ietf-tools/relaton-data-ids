abstract:
- content: <p>Two useful Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions
    in a transport network are "lock" and "loopback". The lock function enables an
    operator to lock a transport path such that it does not carry client traffic,
    but can continue to carry OAM messages and may carry test traffic. The loopback
    function allows an operator to set a specific node on the transport path into
    loopback mode such that it returns all received data. This document specifies
    the lock function for MPLS networks and describes how the loopback function operates
    in MPLS networks. This document updates Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 of RFC 6371.
