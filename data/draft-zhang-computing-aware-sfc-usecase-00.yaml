abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple occurrences of the same service function(SF) can exist in
    the same administrative domain and each occurrence of SF is called SF instance.
    A Service Function Path(SFP) is determined by composing selected SF instances
    and overlay links. The SF instances are selected according to the computing power
    of SFs in addition to the network information and this is defined as the computing-aware
    SFC in this document. This document describes the use cases for computing-aware
    Service Function Chaining(SFC).</p>"
