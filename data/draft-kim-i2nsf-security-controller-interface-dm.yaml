abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an information model and a YANG data model for
    the Security Controller-Facing Interface between two security controllers in an
    Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework. This interface is used
    for the exchange of IPsec flow protection information between two Network Security
    Functions (NSFs) in cross-domain environments. The YANG data model in this document
    is built on the basis of the YANG data model for IPsec flow protection based on
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN).</p>"
