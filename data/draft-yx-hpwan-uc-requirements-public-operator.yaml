- content: "<p>Bulk data transfer is a long-lived service over the past twenty years.
    High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) are the backbone of global network
    infrastructure, enabling the seamless transfer of vast amounts of data and supporting
    advanced scientific collaborations worldwide. Many of the state-of-the-art dedicated
    networks have been mentioned in [I-D.kcrh-hpwan-state-of-art]. For non-dedicated
    networks like public operator's network, the case is different in terms of QoS
    policies, security policies, etc. This document presents use cases and requirements
    of HPWAN from public operator's view.</p>"
