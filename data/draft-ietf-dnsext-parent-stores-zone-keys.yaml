abstract:
- content: "<p>When dealing with large amounts of keys the procedures to update a
    zone and to sign a zone need to be clearly defined and practically possible. The
    current idea is to have the zone KEY RR and the parent's SIG to reside in the
    child's zone and perhaps also in the parent's zone. Operational experiences have
    prompted us to develop an alternative scheme in which the parent zone stores the
    parent's signature over the child's key and also the child's key itself.</p>"
