abstract:
- content: "<p>This document improves and extends the SIP Servlet API defined in [2].
    The SIP Servlet API defines a mechanism, which enables the encapsulation of service
    logic in so called SIP Servlets on the top of the protocol stack of a SIP Server.
    A very important point, which is not treated by [2] is the interoperability of
    services. [3] proposes a first approach to overcome this problem with a so called
    root servlet. In this Internet draft we define a more generic model to perform
    a combination or interaction of SIP Servlets. This makes the servlet approach
    to a very powerful alternative also in UMTS to connect SIP Proxy and Service Logic.</p>"
