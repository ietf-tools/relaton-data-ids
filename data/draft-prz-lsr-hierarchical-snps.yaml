abstract:
- content: "<p>The document introduces an optional, new type of SNPs called Hierarchical
    SNP (HSNP) that can compress the traditional CSNPs exchange into a variant of
    merkle tree, hence allowing to support very large databases and adjacency numbers.
    Such an approach should lead in case of inconsistencies to much faster re-synchronization
    since only a subset of packets compared to full scale CSNP exchange is necessary
    to correct the entropy present.</p>"
