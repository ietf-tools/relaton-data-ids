abstract:
- content: "<p>There is work ongoing in the dhc working group that discusses the various
    identifiers used by DHCPv6 and the potential privacy implications. This draft
    explores several migitation techniques that could be used to address the privacy
    issues in DHCPv6. This draft is expected to evolve significantly over time, but
    the ultimate goal is to standardize mitigation techniques the DHC working group
    considers useful.</p>"
