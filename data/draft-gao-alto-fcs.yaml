abstract:
- content: "<p>ALTO cost maps and endpoint cost services map a source-destination
    pair into a cost value. However, current filter specifications, which define the
    set of source-destination pairs in an ALTO query, have two limitations: 1) Only
    very limited address types are supported (IPv4 and IPv6), which is not sufficient
    to uniquely identify a flow in networks with fine-grained routing, such as the
    emerging Software Defined Networks; 2) The base ALTO protocol only defines filters
    enumerating all sources and all destinations, leading to redundant information
    in the response; 3) Cannot distinguish transmission types of flows in the query,
    which makes the server hard to respond the accurate resource consumption. To address
    these three issues, this document extends the base ALTO protocol with a more fine-grained
    filter type which allows ALTO clients to select only the concerned source-destination
    pairs and announce the flow-specific information like data transmission type,
    and a more expressive address space which allows ALTO clients to make queries
    beyond the limited IP addresses.</p>"
