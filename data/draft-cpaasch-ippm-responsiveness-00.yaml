abstract:
- content: <p>Bufferbloat has been a long-standing problem on the Internet with more
    than a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions, implementations and
    testing. However, to this date, bufferbloat is still a very common problem for
    the end-users. Everyone "knows" that it is "normal" for a video conference to
    have problems when somebody else on the same home-network is watching a 4K movie.
    The reason for this problem is not the lack of technical solutions, but rather
    a lack of awareness of the problem-space, and a lack of tooling to accurately
    measure the problem. We believe that exposing the problem of bufferbloat to the
    end-user by measuring the end- users' experience at a high level will help to
    create the necessary awareness. This document is a first attempt at specifying
    a measurement methodology to evaluate bufferbloat the way common users are experiencing
    it today, using today's most frequently used protocols and mechanisms to accurately
    measure the user-experience. We also provide a way to express the bufferbloat
    as a measure of "Round-trips per minute" (RPM) to have a more intuitive way for
    the users to understand the notion of bufferbloat.</p>
