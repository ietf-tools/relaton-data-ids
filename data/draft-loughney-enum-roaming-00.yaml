abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new service to support cellular roaming. It calls
    for a new service type, called 'roam' to be stored in DNS. This draft outlines
    the resolution of telephone numbering plans (E.214, E.212 and E.164, among others)
    by DNS to support cellular roaming. Considerations need to be made for scalability,
    reliability and performance.</p>"
