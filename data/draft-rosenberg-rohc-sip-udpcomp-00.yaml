abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), along with many other IP protocols
    used for multimedia communications, are UDP-based, textual protocols engineered
    for bandwidth rich links. As a result, these messages have not been optimized
    for message size. With the planned usage of these protocols in wireless handsets
    as part of 2.5G and 3G wireless, the large size of these messages is problematic,
    primarily for latency reasons. As a result, we propose a protocol shim between
    SIP (or any other UDP based protocol meeting our requirements) and UDP in order
    to efficiently compress SIP messages. Preliminary results have shown compression
    gains of up to 8:1.</p>"
