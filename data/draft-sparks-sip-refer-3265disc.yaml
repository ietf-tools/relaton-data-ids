abstract:
- content: "<p>THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL SUBMISSION PROPOSING A CHANGE TO draft-ietf-
    sip-refer. IT IS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY. This document defines the REFER method.
    This SIP extension requests that the recipient REFER to a resource provided in
    the request. It provides a mechanism allowing the party sending the REFER to be
    notified of the outcome of the referenced request. This can be used to enable
    many applications, including call transfer. In addition to the REFER method, this
    document defines the referevent option tag, the refer event package, and the Refer-To
    request header.</p>"
