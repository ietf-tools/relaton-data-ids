abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we present what P2PSIP should achieve - a distributed
    location service. Then we compare the differences between C/S SIP and P2P SIP
    and point out that some features which are not standardized in C/S SIP should
    be addressed in the P2P SIP case. After analyzing some problems, some requirements
    of Peer protocol are proposed.</p>"
