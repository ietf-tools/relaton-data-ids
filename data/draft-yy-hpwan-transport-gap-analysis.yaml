abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the throughput performance of existing transport
    protocols under different implementation modes, including kernel space based mode,
    user space based mode, and offloading-based implementations, and concludes that
    existing technologies are either limited by host CPU overhead or by the complexity
    of offloading, and cannot guarantee high throughput approaching the bandwidth
    rate of the network adapter. Accordingly, this document proposes new requirements
    for the design of HP-WAN transport protocol.</p>"
