abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP servers usually save session states in their persistent storage
    indexed by session cookies generated by the HTTP servers. It is up to the HTTP
    user-agent to send this session cookie on each HTTP request. Some HTTP servers
    check whether the cookie is associated with the HTTP user-agent by the means of
    the user-agent IP address... If the Happy Eyeball mechanism is used to select
    between IPv6 and IPv4, it may happen that while using the same HTTP server, some
    HTTP requests are done over IPv6 and the others over IPv4, which leads to two
    different sets of session states in the HTTP server. This has the consequence
    of inconsistencies at the HTTP server. The only purpose of this document is to
    document this issue. A similar problem arises with the use of non RFC 6888 compliant
    Large Scale NAT (LSN) devices used to access an IPv4-only HTTP server.</p>"
