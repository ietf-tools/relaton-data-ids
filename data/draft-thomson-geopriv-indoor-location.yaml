abstract:
- content: <p>A method is described for constructing a Presence Information Data Format
    - Location Object (PIDF-LO) document that contains location information using
    a locally-defined coordinate reference system (CRS). This form of representation
    allows for use of locally-defined coordinates with potential advantages for improved
    accuracy and usability in local context, in particular location applications that
    operate indoors. A framework for defining a local CRS is provided. A process for
    transformation of coordinates defined in the local CRS and the widely used World
    Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) CRS is defined. Status of This Memo This Internet-Draft
    is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP
