abstract:
- content: "<p>Email has come to be the single most important application of modern
    Information Technology. It is often considered business critical. Most current
    email systems have means for automated replies to incoming messages. These are
    mostly used for so-called out-of-office replies or OoO-replies for short. This
    document discusses problems of out-of-office replies and suggests best practices
    and controls that should be put in place.</p>"
