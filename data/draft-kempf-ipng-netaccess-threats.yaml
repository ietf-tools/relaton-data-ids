abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP Working Group has been conducting a threat analysis for
    the purpose of securing specific Mobile IPv6 mechanisms. In the process of conducting
    the analysis, threats were identified that are not specific to Mobile IP but that
    are amplified by the nature of mobility. These threats are likely to be more or
    less of an issue within any Public Multi-Access network, regardless of whether
    mobility is involved. This document discusses threats associated with Public Multi-Access
    links in IPv6. The document covers non- Mobile IP specific threats uncovered by
    the Mobile IPv6 study, threats raised in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration RFCs that have yet to be adequately addressed, and new
    threats that have not previously been identified.</p>"
