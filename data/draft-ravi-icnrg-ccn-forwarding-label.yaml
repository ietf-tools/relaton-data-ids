abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to enable application identifier
    (AI) and network identifier (NI) split in the CCN protocol that has several applications
    such as towards Interest routing optimization, mobility, conversational session
    support, handling indirections in manifests, and routing scalability. We enable
    this through the notion of forwarding label object (FLO), which is an optional
    hop-by- hop payload in the Interest message with a topological name which identifies
    a network domain, router or a host. FLO can be inserted by the end user applications
    or by the network. FLO is processed by the network resulting in either terminating
    it or swapping it with a new FLO based on the network service context. Furthermore,
    depending on the application and trust context, a FLO can be subjected to policy
    based actions by the forwarders such as invoking security verification or enabling
    other FLO management actions.</p>"
