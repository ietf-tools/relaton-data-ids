abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new data types as additions to both version 1[1]
    and version 2[2] of SNMP's structure of management information(SMI). This document
    also defines the transport mapping so these new data types can be used in all
    versions the Simple Management Protocol (SNMP) without modification. That is,
    using the new data types does not break on-the-wire compatibility with existing
    SNMPv1[3], SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3 implementations.</p>"
