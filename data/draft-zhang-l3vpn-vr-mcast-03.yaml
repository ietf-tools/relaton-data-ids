abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the procedures required to be implemented for
    IP multicast traffic to travel from one VPN site to another within a VR-VPN (Virtual
    Router-based IP VPN).It details the solution about the process in local customer
    sites, establishing of multicast distribution trees in SP networks and forwarding
    of multicast data packets. This document is based on Requirements for Multicast
    in L3 Provider- Provisioned VPNs [MREQT] and specification of Network based IP
    VPN Architecture using Virtual Routers [VR-VPN] that have been implemented and
    deployed.</p>"
