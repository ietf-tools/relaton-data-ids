abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call routing,
    rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is currently no standard mechanism
    by which a proxy can define or influence policies on sessions such as the codecs
    or media types to be used. This document specifies a framework for SIP session
    policies that provides this capability to proxies. It defines a model, an overall
    architecture and the protocol components for session policies.</p>"
