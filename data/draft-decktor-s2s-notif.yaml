abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests a set of requirements for the implementation of
    a protocol in which a messaging system (e.g. email server, voice mail system,
    etc.) submit alerts, which describe potential notification events, regarding an
    end user mailbox status change (e.g. new message has arrived, mailbox is full,
    etc.). These alerts are sent to a notification service, which may, in turn, generate
    an end user alert notification.</p>"
