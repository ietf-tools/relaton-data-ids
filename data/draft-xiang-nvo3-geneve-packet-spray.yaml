abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion is the killer of low latency and high throughput.Network
    congestion occurs on the interconnection links of a data center due to poor traffic
    distribution. Load balancing technologies are used to solve network congestion.
    Packet spraying is a kind of load balancing technology with finer granularity.

    network[1] using a newly defined Geneve Option field.</p>"
