abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are being widely deployed, particularly
    via validating resolvers. However, domain signing tools and processes are not
    yet as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration
    tools and processes. As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur. When
    these failures do occur, end users should not change to a non-validating DNS resolver.</p>"
