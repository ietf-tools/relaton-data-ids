abstract:
- content: "<p>An IETF Network Slice service provides connectivity coupled with a
    set of network resource commitments and is expressed in terms of one or more connectivity
    constructs. A Slice-Flow Aggregate refers to the set of traffic streams from one
    or more connectivity constructs belonging to one or more IETF Network Slices that
    are mapped to a set of network resources and provided the same forwarding treatment.
    The packets associated with a Slice-Flow Aggregate may carry a marking in the
    packet's network layer header to identify this association and this marking is
    referred to as Flow-Aggregate Selector (FAS). The FAS is used to map the packet
    to the associated set of network resources and provide the corresponding forwarding
    treatment to the packet. MPLS Network Actions (MNA) technologies are used to indicate
    actions for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and/or MPLS packets and to transfer data
    needed for these actions. This document discusses options for using MPLS Network
    Actions (MNAs) to carry the FAS in MPLS packets.</p>"
