abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the metadata transfer envelope for Internet Media
    Guides (IMGs). IMG metadata describes files, resources and multimedia programs
    available for streaming or downloading via multicast or unicast. IMG metadata
    is encapsulated into, or associated with, an IMG envelope before actual transport.
    The IMG envelope is a structure providing independence between IMG transport protocols
    and different metadata formats. This specification provides the IMG envelope instantiation
    using structured Extensible Markup Language (XML) syntax, both as a wrapper in
    which to embed an IMG metadata object and as a distinct object to associate with
    a distinct IMG metadata object.</p>"
