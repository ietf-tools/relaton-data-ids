abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-home Multi-prefix (MHMP) IPv6 environment is the norm for businesses
    that need to have uplink resiliency. Several solutions have been already discussed
    and proposed to address MHMP and how it can be enabled in different network contexts.
    This draft looks at MHMP from the perspective of Neighbour Discovery Protocols
    (NDP). For any considered destination, the MHMP challenge may be split into 3
    sub-challenges (important to solve in the below order): 1) the host should choose
    the proper source address for the packet, 2) the host should choose the best default
    router as the next-hop, 3) site topology may be complicated and may need the source
    routing through the site. This draft is concerned with the solution for the first
    two problems that need improvement for the ND (RFC 4861) SLAAC (RFC 4862) and
    Default Address Selection (RFC 6724). The last problem is considered as properly
    discussed by Multihoming in Enterprise (RFC 8678).</p>"
