- content: "<p>The Open Caching working group of the Streaming Video Alliance is focused
    on the delegation of video delivery request from commercial CDNs to a caching
    layer at the ISP. In that aspect, Open Caching is a specific use case of CDNI,
    where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer
    is the downstream CDN (dCDN).</p>"
