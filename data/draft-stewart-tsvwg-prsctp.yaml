abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) RFC2960 [4] that allows an SCTP endpoint to signal to its peer
    that it should move the cumulative ack point forward. When both sides of an SCTP
    association support this extension, it can be used by an SCTP implementation to
    provide partially reliable data transmission service to an upper layer protocol.
    This memo describes (1) the protocol extensions, which consist of a new parameter
    for INIT and INIT ACK, and a new FORWARD TSN chunk type (2) one example partially
    reliable service that can be provided to the upper layer via this mechanism.</p>"
