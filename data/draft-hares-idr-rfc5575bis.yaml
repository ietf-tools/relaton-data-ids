abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC5575 which defines a Border Gateway Protocol
    Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be
    used to distribute traffic flow specifications. This allows the routing system
    to propagate information regarding more specific components of the traffic aggregate
    defined by an IP destination prefix (IPv4, IPv6), MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses,
    and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses. The information is carried via the BGP,
    thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience, and administrative
    processes such as inter-provider peering agreements. There are three applications
    of that encoding format: 1) automation of inter-domain coordination of traffic
    filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service
    attacks; 2) enable traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service,
    and 3) aid centralized control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context. Some of deployments
    of these three applications can be handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI
    traffic flow filters, and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community
    Flow Specification actions. Other deployments (especially SDN/NFV) need to be
    able to allow the user to order the flow specification. Another BGP Flow Specification
    (version 2) is being defined for user- ordered filters, and user-ordered actions
    encoded in Wide Communities. This document provides the definition of a BGP NLRI
    which carries traffic flow specification filters, and Extended Community values
    which encode the actions a routing system can take if a packet matches the traffic
    flow filters. The specification requires that the BGP Flow Specification traffic
    filters follows a string ordering, and that the BGP Flow Specification Extended
    Communities actions are processed in a defined order. This BGP Flow Specification
    is denoted as BGP Flow Specification version 1. There are three applications of
    that encoding format: 1) automation of inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering,
    such as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service
    attacks; 2) enable traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service,
    and 3) aid centralized control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context. Some of deployments
    of these three applications can be handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI
    traffic flow filters, and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community
    Flow Specification actions. Other deployments (especially SDN/NFV) need to be
    able to allow the user to order the flow specification. Another BGP Flow Specification
    (version 2) is being defined for user- ordered filters, and user-ordered actions
    encoded in Wide Communities.</p>"
