    enables policy based configuration and administration of IPSec based Virtual private
    networks within and among Internet domains, intranets, and extranets. The schema
    extends the base IPSec Policy data model in [9] to include end hosts and security
    gateways. The schema closely follows and expands on the DEN specification [7].</p>"
