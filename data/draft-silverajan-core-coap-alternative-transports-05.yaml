abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP has been standardised as an application level REST-based protocol.
    A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and transmitted using UDP or DTLS
    as transports. These transports are optimal solutions for CoAP use in IP-based
    constrained environments and nodes. However compelling motivation exists for understanding
    how CoAP can operate with other transports, such as the need for M2M communication
    using non-IP networks, improved transport level end-to- end reliability and security,
    NAT and firewall traversal issues, and mechanisms possibly incurring a lower overhead
    to CoAP/HTTP translation gateways. This draft examines the requirements for conveying
    CoAP messages to end points over such alternative transports. It also provides
    a new URI format for representing CoAP resources over alternative transports.</p>"
