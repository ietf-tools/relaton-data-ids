abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an address allocation policy in which the address
    of the Rendezvous Point (RP) is encoded in an IPv6 multicast group address. For
    Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), this can be seen as a specification
    of a group-to-RP mapping mechanism. This allows an easy deployment of scalable
    inter-domain multicast and simplifies the intra-domain multicast configuration
    as well. This memo updates the addressing format presented in RFC 3306. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
