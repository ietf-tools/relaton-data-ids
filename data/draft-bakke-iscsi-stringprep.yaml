abstract:
- content: "<p>The iSCSI protocol provides a way for hosts to access SCSI devices
    over an IP network. The iSCSI end-points, called initiators and targets, each
    have a globally-unique name that must be transcribable, as well as easily compared.
    This document describes how to prepare internationlized iSCSI names to increase
    the likelihood that name input and comparison work in ways that make sense for
    typical users throughout the world.</p>"
