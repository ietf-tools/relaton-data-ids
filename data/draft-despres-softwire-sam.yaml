abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism to statelessly
    establish tunnels, point-to-multipoint, for packets of an address family that
    traverse domains whose routing is in another address family (mesh softwires).
    It extends tunneling principles of [6rd] to other address-family combination than
    IPv6 across IPv4 domains. It thus introduces, for a variety of use cases, a simpler
    mesh-softwire model than that of [RFC5565]. Among SAM use cases, some are solutions
    to previously unsolved problems: native IPv6 across IPv4 NATs, with optimized
    paths; multihoming with independent CPEs and provider-aggregatable prefixes; public
    IPv4 addresses across IPv6-only domains with optimized paths; static sharing of
    IPv4 addresses, without impact on routing information bases.</p>"
