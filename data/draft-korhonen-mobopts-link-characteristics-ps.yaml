abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem space related to frequent changes
    in the local link or sub-path characteristics of a mobile node due to various
    reasons such as vertical handovers and the delivery of the sub-path characteristic
    information from a mobile node to its peer nodes. The purpose of this document
    is to define the scope and requirements for possible future work on a generic
    sub-path characteristic information delivery mechanism for optimizing IP mobility
    performance and reducing the implications that significant changes in the local
    link or sub-path characteristics tend to create to the transport and application
    protocol behaviour by altering the end-to-end path properties.</p>"
