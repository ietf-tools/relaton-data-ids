abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles for RObust
    Header Compression (ROHC). Various concepts are introduced within the standard,
    which might be difficult to understand, and especially how these relate to the
    surrounding environments where header compression may be used. This document aims
    at clarifying the architectural aspects of ROHC, discussing terms such as ROHC
    instances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback, ROHC contexts, and how these terms relate
    to other terms like network elements and IP interfaces, commonly used when for
    example addressing MIB issues.</p>"
