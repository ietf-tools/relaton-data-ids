abstract:
- content: "<p>Native Short Address (NSA [I-D.li-6lo-native-short-address]), proposes
    to algorithmically assign short addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment so to
    achieve stateless forwarding, hence, avoiding using a routing protocol. NSA is
    more suitable in case of stable and static wireline connectivity, in order to
    avoid renumbering due to topology changes. Even in such kind of scenarios, reliability
    remains an issue. This memo tackles specifically reliability in NSA deployments,
    analyzing possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.</p>"
