abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new Diameter Application to support the Mobile
    IPv6's bootstrapping mechanism during the AAA authentication and authorization
    phase based on PANA. PANA is used as a protocol for network authentication between
    mobile nodes and access networks. During the PANA authentication phase, the mobile
    node's initial configuration information like its home address, home agent address
    and IKEv2/IKEv1 pre-shared keying material is piggybacked to the PANA messages
    cryptographically protected by the PANA SA. The Diameter and PANA message formats
    to support the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in the integrated bootstrapping scenario
    are defined.</p>"
