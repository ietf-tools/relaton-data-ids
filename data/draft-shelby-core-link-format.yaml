    servers to describe URIs of resources offered along with other attributes. Based
    on the HTTP Link Header format, the CoRE link format is carried as a payload and
    is assigned an Internet media type. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry-point
    for requesting the list of links to resources hosted by a server.</p>"
