abstract:
- content: "<p>An EVPN Inter-Domain interconnect solution is required if two or more
    sites of the same Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) are attached to different
    IGP domains or Autonomous Systems (AS), and they need to communicate. The Inter-Domain
    Option-B connectivity model is one of the most popular solutions for such EVPN
    connectivity. While multiple documents refer to this type of interconnect solution
    and specify different aspects of it, there is no document that summarizes the
    impact of the Inter-Domain Option-B connectivity in the EVPN procedures. This
    document does not specify new procedures but analyses the EVPN procedures in an
    Inter-Domain Option-B network and suggests potential solutions for the described
    issues. Those solutions are based on either other specifications or based on local
    implementations that do not modify the end-to-end EVPN control plane.</p>"
