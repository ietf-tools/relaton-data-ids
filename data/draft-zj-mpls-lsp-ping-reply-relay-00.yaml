abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC4379] describes the LSP Ping mechanism to detect data plane failures.
    In some deployment scenario for the LSP traceroute, a replying LSR may not have
    the available route to the initiator, and the echo reply message sent to the initiator
    would be discarded. Thus, the basic idea of traceroute procedure to localize fault
    could not be achieved. This document describes extensions to LSP Ping mechanism
    to enable the replying LSR to have the capability to relay the echo reply by a
    set of routable intermediate nodes to the initiator.</p>"
