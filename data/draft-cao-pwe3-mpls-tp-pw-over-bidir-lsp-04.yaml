abstract:
- content: "<p>A bidirectional Pseudowire (PW) service currently uses two unidirectional
    PWs each carried over a unidirectional LSP. Each end point of a PW or segment
    of multi-segment PW (MS-PW) independently selects the LSP to use to carry the
    PW for which it is the head end. Some transport services may require that bidirectional
    PW traffic follows the same paths through the network in both directions. Therefore,
    PWs may be required to use LSP with the same paths. Co- routed bidirectional LSPs
    or unidirectional LSPs with the same route (links and nodes) allow this service
    to be provided. This document specifies an optional extension to LDP that allows
    both ends of a PW (or segment of a MS-PW) to select and bind to the same co-routed
    bidirectional LSP or two unidirectional LSPs with the same route.</p>"
