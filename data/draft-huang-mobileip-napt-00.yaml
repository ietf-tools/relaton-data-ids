abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number of mobile terminals increases, Mobile IP[1] potentially
    could make users roam around the world while also keep their connection to the
    Internet uninterruptedly. In the mean time, many organizations are using NAPT[2]
    (Network Address Port Translator) to isolate private network from public realms.
    The integration of NAPT with Mobile IP, however, introduces technical issues that
    must be resolved before they can function together. Although techniques such as
    UDP tunneling[3] and reverse tunneling[4] can be utilized to solve part of the
    problem, there are still some scenarios which need more discussion. This document
    reviews these mechanisms and presents a guideline for the integration of Mobile
    IP and NAPT in various scenarios.</p>"
