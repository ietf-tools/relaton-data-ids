abstract:
- content: '<p>Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections. For example,
    P2P applications maintain connections to a number of different peers while web
    browsers perform concurrent download from the same web server. Application designers
    pursue different goals when doing so: P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected
    mesh in the swarm while web browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize
    requests that involve application latency on the web server side. But this practice
    also has impacts to the host and the network as a whole. For example, an application
    can obtain a larger fraction of the bottleneck than if it had used fewer connections.
    Although capacity is the most commonly considered bottleneck resource, middlebox
    state table entries are also an important resource for an end system communication.
    This documents clarifies the current practices of application design and reasons
    behind them, and discusses the tradeoffs surrounding the use of many concurrent
    TCP connections to one destination and/or to different destinations. Other resource
    types may exist, and the guidelines are expected to comprehensively discuss them.
