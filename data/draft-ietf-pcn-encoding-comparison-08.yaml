abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the
    quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. On every
    link in the PCN domain, the overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets
    are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded. Egress nodes
    provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets which
    allows them to take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request,
    and to terminate some already admitted flows during serious pre- congestion. The
    PCN Working Group explored a number of approaches for encoding this pre-congestion
    information into the IP header. This document provides details of all those approaches
    along with an explanation of the constraints that had to be met by any solution.</p>"
