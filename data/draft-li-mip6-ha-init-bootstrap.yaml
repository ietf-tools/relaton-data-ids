- content: "<p>This document defined a Home Agent initiated Bootstrap solution as
    a complementarity to current Bootstrap solutions. In home agent reliability problem,
    current bootstrap solution is not appropriate because sometimes mobile node would
    be infeasible to initiate the bootstrap procedure. However, a Home Agent initiated
    bootstrap solution would be suitable in this case.</p>"
