abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile networks using LTE, 4G technologies are complex. Managing mobility
    and content delivery using IP transport is challenging and not optimized for content
    delivery. IP unicast routing from server to clients is used for delivery of multimedia
    content to User Equipment (UE), where each user gets separate stream. From bandwidth
    and routing perspective this approach is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast
    technologies have emerged recently for mobile networks, but their deployments
    are very limited or at an experimental stage due to complex architecture and radio
    spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly emerging technology with built in features for
    efficient multimedia content delivery, however majority of the work is focused
    either on fixed networks or unlicensed WiFi-based wireless networks. The main
    focus of this document is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks
    by embedding ICN into 3GPP protocol stack at IP datagram or replacing IP for non-IP
    datagrams. ICN has an inherent capability for anchorless mobility, security and
    it is optimized for content delivery using local caching at the edge. We believe
    that ICN native or dual stack (with IP) deployment will bring all inherent benefits
    and help in optimizing mobile networks.</p>"
