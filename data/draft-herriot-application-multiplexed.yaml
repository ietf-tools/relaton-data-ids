abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed content-type, like the Multipart/Related
    content-type, provides a mechanism for representing objects that consist of multiple
    components. An Application/Vnd.pwg- multiplexed entity contains a sequence of
    chunks. Each chunk contains a MIME message or a part of a MIME message. Each MIME
    message represents a component of the compound object, just as a body part of
    a Multipart/Related entity represents a component. With a Multipart/Related entity,
    a body part and its reference in some other body part may be separated by many
    octets. With an Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed entity, a message and its reference
    in some other message can be made quite close by chunking the message containing
    the reference. For example, if a long message contains references to images and
    the producer does not know of the need for each image until it generates the reference,
    then Application/Vnd.pwg-multiplexed allows the consumer to process the reference
    to the image and the image before it consumes the entire long message. This ability
    is important in printing and scanning applications. This document defines the
    Application/Vnd.pwg- multiplexed content-type. It also provides examples of its
    use.</p>"
