abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a procedure that can be used to renumber a network
    from one prefix to another. It uses IPv6's intrinsic ability to assign multiple
    addresses to a network interface to provide continuity of network service through
    a "make-before-break" transition, as well as addresses naming and configuration
    management issues. It also uses other IPv6 features to minimize the effort and
    time required to complete the transition from the old prefix to the new prefix.
