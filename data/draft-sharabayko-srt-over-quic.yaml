abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an approach to tunnelling SRT live streams over
    QUIC datagrams. QUIC [RFC9000] is a UDP-based transport protocol providing TLS
    encryption, stream multiplexing, and connection migration. It was designed to
    become a faster alternative to the TCP protocol [RFC7323]. An Unreliable Datagram
    Extension to QUIC [QUIC-DATAGRAM] adds support for sending and receiving unreliable
    datagrams over a QUIC connection, but transfers the responsibility for multiplexing
    different kinds of datagrams, or flows of datagrams, to an application protocol.
    SRT [SRTRFC] is a UDP-based transport protocol. Essentially, it can operate over
    any unreliable datagram transport. SRT provides loss recovery and stream multiplexing
    mechanisms. In its live streaming configuration SRT provides an end-to-end latency-aware
    mechanism for packet loss recovery. If SRT fails to recover a packet loss within
    a specified latency, then the packet is dropped to avoid blocking playback of
    further packets. The Datagram Extension to QUIC could be used as an underlying
    transport instead of UDP. This way QUIC would provide TLS-level security, connection
    migration, and potentially multi-path support. It would be easier for existing
    network facilities to process, route, and load balance the unified QUIC traffic.
    SRT on its side would provide end-to-end latency tracking and latency-aware loss
    recovery.</p>"
