abstract:
- content: "<p>Several useful applications of MPLS tunnels based on LSPs with second
    level labels between non adjacent LSRs have been identified: IP-VPNs and VoIP
    over MPLS are just two examples. This tunnelling technique can easily be extended
    to non-MPLS core networks. This Internet-Draft explains the motivation for encapsulating
    MPLS messages in IP and provides the protocol specification of the encapsulation.</p>"
