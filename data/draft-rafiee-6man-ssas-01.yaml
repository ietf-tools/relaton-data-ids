abstract:
- content: "<p>The default method for IPv6 address generation uses a organitionally
    unique identifier assigned by the IEEE Standards Association and the extension
    identifier by the hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291].
    This means that a node will always have the same Interface ID (IID) whenever it
    connects to a new network. Because the node's IP address does not change, the
    node is vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address this issue, there are
    currently two mechanisms in use to randomize the IID, Cryptographically Generated
    Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the
    former approach is the computational cost involved for the IID generation and
    verification. The problem with the latter approach is that it lacks security and
    offers only partial protection to the node against privacy related attacks. This
    document offers a new algorithm for use in the generation of the IID while, at
    the same time, securing the node against some types of attack, like IP spoofing.
    These attacks are prevented by the addition of a signature to the messages sent
    over the network and by directly using a public key in the IP address.</p>"
