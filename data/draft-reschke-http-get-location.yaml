abstract:
- content: "<p>Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methods other
    than GET to expose information. This has the drawback that this kind of information
    is harder to identify (missing a URL to which a GET request could be applied)
    and to cache. This document specifies a simple extension header through which
    a server can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP client subsequently can use
    with the GET method.</p>"
