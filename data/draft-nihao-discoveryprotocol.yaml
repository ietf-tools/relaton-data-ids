abstract:
- content: "<p>The Nihao Protocol is an open source protocol that uses the Extensible
    Markup Language (XML), and simple UDP datagram exchange. It's designed for quick
    (and unencrypted by default) discovery and communication with other devices on
    a local network. This document will show you how the Nihao protocol works internally,
    allowing you to write wrapper libraries on the protocol and implement it in your
    own applications.</p>"
