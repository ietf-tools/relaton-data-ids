abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETCONF protocol defines a subtree filtering mechanism to allow
    an client to select particular XML subtrees to be included in the &lt;rpc-reply&gt;
    for a &lt;get&gt; or &lt;get-config&gt; operation. In some aspects, subtree filtering
    has some disadvantages. This document defines an extended subtree filtering to
    solve these disadvantages.</p>"
