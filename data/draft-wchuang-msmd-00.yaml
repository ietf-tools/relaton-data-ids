abstract:
- content: <p>Opportunistic SMTP TLS does not enforce electronic mail delivery using
    TLS leading to potential loss of privacy and security. We propose an optional
    mail header extension "mandatory-secure-mail- delivery:" and SMTP EHLO response
    extension "MSMD" that indicates mail must be delivered privately using TLS and
    with integrity using DKIM, and thereby provide a security guarantee to the user.
    When mail is sent with the header indicating privacy and integrity and if the
    receiving party does not support this, the mail is instead bounced. To protect
    the mail after delivery, the destination SMTP server must advertise its capabilities
    as part of the EHLO response, and the sender can choose whether the destination
    is able to honor the privacy requirements specified on the mail header.</p>
