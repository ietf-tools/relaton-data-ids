abstract:
- content: <p>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain
    SIP federation. ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks, and SIP, and in doing
    so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP spam problems that have been a
    barrier to federation. The ViPR architecture uses a server, the ViPR server, which
    performs P2P and validation services on behalf of call agents, which acts as clients
    to the server. Such an architecture requires a client/server protocol between
    call agents and the ViPR server. That protocol, defined here, is called the ViPR
    Access Protocol (VAP). Legal This documents and the information contained therein
