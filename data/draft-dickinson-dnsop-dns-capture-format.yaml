abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a data representation for collections of DNS
    messages. The format is designed for efficient storage of large packet captures
    of DNS traffic; it attempts to minimize the size of such packet capture files
    but retain the full DNS message contents along with the most useful transport
    meta data. It is intended to assist with the development of DNS traffic monitoring
    applications and provide a more efficient data exchange format than alternatives
    such as PCAP files.</p>"
