abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines how XML Digital Signatures and XML Encryption may
    be used with Multipart MIME security to provide MIME integrity and confidentiality.
    It extends RFC 1847 by defining application/signature+xml and application/encryption+xml
    protocols for the Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted MIME types. Although
    non-XML content may be signed or encrypted based on XML signing and encryption,
    additional capabilities are available for XML MIME content. This draft defines
    a signature transform parameter for partial signing or manipulation of XML MIME
    content as well as processing rules in addition to the XML Digital Signature and
    XML Encryption processing rules.</p>"
