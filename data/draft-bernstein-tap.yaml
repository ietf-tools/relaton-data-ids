abstract:
- content: "<p>It is common for Internet hosts to associate a relatively long-lived
    identifier, commonly a 'username' or 'owner name,' to each TCP connection. TAP
    announces the identifier associated with a particular TCP connection to the host
    on the other end of the connection. TAP may be used on any host which associates
    a relatively long-lived identifier to each connection.</p>"
