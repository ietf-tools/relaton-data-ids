abstract:
- content: "<p>When network congestion occurs or dynamic transient burst stream transfers
    on a bandwidth constrained network, it is easy to cause bursts of consecutive
    packet loss. Video streams are very vulnerable to packet loss because of motion
    compensation predictive coding at the decoder. In this document, we describe a
    method of using selective transmission to decrease the effect of random drop to
    video stream when necessary. At the same time, this document describes a method
    to avoid retransmission request due to selective transmission.</p>"
