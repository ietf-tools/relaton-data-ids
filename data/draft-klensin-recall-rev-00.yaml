abstract:
- content: <p>The procedures for initiating a recall specified in RFC 3777 restrict
    signatories to those who are "nomcom qualified". Perhaps inadvertently, this prohibits
    members of the IESG and IAB from initiating these procedures. This document suggests
    that limitation was an unanticipated and undesirable side-effect and proposes
    to remove it. This document is intended to update RFC 3777.</p>
