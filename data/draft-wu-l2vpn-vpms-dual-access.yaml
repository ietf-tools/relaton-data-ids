abstract:
- content: <p>Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS) is defined as a Layer 2 VPN
    service. It provides point-to-multipoint connectivity for a variety of Layer 2
    technologies, including Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet, PPP, etc, across an IP or
    MPLS-enabled IP Packet Switch Network (PSN). It is often required for redundant
    access between two VPMS PEs to which a CE is attached, called "dual-homed". This
    document describes how dual-homed access can be achieved in the context of BGP-based
    VPMS.</p>
