abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a problem statement on the use of link events for enhanced
    handover control in network based localized mobility management. Starting from
    existing solutions for fast link detection the document aims at discussing possibilities
    to extend with a 2.5 layer the interface between MN and AR for handover control.
    The document also presents a set of considerations and identifies conditions where
    a layer 2.5 based interface offers significant advantages compared to a pure layer
    three solution. The document addresses separately scenarios for Localized Mobility
    Management and scenarios involving interactions between PMIP and CMIP.</p>"
