abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.11 is an established Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology which
    provides radio connectivity to a wide range of devices. The IEEE 802.11ah amendment
    defines a WLAN system operating at sub 1 GHz license-exempt bands designed to
    operate with low-rate/low-power consumption. This amendment supports large number
    of stations and extends the radio coverage to several hundreds of meters. This
    document describes how IPv6 is transported over 802.11ah using 6LoWPAN techniques.</p>"
