abstract:
- content: "<p>X.509 certificates are widely used for client authentication in many
    protocols, especially in conjunction with Transport Layer Security ([RFC5246])
    and Datagram Transport Layer Security ([RFC6347]. There exist a multitude of forms
    in which certificates and especially their corresponding private keys may be stored
    or referenced. Applications have historically been massively inconsistent in which
    subset of these forms have been supported, and what knowledge is demanded of the
    user. This memo sets out best practice for applications in the interest of usability
    and consistency.</p>"
