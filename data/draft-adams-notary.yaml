abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a general notary service and the protocols
    to be used when communicating with it. The Notary Authority is a Trusted Third
    Party (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable non-repudiation
    services (see [ISONR]). Useful Notary Authority responsibilities in a PKI are
    to validate signatures and to provide up- to-date information regarding the status
    of certificates. We give examples of how to use the notary to extend the lifetime
    of a signature beyond key expiry or revocation and to query the notary regarding
    the status of a certificate.</p>"
