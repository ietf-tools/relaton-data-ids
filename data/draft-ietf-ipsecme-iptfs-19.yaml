abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for aggregation and fragmentation
    of IP packets when they are being encapsulated in ESP payloads. This new payload
    type can be used for various purposes such as decreasing encapsulation overhead
    for small IP packets; however, the focus in this document is to enhance IPsec
    traffic flow security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) to
    encrypted IP encapsulated traffic. TFC is provided by obscuring the size and frequency
    of IP traffic using a fixed-sized, constant-send-rate IPsec tunnel. The solution
    allows for congestion control as well as non- constant send-rate usage.</p>"
