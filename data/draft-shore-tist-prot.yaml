abstract:
- content: "<p>TIST is an application of the RSVP protocol to the problem of com-
    municating application requests, such as pinhole openings and NAT table entries,
    to NATs and firewalls. By using RSVP we avoid the problem of having to locate
    these devices in the network and estab- lish trusted relationships with each one
    we would like to influ- ence.</p>"
