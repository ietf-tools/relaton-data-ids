abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of proposals have been published to address the need of securing
    media traffic. A summary of the proposals available at that time is available
    in the appendix of this document. Different assumptions, requirements, and usage
    environments justify every one of them. This document aims to summarize the discussed
    media security requirements. A comparison of the requirements against the individual
    proposals is provided. This document is discussed on the SIP mailing list, &lt;http://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/sip&gt;.</p>"
