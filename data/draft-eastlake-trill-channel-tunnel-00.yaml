abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    includes an optional mechanism, called RBridge Channel, for the transmission of
    typed messages between TRILL switches in the same campus and between TRILL switches
    and end stations on the same link. This document specifies optional extensions
    to RBridge Channel that provides three facilities: (1) A mechanism to send such
    messages between a TRILL switch and an end station in either direction, or between
    two end stations, when the two devices are in the same campus but not on the same
    link; (2) A method to support security facilities for RBridge Channel messages;
    and (3) A method to tunnel a variety of payload types by encapsulating them in
    an RBridge Channel message.</p>"
