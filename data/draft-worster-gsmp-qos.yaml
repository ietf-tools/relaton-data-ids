abstract:
- content: "<p>The General Switch Management Protocol [1], [2] allows low level control
    of a label switch. A model for the provision of quality of service must be established
    in order that GSMP can control the capabilities of a label switch to provide connections
    with specified quality of service. This memo presents some considerations surrounding
    the provision of QoS in such an open switch control scenario. This discussion
    leads to a proposal for a service oriented QoS model for GSMP. The memo also presents
    proposed extensions to GSMP to allow control of a switch using the Service Model.</p>"
