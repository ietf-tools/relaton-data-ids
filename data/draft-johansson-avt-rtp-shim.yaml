abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a general mechanism to provide with compact and
    efficient inband signaling mechanisms for VoIP applications using the RTP (Real-Time
    Transport Protocol). It provides the option to include a few additional inband
    signaling bytes in between the RTP header and the RTP payload. The intention of
    using Shim is to enable a fast inband signaling channel that can be used for adaptation
    purposes. The intention of the proposed inband signaling is that it should act
    as a wrapper around the actual payload. For instance if the payload is AMR-NB
    (RFC 3267), shim will encapsulate the payload in a fashion similar to RCF2198.
    In order to distinguish this encapsulated payload from a "normal" payload, necessary
    attributes are specified in SDP. The main application is for two party teleconferencing
    but the presented mechanism can be used for multi party teleconferencing applications
    as well. The name Shim is to refer to the "little thing something that one put
    in between". The name Shim is to refer to the "little thing something that one
    put in between".</p>
