abstract:
- content: "<p>The small (16-bit) size of the DNS transaction ID has made it a frequent
    target for forgery, with the unhappy result of many cache pollution vulnerabilities
    demonstrated throughout Internet history. Even with perfectly and unpredictably
    random transaction ID's, random and birthday attacks are still theoretically feasible.
    This document describes a method by which an initiator can improve transaction
    identity using the 0x20 bit in DNS labels.</p>"
