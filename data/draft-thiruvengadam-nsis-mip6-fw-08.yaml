abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the firewalls deployed today are Mobile IPv6 unaware. Widespread
    Mobile IPv6 deployment is not possible unless Mobile IPv6 messages can pass through
    these firewalls. One approach is to use a signaling protocol to communicate with
    these firewalls and instruct them to bypass these Mobile IPv6 messages. The goal
    of this document is to describe the interaction between NSIS and Mobile IPv6 for
    enabling Mobile IPv6 traversal.</p>"
