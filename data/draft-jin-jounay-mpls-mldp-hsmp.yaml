abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP
    LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also leaf
    to root along the co-routed reverse path. That means traffic entering the HSMP
    LSP from application/customer at the root node travels downstream, exactly as
    if it was traveling downstream along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic
    entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the
    root. A packet traveling upstream should be thought of as being unicast to the
    root, except that it follows the path of the tree rather than ordinary unicast
    path.</p>"
