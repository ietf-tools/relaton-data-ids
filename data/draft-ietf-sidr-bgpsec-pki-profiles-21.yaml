abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates used
    to enable validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol known as BGPsec. BGP is the standard
    for inter-domain routing in the Internet; it is the "glue" that holds the Internet
    together. BGPsec is being developed as one component of a solution that addresses
    the requirement to provide security for BGP. The goal of BGPsec is to provide
    full AS path validation based on the use of strong cryptographic primitives. The
    end entity (EE) certificates specified by this profile are issued to routers within
    an AS. Each of these certificates is issued under a Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificate. These CA certificates and EE
    certificates both contain the AS Resource extension. An EE certificate of this
    type asserts that the router or routers holding the corresponding private key
    are authorized to emit secure route advertisements on behalf of the AS(es) specified
    in the certificate. This document also profiles the format of certification requests
    and specifies Relying Party (RP) certificate path validation procedures for these
    EE certificates. This document extends the RPKI; therefore, this document updates
    the RPKI Resource Certificates Profile (RFC 6487).</p>
