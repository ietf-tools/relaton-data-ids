abstract:
- content: "<p>This document motivates a new service that the Internet could provide
    to eventually replace best efforts for all traffic: Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable
    throughput (L4S). It is becoming common for all (or most) applications being run
    by a user at any one time to require low latency, but the only solution the IETF
    can offer for ultra-low queuing latency is Diffserv, which only offers low latency
    for some packets at the expense of others. Diffserv has also proved hard to deploy
    widely end-to-end. In contrast, a zero-config incrementally deployable solution
    has been demonstrated that keeps average queuing delay under a millisecond for
    _all_ applications even under very heavy load; and it keeps congestion loss to
    zero. At the same time it solves the long-running problem with the scalability
    of TCP throughput. Even with a high capacity broadband access, the resulting performance
    under load is remarkably and consistently improved for applications such as interactive
    video, conversational video, voice, Web, gaming, instant messaging, remote desktop
    and cloud-based apps. This document explains the underlying problems that have
    been preventing the Internet from enjoying such performance improvements. It then
    outlines the parts necessary for a solution and the steps that will be needed
    to standardize them.</p>"
