abstract:
- content: "<p>The application specific routing requirements for Urban Low Power and
    Lossy Networks (U-L2Ns) are presented in this document. In the near future, sensing
    and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban environments so as to improve
    the citizens' living conditions as well as to monitor compliance with increasingly
    strict environmental laws. These field nodes are expected to measure and report
    a wide gamut of data, such as required in smart metering, waste disposal, meteorological,
    pollution and allergy reporting applications. The majority of these nodes is expected
    to communicate wirelessly which - given the limited radio range - requires the
    use of suitable multi-hop routing protocols. The design of such protocols will
    be mainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory, processing power,
    battery, etc) and the particularities of the outdoors urban application scenario.
    As such, for a wireless roll solution to be competitive with other incumbent and
    emerging solutions, the protocol ought to be energy-efficient, scalable and autonomous.
    This documents aims to specify a set of requirements reflecting these and further
    U-L2Ns tailored characteristics.</p>"
