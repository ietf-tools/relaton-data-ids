abstract:
- content: "<p>The transition from circuit based voice telephony network to pure packet
    based voice telephony network requires huge investment. It also requires setting
    of a parallel packet voice telephony network components with definition of packet
    network signalling protocols and packet network bearer transport protocols and
    in addition, support for intelligent services on packet network. This paper defines
    a Packet-SS7 network. This paper tries to explore the idea of modifying existing
    SS7 network protocol and network architecture to support packet voice services
    on it. It can also provide an easy transition path from circuit voice network
    to pure packet voice network.</p>"
