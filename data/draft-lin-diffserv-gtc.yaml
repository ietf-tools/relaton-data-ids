abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Generic Traffic Conditioner (GTC) for Diffserv-capable
    nodes [RFC2475, RFC2474]. The GTC employs a token bucket to meter the traffic
    stream, and a shaping buffer to store out-of-profile packets of a behavior aggregate
    in order to enforce conformance to the traffic profile. The GTC employs a policer
    to decide whether to shape, drop, or re-mark the out-of-profile packets. The GTC
    marks each outgoing packet with a Diffserv codepoint (DSCP) according to the traffic
    conditioning result in accordance with the Traffic Conditioning Specification.
    By enabling the components and configuring them with associated traffic parameters,
    the GTC can be used to condition the traffics for EF PHB [Jacobson], AF PHBs [Heinanen],
    as well as Class Selector PHBs [RFC 2474].</p>"
