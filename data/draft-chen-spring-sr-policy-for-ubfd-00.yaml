abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to leverage Segment Routing (SR) Policy
    to make sure that the Unaffiliated BFD (U-BFD) Echo packets must be transmitted
    to the remote system before being looped back to the local system. This enables
    that U-BFD works not only for one hop scenario but for multiple hops scenario
    as well. In addition, this document also defines a way to explicitly specify the
    loop back path of the Echo packets. This is useful in the case where the forward
    and reverse path of the Echo packets are required to follow the same path.</p>"
