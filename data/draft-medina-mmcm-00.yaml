abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mark and drop mechanism called Multimedia Color
    Marker or mmCM. This mechanism, based on the Three Color Marker [trTCM], can be
    used as a component of a Diffserv traffic conditioner for CBR Audio/Video flows.
    In addition to the functions performed by a color aware trTCM, the mmCM performs
    rate control and reactive discard. Rate control protects TCP flows from unresponsive
    UDP streams. Rate control is performed by introducing a third Token Bucket to
    the trTCM model with a small bucket size. Reactive discard is used to increase
    the probability of delivery for low precedence packets. Reactive discard is performed
    by demoting or dropping yellow and red packets in reaction to a green packet demotion
    at the marker. Hierarchically coded Audio/Video flows can benefit of this functionality
    if the coder pre-marks the stream to reflect the relative value of the information
    transported in each IP packet. It is assumed that the mmCM is used in conjunction
    with AF-based services.</p>"
