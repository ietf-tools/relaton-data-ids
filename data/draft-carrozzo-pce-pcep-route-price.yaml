abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE defined in RFC4655 is a functional entity generally confined
    in the control plane to elaborate explicit optimal routes with related costs to
    be installed as [G]MPLS tunnels/LSPs. The resulting route cost(s)/metric(s) are
    Traffic Engineering indicators used by the network administrator (carrier) to
    optimize the usage of its network resources. In this document a framework for
    the usage of PCE in cooperation with the Network Service and Business Plane (NSBP)
    is proposed, along with related PCEP extensions. The NSBP invokes this extended
    PCE (service PCE) to trigger the computation of network service offers with related
    price information. The price of a network connectivity service generally depends
    on strategic factors, but it could also be influenced by the amount of mobilized
    network resources (along the route), the ingress/egress interfaces/PoPs, etc.
    Therefore, it could be provided by an extended service-PCE as an additional route
    information. This document focuses on the extensions to the PCEP protocol in support
    of the computation of route prices for intra- and inter- domain network connectivity
    services. Mechanisms for elaborating and retrieving price information in the PCE
    are vendor-specific and out of the scope of this document.</p>"
