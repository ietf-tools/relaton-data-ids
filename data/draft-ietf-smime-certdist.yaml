abstract:
- content: "<p>Current methods of publishing certificates in directory services are
    restricted to just certificates. This document provides a method of publishing
    certificates with secondary support information such as the SMimeCapabilities
    attribute (containing bulk algorithm support) in a way that is both authenticated
    and bound to a given certificate. This draft is being discussed on the 'ietf-smime'
    mailing list. To join the list, send a message to &lt;ietf-smime-request@imc.org&gt;
    with the single word 'subscribe' in the body of the message. Also, there is a
