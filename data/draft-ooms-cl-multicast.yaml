abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new mechanism for multipoint-to-multipoint (mp2mp)
    communication in IP networks, namely Connectionless Multicast (CLM). Instead of
    a group address, a list of member addresses is encoded in the data packets. The
    traditional Host Group Model [DEER] for IP multicast requires a globally unique
    address for each session. To support this model, multicast routing protocols create
    state per group in the routers. Like any connection oriented protocol, it suffers
    from scalability problems in backbone networks where the number of groups to be
    maintained can be huge. CLM does not have this problem, and additionally has some
    other advantages. Its limitation lies in the number of members per multicast session,
    not in the number of sessions. CLM will not replace the traditional multicast
    model. CLM offers an alternative for mp2mp communication in the cases that traditional
    multicast becomes problematic. The pros and cons of CLM are described and suggestions
    are made to alleviate the disadvantages. Furthermore different modes of operation
    are described: an end-to-end mode in close conjunction with SIP (Session Initiation
    Protocol [HAND]), as well as an interworking mode with PIM-SM and Simple Multicast.
    Both IPv4 and IPv6 are considered.</p>"
