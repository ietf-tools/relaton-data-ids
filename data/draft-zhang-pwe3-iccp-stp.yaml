abstract:
- content: "<p>Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) supports the inter- chassis
    redundancy mechanism which achieves high network availability. In this document,
    the PEs in a Redundant Group (RG) running ICCP are used to offer multi-homed connectivity
    to Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) networks. The ICCP TLVs for the STP application
    are defined, therefore PEs from the RG can make use of these TLVs to synchronize
    the state and configuration data of the STP network.</p>"
