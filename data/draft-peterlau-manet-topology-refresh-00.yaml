abstract:
- content: <p>The topology refresh protocol is intended for use in mobile social networks
    where user nodes announce their presence when they move into contact with the
    network, see all existing users, know when old users have left the network and
    new ones join the network, and communicate with each other over optimal paths
    established on the fly. TRP is a very lightweight protocol but does require user
    nodes periodically broadcast their ids along with some personal information to
    the network. These broadcasts serve the dual purpose of announcing users' presence
    in the social network and establishing a complete topology of end-to-end optimal
    paths. Individual user controls her "radius of users" based on the number of hops
    and physical distance between her and the others. User nodes independently choose
    their ids and dynamically resolve any duplicated ones.</p>
