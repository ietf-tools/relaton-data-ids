abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies some new PDU operations intended to optimize SNMP
    requests for performance. This draft is not a complete specification, but merely
    is intended to illustrate concepts which can then be discussed within the EoS
    working group. A complete specification will be completed after the agreed features
    and packet structure is fairly well solidified so the author doesn't have to rewrite
    large portions of stuff ;-). There are no error handling codes or elements of
    procedures defined yet. The concepts, however, have been thought out about a lot.
    Feedback on what you see within would be greatly appreciated at this point.</p>"
