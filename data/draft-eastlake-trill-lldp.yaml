abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges are devices that implement the IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots of Links, RFC 6325) protocol. The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP,
    IEEE Std 802.1AB) is a one-way, unacknowledged protocol for the announcement of
    a station's capabilities to its peers. The set of peers that receive these frames
    and the scoping of the frame is primarily determined by the destination MAC address
    of the LLDP frame. This document specifies a Nearest-RBridge MAC address and other
    details of TRILL support of LLDP. It updates RFC 6325.</p>"
