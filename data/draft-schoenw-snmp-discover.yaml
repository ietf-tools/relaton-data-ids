abstract:
- content: "<p>The third version of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
    assumes that a manager knows the identifier of a remote SNMP protocol engine (the
    so called snmpEngineID) in order to retrieve or manipulate objects maintained
    locally on the remote engine. This document introduces a well-known localEngineID
    and a discovery mechanism which can be used to learn the engine identifier of
    a remote SNMP protocol engine. The proposed mechanism is independent of the features
    provided by SNMP security models and may also be used by other protocol interfaces
    providing access to managed objects.</p>"
