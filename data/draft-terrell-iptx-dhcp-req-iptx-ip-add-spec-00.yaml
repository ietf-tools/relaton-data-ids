abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the changes when the IP Bit Mapped Header Size
    Specification Equals 64 Bits, as would be required for the Implementation Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support hosts defined by the IPtX IP Addressing
    Protocol Family Specification. Furthermore, while the underlining implications
    regarding any Change in the Header Size Specification maintains the possibility
    of having a Profound Cascading Affect upon other Protocols. Noting specifically,
    the affects upon the 'TCP' and 'UDP' Headers, and the corresponding affects upon
    the Growth in the Number of Available 'PORTS'. Nevertheless, while there is a
    noticeable growth occurring in each of these areas, they remain manageable, because
    the difference between the IPv4 and the IPtX Specification is minimal. In which
    case, it should be clearly understood, the Operations presently defined for the
    IPv4 IP Addressing System would be the same under the IPt1 Specification. And
    this is valid because the differences between their IP Addressing Schematic Design
    does not mandate a requirement for any change, and they both use the same 32Bit
    Header Size Specification. In other words, the implementation of the IPtX Specification
    has little or No affect, nor does it constitute an appreciable change in the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol Specification, which is Currently used in the IPv4
    IP Addressing System. Hence, this work should only be considered as an extension
    of the RFC(s) governing and supporting the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) for the IPv4 Specification, because the only objective this paper maintains,
    is the development and presentation of the IPtX DHCP Specification, which only
    compliments the requirements in the current RFC(s) defining the DHCP Protocol
    Specification.</p>"
