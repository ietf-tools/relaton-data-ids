abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach for integrating the functionality
    currently contained in [47]SDP (Session Announcement Protocol) into [48]SMIL (Synchronized
    Multimedia Integration Language). The motivation is to make it easier for SMIL
    authors to interface with the existing RTP/MBone infrastructure. Currently, this
    requires maintaining two different sets of files, each of which use a different
    text format. Another motivation is to save one network round-trip per RTSP URL
    in the SMIL file, since the information contained in the SDP file is now directly
    included in the SMIL file.</p>"
