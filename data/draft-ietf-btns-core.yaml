abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies how to use the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocols,
    such as IKEv1 and IKEv2, to setup "unauthenticated" security associations (SAs)
    for use with the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the IPsec Authentication
    Header (AH). No changes to IKEv2 bits-on-the-wire are required, but Peer Authorization
    Database (PAD) and Security Policy Database (SPD) extensions are specified. Unauthenticated
    IPsec is herein referred to by its popular acronym, "BTNS" (Better-Than-Nothing
    Security). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
