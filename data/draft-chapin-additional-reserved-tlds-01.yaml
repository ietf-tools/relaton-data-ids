abstract:
- content: '<p>The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names starting
    with root, ".", immediately below which are top level domain (TLD) names such
    as ".com" and ".us". In June 1999 [RFC2606] reserved a small number of TLD names
    for use in documentation examples, private testing, experiments, and other circumstances
    in which it is desirable to avoid conflict with current or future actual TLD names
    in the DNS. There has been significant evolution of Internet engineering and operation
    practices since [RFC2606] was published. In February 2013 [RFC6761] defined criteria
    and procedures for reserving a domain name for special use, and established an
    IANA registry for such names. This document reserves six domain name labels for
    special use in accordance with the criteria and procedures of [RFC6761]: localdomain,
    domain, lan, home, corp, and mail. It is important to note that TLD names may
    be reserved, in other contexts, for policy, political, or other reasons that are
    distinct from the IETF''s concern with Internet engineering and operations. This
    document reserves TLD names only for operational and engineering reasons.</p>'
