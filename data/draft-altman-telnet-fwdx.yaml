abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism via which X Window System client
    applications may have their communications with the X Windows System server forwarded
    across a Telnet communications channel. This is desireable when the Telnet session
    is established through a Firewall or Network Address Translator which does not
    allow arbitrary connections to be created from the host machine to the client
    machine; or when the Telnet session is using an authenticated and encrypted channel
    and that same security is desired for the X Window System session data. Authorization
    to communicate across the tunnel is provided to the X Windows System client via
    use of X Display access control data.</p>"
