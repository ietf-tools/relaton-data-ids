abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defines
    the mechanisms for the communication between a client and a PCE, or among PCEs.
    This document describe the usage of Transport Layer Security to enhance PCEP security,
    hence the PCEPS acronym proposed for it. The additional security mechanisms are
    provided by the transport protocol supporting PCEP, and therefore they do not
    affect its flexibility and extensibility.</p>"
