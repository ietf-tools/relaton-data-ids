abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the issues involved in elevating RTP to the
    status of protocol, equivalent to TCP or UDP. This will result in all RTP packets
    being explicitly labeled as such in the packet header. This vastly simplifies
    the problem of classifying real time streams. Such classification operations are
    essential for successful deploy- ment of RTP header compression, differentiated
    services, and traffic isolation. We define the format of the RTP protocol header,
    and dis- cuss issues of backwards compatibility.</p>"
