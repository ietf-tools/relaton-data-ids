abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey
    event notification messages. This protocol utilizes a layered architecture, which
    allows the use of any number of transport protocols for transmission of syslog
    messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions
    to be provided in a structured way. This document has been written with the original
    design goals for traditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered specification
    has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions
    suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and transport-independent RFC. Without
    this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet format
    and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues.
    This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on.
    This layered architecture approach also provides a solid basis that allows code
    to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each transport.
