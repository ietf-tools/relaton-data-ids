abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an experimental MPTCP option that is meant
    to negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can be established and maintained
    for a given MPTCP connection. The purpose is to minimize any possible performance
    degradation that can be induced by a possibly large number of establishment requests
    for additional subflows if the remote endpoint is not appropriateley dimensioned
    to handle such requests.</p>"
