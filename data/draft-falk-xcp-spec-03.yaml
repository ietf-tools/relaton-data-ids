abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains an initial specification for the Explicit Control
    Protocol (XCP), an experimental congestion control protocol. XCP is designed to
    deliver the highest possible end-to-end throughput over a broad range of network
    infrastructure, including links with very large bandwidth-delay products, which
    are not well served by the current control algorithms. XCP is potentially applicable
    to any transport protocol, although initial testing has applied it to TCP in particular.
    XCP routers are required to perform a small calculation on congestion state carried
    in each data packet. XCP routers also periodically recalculate the local parameters
    required to provide fairness. On the other hand, there is no per-flow congestion
    state in XCP routers. XCP is currently not ready for wide-scale deployment on
    the public Internet and the intent of this document is to provide a starting point
    for future experimentation and development as well as to record the authors' implementation
    experiences and caveats.</p>"
