abstract:
- content: "<p>Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms
    simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing security even
    if all but one of the component algorithms is broken. It is motivated by transition
    to post-quantum cryptography. This document provides a construction for hybrid
    key exchange in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3. Discussion
    of this work is encouraged to happen on the TLS IETF mailing list tls@ietf.org
    or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/dstebila/draft-stebila-tls-hybrid-
    design.</p>"
