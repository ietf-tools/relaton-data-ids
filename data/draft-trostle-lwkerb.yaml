abstract:
- content: "<p>The Kerberos V5 protocol [3] allows network entities to authenticate
    and establish shared secret keys. Some network applications would benefit from
    a lightweight authentication mechanism with many of the benefits of Kerberos,
    but where the messages have fewer bytes than existing Kerberos messages. Also,
    we describe a protocol option that requires only two messages to be sent and received
    from the client, to support lightweight clients. This document describes a Kerberos-
    like protocol that does not use ASN.1 and is optimized for smaller messages. The
    protocol makes use of existing Kerberos infrastructure.</p>"
