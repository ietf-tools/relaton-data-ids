abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies how the TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) of RTP
    flows can be supported using the RTP/AVPF profile and the general RTP header extension
    mechanism. AVPF feedback packets and RTP header extensions are defined to support
    the exchange of control information between RTP TFRC senders and receivers. TFRC
    is an equation-based congestion control scheme for unicast flows operating in
    a best effort Internet environment.</p>"
