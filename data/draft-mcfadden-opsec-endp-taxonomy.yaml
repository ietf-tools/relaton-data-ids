abstract:
- content: "<p>A separate document [I-D:draft-mcfadden-opsec-endp-evolve] attempts
    to establish the capabilities and limitations of endpoint-only security solutions
    and explore potential alternative approaches. That document discusses endpoints
    in general terms. It has been suggested that there are classes of endpoints that
    have different characteristics. Those classes may have completely different threat
    landscapes and the endpoints may have completely different security capabilities.
    As a companion to the endpoint evolution draft, this document provides a taxonomy
    of endpoints that is intended to provide a foundation for further work on endpoint
    security evolution and research on approaches to providing endpoint security alternatives
    in a diverse group of settings.</p>"
