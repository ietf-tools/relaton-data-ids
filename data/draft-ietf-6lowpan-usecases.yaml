abstract:
- content: "<p>This document investigates potential application scenarios and use
    cases for low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs). This document provides
    dimensions of design space for LoWPAN applications. A list of use cases and market
    domains that may benefit and motivate the work currently done in the 6LoWPAN Working
    Group is provided with the characteristics of each dimension. A complete list
    of practical use cases is not the goal of this document. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
