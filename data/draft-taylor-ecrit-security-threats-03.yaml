abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the security threats associated with the two
    current work items of the ECRIT Working Group. The first is the marking of signalling
    messages to indicate that they are related to an emergency. The second is the
    process of mapping from locations to Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) pointing
    to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). This mapping occurs as part of the
    process of routing emergency calls through the IP network. Based on the threats,
    this document establishes a set of security requirements for the the mapping protocol
    and for the handling of emergency-marked calls.</p>"
