abstract:
- content: "<p>Summoning emergency help is a core feature of telephone networks. This
    document describes how the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide
    advanced emergency services for voice-over-IP (VoIP). The architecture employs
    standard SIP features and requires no new protocol mechanisms. DNS is used to
    map civil and geospatial locations to the appropriate emergency call center.</p>"
