abstract:
- content: "<p>Many enterprises today employ the service of multiple DNS providers
    to distribute their authoritative DNS service. Deploying DNSSEC in such an environment
    may present some challenges, depending on the configuration and feature set in
    use. In particular, when each DNS provider independently signs zone data with
    their own keys, additional key-management mechanisms are necessary. This document
    presents deployment models that accommodate this scenario and describes these
    key-management requirements. These models do not require any changes to the behavior
    of validating resolvers, nor do they impose the new key-management requirements
    on authoritative servers not involved in multi-signer configurations.</p>"
