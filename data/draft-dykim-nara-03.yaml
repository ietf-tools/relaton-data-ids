abstract:
- content: "<p>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The
    Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a collection
    of nodes. Each site is named by an exterior address whereas each node by an interior
    local address. Exterior routing depends solely on site addresses while interior
    routing on node addresses. Mobility is inherent in Interior routing while migration
    and multihoming are in exterior routing. The model can recursively repeat itself
    both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability, for example,
    to inter-planetary as well as Internet of Things.</p>"
