abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources
    and associated policies on each of a connected set of links in the underlay network.
    An NRP could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN
    services. Multiple NRPs can be created by network operator to meet the diverse
    requirements of different enhanced VPN services. In packet forwarding, some fields
    in the data packet needs to be used as the NRP Selector to identify the NRP the
    packet belongs to, so that the NRP-specific processing can be executed on the
    packet. This document proposes a mechanism to carry the NRP Selector ID and related
    information in MPLS packets. The procedure for processing the NRP Selector ID
    and related information is also specified.</p>"
