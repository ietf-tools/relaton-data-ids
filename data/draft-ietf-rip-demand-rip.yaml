abstract:
- content: "<p>Running routing protocols on connection oriented Public Data Networks,
    for example X.25 packet switched networks or ISDN, can be expensive if the standard
    form of periodic broadcasting of routing information is adhered to. The high cost
    arises because a connection has to all practical intents and purposes be kept
    open to every destination to which routing information is to be sent, whether
    or not it is being used to carry user data. Routing information may also fail
    to be propagated if the number of destinations to which the routing information
    is to be sent exceeds the number of channels available to the router on the Wide
    Area Network (WAN).</p>"
