abstract:
- content: "<p>Recommendations for Interoperable Networks using Intermediate System
    to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC3719] highlights a number of differences between
    the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 and the protocol as it is deployed
    today. This document outlines a number of differences found in the China Mobile
    backbone network, which is constructed using routers from several manufacturers.
    These differences include LSP checksum calculation, zero checksum LSP processing,
    zero remaining lifetime LSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing. This document
    is intended to provide best current practices to facilitate interoperability and
    maintain network stability.</p>"
