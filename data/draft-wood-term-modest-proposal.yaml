abstract:
- content: "<p>Certain established and longstanding terms of art, used as technical
    terminology, are now considered contentious and can be considered harmful when
    used in discussion, in debate, and in reading, following, accepting the authority
    of, and complying with, existing technical documentation that unfortunately uses
    those terms that were not considered to be at all contentious, but clear and entirely
    uncontroversial normal use, when that technical documentation was originally authored
    or published. The use of such now-deplorable terms of art should be deprecated,
    and those terms should ideally be replaced with approved, accepted, more effective,
    inoffensive terms of art wherever possible. Any new use of those original terms
    must be carefully considered and fully justified before that use is agreed by
    consensus and submitted for careful approval in documents. Recommended replacement
    substitute terms should be considered for inclusion instead. A process for identifying
    and recommending replacements to those harmful terms is outlined here.</p>"
