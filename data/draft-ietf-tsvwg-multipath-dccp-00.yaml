abstract:
- content: "<p>DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple
    paths for a DCCP session could improve resource usage within the network and,
    thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    to network failures. Use cases for a Multipath DCCP (MP-DCCP) are mobile devices
    (handsets, vehicles) and residential home gateways simultaneously connected to
    distinct paths as, e.g., a cellular link and a WiFi link or to a mobile radio
    station and a fixed access network. Compared to existing multipath protocols such
    as MPTCP, MP- DCCP provides specific support for non-TCP user traffic as UDP or
    plain IP. More details on potential use cases are provided in [website], [slide]
    and [paper]. All this use cases profit from an Open Source Linux reference implementation
    provided under [website]. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional
    DCCP to support multipath operation. Multipath DCCP provides the ability to simultaneously
    use multiple paths between peers. The protocol offers the same type of service
    to applications as DCCP and it provides the components necessary to establish
    and use multiple DCCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</p>"
