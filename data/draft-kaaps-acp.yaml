abstract:
- content: <p>Access Control Protocol (ACP) is a protocol for unified implementation
    of various methods for computer device access control. The protocol allows two
    devices to negotiate required assets, negotiate an authentication method, do authentication,
    deliver the access parameters and do accounting, all within one so called "transaction".
    Separate transactions can be joined so that more devices can be added to the access
    control operation.</p>
