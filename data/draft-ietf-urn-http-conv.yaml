abstract:
- content: <p>The Uniform Resource Names Working Group (URN-WG) was formed to specify
    persistent, location-independent names for network accessible resources, as well
    as resolution mechanisms to retrieve the resources given such a name. At this
    time the URN-WG is considering one particular resolution mechanism, the NAPTR
    proposal [1]. That proposal specifies how a client may find a "resolver" for a
    URN. A resolver is a database that can provide information about the resource
    identified by a URN, such as the resource's location, a bibliographic description,
    or even the resource itself. The protocol used for the client to communicate with
    the resolver is not specified in the NAPTR proposal. Instead, the NAPTR resource
    record provides a field that indicates the "resolution protocol" and "resolution
    service requests" offered by the resolver. This document specifies the "THTTP"
    resolution protocol - a trivial convention for encoding resolution service requests
    and responses as HTTP 1.0 or 1.1 requests and responses. The primary goal of THTTP
    is to be simple to implement so that existing HTTP servers may easily add support
    for URN resolution. We expect that the databases used by early resolvers will
    be useful when more sophisticated resolution protocols are developed later.</p>
