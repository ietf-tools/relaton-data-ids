abstract:
- content: '<p>The "persistently full buffer" problem has been discussed in the IETF
    community since the early 80''s [RFC896]. The IRTF''s End-to-End Working Group
    called for the deployment of active queue management (AQM) to solve the problem
    in 1998 [RFC2309]. Despite the awareness, the problem has only gotten worse as
    Moore''s Law growth in memory density fueled an exponential increase in buffer
    pool size. Efforts to deploy AQM have been frustrated by difficult configuration
    and negative impact on network utilization. This problem, recently christened
    "bufferbloat", [TSVBB2011] [BB2011] has become increasingly important throughout
    the Internet but particularly at the consumer edge. This document describes a
    general framework called CoDel (Controlled Delay) [CODEL2012] that controls bufferbloat-generated
    excess delay in modern networking environments. CoDel consists of an estimator,
    a setpoint, and a control loop. It requires no configuration in normal Internet
    deployments. CoDel comprises some major technical innovations and has been made
    available as open source so that the framework can be applied by the community
    to a range of problems. It has been implemented in Linux (and available in the
    Linux distribution) and deployed in some networks at the consumer edge. In addition,
    the framework has been successfully applied in other ways. Note: Code Components
    extracted from this document must include the license as included with the code
    in Section 5.</p>'
