abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces a new message type into the Secure Shell (SSH)
    Transport Layer Protocol whose meaning and contents are defined by a name at the
    start of the message, thus allowing for further extensions to the protocol to
    be implemented without using further message numbers. Comments are solicited and
    should be addressed to the mailing list at &lt;ietf-ssh@NetBSD.org&gt; or to the
    author.</p>"
