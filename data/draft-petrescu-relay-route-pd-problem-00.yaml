abstract:
- content: "<p>The operation of a prefix delegation procedure with the DHCPv6 protocol
    may need route setup and maintenance at the Delegating Router, Requesting Router
    and on the entity on which the Relay agent is implemented. This document describes
    the problem of routing during DHCPv6 prefix delegation, and is illustrated by
    ADSL-type and cellular-type of topologies which may use Relays; we refer to section
    14 of RFC 3633 which mentions the need of 'a protocol or other out of band communication
    to add routing information for delegated prefixes'. Based on this problem, a number
    of requirements from the service providers are described. A small set of documented
    solutions are separately mentioned (snooping, route injection, etc.), together
    with their pros and cons according to a particular judgment.</p>"
