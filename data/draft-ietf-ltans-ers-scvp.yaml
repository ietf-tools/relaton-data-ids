abstract:
- content: "<p>The Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) defines an
    extensible means of delegating the development and validation of certification
    paths to a server. It can be used to support the development and validation of
    certification paths well after the expiration of the certificates in the path
    by specifying a time of interest in the past. The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS)
    defines structures, called evidence records, to support the non-repudiation of
    the existence of data. Evidence records can be used to preserve materials that
    comprise a certification path such that trust in the certificates can be established
    after the expiration of the certificates in the path and after the cryptographic
    algorithms used to sign the certificates in the path are no longer secure. This
    document describes usage of the SCVP WantBack feature to convey evidence records,
    enabling SCVP responders to provide preservation evidence for certificates and
    certificate revocation lists (CRLs). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
