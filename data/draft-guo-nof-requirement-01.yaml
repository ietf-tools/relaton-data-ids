abstract:
- content: "<p>NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range
    of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a storage networking
    fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. For IP-based network,
    RDMA or TCP technology can be used to transport NVMe, but the network fault detection
    is weak. This document describes the solution requirements for fast fault detection
    to improve reliability.</p>"
