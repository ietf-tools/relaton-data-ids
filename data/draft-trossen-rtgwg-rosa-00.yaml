abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a novel communication approach which reasons
    about WHAT is being communicated (and invoked) instead of WHO is communicating.
    Such approach is meant to transition away from locator-based addressing (and thus
    routing and forwarding) to an addressing scheme where the address semantics relate
    to services being invoked (e.g., for computational processes, and their generated
    information requests and responses). The document introduces Routing on Service
    Addresses (ROSA), as a realization of what is referred to as 'service-based routing'
    (SBR). Such routing is designed to be constrained by service-specific parameters
    that go beyond load and latency, as in today's best effort or traffic engineering
    based routing, leading to an approach to steer traffic in a service-specific constraint-based
    manner. Particularly, this document outlines sample ROSA use case scenarios, requirements
    for its design, and the ROSA system design itself.</p>"
