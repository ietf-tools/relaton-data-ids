abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers proposals to enable the negotiation of trust
    anchors in TLS. It makes three basic arguments: that trust negotiation is not
    helpful in addressing the problems it claims to address, that trust negotiation
    instead comes with material harms to the critical trust infrastructure of the
    Internet, and that the proposed mechanisms for deploying trust negotiation are
    unworkable. This draft goes on to discuss simpler and more effective solutions
    to these problems.</p>"
