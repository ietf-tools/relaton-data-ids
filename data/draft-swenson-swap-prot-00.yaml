abstract:
- content: "<p>A standard protocol is needed to integrate work providers, asynchronous
    services, across the intranet/internet and provide for their interaction. The
    integration and interactions consist of control and monitoring of the work. Control
    means creating the work, setting up the work, starting the work, stopping the
    work, being informed of exceptions, being informed of the completion of the work
    and getting the results of the work Monitoring means checking on the current status
    of the work and getting a history of the execution of the work. The protocol should
    be light weight and easy to implement, so that a variety of devices and situations
    can be covered. The Simple Workflow Access Protocol is a proposed way to solve
    this problem through use of HTTP protocol, and by transferring structured information
    encoded in XML. A new set of HTTP methods is defined, as well as the information
    to be supplied and the information returned in XML, that accomplish the control
    of generic asynchronous services. This has applicability to workflow because a
    workflow is itself an asynchronous service, and it also has the need to be able
    to call asynchronous services aoutside of itself.</p>"
