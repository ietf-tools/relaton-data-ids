abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a DHCPv6 option to configure hosts on a 6LoWPAN
    with IPv6 address compression information as required by stateful compression
    methods specified in RFC 6282. The option provides up to 16 prefixes that can
    be associated with specific instances of IPv6 address compression used in 6LoWPANs.
    Each prefix can be a variable length of bits, and includes a validity lifetime
    as well.</p>"
