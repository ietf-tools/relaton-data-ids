abstract:
- content: <p>As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and technologies, various qualifiers
    and modifiers are prepended to the OAM abbreviation. While, at first glance, the
    most used appear to be well understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted
    differently in different contexts. A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band"
    and "out-of-band" which have their origins in the radio lexicon, and which have
    been extrapolated into other communication networks. This document recommends
    not to use these two terms when referring to OAM. This document considers some
    common qualifiers and modifiers that are prepended, within the context of packet
    networks, to the OAM abbreviation and lays out guidelines for their use in future
    IETF work.</p>
