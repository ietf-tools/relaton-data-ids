abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources
    and associated policies on each of a connected set of links in the underlay network.
    An NRP could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN
    services. Multiple NRPs can be created by network operator to meet the diverse
    requirements of enhanced VPN services. In packet forwarding, some fields in the
    data packet needs to be used to identify the NRP the packet belongs to, so that
    the NRP-specific processing can be executed on the packet. This document proposes
    a mechanism to carry the data plane NRP ID in an MPLS packet to identify the NRP
    the packet belongs to. The procedure for processing the data plane NRP ID is also
    specified.</p>"
