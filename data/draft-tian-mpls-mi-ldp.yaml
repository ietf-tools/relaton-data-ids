abstract:
- content: "<p>Many of the routing protocols today can support multiple topologies
    or multiple instances [ISISMT] [OSPFV3] [OSPFMT]. In such an environment, prefix,
    address family, and topology/instance together define an FEC. But the current
    LDP specificaiton is not sufficient to allow multi-topology/multi-instance to
    share the same LDP session. In this document we introduce a concept of 'Label
    Binding Instance' to LDP so that FECs can be unambiguiously identified in a multi-
    topology/multi-instance routing environment.</p>"
