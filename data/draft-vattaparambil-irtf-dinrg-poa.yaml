abstract:
- content: "<p>Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization is a generic and decentralized
    subgranting based authorization technique. In this, a principal can grant limited
    credibilities for an agent to act on its behalf for some limited time and context.
    This can be used for example with semi autonomous devices to have them act on
    behalf. PoA is a self-contained document that a principal sign and directs to
    an agent, thereby providing it the power to execute user actions on behalf of
    the principal for a predefined time. As an example in this document we explain
    Power of Attorney based authorization technique as a decentralized solution for
    onboarding devices. Industrial network layer onboarding demands a technique that
    is efficient, scalable, and secure. PoA based onboarding enables users such as
    integrators and subcontractors to onboard devices permanently or temporarily according
    to terms and requirements set in the PoAs.</p>"
