abstract:
- content: "<p>The most common existing authentication mechanisms for HTTP are sent
    with each HTTP request, and authenticate that request instead of the underlying
    HTTP connection, or transport. While these mechanisms work well for existing uses
    of HTTP, they are not suitable for emerging applications that multiplex non-HTTP
    traffic inside an HTTP connection. This document describes the HTTP Transport
    Authentication Framework, a method of authenticating not only an HTTP request,
    but also its underlying transport.</p>"
