abstract:
- content: "<p>Some relay agents extract lease information from the DHCP messages
    exchanged between the client and DHCP server. This lease information is used by
    relay agents for various purposes like antispoofing and prevention of flooding.
    RFC 4388 defines a mechanism for relay agents to retrieve the lease information
    from the DHCP server when this information is lost. The existing lease query mechanism
    is data-driven, which means that a relay agent can initiate the lease query only
    when it starts receiving data to and from the clients. In certain scenarios, this
    model is not scalable. This document first looks at issues in the existing mechanism
    and then proposes a new query type, query by Remote ID, to address these issues.
