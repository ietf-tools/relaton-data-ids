abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used to
    route both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. [2] adds functionality to
    Integrated IS-IS so that it supports IPv6. RFC 1195 [1] places topological restrictions
    on networks that are routed using Integrated IS-IS, specifically, that every router
    in a level-1 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that are present
    in that area, and every router in a level-2 area must be capable of all network
    layer protocols that are present in the whole IS-IS routing domain. The mechanism
    described in this document enables a single IS-IS routing domain to support different
    network layer protocol topologies by maintaining separate SPF trees for each network
    layer protocol.</p>"
