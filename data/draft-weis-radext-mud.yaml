abstract:
- content: "<p>A Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a file describing the expected
    use of a class of devices, usually an Internet of Things class of devices. It
    is prepared by a manufacturer and placed on a generally available web server,
    and is addressable via a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The URI is often included
    in a discovery protocol (e.g., DNS, LLDP). A Network Access Server (NAS) in the
    path of the discovery protocol can collect and forward the URI to a RADIUS server,
    which processes the URI. This draft defines the RADIUS extension needed for the
    NAS to forward the URI to the RADIUS server.</p>"
