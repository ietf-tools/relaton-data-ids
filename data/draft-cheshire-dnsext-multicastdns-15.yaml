abstract:
- content: "<p>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous,
    the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.
    In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including,
    but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server
    is useful. Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations
    on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server. In addition,
    Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free for local use,
    without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to set up delegations
    or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer for those names. The
    primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i) they require little or no
    administration or configuration to set them up, (ii) they work when no infrastructure
    is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure failures.</p>"
