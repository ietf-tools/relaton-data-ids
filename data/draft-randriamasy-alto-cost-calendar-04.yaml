abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning network related information
    in order to allow applications to make informed decisions. The present draft extends
    the ALTO cost information so as to broaden the decision possibilities of applications
    to not only decide 'where' to connect to, but also 'when'. This is useful to applications
    that need to schedule their data transfers and connections and have a degree of
    freedom to do so. ALTO guidance to schedule application traffic can also efficiently
    help for load balancing and resources efficiency. Besides, the ALTO Cost Calendar
    also allows to schedule the ALTO requests themselves and thus save a number of
    ALTO transactions. The draft proposes new capabilities and attributes on filtered
    cost maps and endpoint costs enabling an ALTO Server to provide "Cost Calendars".
    These capabilities are applicable to time-sensitive ALTO metrics With ALTO Cost
    Calendars, an ALTO Server exposes ALTO Cost Values in JSON arrays where each value
    corresponds to a given time interval. The time intervals as well as other Calendar
    attributes are specified in the IRD and ALTO Server responses.</p>
