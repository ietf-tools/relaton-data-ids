abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070] defines a
    data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly
    exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer
    security incidents. Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of available options
    that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging
    for implementers to develop tools that can Leverage IODEF for incident sharing.
    This document provides guidelines for IODEF implementers. It will also address
    how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF. The goal of this document
    is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption
    of the model by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the
    world.</p>"
