abstract:
- content: "<p>Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly important
    functionality that needs to be provided in the Internet. This document proposes
    the definition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP), named Metering NSLP
    (M-NSLP), which allows the dynamic configuration of Metering Entities on the data
    path. An accompanying document [I-D.fessi-nsis-m-nslp-framework] provides a problem
    statement, describes scenarios where such a path-coupled configuration of Metering
    Entities is useful, elaborates requirements for a path-coupled protocol for the
    configuration of Metering Entities and discusses the applicability of NSIS for
    this purpose. This document defines a Metering NSLP protocol design and messages,
    and describes the protocol operation.</p>"
