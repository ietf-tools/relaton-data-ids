abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method for making random selections in such
    a way as to promote public confidence in the unbiased nature of the choice. This
    method is referred to in this document as "verifiable selection". It focuses on
    the selection of the voting members of the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom)
    from the pool of eligible volunteers; however, similar techniques could be and
    have been applied to other selections. It provdes an optional extension for multiple
    rounds of such selection that can be induced by earlier selectees without compromising
    the unpredictable nature of the selections. This document obsoletes RFC 3797.</p>
