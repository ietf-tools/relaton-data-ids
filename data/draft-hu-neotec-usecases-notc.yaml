abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents two network operations in telco cloud orchestration
    use case for AI-based video recognition in smart city management and dynamic high-bandwidth
    transport. Key innovations include dynamic resource scheduling across heterogeneous
    computing (GPU/NPU) and network domains, centralized training with distributed
    inference, and low-latency data transmission compliant with data sovereignty requirements.
    Additionally, the use case demonstrates elastic bandwidth provisioning and failover
    mechanisms to ensure reliability. The framework highlights the need for standardized
    interfaces between cloud and network controllers to optimize performance, resource
    utilization, and QoS in telecom cloud environments.</p>"
