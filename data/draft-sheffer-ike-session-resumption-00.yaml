abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol is computationally
    intensive with respect to the number of round-trips required and cryptographic
    operations involved. In particular the Extensible Authentication Protocol is used
    for authentication, which adds additional computational intensity. To re-establish
    security associations (SA) upon a failure recovery condition is time comsuming,
    especially when an IPsec peer, such as a VPN gateway, needs to re-establish a
    large number of SAs with various end points. A high number of concurrent sessions
    might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA restablishment. In
    many failure cases it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an
    interrupted IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that
    allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient
    manner, utilizing a previously establied IKE SA. A client can reconnect to a gateway
    from which it was disconnected, or alternatively migrate to another gateway that
    is associated with the previous one. The proposed approach conveys IKEv2 state
    information, in the form of an encrypted ticket, to a VPN client that is later
    presented to the VPN gateway for re-authentication. An encrypted ticket cannot
    be decrypted by a VPN client but allows a VPN gateway to restore state for faster
    session state setup.</p>"
