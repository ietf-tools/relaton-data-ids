abstract:
- content: "<p>Two protocols, CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) and Mobile-IP have
    been developed by the CDPD Forum and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) respectively
    to address the issue of providing seamless network access to mobile data devices.
    In this memo a scheme is proposed for the two networks to interwork together and
    to support seamless migration of mobile data devices between the networks.</p>"
