abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft gives a summary of findings about routing optimization of
    not-via addresses [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] and LFAs [RFC5286] in
    IP networks. The optimization is done only by tuning IP link costs. Optimization
    goals for both IP FRR techniques is the maximum link utilization in the failure-free
    scenario and for a set of failure scenarios such as all single link (and node)
    failures as well as the failure coverage by LFAs. For LFAs, the failure coverage
    is another optimization goal.</p>"
