abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the framework and operational procedure for
    deterministic networking that guarantees maximum and minimum end-to- end latency
    bounds to flows. The solution has non-periodic, asynchronous, flow-level, non-work
    conserving, on-time, and rate- based functional characteristics, according to
    the taxonomy suggested by [draft-ietf-detnet-dataplane-taxonomy-02]. The packets
    are stored in the queue in ascending order of the ideal service start time, called
    Eligible Time (ET), and the ideal service completion time, called Finish Time
    (FT). The queued packets were forwarded between ET and FT in a non-work conserving
    manner. The ET and FT are calculated at the entrance node according to the packet
    size and rate of the flow. All subsequent core nodes are stateless and asynchronously
    compute ET and FT based on metadata received via packet headers. This mechanism
    is called non-work-preserving stateless fair queuing, which guarantees both E2E
    latency upper and lower bounds.</p>"
