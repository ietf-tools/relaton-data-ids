abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB Stack Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI) workshop in
    Zurich in January 2015 and the follow-up Substrate Protocol for User Datagrams
    (SPUD) BoF session at the IETF 92 meeting in Dallas in March 2015 identified the
    potential need for a UDP-based encapsulation to allow explicit cooperation with
    middleboxes while using encryption at the transport layer and above to protect
    user payload and metadata from inspection and interference. This document proposes
    a set of architectural considerations for such approaches.</p>"
