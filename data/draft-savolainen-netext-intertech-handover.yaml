abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility management
    protocol which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way which is transparent
    to the host itself. This document analyses the scenarios in which a multi-interfaced
    Mobile Node roams in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain which consists of access networks
    that are of different types. In order to support session continuity as the Mobile
    Node moves between access networks within the PMIP6 domain, the Mobile Node either
    needs to use host based Mobile IP or be enhanced with various capabilities described
    in this document.</p>"
