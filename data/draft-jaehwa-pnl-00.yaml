abstract:
- content: "<p>An important challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) is that how
    to route data packets from sources to base station energy efficiently. Inspiring
    data fusion feature and multi-hop routing, in this document, we introduce a clustering
    approach called PLIR (Prolonging Network Lifetime via Intra-Cluster Routing) for
    saving energy and distributing data dissipation evenly by improving BS cluster
    formation algorithm of LEACH-Centralized and providing 3-hop routing algorithm
    within clusters. Hence, it prolongs the lifetime of WSN. PLIR consumes less energy
    and reduces communication overhead, and extends the network lifetime compared
    with other approaches.</p>"
