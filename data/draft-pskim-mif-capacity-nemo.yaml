abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an estimation scheme of available capacity for
    network mobility (NEMO) with the multi-interfaced mobile router (MMR). In the
    proposed scheme, mobile nodes (MNs) can get information on available capacity
    irrespective of the presence or absence of estimation functionality. Since the
    MMR with heterogeneous wireless network interfaces estimates available capacity
    on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network, the proposed scheme does not require
    MNs to be involved in estimating available capacity. A new algorithm for available
    capacity estimation on MMR is developed to improve the estimation accuracy compared
    with the existing scheme. The developed algorithm defines three cases of the difference
    between the average output gap and the input gap, and then reflects fully them,
    which can reduce the detection error for the turning point and thus provide more
    accurate estimation than the existing algorithm. Then, MNs can get information
    on estimated available capacity from the MMR using L3 messages. Therefore, the
    proposed scheme can reduce burden and power consumption of MNs with limited resource
    and battery power since MNs do not estimates directly available capacity. In addition,
    the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead over wireless links
    on multiple estimation paths since signaling messages and injected testing traffic
    are reduced.</p>"
