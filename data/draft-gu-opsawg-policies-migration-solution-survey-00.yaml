abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft enumerates several kinds of potential solutions that may
    resolve the problem described in I-D.gu-opsawg-policies-migration. The goal is
    to, on one hand, make deeper analysis to this problem and, on the other hand,
    provide informaiton for gap analysis, and authors of gap analysis can make research
    on the potential solutions to find out whether there are existing protocols or
    mechanisms can be reused to compose a specific potential solution. The solutions
    introduced here are just high level thought and, if one solution is regarded as
    a preferred way, we need to analyze and define, if needed, detail mechanism and
    protocols in future.</p>"
