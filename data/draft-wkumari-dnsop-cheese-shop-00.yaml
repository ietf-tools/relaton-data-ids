abstract:
- content: "<p>This document cuts down on junk queries to the DNS root and improves
    performance by answering queries locally from compliant resolvers. It does this
    by actually believing the NSEC responses. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets
    ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions,
    general musings, etc. They will be removed before publication.] [ This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</p>"
