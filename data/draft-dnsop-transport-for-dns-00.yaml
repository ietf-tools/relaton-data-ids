abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS queries and responses are available over a variety of transports
    (UDP/TCP) and may be ported to use other transports in the future. Current use
    profiles show that most user generated DNS traffic prefers one transport over
    another. This historical usage pattern has or may lead to the presumption that
    any DNS traffic, regardless of transport, should be considered on equal footing.</p>"
