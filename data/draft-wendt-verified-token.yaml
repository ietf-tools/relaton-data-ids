abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a token format for verifying with non-repudiation
    the originator of a set of information. The originator uses a cryptographic signature
    generally with a key that proves authorization from a trust anchor to prove to
    a terminating party that the originator is both an authorized sender and the information
    wasn't altered or modified in transit. The token incorporates the ability for
    the originator to assert a application specific but extensible set of information
    that could include network identity, device identity, realm of origin, and other
    metadata. Verification of this information in the telephony world is important
    for validating telephone calls and the telephone numbers they are presenting and
    can be utilized as an important tool for combat spoofing of identity and other
    forms of impersonation.</p>"
