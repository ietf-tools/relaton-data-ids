abstract:
- content: "<p>In the interest of addressing pervasive threats to the confidentiality
    and integrity of online communications identified by the Internet community [I-D.barnes-pervasive-problem]
    this specification introduces an open architecture for the establishment, management,
    and secure distribution of cryptographic keys for use in the end-to-end (E2E)
    encryption of online communications and shared content. This architecture allows
    for the independent deployment of dedicated key management services in a manner
    that supports the adoption of third-party communications and data sharing services
    by individuals and organizations that require full and exclusive discretion over
    the confidentiality of their data.</p>"
