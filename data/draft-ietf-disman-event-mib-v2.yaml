- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects that can be used to manage and monitor MIB objects
    and take action through events. This document obsoletes RFC 2981. The Event MIB
    provides the ability to monitor MIB objects on the local system or on a remote
    system and take simple action when a trigger condition is met.</p>"
