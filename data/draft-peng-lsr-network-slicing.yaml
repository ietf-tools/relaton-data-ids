abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a mechanism aimed at providing a solution for
    network slicing in the transport network for 5G services. The proposed mechanism
    uses a unified administrative instance identifier to distinguish different virtual
    network resources for both intra- domain and inter-domain network slicing scenarios.
    Combined with the segment routing technology, the mechanism could be used for
    both best-effort and traffic engineered services for tenants.</p>"
