abstract:
- content: "<p>The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as defined
    in the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra- session replay
    attacks when its uses manual keying. Additionally, the existing cryptographic
    authentication schemes do not cover the IP header. This omission can be exploited
    to carry out various types of attacks. This draft proposes an authentication scheme
    based on a challenge- response mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter
    and intra replay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its protocol
    packets. For comparison, an approach based on making sequence numbers unique is
    presented. Later we also describe some changes in the cryptographic hash computation
    so that we eliminate most attacks that result because of OSPFv2 not protecting
    the IP header.</p>"
