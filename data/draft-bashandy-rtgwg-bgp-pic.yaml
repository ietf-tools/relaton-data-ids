abstract:
- content: "<p>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millions
    of routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Given the large scaling
    targets, it is desirable to restore traffic after failure in a time period that
    does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. In this document we proposed an
    architecture by which traffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup
    paths in a timeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. The objective
    is achieved through organizing the forwarding chains in a hierarchical manner
    and sharing forwarding elements among the maximum possible number of routes. The
    proposed technique achieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring incremental
    deployment, complete transparency and automation, and zero management and provisioning
    effort. It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of BGP-PIC are hinged on
    the existence of more than one path whether as ECMP or primary-backup.</p>"
