abstract:
- content: <p>Over the last year of work, the SIMPLE group has tried to answer the
    question of "what is a tuple". This document tries to answer that question by
    proposing an abstract data model for presence, and then mapping that data model
    onto the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF). It then discusses the operations
    of publication, composition, filtering as they relate to presence data processing.</p>
