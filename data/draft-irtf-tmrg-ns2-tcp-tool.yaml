abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a TCP performance evaluation tool for the
    network simulator NS2. This tool is motivated by the observation that there is
    significant overlap among (but lack of an agreed set of) the topologies, traffic,
    and metrics used by many researchers in the evaluation of TCP alternatives: effort
    could be saved by starting research from an existing framework. As such, our tool
    includes several typical topologies and traffic models; it measures some of the
    most important metrics commonly used in TCP evaluation; and it can automatically
    generate simulation statistics and graphs ready for inclusion in latex and html
    documents. The tool also contains an extendable open-source framework. With community
    effort, we hope the tool evolves into a widely accepted, well-defined set of TCP
    performance evaluation benchmarks.</p>"
