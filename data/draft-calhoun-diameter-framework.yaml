abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks by using
    the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
    (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent work done in the Roaming Operations (ROAMOPS)
    Working Group was to investigate whether RADIUS could be used in a roaming network,
    and concluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes. The IETF has
    formed a new NAS Requirements Working Group, and part of their charter is to document
    the next generation NAS' AAA requirements. Recently, the Mobile-IP Working Group
    also documented their own AAA requirements that would help Mobile IP scale for
    Inter-Domain mobility. The DIAMETER protocol is a follow-on to the RADIUS protocol.
    DIAMETER addresses the known RADIUS deficiencies, and is intended for use with
    the NASREQ and Mobile IP application space.</p>"
