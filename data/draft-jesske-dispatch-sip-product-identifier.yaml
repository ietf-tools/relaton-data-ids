abstract:
- content: "<p>Complex telephony networks using SIP as signalling like the IP Multimedia
    Subsystem (IMS) of the Third Generation Partnership (3GPP) serving different groups
    of customers like business and retail customers with different products like mobile,
    fixed and PBX services have the problem of different handling of the services.
    This may end up in a complex analysis of the signalling syntax before starting
    the required procedures for calls based on their service provided to the customer.
    With the introduction of microservice based technologies the complexity increases.
    This draft describes a generic identification mechanism for SIP dialogs in using
    an identifier indicating the service/product which the customer is using to allow
    an efficient processing of the SIP dialog and session.</p>"
