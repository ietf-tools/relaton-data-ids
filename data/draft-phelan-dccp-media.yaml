abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses strategies for using DCCP as the transport
    protocol for streaming media applications. Of particular interest is how media
    streams can be adapted to the smoothly varying transmit rate requirements of CCID3,
    or TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). Also explored is the resulting network behavior
    of streams using these strategies and the fairness between these streams and TCP-based
    streams.</p>"
