abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses authorization models for DNSSEC that can be used
    to determine the relationship of a KEY RR and a DNS RRset in the validation process.
    Is this key trusted to sign for this data? Is this data trusted because it was
    signed by this key? This draft defines a number of different policies that can
    be used and what the signing authority of keys are in each. This draft also addresses
    what steps are recommended in the secure DNS resolution process and how the authorization
    policy is put to use. The ideas and definitions expressed here are based on the
    authors experience in implementing a reference secure resolver.</p>"
