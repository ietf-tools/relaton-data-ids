abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use case where IP packets are disseminated
    to geographical areas, based on geographical location information. A source node,
    which may be located anywhere, sends packets to an access router through the Internet.
    Those access routers are selected based on geographical location information,
    and traffic is routed to them using the IP address of the router and conventional
    IP routing. Each of the destination access routers then copies and broadcasts
    the received packets to listeners within its (1) radio coverage for wireless access
    routers or (2) IP subnet for wired access routers.</p>"
