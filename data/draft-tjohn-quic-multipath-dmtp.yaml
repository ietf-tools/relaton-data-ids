abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport Protocol
    (DMTP) concept as an extension to the Multipath Extension for QUIC (MP-QUIC).
    This extension aims to support data streams with strict latency requirements by
    enabling the signaling of a stream's deadline and by combining multipath scheduling,
    congestion control adaptations, and optional forward error correction (FEC). Moreover,
    DMTP leverages MP-QUIC's path identifiers to distinguish different end-to-end
    paths as they may be offered in a Path Aware Network (PAN) such as SCION. This
    allows an application to select its preferred paths while maintaining interoperability
    with standard MP-QUIC endpoints. In combination, DMTP enables endpoints to exchange
    and schedule deadline-aware streams across multiple network paths.</p>"
