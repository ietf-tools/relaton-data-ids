abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generic architecture for the service automation
    management (SAM) which can be used to deploy service across networks models specified
    in IETF. It describes the basic architecture, the components, and interfaces used
    for service automation control and configuration. However, this document does
    not propose protocols or extensions to existing protocols but shows how service
    requests from customer applications can be realized in the way more programmable
    and agile manner and mapped to the corresponding protocols and network elements.</p>"
