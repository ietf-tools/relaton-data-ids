abstract:
- content: "<p>In some situations it be can attractive to have an authoritative DNS
    server that does not have a local copy of the zone or zones that it serves. In
    particular in anycast operations, it is sensible to have a great geographical
    and topological diversity. However, sometimes the expected use of a particular
    site does not warrant the cost of keeping local copies of the zones. This can
    be the case if a zone is very large or if the anycast cluster serves many zones
    from which only a few are expected to receive significant traffic. In these cases
    it can be useful to have a proxy serve some or all of the zones. The proxy would
    not have a local copy of the zones it serves, instead it forwards request to another
    server that is authoritative for the zone. The proxy may have a cache. This document
    describes the details of such proxies.</p>"
