abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the yang data model for packet forwarding policy
    that filters received packets and forwards (or drops) the packets. Prior to forwarding
    the packets out other interfaces, some of the fields in the packets may be modified.
    If one considers the packet reception an event, this packet policy is a minimalistic
    Event-Match Condition-Action policy. This policy controls forwarding of packets
    received by a routing device on one or more interfaces on which this policy is
    enabled. The policy is composed of an ordered list of policy rules. Each policy
    policy rule contains a set of match conditions that filters for packets plus a
    set of actions to modify the packet and forward packets. The match conditions
    can match tuples in multiple layers (L1-L4, application), interface received on,
    and and other conditions regarding the packet (size of packet, time of day). The
    modify packet actions allow for setting things within the packet plus decapsulation
    and encapsulation packet. The forwarding actions include forwarding via interfaces,
    tunnels, or nexthops and dropping the packet. The policy model can be used with
    the session ephemeral (BGP Flow Specifications), reboot ephemeral state (I2RS
    ephemeral), and non-ephemeral routing/forwarding state (e.g. configuration state
    ).</p>"
