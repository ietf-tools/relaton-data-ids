abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Message Support Protocol (IMSP) is designed to support
    the provision of mail in a medium to large scale operation. It is intended to
    be used as a companion to the IMAP4 protocol [IMAP4], providing services which
    are either outside the scope of mail access or which pertain to environments which
    must run more than one IMAP4 server in the same mail domain. The services that
    IMSP provides are extended mailbox management, configuration options, and address
    books.</p>"
