abstract:
- content: "<p>In case a webserver gets defaced a black hat might change vital information
    with massive danger for the normal surfer. If for example a banking web portal
    site containing a link to the online banking login screen gets changed pointing
    to the black hats identical mirror of the login screen (as happend here some times
    already) he will get his hands on real banking accounts. The encryption via SSL
    of already defaced data will be no solution at all. SSL is only a counterpart
    in this scenario to ensure the connected web server is the right one and to dis-
    able data sniffing on the wire. The solution to this case might be signing all
    HTTP-accessable con- tent including static and dynamic HTML pages. This solution
    even keeps an eye on dynamic portal content, as most starting pages now have dynamic
    content on it, starting from the current time to brokerage news. Best solution
    would never the less be to have the critical data within static pages. We can
    sign any URL based content because the signature doesn't get into the content
    sent, but into the HTTP reply headers. So we don't modify any data. The HTTP reply
    doesn't need any change within the web- server source code but can most times
    be configured by standard configu- ration ways. Signing not only HTML but possibly
    any critical data is needed for example with a flash movie who display critical
    data like online broker- age data. This data might be forged by replacing a lying
    flash movie with possibly bad consequences to stock rates. One shouldn't underesti-
    mate the criminal energy in these cases.</p>"
