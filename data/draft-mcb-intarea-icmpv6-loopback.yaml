abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines ICMPv6 Loopback, which enables a two-way packet
    exchange that can be used for probing and for diagnostic purposes. ICMPv6 Loopback
    is similar to ICMPv6 Echo, except that after a Loopback Request is sent, its corresponding
    Reply includes as much of the IPv6 Loopback Request packet as possible, including
    the IPv6 header and IPv6 extension headers and options if they are present.</p>"
