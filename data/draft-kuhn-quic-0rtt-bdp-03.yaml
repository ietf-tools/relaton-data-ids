abstract:
- content: "<p>The time-to-service duration depends on both peers and the peer initiating
    the connection may not be the peer actually sending data. Moreover, clients may
    be resource-limited, behind a low bandwidth or a long-RTT network and may need
    adaptations to improve data transmission or reception. While each client and server
    can have its dedicated solution to store path parameters, having a standard way
    of exchanging this information helps in providing symmetrical control of the optimisation
    and reducing protocol ossification. QUIC may not be limited to HTTP3: it can be
    used as a substrate for proxying and tunneling. This memo discusses a solution
    where the client is informed about path parameters: both the client and the server
    can contribute to the reduction of the time-to-service for subsequent connections.
    This would improve symmetrical transmission of data and reduce ossification of
    the protocol. To improve the time-to-service of subsequent 0-RTT reconnection
    the server currently sets in the early_data extension the maximum volume of egress
    data the client is allowed to send when reconnecting. This memo proposes BDP_metadata,
    an additional extension, to also inform the client about path parameters.</p>"
