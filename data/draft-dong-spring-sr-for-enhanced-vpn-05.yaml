abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to enable it
    to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation from both control
    and data plane's perspective and have more stringent performance requirements
    than can be provided with overlay VPNs. The characteristics of an enhanced VPN
    as perceived by its tenant needs to be comparable to those of a dedicated private
    network. This requires tight integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay
    network topology and resources in a scalable manner. An enhanced VPN may form
    the underpinning of 5G network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right.
    This document describes how to use segment routing based mechanisms to provide
    the enhanced VPN service with the required network topology and resources. The
    overall mechanism of providing segment routing based enhanced VPN service is also
    described. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS
    data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
