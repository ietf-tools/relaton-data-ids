abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP Simple Management Protocol (CSMP) is purpose-built to provide
    lifecycle management for resource constrained IoT devices deployed within large-scale,
    bandwidth constrained IoT networks. CSMP offers an efficient transport and message
    encoding supporting classic NMS functions such as device on-boarding, device configuration,
    device status reporting, securing the network, etc. This document describes the
    design and operation of CSMP. This document does not represent an IETF consensus.</p>"
