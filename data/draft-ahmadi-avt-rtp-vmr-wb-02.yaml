abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a real-time transport protocol (RTP) payload
    format to be used for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec.
    The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing VMR-WB
    transport formats on non-IP networks. In addition, a file format is specified
    for transport of VMR-WB speech data in storage mode applications such as email.
    A MIME type registration is included, for VMR-WB, specifying use of both the RTP
    payload and the storage formats that has a number of operating modes, one of which
    is interoperable with AMR-WB (i.e., RFC 3267) audio codec at certain rates. Therefore,
    provisions have been made in this draft to facilitate and simplify data packet
    exchange between VMR-WB and AMR-WB in the interoperable mode with no transcoding
    function involved.</p>"
