abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 mobility [5] has many security requirements which can be roughly
    divided into security of signaling with common correspondent nodes [6] and security
    between the mobile node and its home agent. If IPsec [1] is not so usable in the
    first case it remains the solution of choice in the second. Unfortunately IPsec
    does not allow reasonable performance in some common situations. One of the main
    problems is the lack of integration with a modern network access service security
    like the one provided by AAA [7].</p>"
