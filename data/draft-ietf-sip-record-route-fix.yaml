abstract:
- content: <p>A typical function of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Proxy is to
    insert a Record-Route header into initial, dialog-creating requests in order to
    make subsequent, in-dialog requests pass through it. This header contains a SIP
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) or SIPS (secure SIP) URI indicating where and
    how the subsequent requests should be sent to reach the proxy. These SIP or SIPS
    URIs can contain IPv4 or IPv6 addresses and URI parameters that could influence
    the routing such as the transport parameter (for example, transport=tcp), or a
    compression indication like "comp=sigcomp". When a proxy has to change some of
    those parameters between its incoming and outgoing interfaces (multi-homed proxies,
    transport protocol switching, or IPv4 to IPv6 scenarios, etc.), the question arises
    on what should be put in Record-Route header(s). It is not possible to make one
    header have the characteristics of both interfaces at the same time. This document
    aims to clarify these scenarios and fix bugs already identified on this topic;
    it formally recommends the use of the double Record-Route technique as an alternative
    to the current RFC 3261 text, which describes only a Record-Route rewriting solution.
