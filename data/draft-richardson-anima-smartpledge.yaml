abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details the mechanism used for initial enrollment by
    a smartphone into a BRSKI based enrollment system. There are two key differences
    in assumption from [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]: that the intended
    registrar has Internet, and that the Pledge has no user-interface. This variation
    on BRSKI is intended to be used in the situation where the registrar device is
    new out of the box and is the intended gateway to the Internet (such as a home
    gateway), but has not yet been configured. This work is also intended as a transition
    to the Wi-Fi Alliance work on the Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP).</p>"
