abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the actors in a global Tier-1 ENUM System and
    the roles and responsibilities that each of the actors fulfills. In this context,
    a 'Tier-1 ENUM System' refers to a holistic system for registering E.164 telephone
    numbers in a DNS top-level domain. The population of NAPTR records with URI's
    in a Tier-2 ENUM System as described in RFC 2916 [4] is not discussed in this
    draft.</p>"
