abstract:
- content: <p>Pairing-based cryptography, a variant of elliptic curve cryptography,
    has received attention for its flexible and applicable functionality. Pairing
    is a special map defined over elliptic curves and it can be applied to construct
    several cryptographic protocols such as identity-based encryption, attribute-based
    encryption, and so on. At CRYPTO 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed an efficient
    number field sieve algorithm named exTNFS for the discrete logarithm problem in
    a finite field. Several types of pairing-friendly curves such as Barreto-Naehrig
    curves are affected by the attack. In particular, a Barreto-Naehrig curve with
    a 254-bit characteristic was adopted by a lot of cryptographic libraries as a
    parameter of 128-bit security, however, it ensures no more than a 100-bit security
    level due to the effect of the attack. In this memo, we summarize the adoption
    status of pairing-friendly curves in standards, libraries and applications, and
    classify them in 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit security levels. Then, from the
    viewpoints of "security" and "widely use", we select the recommended pairing-friendly
    curves considering exTNFS.</p>
