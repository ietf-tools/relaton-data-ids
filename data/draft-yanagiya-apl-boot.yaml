abstract:
- content: "<p>In [ID-yanagiya-eap-saa-00], [ID-ohba-mip6-boot-arch-dhcp-01], and
    [ID-yegin-eap-boot-rfc3118-01], it is assumed that a peer and service authenticator
    execute the authentication or authorization process with a key derived from EAP
    Keying materials. However, [EAP-Key-04] does not assume that a network element
    that does not support EAP, such as a DHCP server or Mobile IP home agent, uses
    the EAP key to authenticate/authorize the user. Thus, it is necessary to define
    a new security association and key for the application authenticator.</p>"
