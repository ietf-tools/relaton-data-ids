abstract:
- content: "<p>In any provider-based VPN scheme, the Provider Edge (PE) devices attached
    to a common VPN must exchange certain information as a prerequisite to establish
    VPN-specific connectivity. The main purpose of an auto-discovery mechanism is
    to enable a PE to dynamically discover the set of remote PEs having VPN members
    in common. The auto-discovery mechanism proceeds by having a PE advertises to
    other PEs, at a minimum, its own IP address and the list of VPN members configured
    on that PE. Once that information is received the remote PEs will then identify
    the list of VPN sites members of the same VPN, and use the information carried
    within the discovery mechanism to establish VPN connectivity. This draft defines
    a BGP based auto-discovery mechanism for Virtual Router-based layer-3 VPNs. This
    mechanism is based on the approach used by BGP/MPLS-IP-VPN for distributing VPN
    routing information within the service provider(s).</p>"
