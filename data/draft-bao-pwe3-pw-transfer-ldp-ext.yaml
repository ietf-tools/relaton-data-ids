abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to LDP signaling that enables the
    PW ownership transfer between the Management Plane and the Control Plane. This
    document defines all PW transfer related procedures. This includes the handling
    of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state. A basic premise
    of the extension is that the transfer procedures must never impact an already
    established Data plane connection.</p>"
