abstract:
- content: "<p>With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber security and data
    protection are of increasing importance. This is especially the case regarding
    cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with the physical world.
    Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to financial and physical damage
    and endanger human lives and well- being. Thus, hard security and privacy requirements
    are necessary to be met. Furthermore, a thorough investigation of incidents is
    essential for ultimate protection. Computing in the Network (COIN) allows the
    processing of traffic and data directly in the network and at line-rate. Thus,
    COIN presents a promising solution for efficiently providing security and privacy
    mechanisms as well as network monitoring. This document discusses select mechanisms
    to demonstrate how COIN concepts can be applied to counter existing shortcomings
    of cyber security and data privacy.</p>"
