abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the historical and background information behind
    the removal of the "on-link assumption" from the conceptual host sending algorithm
    defined in Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6). According to the algorithm
    as originally described, when a host's default router list is empty, the host
    assumes that all destinations are on-link. This is particularly problematic with
    IPv6-capable nodes that do not have off-link IPv6 connectivity (e.g., no default
    router). This document describes how making this assumption causes problems and
    how these problems outweigh the benefits of this part of the conceptual sending
    algorithm. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
