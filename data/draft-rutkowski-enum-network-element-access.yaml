abstract:
- content: "<p>ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefit of private
    users of the Internet. It makes use of authoritative E.164 telephone number data
    maintained among public telecommunication service providers to enable some useful
    value added messaging services on the Internet. Anyone can (and several companies
    do) provide these ENUM services competitively today without government involvement
    or regulation. Other providers can enter the marketplace. Although one ENUM provisioning
    option is to denominate a particular Internet offering worldwide as 'public' and
    'authoritative,' there are significant technical, operational, and regulatory
    burdens and costs created that make the prospect rather daunting at best. It is
    also unnecessary. A more effective alternative is to facilitate ENUM service providers'
    access to authoritative E.164 number and customer information through fair and
    non-discriminatory contractual arrangements with public telecommunication service
    providers, and leave the rest to a competitive ENUM provider marketplace and the
    commercial relationships between Internet Service Providers and public telecommunication
    carriers.</p>"
