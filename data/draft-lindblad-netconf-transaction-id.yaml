abstract:
- content: "<p>NETCONF clients and servers often need to have a synchronized view
    of the server's configuration data stores. The volume of configuration data in
    a server may be very large, while data store changes typically are small when
    observed at typical client resynchronization intervals. Rereading the entire data
    store and analyzing the response for changes is an inefficient mechanism for synchronization.
    This document specifies an extension to NETCONF that allows clients and servers
    to keep synchronized with a much smaller data exchange and without any need for
    servers to store information about the clients.</p>"
