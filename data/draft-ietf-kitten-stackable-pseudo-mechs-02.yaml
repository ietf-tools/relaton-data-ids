abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable pseudo-
    mechanisms, and associated concept of composite mechanisms, for the Generic Security
    Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API), as well as several utility
    functions. Stackable GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition of new
    mechanisms that combine features from multiple mechanisms. Stackable mechanisms
    that add support for Perfect Forward Security (PFS), data compression, additional
    authentication factors, etc... are facilitated by this document.</p>"
