abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the applicability of Remote Direct Memory Access
    Protocol (RDMAP) and the Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP). It compares and
    contrasts the different transport options over IP that DDP can use, provides guidance
    to ULP developers on choosing between available transports and/or how to be indifferent
    to the specific transport layer used, compares use of DDP with direct use of the
    supporting transports, and compares DDP over IP transports with non-IP transports
    that support RDMA functionality. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
