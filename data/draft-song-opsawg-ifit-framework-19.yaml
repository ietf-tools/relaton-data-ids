abstract:
- content: "<p>As network scale increases and network operation becomes more sophisticated,
    existing Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) methods are no longer
    sufficient to meet the monitoring and measurement requirements. Emerging data-plane
    on-path telemetry techniques, such as IOAM and AltMrk, which provide high-precision
    flow insight and issue notifications in real time can supplement existing proactive
    and reactive methods that run in active and passive modes. They enable quality
    of experience for users and applications, and identification of network faults
    and deficiencies. This document describes a reference framework, named as In-situ
    Flow Information Telemetry, for the on-path telemetry techniques. The high-level
    framework outlines the system architecture for applying the on-path telemetry
    techniques to collect and correlate performance measurement information from the
    network. It identifies the components that coordinate existing protocol tools
    and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses deployment challenges for flow-oriented
    on- path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier networks. The document is
    a guide for system designers applying the referenced techniques. It is also intended
    to motivate further work to enhance the OAM ecosystem.</p>"
