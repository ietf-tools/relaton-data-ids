abstract:
- content: <p>The FTP protocol [1] needs two connections. A control and a data connection.
    Using networks with "port forwarding" (eg. SSH, DSL routers, VPN etc.) there is
    often only the possibility for the server to listen on only one TCP port. In such
    networks the traditional FTP protocol cannot be used. This memo describes an extension
    to the FTP protocol that allows the use of FTP using only one TCP port number
    for both control connections and passive-mode data connections. The extension
    can also be used to use the FTP protocol over network protocols that do not have
    a "port" concept (such as the NetBIOS protocol).</p>
