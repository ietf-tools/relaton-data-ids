abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a base YANG Data model for the management of
    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols that use connectionless
    communications. The data model is defined using the YANG data modeling language,
    as specified in RFC 7950. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of
    key OAM constructs for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication. The
    base model presented here can be extended to include technology-specific details.
    There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between
    OAM protocols. Second, it supports both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing
    OAM functions at the same level or different levels through a unified interface)
    as well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at the same
    level through a unified interface).</p>"
