abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an information model of information needed by
    the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched optical
    networks (WSONs). The purpose of information described in this model is to facilitate
    constrained lightpath computation in WSONs. In particular in cases where there
    are no or a limited number of wavelength converters available in the WSON. This
    model currently does not include optical impairments.</p>"
