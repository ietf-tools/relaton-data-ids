abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate over
    QUIC Encryption). MASQUE is a mechanism that allows co-locating and obfuscating
    networking applications behind an HTTPS web server. The currently prevalent use-case
    is to allow running a proxy or VPN server that is indistinguishable from an HTTPS
    server to any unauthenticated observer. We do not expect major providers and CDNs
    to deploy this behind their main TLS certificate, as they are not willing to take
    the risk of getting blocked, as shown when domain fronting was blocked. An expected
    use would be for individuals to enable this behind their personal websites via
    easy to configure open-source software. This document is a straw-man proposal.
    It does not contain enough details to implement the protocol, and is currently
    intended to spark discussions on the approach it is taking. Discussion of this
    work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org [1]
    or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts
    [2].</p>"
