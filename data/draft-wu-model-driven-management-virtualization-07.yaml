abstract:
- content: "<p>Data models for service and network management provides a programmatic
    approach for representing (virtual) services or networks and deriving (1) configuration
    information that will be communicated to network and service components that are
    used to build and deliver the service and (2) state information that will be monitored
    and tracked. Indeed, data models can be used during various phases of the service
    and network management life cycle, such as service instantiation, service provisioning,
    optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic. Also, data models are instrumental in
    the automation of network management. They also provide closed-loop control for
    the sake of adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance.
    This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an architecture
    for service and network management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling
    technologies. This framework is drawn from a network provider perspective irrespective
    of the origin of a data module; it can accommodate even modules that are developed
    outside the IETF. The document aims to exemplify an approach that specifies the
    journey from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific actions.</p>"
