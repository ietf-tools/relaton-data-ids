abstract:
- content: "<p>The Calendaring Interoperability Protocol (CIP) provides a standard
    mechanism for exchanging events and other information between scheduling systems.
    This allows users to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter what scheduling
    software they use. CIP is one of three standards under development by the Calendaring
    and Scheduling Working Group of the IETF. The other two are the Core Object Specification
    (COS), a standard data format for representing scheduled events, and the Calendaring
    Access Protocol (CAP), a standard mechanism that scheduling user agents may use
    to access user calendars (analogous to POP).</p>"
