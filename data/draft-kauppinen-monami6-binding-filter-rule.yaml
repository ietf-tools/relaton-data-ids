abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile nodes using more than one interface for communicating with other
    nodes in the network need a mechanism that controls how these interfaces are used.
    One way of controlling the interface usage is to define rules that map flows to
    network interfaces. These rules can also be called filter rules that are bound
    to Filter Interface Identifiers. This document describes a mechanism to associate
    Filter Interface Identifiers with the current location information of a mobile
    node in case when the mobility protocol used by the mobile node is Mobile IPv6.</p>"
