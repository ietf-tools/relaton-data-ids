abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Yang data model for Network Inventory location,
    e.g. site, room, rack, geo-location data, which is used to provide location information
    with different granularities for network inventory items (such as Network Elements,
    device components). Accurate location information is useful for network planning,
    deployment, and maintenance. However, such information cannot be obtained or verified
    from Network Elements and therefore is not included in the base Network Inventory
    model defined in draft-ietf- ivy-network-inventory-yang. The purpose of this document
    is to define a location model for network inventory that extends the base inventory
    with comprehensive location data.</p>"
