abstract:
- content: <p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) being specified jointly by IETF
    and ITU-T includes requirements documents and framework documents. The framework
    documents define the basic architecture that is needed in order to support various
    aspects of the required behavior. This document addresses the functionality described
    in the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document and defines a protocol that may
    be used to fulfill the function of the Protection State Coordination for linear
    protection, as described in that document. This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
    Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
    Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. Status
    of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with
    the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts are working documents of
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.
    Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet- Drafts.
    Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may
    be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate
    to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work
    in progress." The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt.
