abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for group key management for multicast
    security, motivated by three main considerations, namely the multicast application,
    scalability and trust-relationships among entities. It introduces two planes corresponding
    to the network entities and functions important to multicasting and to security.
    The key management plane consists of two hierarchy-levels in the form of a single
    'trunk region' (inter-region) and one or more 'leaf regions' (intra-region). The
    advantages of the framework among others are that it is scalable, it has reduced
    complexity and allows the independence in regions of group key management.</p>"
