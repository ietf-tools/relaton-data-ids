abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the addition of three new attributes that are
    used by servers to support POSIX ACLs. The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL component
    of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e draft 17 [IEEE] document
    for which sponsorship was withdrawn in January 1998. Although the draft POSIX
    standard that describes these ACLs was never ratified, several POSIX based operating
    systems, such as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include support for them. The NFS
    Version 4 ACLs described in [RFC8881] henseforth referred to as NFSv4 ACLs, use
    a different model and attempts to map between the ACLs of these two models has
    not been completely successful. As such, this document proposes three new attributes
    that may optionally be used by an NFSv4.2 server to support ACLs that conform
    the afor mentioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.</p>"
