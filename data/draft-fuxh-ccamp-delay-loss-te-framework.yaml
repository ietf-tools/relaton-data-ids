abstract:
- content: <p>Latency and packet loss is such requirement that must be achieved according
    to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) / Network Performance Objective (NPO) between
    customers and service providers. Latency and packet loss can be associated with
    different service level. The user may select a private line provider based on
    the ability to meet a latency and loss SLA. The key driver for latency and loss
    is stock/commodity trading applications that use data base mirroring. A few milli
    seconds and packet loss can impact a transaction. Financial or trading companies
    are very focused on end-to-end private pipe line latency optimizations that improve
    things 2-3 ms. Latency/loss and associated SLA is one of the key parameters that
    these "high value" customers use to select a private pipe line provider. Other
    key applications like video gaming, conferencing and storage area networks require
    stringent latency, loss and bandwidth. This document describes requirements to
    communicate latency and packet loss as a traffic engineering performance metric
    in today's network which is consisting of potentially multiple layers of packet
    transport network and optical transport network in order to meet the latency/loss
    SLA between service provider and his customers.</p>
