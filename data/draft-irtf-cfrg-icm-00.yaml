abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Integer Counter Mode (ICM), a mode of operation
    of a block cipher which defines an indexed keystream generator (which generates
    a keystream segment given an index). This mode is efficient, parallelizable, and
    has been proven secure given realistic assumptions about the block cipher. Test
    vectors are provided for AES. Counter Mode admits many variations. The variant
    specified in this document is secure and flexible, yet it enables a single implementation
    of a keystream generator to suffice in different application domains.</p>"
