abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast Tunnels are built between Provider Edge (PE) routers to allow
    multicast communication between different site's of a VPN. The MT tunnel has a
    destination MDT group address that is unique to the VPN. All routers that act
    as PE's and are configured for a specific VPN join the VPN MDT multicast group
    in the backbone of the provider network to be able to receive each others packets.
    Each router is also a sender to the MDT group. How the forwarding of the MDT packets
    is achieved is depending on the PIM mode of the MDT group. This can be either
    PIM-Bidir, PIM-SM or PIM SSM. The proposal in this document is related specifically
    to PIM SSM mode.</p>"
