abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet
    of Things. It was created as a common language for use in the development of the
    One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions. Tools convert this format
    to database formats and other serializations as needed. The SDF format is mainly
    intended for interchange between machine generation and machine processing. However,
    there is often a need for humans to look at and edit SDF models. Similar to the
    way Relax-NG as defined in ISO/IEC 19757-2 has an XML format and a compact format
    (Annex C), this specification defines a compact format to go along SDF's JSON
    format. The present version of this document is mostly a proof of concept, but
    was deemed useful to obtain initial feedback on the approach taken.</p>"
