abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the LLIDL interface description language, the
    related LLSD abstract type system and three serialization formats for LLIDL messages.
    LLIDL (pronounced "little") is a language-neutral facility for describing transport
    independent message flows for RESTful resource access. LLIDL itself is an abstract
    meta-grammar for producing and recognizing valid request / response messages affecting
    state change in application layer objects by way of RESTful resource access. It
    may be used by protocol developers and system deployers to describe the composition
    of application layer protocol exchanges without adopting transport specific message
    semantics or programming language specific type semantics. The type behavior of
    individual message elements is described by the LLSD abstract type system. Abstract
    LLIDL messages are concretized using one of three defined LLSD serialization schemes.
    Serialization / deserialization rules are provided in this document for XML, JSON
    and Binary schemes. This abstract messaging and type system is intended to be
    used by other specifications to describe application layer protocol exchanges,
    independent of implementation language or message transport protocol.</p>
