abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from the router
    to the host is defined to protect Neighbor Discovery(ND) signaling between the
    router and the host. The host sends a Router Solicitation(RS) message with ND
    Shared Key Request Option to the router. The router encrypts a ND shared key using
    the host's SEcure Neighbor Discovery(SEND) public key and sends it back to the
    host through a Router Advertisement(RA) message. The host decrypts the ND shared
    key using the matching private key. The Neighbor Discovery shared key is then
    used for protecting the following Neighbor Discovery signaling between the router
    and the host. The Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement message exchanges
    are required to have SEND security.</p>"
