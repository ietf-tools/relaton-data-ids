abstract:
- content: "<p>In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue may
    occur when pseudo-nickname mechanism in [RFC7781] is used. This draft describes
    a solution to resolve the RPF check failure issue through centralized replication.
    All ingress RBridges send BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast and Mutlicast) traffic
    to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation. When the centralized node
    receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets and forwards them to all
    destination RBridges using a distribution tree established as per TRILL base protocol[RFC6325].
    To avoid RPF check failure on a RBridge sitting between the ingress RBridge and
    the centralized replication node, some change of RPF calculation algorithm is
    required. RPF calculation on each RBridge should use the centralized node as ingress
    RB instead of the real ingress RBridge which is denoted as RBv in [RFC7781] to
    perform the calculation.</p>"
