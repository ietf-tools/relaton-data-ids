abstract:
- content: "<p>We are considering the IETF Mobile IP WG proposed Low Latency Handoff
    draft[2] in the different network scenerios and suggesting one simpler solution
    with low loss, reduced number of timers, reduced network overhead, along with
    the low latency. One more achievement will be reduction in the dependency on exact
    L2 trigger timing and Pre-Registration timer expiration in Combined Handoff method[2].</p>"
