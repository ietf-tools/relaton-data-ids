abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP extends the plain, singlepath limited, TCP towards the
    capability of multipath transmission. This greatly improves the reliability and
    performance of TCP communication. For backwards compatiblity reason the Multipath
    TCP was designed to setup successfully an inital path first, after which subsequent
    paths can be added for multipath transmission. For that reason the Multipath TCP
    has the same limitations as the plain TCP during connection setup, in case the
    selected path is not functional. RobE provides the ability to simultaneously use
    multiple paths for connection setup. This document presents with RobE a set of
    extensions to Multipath TCP to overcome its singlepath limitation during connection
    initialisation and extends it to a full fledged multipath protocol. RobE ensures
    connecitivity if at least one functional path out of a bunch of paths is given
    and offers beside that the opportunity to significantly improve loading times
    of Internet services.</p>"
