abstract:
- content: "<p>In Mobile IPv6 environment, TCP connections between MN (mobile node)
    and CN (correspondent node) suffer a significant degradation in performance in
    the form of poor throughput and very high interactive delays during handoff. This
    note describes an optional modification of TCP's congestion control mechanism
    for performance enhancement by using Binding Update messages to invoke TCP's congestion
    control processing. This modification is applied to TCP of CN side, and no additional
    processing requirement is added to MN to save MN's power.</p>"
