abstract:
- content: '<p>TBD: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple transports
    running both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. In more and more cases, a SIP user
    agent (UA) is connected to network interfaces with multiple address families.
    In these cases sending a message from a dual stack client to a dual stack server
    may suffer from the issues described in [RFC6555] ("Happy Eyeballs"): the UA attempts
    to send the message using IPv6, but IPv6 connectivity is not working to the server.
    This can cause significant delays in the process of sending the message to the
    server. This negatively affects the user''s experience. TBD: This document builds
    on [RFC6555] by modifying the procedures specified in [RFC3263] and related specifications
    to require that a client ensure that communication targets are accessible before
    sending messages to them, to allow a client to contact targets out of the order
    required by other specifications, and to require a client to properly distribute
    the message load among targets over time.</p>'
