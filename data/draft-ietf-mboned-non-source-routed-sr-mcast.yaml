abstract:
- content: "<p>With Segment Routing (SR) architecture, a unicast flow can be source-
    routed through an SR network following an explicit path specified in the packet,
    w/o the need for per-flow state in the network. As a result, the otherwise needed
    protocols to signal the per-flow unicast state can also be removed from the network.
    In the case of multicast, traffic can be either source-routed or non-source-routed,
    and this document discusses non-sourced-routed options for multicast in an SR
    network with either MPLS or IPv6/SRv6 data plane.</p>"
