abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access
    Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] is becoming increasingly popular for distributed and web-based
    services. Since most LDAP-based applications have developed their schemas independently,
    new application designers find themselves faced with the dilemma of how to interoperate
    with an already conflicting set of existing LDAP specifications. Today's Web-aware
    customers expect interoperability, so it is crucial to converge existing schema
    in a way that supports interoperability across arbitrary applications and vendors.
    In this spirit, we describe an LDAP schema for internet mail routing and delivery
    that is designed to be modular and to support a common core for sharing user state
    across an arbitrary set of applications.</p>"
