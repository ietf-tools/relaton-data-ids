abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines two URI schemes. The first, 'duri' (standing for
    "dated URI"), identifies a resource as of a particular time. This allows explicit
    reference to the "time of retrieval", similar to the way in which bibliographic
    references containing URIs are often written. The second scheme, 'tdb' ( standing
    for "Thing Described By"), provides a way of minting URIs for anything that can
    be described, by the means of identifying a description as of a particular time.
    These schemes were posited as "thought experiments", and therefore this document
    is designated as Experimental.</p>
