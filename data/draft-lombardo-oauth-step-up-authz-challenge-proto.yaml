abstract:
- content: "<p>It is not uncommon for resource servers to require additional information
    like details of delegation authorization, or assurance proof of the delegation
    of authorization mechanism used according to the characteristics of a request.
    This document introduces a mechanism that resource servers can use to signal to
    a client that the data and metadata associated with the access token of the current
    request does not meet its authorization requirements and, further, how to meet
    them. This document also codifies a taxonomy to guide the client into starting
    a new request towards the authorization server in order to get issued, if applicable,
    a new set of tokens matching the requirements.</p>"
