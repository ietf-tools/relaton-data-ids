abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple state machine for stateful network
    devices on a path between two endpoints to associate state with traffic traversing
    them on a per-flow basis, as well as abstract signaling mechanisms for driving
    the state machine. This state machine is intended to replace the de-facto use
    of the TCP state machine or incomplete forms thereof by stateful network devices
    in a transport-independent way, while still allowing for fast state timeout of
    non-established or undesirable flows.</p>"
