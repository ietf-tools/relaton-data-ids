abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to
    control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These
    include support for requesting TDM connections including SONET/SDH and Optical
    Transport Networks (OTNs). This document concentrates on the routing requirements
    on the GMPLS suite of protocols to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).</p>"
