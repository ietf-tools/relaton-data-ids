abstract:
- content: "<p>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the
    Internet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and destinations.
    However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or characteristics to a given
    resource identifier and subsequently assessing those attributes or characteristics
    has not been specified and deployed. A particularly important resolution service
    of this general type is one which, when given a mail address identifying a particular
    mail recipient, will return a series of attributes describing the capabilities
    of that recipient. This differs from a directory service in that no searching
    or other advanced query operations are involved. Two tasks are envisioned. The
    first task will be to define a general resolution protocol that will translate
    resource identifiers to a list of attributes. The second task will be to define
    an administrative model and update protocol that can be used to set up and maintain
    the information the resolution protocol accesses. This document defines the requirements
    for these two protocols.</p>"
