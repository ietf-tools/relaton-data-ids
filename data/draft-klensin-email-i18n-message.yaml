abstract:
- content: "<p>Efforts to design an internationalization model for electronic mail
    frequently encounter situations in which an internationalized message -- perhaps
    one containing some headers with characters coded in UTF-8 -- must be converted
    and transported over a traditional, 7-bit infrastructure. This document provides
    a specification, building on the design of message/rfc822, for encapsulating messages
    with internationalized headers and/or body part content types. This specification
    is one of a group intended to provide a modified and extended email environment
    for fully internationalized email. If approved, it is expected to update the discussion
    of 'message/' content types in RFC 2046.</p>"
