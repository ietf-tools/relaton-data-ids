abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a Session Based Security Model (SBSM) for use
    within version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3). The security
    model is designed to establish a "session" between two interacting SNMPv3 entities,
    over which SNMP operations can be sent securely. It provides a number of security
    properties not previously available in defined SNMPv3 security models, such as
    public key based identity authentication, limited life-time keying, and the ability
    to make use of previously implemented and deployed security infrastructures for
    purposes of identification and authentication.</p>
