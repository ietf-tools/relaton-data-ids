abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes local interchange routines to support Direct Data
    Placement shim layers. This includes memory authorization, memory boundary assignment,
    logical to physical address translation, cumulative TSN pooling per association,
    and Payload Protocol Identifiers with Stream binding. These functions may implement
    data vectoring as DMA bus master for a network interface card working above an
    SCTP transport layer.</p>"
