abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a MIME Content-Type and for holding arbitrary item
    information. The definition is independent of any particular item type or application.
    The application/properties Content-Type is defined for holding a variety of basic
    textual property information to describe the item, for example a directory item
    could contain name, and email address. The application/properties Content-Type
    can also be used as the root body part in a multipart/related Content-Type for
    handling more complicated situations in which non-textual information, for example
    an image or sound, must be represented. The application/properties Content-Type
    defines a general framework and format for holding directory information in a
    'name, datatype: value' format. This document also defines the procedure by which
    particular formats for carrying the application-specific information within an
    application/properties Content-Type may be defined and registered, and the conventions
    such formats must follow. It is expected that other documents will be produced
    that define such formats for various application item types (e.g. white pages,
    appointments).</p>"
