abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the following
    two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link to identify
    the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers on the link to consistently
    respond to such a query with minimal delay (Fast RA). Solving the link identification
    based strictly on RFC 2461 is difficult because of the flexibilities offered to
    routers in terms of prefixes advertised in a router advertisement (RA) message.
    Similarly, the random delay in responding to router solicitation messages imposed
    by RFC 2461 makes to it difficult to achieve fast RA. A known set of solutions
    to these two problems was identified and catalogued by the DNA design team. In
    this memo, an integrated solution is presented, based on a sub-set of the catalogued
    solutions. This integrated solution consolidates most of the advantages of all
    known solutions while addressing most of the disadvantages.</p>"
