abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposed a network-based mobility control scheme in wireless/mobile
    networks using the Locator-Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP). In the existing
    host-based mobility control, LISP Tunnel Router (TR) is implemented at mobile
    node. In the proposed scheme, each TR is implemented at the first-hop access router
    that mobile nodes are attached to in the wireless network. For network- based
    mobility control, we present the data delivery and handover control operations.
    It is expected that the proposed network-based scheme can reduce implementation
    overhead and handover latency of MN, compared to the existing host-based scheme.</p>"
