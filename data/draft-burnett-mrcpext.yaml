abstract:
- content: "<p>The Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) is an application level
    protocol to control media service resources like Speech Synthesizers, Recognizers,
    Signal Generators, Signal Detectors, Fax Servers etc. over a network. This document
    captures the extensions required to implement Voice Enrollment, Speaker Verification
    and Hotword recognition as well as to augment the recognizer functionality using
    MRCP. The extensions are largely orthogonal to existing features of MRCP and to
    each other, with an eye towards backwards compatibility with existing features
    and independence of the extensions from each other to simplify integration.</p>"
