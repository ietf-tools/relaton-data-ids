abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to convey information about media
    frames. The information is used for specific handling in functions such as error
    recovery and congestion handling. These functions can be critical to improve energy
    efficiency and network capacity in some (especially wireless) networks. Due to
    end-to-end encryption, MoQ relays are expected to extract the metadata required
    by these functions. This document aims to enable a level of wireless network support
    for MoQ that is equivalent to what is possible for RTP.</p>"
