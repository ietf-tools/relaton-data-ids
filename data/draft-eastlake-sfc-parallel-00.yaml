abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the processing of packets through
    a sequence of Service Functions (SFs) within an SFC domain by the addition of
    path information and metadata on entry to that domain, the use and modification
    of that path information and metadata to step the packet through a sequence of
    SFs, and the removal of that path information and metadata on exit from that domain.
    The IETF has standardized a method for SFC using the Network Service Header specified
    in RFC 8300. There are requirements for SFC to process packets through parallel
    sequences of service functions and to easily splice in additional service functions
    or splice service functions out of a service chain. This document provides use
    cases for these requirements and extensions to SFC to support them.</p>"
