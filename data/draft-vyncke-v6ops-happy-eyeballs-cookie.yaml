abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP servers usually save session states in their persistent storage
    indexed by session cookies generated by the HTTP servers. It is up to the HTTP
    user-agent to send this session cookie on each HTTP request. Some HTTP servers
    check whether the cookie is associated with the HTTP user-agent by the means of
    the user-agent IP address. Everything linking a state to an IP address (such as
    OAuth access code) to an IP address has the same issue. If the Happy Eyeball mechanism
    is used to select between IPv6 and IPv4, it may happen that while using the same
    HTTP server, some HTTP requests are done over IPv6 and the others over IPv4, which
    leads to two different sets of session states in the HTTP server. This has the
    consequence of inconsistencies at the HTTP server. The only purpose of this document
    is to document this issue in more details than in section 8.2 of RFC 6883 including
    security considerations and mitigations. A similar problem arises with the use
    of non RFC 6888 compliant Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) devices used to access an IPv4-only
    HTTP server or HTTP user-agent using multi-homing.</p>"
