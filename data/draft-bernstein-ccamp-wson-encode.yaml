abstract:
- content: <p>A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain key
    information elements are made available to facilitate path computation and the
    establishment of label switching paths (LSPs). The information model described
    in "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information for Wavelength Switched Optical
    Networks" shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON. The
    information may be used in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling
    protocols, and may be distributed by GMSPL routing protocols. Other distribution
    mechanisms (for example, XML-based protocols) may also be used. This document
    provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for the information elements necessary
    to operate a WSON. It is intended that protocol-specific documents will reference
    this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses. Conventions
    used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</p>
