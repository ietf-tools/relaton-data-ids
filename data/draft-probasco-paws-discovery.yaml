abstract:
- content: "<p>A white space master device needs to query a white space database and
    obtain information about available spectrum/channels prior to operation. White
    space databases which contain information about available spectrum/channels are
    associated with a regulatory domain and hence specific to a country or region.
    A white space master device needs to discover the relevant white space database(s)
    given its current location and the regulatory domain that it is operating in.
    The white space database discovery is the preliminary step that a white space
    master device has to perform.</p>"
