abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile networks may be divided into two main segments: the radio segment,
    and the wireline segment. This document highlights that the algorithms leading
    to pre-congestion notification (e.g. ECN marking) are usually significantly different
    for these two segments, and not defined or documented in general over the radio
    segment. It also explains that using ECN bits leads to having a unique signal
    for notifying a pre-congestion related to two separate segments with very different
    notification algorithms. Some consequences are questioned, as well as the potential
    benefits of being able to identify where the congestion comes from. This document
    finally discusses the possibility to take into account the radio conditions of
    the terminals when counting the volume of congestion over the radio segment.</p>"
