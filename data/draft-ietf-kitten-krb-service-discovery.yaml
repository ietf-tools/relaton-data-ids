abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes defines a new mechanism for discovering Kerberos
    services using DNS. This new mechanism extends the mechanism already defined in
    Kerberos V5 [RFC4120] and has four goals. First, reduce the number of DNS queries
    required to discover a Kerberos KDC. Second, provide DNS administrators more control
    over client behavior. Third, provide support for discovery of the MS- KKDCP transport.
    Fourth, define a discovery procedure for Kerberos password services.</p>"
