abstract:
- content: "<p>This document recommends that network implementors who have planned
    or deployed an OSI NSAP addressing plan, and who wish to deploy or transition
    to IP6, should redesign a native IP6 addressing plan to meet their needs. However,
    in the event that network implementors prefer to keep their OSI addressing plan
    intact, this document defines a mapping of OSI NSAP addresses into IP6 addresses.
    This mapping is restricted by the 16 byte size of IP6 addresses. This document
    also defines a mapping of IP6 addresses within the OSI address format, should
    this be required for any reason.</p>"
