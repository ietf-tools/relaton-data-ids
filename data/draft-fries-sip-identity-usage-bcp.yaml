abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case for RFC4474 (SIP Identity) for verifying
    a certificate that might not be publicly verifiable by traditional means. It provides
    a best current practice document for binding an identity to a certificate for
    the duration of a session. The certificate may then be used to bootstrap further
    security parameters, e.g., for securing media data. A discussion of possible enhancements
    is included in the appendix. Editors Note: The first version of this draft was
    discussed in the SIPPING WG. As the target of this draft is a BCP for current
    issues, the draft was updated and submitted to the SIP WG.</p>"
