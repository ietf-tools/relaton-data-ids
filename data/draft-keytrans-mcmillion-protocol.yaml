abstract:
- content: "<p>While there are several established protocols for end-to-end encryption,
    relatively little attention has been given to securely distributing the end-user
    public keys for such encryption. As a result, these protocols are often still
    vulnerable to eavesdropping by active attackers. Key Transparency is a protocol
    for distributing sensitive cryptographic information, such as public keys, in
    a way that reliably either prevents interference or detects that it occurred in
    a timely manner.</p>"
