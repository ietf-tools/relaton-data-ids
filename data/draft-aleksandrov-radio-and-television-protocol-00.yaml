abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the assignment is to emphasise on the necessity of available
    transport protocol for public broadcast of audio-video data in a packet switching
    network, in particular in Internet. A theoretic scheme of such protocol is suggested,
    conventionally called RTVP - Radio and Television Protocol. The spreading of information,
    that the teoretic protocol is trying to achieve, is general, i.e. independence
    in loading the supplying radio and television program server from the number of
    viewers has been sought. The purpose also is to achieve receiving quality which
    is independant from the number of viewers. The theoretical RTVP achieves these
    goals by implementing the radio transmitting idea in a packet switching network.</p>"
