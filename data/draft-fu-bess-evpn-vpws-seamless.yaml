abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a solution for migrating L2VPN virtual private
    wire service(VPWS) to Ethernet VPN Virtual Private wire service (EVPN-VPWS) over
    SRv6. The service provider may want to migrate L2VPN VPWS to EVPN-VPWS, and deploy
    EVPN-VPWS over SRv6 network. When co-existing of EVPN-VPWS over SRv6 network and
    a legacy L2VPN VPWS over MPLS/IP network, the next hop of the EVPN Ethernet-AD
    per EVI route is different from the nexthop of VPWS AD routes or the source of
    LDP-LM message of the legacy L2VPN VPWS. As a result, whether the pseudowire of
    the EVPN VPWS and legacy L2VPN VPWS is same cannot be identified by the next hop
    of the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route and VPWS AD routes or LDM messages. This
    document provides a solution to identify whether the pseudowire of EVPN VPWS is
    same with the pseudowire of L2VPN VPWS, which allows migrating VPWS to EVPN- VPWS
    under the same vpn instance but over different network.</p>"
