abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 specifies the Fragment Header, which is employed for the fragmentation
    and reassembly mechanisms. The Fragment Header contains an "Identification" field
    which, together with the IPv6 Source Address and the IPv6 Destination Address
    of a packet, identifies fragments that correspond to the same original datagram,
    such that they can be reassembled together by the receiving host. The only requirement
    for setting the "Identification" field is that the corresponding value must be
    different than that employed for any other fragmented packet sent recently with
    the same Source Address and Destination Address. Some implementations use a simple
    global counter for setting the Identification field, thus leading to predictable
    Identification values. This document analyzes the security implications of predictable
    Identification values, and provides implementation guidance for selecting the
    Identification field of the Fragment Header, such that the aforementioned security
    implications are mitigated.</p>
