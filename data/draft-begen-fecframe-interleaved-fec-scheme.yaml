abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) Scheme for the one-dimensional (1-D) interleaved parity code and its application
    to reliable delivery of media streams in the context of FEC Framework. The 1-D
    interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols
    are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows
    in addition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source
    flow. The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty
    packet losses at a cost of decent complexity. This document extends the FEC header
    defined in RFC 2733 and registers a new RTP payload format for the FEC that is
    generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulated
    in RTP. This new payload format is compatible with and used as a part of the DVB
    Application-layer FEC Specification.</p>"
