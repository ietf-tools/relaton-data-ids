abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification suggests two changes to the Host Identity Protocol
    (HIP) checksum calculation. Specifically, only the HIP header and payload fields
    would be included in the checksum calculation, and the CRC32c algorithm would
    be used to compute the checksum. The HIP version number would be incremented if
    these suggestions are accepted, to reflect a different checksum algorithm.</p>"
