abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol, called kx509, for using Kerberos
    tickets to acquire X.509 certificates. These certificates may be used for many
    of the same purposes as X.509 certificates acquired by other means, but if a Kerberos
    infrastructure already exists, then the overhead of using kx509 may be much less.
    While not standardized, this protocol is already in use at several large organizations,
    and certificates issued with this protocol are recognized by the International
    Grid Trust Federation. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
