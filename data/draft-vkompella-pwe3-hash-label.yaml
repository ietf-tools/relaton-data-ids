- content: "<p>V. Kompella Expires August 2008 [page 1] Internet-Draft Hashing on
    Pseudowires February 2008 This draft proposes a method to introduce granularity
    on the hashing of traffic running over pseudowires. Most forwarding engines are
    able to hash based on label stacks, so the approach here is to introduce additional
    labels that do not affect the handling of packets, but which identify a conversation,
    and can be hashed with granularity.</p>"
