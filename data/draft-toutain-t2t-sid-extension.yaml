abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming more pervasive
    with their rapid adoption, they are also becoming more complex in their architecture.
    Hence, a tool is required to generate prototype code based on the YANG models
    for constrained devices [RFC7228] to improve interoperability and increase the
    reusability of software components. A novel approach is introduced in this document
    to generate software prototypes (also called stubs) in the C language for the
    CORECONF protocol [I-D.ietf-core-comi] using YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG
    SID [I-D.ietf-core-sid]). These stubs greatly reduce the complexity of navigating
    the CORECONF structure by abstracting the corresponding YANG SIDs. This document
    elaborates on the procedure to generate YANG SIDs for a given YANG model of a
    system, which then generates C stubs using the tools developed by the authors
    with the help of an example (sensor.yang file).</p>"
