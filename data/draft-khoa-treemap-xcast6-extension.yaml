abstract:
- content: "<p>Xcast6 (Explicit Multi-unicast for IPv6) is a new multicast scheme
    that supports very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast6 sends data
    via optimal route without traffic redundancy when Xcast- aware routers exist;
    otherwise, data will be sent in daisy-chain form. In this document, we propose
    Xcast6 Treemap - an extension of Xcast6. Using Xcast6 Treemap, data can be branched
    not only at source but also at remote hosts, solving the limitation of daisy-chain
    connection. Xcast6 Treemap utilizes existing multicast infrastructure (Xcast-aware
    routers) to improve application performance and reduce traffic redundancy on network;
    also, it automatically switches to end-host multicast operation mode in the absence
    of Xcast-aware router. For widely deployment of Xcast6, routers must be upgraded
    gradually. This requires a long term strategy and Xcast6 Treemap is a good choice
    for incremental deployment.</p>"
