abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides methodology and framework for quantifying performance
    impact of monitoring of IP flows on a network device and export of this information
    to a collector. It identifies the rate at which the IP flows are created, expired
    and exported as the performance metric. The metric is only applicable to the devices
    compliant with the Architecture for IP Flow Information Export [RFC5470].</p>"
