abstract:
- content: "<p>Without a security solution, Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization function­
    ality exposes the involved nodes as well as other nodes in the Inter­ net to various
    security attacks. Recent work in the area has produced a number of proposals to
    solve these security issues. The proposals are, however, in many cases architecturally
    quite different from each other, and don't always describe more than a part of
    the solution. Due to the complexity of the problem, we feel that it is necessary
    to doc­ ument a higher level solution roadmap. We call this roadmap the 'Secu­
    rity Framework for Route Optimization'. It talks about the architec­ ture that
    a complete solution has, and the components that are needed. We also discuss factors
    affecting the need for various components and particular technical solutions for
    them.</p>"
