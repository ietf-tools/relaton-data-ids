abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP is an application-layer control protocol that can establish, modify,
    and terminate multimedia sessions. SIP makes use of elements called proxy servers
    to help route requests to and from the user's current location. Before a SIP request
    can be sent by a SIP client, an outbound SIP proxy (first hop proxy) has to be
    discovered to which the SIP request can be forwarded. This draft proposes a new
    method for discovering the address of first hop outbound SIP proxy server based
    on the use of anycast addressing and the SIP OPTIONS request. This new method
    can be used with either IPv4 or IPv6, however the description and examples given
    in this draft are for IPv6 only.</p>"
