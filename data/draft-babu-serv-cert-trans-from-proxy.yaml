abstract:
- content: "<p>Intercepting transparent proxies splice the client-Server connection
    into two connections: Client-Proxy connection, Proxy-server connection. On Client-Proxy
    connection, proxy sends it's certificate to the client. As client is generally
    (in such a scenario) pre-configured to accept proxy's certificate, client accepts
    and proceeds further with the connection. On Proxy-Server connection, server sends
    its certificate to the proxy. Proxy typically doesn't possess the information
    (like MX domain name in case of SMTP) required to validate the certificate. The
    certificate validation is at times very complex &amp; hence it is better to offload
    this reponsibility to the original client itself. This document addresses this
    issue by extending TLS to let proxy send server's certificate to the client for
    validation and suggests how client can indicate certificate validation result
    to the proxy.</p>"
