abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable
    router is required to advertise global MPLS labels or Segment IDs (SID ) for its
    attached prefixes by using link-state IGPs, e.g., IS- IS. One major challenge
    associated with such global MPLS label or SID advertisement mechanism is how to
    avoid a given global MPLS label or SID from being allocated by different routers
    to different prefixes. Although such global label or SID allocation collision
    problem can be addressed through manual allocation, it is error- prone and nonautomatic
    therefore may not be suitable in large-scale SR network environments. This document
    proposes an alternative approach for allocating and advertising global MPLS labels
    or SIDs via IS-IS so as to eliminate the potential risk of label allocation collision.</p>"
