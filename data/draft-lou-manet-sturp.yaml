abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an approach to updating topologies in typical MANET-like
    environments, relying on what is termed 'sloppy updates' in the remainder of this
    document. Key to the approach is that updates are only initiated if existing communication
    relations may be effect by non-synchronized topology information, otherwise using
    the topology information as it exists. This 'sloppy' nature of the approach reduces
    the needed updates and the associated communication for them, thus increases efficiency
    as well as performance from a user perspective. As such, STURP does not provide
    a complete routing protocol solution but is intended to extend existing routing
    protocols with this improved efficiency mechanism instead.</p>"
