abstract:
- content: "<p>The forwarding of packets in today's networks has long evolved beyond
    ensuring mere reachability of the receiving endpoint. Instead, other 'purposes'
    of communication, e.g., ensuring quality of service of delivery, ensuring protection
    against path failures through utilizing more than one, and others, are realized
    by many extensions to the original reachability purpose of IP routing. Semantic
    Routing defines an approach to realizing such extended purposes beyond reachability
    by instead making routing and forwarding decisions based, not only on the destination
    IP address, but on other information carried in an IP packet. The intent is to
    facilitate enhanced routing decisions based on this information in order to provide
    differentiated forwarding paths for specific packet flows. Software Defined Networking
    (SDN) places control of network elements (including all or some of their forwarding
    decisions) within external software components called controllers and orchestrators.
    This approach differs from conventional approaches that solely rely upon distributed
    routing protocols for the delivery of advanced connectivity services. By doing
    so, SDN aims to enable network elements to be simplified while still performing
    forwarding function. This document examines the applicability of SDN techniques
    to Semantic Routing and provides considerations for the development of Semantic
    Routing solutions in the context of SDN.</p>"
