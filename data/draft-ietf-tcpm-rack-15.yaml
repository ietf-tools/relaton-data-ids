abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP.
    RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamps and selective acknowledgments (SACKs)
    and has two parts. Recent Acknowledgment (RACK) starts fast recovery quickly using
    time-based inferences derived from acknowledgment (ACK) feedback, and Tail Loss
    Probe (TLP) leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to
    avoid retransmission timeout (RTO) events. Compared to the widely used duplicate
    acknowledgment (DupAck) threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses more efficiently
    when there are application-limited flights of data, lost retransmissions, or data
    packet reordering events. It is intended to be an alternative to the DupAck threshold
    approach.</p>"
