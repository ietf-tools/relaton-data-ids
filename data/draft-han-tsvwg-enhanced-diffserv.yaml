- content: "<p>There are real-time applications requiring deterministic services in
    terms of bandwidth and latency in various industries, such as network based AR/VR
    (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial internet. This document proposes
    a solution which enhances DiffServ in IPv6 to provide end to end bandwidth guaranteed
    service and latency guaranteed service.</p>"
