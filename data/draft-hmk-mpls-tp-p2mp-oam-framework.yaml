abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable
    carrier-grade packet transport. This document discusses and specifies the P2MP
    framework primarily related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP networks.
    This document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on the details
    that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs such as RFC5654, RFC5860,
    RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and draft-mpls- tp-p2mp-framework. Note: This I-D was
    made and updated including the discussions in ITU-T SG15, which were described
    in Liaison Statements such as (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/) This
    document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
    to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
