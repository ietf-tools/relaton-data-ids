abstract:
- content: <p>When setting up a label switched path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS and
    MPLS/TE networks, the completion of the signaling process does not necessarily
    mean that the cross connection along the LSP have been programmed accordingly
    and in a timely manner. Meanwhile, the completion of signaling process may be
    used by applications as indication that data path has become usable. The existence
    of this delay and the possible failure of cross connection programming, if not
    properly treated, will result in data loss or even application failure. Characterization
    of this performance can thus help designers to improve the application model and
    to build more robust applications. This document defines a series of performance
    metrics to evaluate the availability of data path in the signaling process. Status
