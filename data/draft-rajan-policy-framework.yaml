abstract:
- content: "<p>Many new protocols defined in the IETF have a regulatory component,
    i.e., network administrators have to decide what users, applications or hosts
    should have access to what resources/services under what conditions. Large-scale
    deployment of services using such protocols is critically dependent on the presence
    of a network-wide policy infrastructure that allows Internet Service Providers
    (ISPs)and corporate administrators to regulate the network rather than configure
    individual devices. A key component of this effort is to evolve standards-based
    means of representing and storing policy information in a unified manner, with
    a focus on schema for storing policy information in directories. This document
    presents concepts, terminology,a policy framework and requirements for such a
    definition.</p>"
