abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses a simple, effective, and straightforward method
    for using ingress traffic filtering to prohibit DoS (Denial of Service) attacks
    which use forged IP addresses to be propagated from 'behind' an Internet Service
    Provider's (ISP) aggregation point. This document specifies an Internet Best Current
    Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.</p>"
