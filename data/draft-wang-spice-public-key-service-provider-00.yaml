abstract:
- content: "<p>SPICE provides a selective disclosure mechanism of credentials from
    issuer. However, future network services may be built on the trust between multiple
    entities. Obtaining the public key of multiple issuers for a verifer from potential
    multiple sources can be complex. In this contribution, an optional public key
    service is proposed in SPICE architecture for the issue of obtaining the public
    keys of the issuers from multiple trusted entities. The basic function of public
    key service is proposed including public key registration, token verification,
    and a potential implementation such as the distributed ledger. We hope that the
    proposed contribution can be used as infomative for SPICE regarding to the token
    validation procedure.</p>"
