abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the set of requirements for Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) for the Transport Profile of MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in
    [MPLS-TP OAM Reqs], to evaluate whether existing OAM tools (either from the current
    MPLS toolset or from the ITU-T documents) can be applied to these requirements.
    Eventually, the purpose of the document is to recommend which of the existing
    tools should be extended and what new tools should be defined to support the set
    of OAM requirements for MPLS-TP. This document reports the conclusions of the
    MPLS-TP design team discussions concerning the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75.</p>"
