abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use TCP/IP as the transport protocol for
    V5. The migration from the current trunk 2048 kbps physical to an IP based transport
    will reduce the cost associated with dedicated trunk based link. Also, the current
    signaling End-to-End will be unchanged to make the transition seamless as possible.</p>"
