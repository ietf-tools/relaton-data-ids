abstract:
- content: <p>For maintaining DNSSEC Delegation Trust, DS records have to be kept
    up to date. [RFC7344] automates this by having the child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY
    records which hold the prospective DS parameters. Parent-side entities (e.g. Registries,
    Registrars) can use these records to update the delegation's DS records. A common
    method for detecting changes in CDS/CDNSKEY record sets is to query them periodically
    from the child zone ("polling"), as described in Section 6.1 of [RFC7344]. This
    document specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities MUST ensure that
    CDS/CDNSKEY record sets are equivalent across all of the child's authoritative
    nameservers, before taking any action based on these records.</p>
