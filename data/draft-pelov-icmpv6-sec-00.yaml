abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new ICMPv6 message type, ICMPv6-SEC, designed
    to convey cryptographically verifiable information using COSE objects and CBOR-encoded
    certificates. The purpose is to signal segment-specific network characteristics,
    including high RTT, congestion, policy constraints, and traffic treatment expectations.
    These messages can describe either the segment beyond the current hop (forward
    segment) or the local segment on which the source resides. Certificates may be
    embedded or referenced via DNS using cryptographic hashes. The mechanism is optimized
    for high-speed environments by allowing the use of static, signed descriptors
    for destination prefixes.</p>"
