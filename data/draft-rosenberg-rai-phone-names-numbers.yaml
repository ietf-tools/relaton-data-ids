abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is often used for the purposes
    of making and receiving Voice over IP (VoIP) calls, and in many of these cases
    one or both parties in the call is on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
    For this reason, phone numbers are often used as part of SIP calls. Despite numerous
    small specifications describing usage of phone numbers for SIP, there remains
    a great deal of interoperability problems and feature loss. This document tries
    to address this by providing a general framework for the usage of phone numbers
    and phone naming and numbering services with SIP.</p>"
