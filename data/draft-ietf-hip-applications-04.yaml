abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an informative overview of how legacy applications
    can be made to work with the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). HIP proposes to add
    a cryptographic name space for network stack names. From an application viewpoint,
    HIP-enabled systems support a new address family of host identifiers, but it may
    be a long time until such HIP-aware applications are widely deployed even if host
    systems are upgraded. This informational document discusses implementation and
    Application Programming Interface (API) issues relating to using HIP in situations
    in which the system is HIP-aware but the applications are not, and is intended
    to aid implementors and early adopters in thinking about and locally solving systems
    issues regarding the incremental deployment of HIP. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
