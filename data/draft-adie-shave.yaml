abstract:
- content: "<p>The usefulness of attribute/value pairs for conveying information is
    well established. There is a need for a standard text-based method of representing
    attribute/value data, which is capable of being easily written and read by humans,
    and also easily processed by a computer program. Often, such data is required
    to be transferred in electronic mail messages. This document describes how SGML
    (Standard Generalized Markup Language) can be used as the basis for such a representation.</p>"
