abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes requirements for a Remote Direct Memory Access
    (RDMA) Protocol to run on TCP and SCTP transport protocols. An RDMA protocol provides
    a general facility for extremely high efficiency (low CPU cost per unit of data
    transferred), end-to-end data transfer. An RDMA protocol enables high efficiency
    data transfer by allowing network interfaces with hardware support for the RDMA
    protocol to perform zero-copy data transfer directly among application buffers.</p>"
