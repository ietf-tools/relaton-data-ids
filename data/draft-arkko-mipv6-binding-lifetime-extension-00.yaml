abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 return routability mechanisms require home and care-of
    address keygen tokens to be used to authorize a binding update to correspondent
    nodes. The current rules dictate that such authorization be performed every seven
    minutes, using tokens at most three and half minutes old. This requirement results
    in an average signaling traffic of around 7 bits per second when the hosts are
    not moving around. This traffic load by itself is neglible, but can be problematic
    for hosts in standby mode. We present a secure and lightweight extension of return
    routability that can reduce this signaling load to around 0.1 bits per second,
    and require hosts to wake up much less frequently.</p>"
