abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows network traffic to distribute
    among multiple mobility anchors which have mobility functions to solve the existing
    problems in current centralized mobility protocols. There are many DMM approaches
    extending network- based mobility protocols (e.g. Proxy Mobile IPv6). In Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213], they allow a mobile node to connect to PMIPv6
    domain through different physical interfaces. In this reason, flow mobility that
    enables movement between physical interfaces of mobile node is proposed. In this
    document, we present some use cases to support flow mobility in DMM domain and
    analyze some problems. These use cases are based on scenarios of flow mobility
    in PMIPv6. In these scenarios, a multi-interface mobile node connects to different
    distributed mobility access points and move specific flows from one interface
    to another. These use cases have common issues which will be analyzed in detail.</p>"
