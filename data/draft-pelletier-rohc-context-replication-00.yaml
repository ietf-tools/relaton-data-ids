abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines context replication, an alternative to the context
    initialization procedure found in ROHC (Robust Header Compression) [RFC-3095].
    Profiles defining support for context replication may use the mechanism described
    herein to establish a new context based on another already existing context. Context
    replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of the context establishment
    procedure, and may be especially useful for the compression of multiple short-lived
    flows that may be occurring simultaneously or near-simultaneously, such as for
    example short- lived TCP flows.</p>"
