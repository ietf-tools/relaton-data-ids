abstract:
- content: <p>This document deals with end-to-end cryptographically signed e-mail.
    It introduces a novel structure for signed e-mail that is designed to avoid creating
    any disturbance in legacy e-mail clients. This "invisible" signature structure
    removes disincentives for signing e-mail.</p>
