- content: "<p>The rapid growth of the Internet and the increasing number of Internet
    users have led to a wide deployment of network edge caching proxies. These systems
    have been very successful in accelerating Web content delivery and reducing the
    load on origin Web servers. However, the specific role of these network edge caching
    proxies as a gateway between Web users and content providers suggests utilizing
    them for intelligent services beyond simple caching.</p>"
