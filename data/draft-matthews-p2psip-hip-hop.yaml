abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines a P2PSIP architecture where the peer-to-peer
    (P2P) layer is separate from and lies below the SIP layer. We discuss the functions
    of the P2P layer in such an architecture, and focus in on the Distributed Transport
    function - the function that allows a peer to exchange messages with any other
    peer in the overlay, even in the presence of NATs. We list the features that the
    Distributed Transport function needs to provide, and observe that the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP) already provides a number of these features. We then propose extensions
    to HIP that allow it to provide the missing features. We discuss how a complete
    P2PSIP architecture can be built around HIP, and contrast this approach with other
    approaches for implementing a P2P layer. Two of the advantages of HIP approach
    are that (a) most existing applications can run in an overlay without needing
    any changes and (b) peer mobility and NAT traversal are handled in a way that
    is transparent to most applications.</p>"
