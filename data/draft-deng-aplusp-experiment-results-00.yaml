abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an implementation of A+P in the provider's IPv6-
    only network. It provides an overview of the implementation environment which
    consists of network elements and configurations, and the results of the application
    compatibility test to verify the feasibility of deploying A+P in the IPv6-only
    network and to assess the impacts on services and also the viability of A+P proposed
    approach. This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor of A+P.</p>"
