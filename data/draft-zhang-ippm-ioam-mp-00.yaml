abstract:
- content: "<p>Active measurements are typically used to collect the information of
    a specific path. However, when using active measurement mechanisms in a multi-path
    topology, the default forwarding behavior is to go through one path. So, it cannot
    collect the information of all the paths at one time. This document extends IOAM
    Trace Option with a multi-path flag to simplify multi-path IOAM active measurement,
    which can promote the information collection and topology restoration of a multi-path
    topology.</p>"
