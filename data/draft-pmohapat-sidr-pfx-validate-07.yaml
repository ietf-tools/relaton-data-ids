abstract:
- content: "<p>A BGP route associates an address prefix with a set of autonomous systems
    (AS) that identify the interdomain path the prefix has traversed in the form of
    BGP announcements. This set is represented as the AS_PATH attribute in BGP and
    starts with the AS that originated the prefix. To help reduce well-known threats
    against BGP including prefix mis-announcing and monkey-in-the-middle attacks,
    one of the security requirements is the ability to validate the origination AS
    of BGP routes. More specifically, one needs to validate that the AS number claiming
    to originate an address prefix (as derived from the AS_PATH attribute of the BGP
    route) is in fact authorized by the prefix holder to do so. This document describes
    a simple validation mechanism to partially satisfy this requirement.</p>"
