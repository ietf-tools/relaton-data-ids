abstract:
- content: <p>This draft describes a mechanism that provides fast reroute in an IP
    network through encapsulation to "not-via" addresses. A single level of encapsulation
    is used. The mechanism protects unicast, multicast and LDP traffic against link,
    router and shared risk group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.</p>
