abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-link transport can offer higher bandwidth and more robust connections.
    Because of a wide variety of emerged wireless access technologies, a mobile host
    can potentially have subscriptions and access more than one wireless network simultaneously.
    This document introduces example applications which use multiple links in a connection
    simultaneously and illustrates the advantages of multi-link transport. A problem
    with those applications is that the efficient multi-link transport needs much
    more knowledge about each link characteristics such as bandwidth, delay, reliability
    and robustness. This document defines the requirements for efficient and adaptive
    multi-link transport and also describes the link information that multi-stream
    senders can require.</p>"
