abstract:
- content: "<p>Floor control is a means to manage joint or exclusive access to shared
    resources in a (multiparty) conferencing environment. Thereby, floor control complements
    other functions -- such as conference and media session setup, conference policy
    manipulation, and media control -- that are realized by other protocols. This
    document defines the requirements for a floor control protocol for multiparty
    conferences in the context of an existing framework. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
