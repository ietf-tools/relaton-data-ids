abstract:
- content: "<p>If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs
    without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of these VLANs,
    it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other RBridges lightly loaded,
    which reduces the scalability of a RBridge network and undermines its performance.
    A new mechanism is designed in this document to support the adaptive VLAN assignment
    (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the forwarders' reporting of their
    usage of MAC tables and available bandwidth.</p>"
