abstract:
- content: <p>Constrained Devices as they are used in the "Internet of Things" need
    security. One important element of this security is that devices in the Internet
    of Things need to be able to decide which operations requested of them should
    be considered authorized, need to ascertain that the authorization to request
    the operation does apply to the actual requester, and need to ascertain that other
    devices they place requests on are the ones they intended. To transfer detailed
    authorization information from an authorization manager (such as an ACE-OAuth
    Authorization Server) to a device, a representation format is needed. This document
    provides a suggestion for such a format, the Authorization Information Format
    (AIF). AIF is defined both as a general structure that can be used for many different
    applications and as a specific refinement that describes REST resources and the
    permissions on them.</p>
