abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the many years since the introduction of the Internet Protocol,
    we have seen a number of transitions throughout the protocol stack, such as deploying
    a new protocol, or updating or replacing an existing protocol. Many protocols
    and technologies were not designed to enable smooth transition to alternatives
    or to easily deploy extensions; thus, some transitions, such as the introduction
    of IPv6, have been difficult. This document attempts to summarize some basic principles
    to enable future transitions, and it also summarizes what makes for a good transition
    plan.</p>"
