abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an analysis of the Host Density metric as currently
    used to guide registry allocations of IPv6 unicast address blocks. This document
    contrasts the address efficiency as currently adopted in the allocation of IPv4
    network addresses and that used by the IPv6 protocol. It is noted that for large
    allocations there are very significant variations in the target efficiency metric
    between the two approaches. The memo notes that the IPv6 address assignment efficiency
    metric would benefit from a detailed technical review, particularly relating to
    large scale deployments of public infrastructure.</p>"
