abstract:
- content: "<p>Tele-Media Address Resolution (TMAR) is a scheme for use with internet
    telephony. The scheme introduces a URL format and protocol that is simple and
    flexible yet powerful enough to meet most any telecommunication need. The URL
    takes the form of tmar://caller:password@host:port/path, where path may be written
    as a directory tree or in E.164 notation. The protocol allows for such features
    as customized call routing, call load balancing, and firewalls to be implemented
    within an internet telephony network. This internet-draft contains the requirements,
    examples, and recommendations for the implementation of this scheme.</p>"
