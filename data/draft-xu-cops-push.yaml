abstract:
- content: "<p>COPS (RFC 2748) was originally designed for pull mode operation. The
    message exchanges for pull mode are efficient and support a close relationship
    between the protocol operations and state associated with particular events detected
    at the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP). The operation of push mode, as defined
    in COPS-PR (RFC 3084), is more awkward. Push mode involves extra messaging between
    the PEP and the Policy Decision Point (PDP) if one again wants to associate state
    arising from specific events (this time detected at the PDP) with specific protocol
    operations. This memo proposes to modify RFC 2748 to make push mode operation
    more efficient. Comments are invited on whether there are issues with the proposed
    solution.</p>"
