abstract:
- content: "<p>Mailing Lists often make changes to a message before it is retransmitted.
    This invalidates DKIM signatures, causing a DMARC test on the RFC5322.From addres
    to fail. A DMARC-compliant mailing list is one which uses member alias addresses
    to identify the document as sent by a specific author via the mechanism of the
    list. An appropriate aliasing mechanism will not only prevent DMARC FAIL, but
    will also allow messages between members, will look natural to senders and recipients,
    and will allow list organization domains to advance to p=reject. This document
    describes an aliasing approach which meets these goals.</p>"
