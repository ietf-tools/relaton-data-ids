abstract:
- content: "<p>A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface
    for communication. Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static configuration
    and does not consider the path characteristics, which may affect the user experience.
    This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to measure the path characteristics
    fractional loss and RTT using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) messages.</p>"
