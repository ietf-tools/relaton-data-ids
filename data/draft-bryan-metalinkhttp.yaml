abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Metalink/HTTP: Mirrors and Cryptographic Hashes
    in HTTP header fields, a different way to get information that is usually contained
    in the Metalink XML-based download description format. Metalink/HTTP describes
    multiple download locations (mirrors), Peer-to-Peer, cryptographic hashes, digital
    signatures, and other information using existing standards for HTTP header fields.
    Metalink clients can use this information to make file transfers more robust and
    reliable. Normative requirements for Metalink/HTTP clients and servers are described
    here. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
