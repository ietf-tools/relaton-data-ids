abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to the Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols to enable
    a horizontally unified IoT architecture. The objective of such an architecture
    is to make resource objects securely accessible to applications across organizations
    and domains. Towards this goal, quite a few proposals have been made to build
    an application-layer based unified IoT platform on top of today's host-centric
    Internet. However, there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric nature
    of today's Internet and mostly information-centric nature of the IoT system. To
    address this mismatch the common set of protocols and network services offered
    by an information-centric network (ICN) architecture can be leveraged to realize
    ICN-IoT architectures. These ICN-IoT solutions leverages the salient features
    of ICN, and taking advantage of naming, security, mobility and efficient content
    and service delivery support. This draft summarizes general IoT demands, and covers
    the challenges and design to realize ICN-IoT frameworks based on ICN architecture.
    Beyond this, the goal of this draft is not to offer any specific ICN- IoT architectural
    proposals.</p>
