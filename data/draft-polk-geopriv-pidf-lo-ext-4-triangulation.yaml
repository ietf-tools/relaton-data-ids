abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a Presentity Agent (PA) provides a Location
    Information Server (LIS) with location specific measurement data it observes,
    for example - how many satellites are visible to a PA, and at what angle are each
    currently, to aid the LIS in determining geographically where the PA is. This
    is done within a Session Initiation Protocol subscription framework where the
    LIS subscribes to the PA for its measurement data. The LIS performs the location
    calculation, determining where the PA is.</p>"
