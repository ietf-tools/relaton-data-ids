abstract:
- content: "<p>Server Cache Synchronization Protocol SCSP [1], [2], [3], [4] is used
    to solve the generalized cache synchronization/cache -replication problem for
    distributed protocol entities. In a client-server paradigm, SCSP synchronizes
    caches (or a portion of the caches) of a set of server entities of a particular
    protocol which are bound to a Server Group. This document provided a security
    analysis of the current SCSP framework and identified potential threats to the
    protocol operation. Possible solutions to secure the SCSP from potential attacks
    are presented and discussed.</p>"
