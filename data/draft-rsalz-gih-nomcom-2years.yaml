abstract:
- content: "<p>Each year the NomCom process is actually two processes -- finding out
    anew how to be a NomCom and conduct its business, and then undertaking the work
    of the NomCom in selecting individuals to undertake the various roles for which
    the NomCom has responsibility. This applies to both the chair and to the voting
    volunteer members of the NomCom. The inclusion of the past chair into the NomCom
    as a non-voting member mitigates this to some extent, but the past chair is constrained
    as to the level of advice that can be offerred. This acts an impediment to making
    concrete changes for future incarnations of the Nomcom that would improve the
    overall Nomcom process. The NomCom process could benefit from greater levels of
    continuity from year-to-year to reduce the amount of time taken to by the new
    Nomcom to define its intended mode of operation and allow the operation each incarnation
    of the Nomcom with a greater level of consistency. This document changes the term
    of office for NomCom voting volunteers from one to two years. It also changes
    the term of office for the NomCom Chair from two to three.</p>"
