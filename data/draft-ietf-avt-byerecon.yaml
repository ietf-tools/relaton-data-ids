abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, a number of problems related to RTP scalability to large
    multicast groups have been identified. The main problem, congestion of RTCP packets
    due to near-simultaneous joins, has been resolved in previous work. In this document,
    we present some additional problems and describe the solutions. In particular,
    we discuss the problem of BYE floods and premature timeouts. To resolve the BYE
    flood problem, we propose a BYE reconsideration mechanism. To help alleviate prema-
    ture timeouts, we propose a reverse timer reconsideration algorithm. Both algorithms
    are simple, and require minimal state and computa- tion.</p>"
