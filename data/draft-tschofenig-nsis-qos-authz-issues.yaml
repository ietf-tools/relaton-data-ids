abstract:
- content: "<p>Various proposals for NSIS QoS NSLPs have been published recently.
    The design of a QoS NSLPs has to consider more than only exchanging QoS objects.
    Authorization has to be handled properly to make this protocol both useful and
    performant. Authorization in mobile environments, unfortunately, raises additional
    questions. This document provides an introduction to the topic.</p>"
