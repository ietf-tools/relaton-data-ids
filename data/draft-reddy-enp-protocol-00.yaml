abstract:
- content: "<p>As the complexity of distributed applications increases, an increasing
    amount of processing is done using distributed processes, which typically execute
    without the direct supervision of an end user. The user must poll these processes
    periodically to check if they are completed successfully or not. This polling
    results in unnecessary wastage of network bandwidth as well as computing resources.
    The user generally cannot see intermediate results or progress reports for long
    running processes, they must wait till the process is completely finished before
    viewing the results. Thus the problem of monitoring events is central in distributed
    applications and protocols. A repeated need in such applications is receive notifications
    when a resource property value changes or event state changes. Current database
    systems provides mechanisms like constraints, triggers and active database rules.
    These facilities provides an automated means to ensure the database integrity
    or perform specific action when data changes. Need for such kind of requirement
    is fundamental is network applications. Event Notification Protocol(ENP) abstracts
    the notification requirements from the applications. ENP provides a lean and mean
    protocol with a client side semantics for processing notifications. The goal of
    ENP is to provide a service which allows users to select resources or events for
    which they wish to be notified in case changes of property values or state values
    occur. The Event Notification Protocol will also allow users to define what events
    or state changes they are interested in. This document describes the Event Notification
    Protocol. The objective is to provide a simple, scalable and highly efficient
    notification protocol while also providing the appropriate flexibility to meet
    the needs of both the internet and enterprise enviro</p>"
