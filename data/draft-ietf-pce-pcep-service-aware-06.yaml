abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity
    trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency
    Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation
    along with other constraints and metrics. Latency, Latency Variation and Packet
    Loss is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and
    service providers. The Link Bandwidth Utilization (the total bandwidth of a link
    in current use for the forwarding) is also an important factor to consider during
    path computation. IGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric extensions describes mechanisms
    with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and IS-IS respectively.
    The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms
    for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response
    to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. This document describes the extension
    to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency Variation, Packet Loss, and Link Bandwidth Utilization
    as constraints for end to end path computation.</p>"
