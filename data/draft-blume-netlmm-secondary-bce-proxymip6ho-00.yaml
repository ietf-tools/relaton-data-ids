abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized
    mobility management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management
    and de-registration into account in a first protocol release. This document proposes
    an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 to suit MNs, which have multiple network interfaces
    implemented and can be connected over more than one network interface at the same
    time. This extension introduces a secondary binding at the local Mobility Anchor
    (LMA) that is valid for receiving uplink packets but is not used for tunneling
    downlink packets towards the MN. This allows for preparation of the new binding
    while avoiding that the LMA will prematurely forward data packets to the mobile
    node's new interface before the address configuration of this interface has completed.
    Furthermore, secondary bindings can be used to avoid loss of delayed packets arriving
    at the LMA after the Binding Cache has been updated by a Proxy Binding Update
    from a new MAG. With the proposed extension, packet buffering at the new MAG is
    not necessary and packet losses during an inter-technology handover can be mitigated.</p>"
