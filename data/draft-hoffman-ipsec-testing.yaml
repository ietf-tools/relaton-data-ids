abstract:
- content: "<p>Bringing up IPsec gateways, clients and end systems is a hard task.
    There are the numerous configurations issues that occur when doing this. Techniques
    for diagnosing regular nodes may not yeild understandable results when one or
    both nodes have network security features. There is a further difficulty presented
    by the number of configuration options presented by a typical IPsec gateway implementation,
    and the lack of consistent diagnostics from gateways. The network administrator,
    field engineers and product support staff are faced with multiple indistinguishable
    failure modes: is the client unable to connect because of a network outage, or
    because the two products have never actually tested in that scenario? Or is the
    naive user unaware that they are behind a network address translator?</p>"
