abstract:
- content: <p>To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for systems
    that have high bit-rates, the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872
    to include a new Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining
    a set of nominal central frequencies, channel spacings, and the concept of the
    "frequency slot". In such an environment, a data-plane connection is switched
    based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum,
    creating what is known as a flexible grid (flexi-grid). Given the specific characteristics
    of flexi-grid optical networks and their associated technology, this document
    defines a framework and the associated control-plane requirements for the application
    of the existing GMPLS architecture and control-plane protocols to the control
    of flexi-grid DWDM networks. The actual extensions to the GMPLS protocols will
    be defined in companion documents.</p>
