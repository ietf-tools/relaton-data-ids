abstract:
- content: "<p>The computation of one or a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSPs) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks is subject to a set of one or more specific optimization criteria, referred
    to as objective functions. In the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture,
    a Path Computation Client (PCC) may want a set of services that are required to
    be diverse (disjointed) from each other. In case when full diversity could not
    be achieved, it is helpful to maximize diversity as much as possible (or in other
    words, minimize the common shared resources). This document defines objective
    function code types for three new objective functions for this purpose to be applied
    to a set of synchronized path computation requests.</p>"
