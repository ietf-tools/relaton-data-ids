abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to MPLS BDI packet to form a new
    type of OAM packet BNM(Bidirectional Notify Message), this BNM packet will not
    only have the function of informing another peer MEP about existing fault of this
    path like MPLS BDI packet, but also it may use for performance measure and testing
    communication between two equipments. in addtion, when Client network has a fault
    or defect. it notify another peer client network about remote peer fault. And
    these performance measure and fault notification information will be encapsulated
    in BNM packet by the way of TLV packet. So it may decrease the number of OAM type
    and keep compatibility with MPLS network. on the other hand, this encapsulating
    these information by the way of TLV packet will be easy to extend OAM function
    to operate an MPLS Transport profile(MPLS-TP) label switched path (LSP).</p>"
