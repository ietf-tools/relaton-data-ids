abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model for Network Inventory location
    (e.g., site, room, rack, geo-location data), which provides location information
    with different granularity levels for inventoried network elements. Accurate location
    information is useful for network planning, deployment, and maintenance. However,
    such information cannot be obtained or verified from the Network Elements themselves.
    This document defines a location model for network inventory that extends the
    base inventory with comprehensive location data.</p>"
