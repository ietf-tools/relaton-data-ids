abstract:
- content: "<p>The framework for MPLS in transport networks (RFC 5921) provides reference
    models for the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Transport Service Interfaces,
    which are a User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and a Network-to-Network Interface
    (NNI). This document updates those reference models to show detailed reference
    points for these interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional
    architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI. This document is a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union
    Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
    Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures
    to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network
    as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
