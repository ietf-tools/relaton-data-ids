abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non- Queue-Building
    Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB). The purpose of this NQB PHB is to provide a separate
    queue that enables low latency and, when possible, low loss for application-limited
    traffic flows that would ordinarily share a queue with capacity-seeking traffic.
    The PHB provides low latency and, when possible, low loss without prioritization
    and without rate policing, making it suitable for environments where the use of
    either these features may be restricted. The NQB PHB has been developed primarily
    for use by access network segments, where queuing delays and queuing loss caused
    by Queue-Building protocols are manifested, but its use is not limited to such
    segments. In particular, applications to cable broadband links and mobile network
    radio and core segments are discussed. This document defines a standard Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP) to identify Non-Queue-Building flows.</p>"
