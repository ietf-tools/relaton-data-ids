abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
    supporting multiple types of authentication methods. In systems where EAP is used
    for authentication, it is desirable to avoid repeating the entire EAP exchange
    with another authenticator. This document specifies extensions to EAP and the
    EAP keying hierarchy to support an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient
    re- authentication between the peer and an EAP re-authentication server through
    any authenticator. The re-authentication server may be in the home network or
    in the local network to which the peer is connecting. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
