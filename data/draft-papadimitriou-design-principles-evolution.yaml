- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to extend RFC 1958 and RFC 3439 analysing
    the design principles that govern the Internet Architecture, evaluate how then
    have evolved since they were initially introduced and how we expect to evolve
    in the near future. We describe a number of design principle, discuss their implications
    on the Internet architecture, design and engineering. The work has been based
    on the outcome of the ad-hoc European Commission Future Internet Architecture
    (FIArch) group.</p>"
