abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol specified in this document is designed to provide multicast
    and broadcast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. It utilizes the Route Discovery
    mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) [4, 5, 7] to flood
    the data packets through the network. Although this protocol is derived from DSR,
    it can be implemented as a stand-alone protocol. In fact, it does not rely on
    unicast routing to operate. If DSR is already implemented on the network, very
    minor modifications are required to enable this protocol.</p>"
