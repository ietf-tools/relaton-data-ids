abstract:
- content: "<p>This addendum to the Site Security Handbook [RFC2196] is providing
    a checklist for the general Internet community to use when discussing security
    with Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These questions can serve as a framework
    for discussion of security expectations with current and prospective service providers.
    Regrettably, such a discussion rarely takes place today.</p>"
