abstract:
- content: "<p>APCCIRN internationalization group has, based on the experience with
    'ISO-2022-JP-2' (RFC 1554), designed a multilingual text encoding scheme, 'ISO-2022-INT-1',
    as an extension of 'ISO-2022-JP' (RFC 1468) and 'ISO-2022-KR' (RFC 1557). The
    encoding is ASCII compatible and 7-bit, thus, can be used mixed with any ASCII
    compatible encoding. The encoding is designed to be as stateless as practically
    possible with ISO 2022. That is, no state information needs to be preserved between
    lines. 'ISO-2022-INT-1' and its successors have an aggregated name: 'ISO-2022-INT-*'.</p>"
