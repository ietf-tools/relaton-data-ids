abstract:
- content: <p>The markup language known as "HTML/2.0" provides for image maps. Image
    maps are document elements which allow clicking different areas of an image to
    reference different network resources, as specified by Uniform Identifier (URIs).
    The image map capability in HTML/2.0 is limited in several ways, such as the restriction
    that it only works with documents served via the "HTTP" protocol, and the lack
    of a viable fallback for users of text-only browsers. This document specifies
    an extension to the HTML language, referred to as "Client- Side Image Maps," which
    resolves these limitations.</p>
