abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is specifying a protocol for network-based localized mobility
    management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management and
    de-registration into account. This document specifies how the IETF's Context Transfer
    Protocol, which is specified in RFC 4067, can be used with protocols for network-based
    mobility management, taking proactive and reactive handover scenarios into account.
    The protocol Proxy Mobile IPv6 is suitable to support network-based mobility management,
    which is the reference protocol solution for the integration of the context transfer
    mechanisms in this document.</p>"
