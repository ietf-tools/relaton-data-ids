abstract:
- content: "<p>Calendaring Interoperability over HTTP (CIH) is a technique for exchanging
    calendaring information between scheduling systems using the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). This allows users to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter
    what scheduling software they use. This document is a tentative exploration of
    whether CIH is feasible and what the pros and cons are relative to a brand new
    protocol like the Calendaring Interoperability Protocol (CIP). The primary benefit
    of CIH over CIP and motivation for this project is that we avoid implementing
    a whole new protocol, such as writing and debugging the protocol, convincing vendors
    to write new code to support it, and then convincing users to deploy it.</p>"
