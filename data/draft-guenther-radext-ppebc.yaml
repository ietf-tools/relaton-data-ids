abstract:
- content: "<p>In event-based charging procedures, customers get charged for service
    usage per se. This type of charging can be independent of data volume transferred,
    time period of service availment, or user subscription status. This memo introduces
    Radius attributes appropriate for event-based charging with debiting of prepaid
    user accounts.</p>"
