abstract:
- content: "<p>For various computing applications, it is helpful to know the language
    of the text being processed. This can be the case even if otherwise only pure
    character sequences (so-called plain text) are handled. From several sides, the
    need for such a scheme for ACAP has been claimed. One specific scheme, called
    MLSF, has also been proposed, see draft-ietf-acap-mlsf-01.txt for details. This
    document proposes two alternatives to MLSF. One alternative is using text/enriched-like
    markup. The second alternative is using a special tag-introduction character.
    Advantages and disadvantages of the various proposals are discussed. Some general
    comments about the topic of language tagging are given in the introduction.</p>"
