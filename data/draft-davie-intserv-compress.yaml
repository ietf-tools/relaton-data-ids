abstract:
- content: "<p>An Integrated Services router performs admission control and resource
    allocation based on the information contained in a TSpec (among other things).
    As currently defined, TSpecs convey information about the data rate (using a token
    bucket) and range of packet sizes of the flow in question. However, the TSpec
    may not be an accurate representation of the resources needed to support the reservation
    if the router is able to compress the data at the link level. This draft describes
    an extension to the TSpec which enables a sender of potentially compressible data
    to provide hints to int-serv routers about the compressibility they may obtain.
    Routers which support appropriate compression take advantage of the hint in their
    admission control decisions and resource allocation procedures; other routers
    ignore the hint. An initial application of this approach is to notify routers
    performing RTP header compression that they may allocate fewer resources to RTP
    flows.</p>"
