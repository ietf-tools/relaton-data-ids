abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility management protocol standardized
    in IETF and is being specified in various system architectures as a protocol for
    building a common and access independent mobile core. Currently, there are number
    of proposals and a huge amount of interest in NETEXT working group for extending
    the protocol to support various mobility extensions. This document identifies
    some of the critical extensions that are absolutely required and builds a case
    as why these extensions have to be supported.</p>"
