abstract:
- content: "<p>Advancing a protocol to Draft Standard requires documentation of the
    interoperation and implementation of the protocol. Historic reports have varied
    widely in form and level of content and there is little guidance available to
    new report preparers. This document updates the existing processes and provides
    more detail on what is appropriate in an interoperability and implementation report.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
