abstract:
- content: "<p>The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol and the
    Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) are experimental protocols designed to accelerate
    IP handover between wireless access routers. These protocols require IANA allocations
    for ICMP type and options, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Payload
    Protocol Identifiers, port numbers, and registries for certain formatted message
    options. This document contains instructions to IANA about which allocations are
    required for the Seamoby protocols. The ICMP subtype extension format for Seamoby
    has been additionally designed so that it can be utilized by other experimental
    mobility protocols, and the SCTP port number is also available for other experimental
    mobility protocols. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
