abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP is used to establish secure communication channel in IKEv2 and
    in Wireless Security. EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MD5, EAP-SIM uses radius protocol
    for communication bewteen radius server and the client. These protocols are used
    in both Wireless network authentication and in IKEV2 authentication to establish
    VPN tunnel. +----------+ +----------+ +----------+ | | EAPOL | EAP | RADIUS |

    (EAP) | Server | | | | | | | +----------+ +----------+ +----------+ This draft
    presents the security protocol which can be used to establish the secure communication
    channel between the radius server and pass through server. Pass through server
