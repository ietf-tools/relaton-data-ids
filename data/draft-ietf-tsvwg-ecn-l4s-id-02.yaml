abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the identifier to be used on IP packets
    for a new network service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput
    (L4S). It is similar to the original (or 'Classic') Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN). 'Classic' ECN marking was required to be equivalent to a drop, both when
    applied in the network and when responded to by a transport. Unlike 'Classic'
    ECN marking, for packets carrying the L4S identifier, the network applies marking
    more immediately and more aggressively than drop, and the transport response to
    each mark is reduced and smoothed relative to that for drop. The two changes counterbalance
    each other so that the throughput of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a
    'Classic' flow under the same conditions. However, the much more frequent control
    signals and the finer responses to them result in ultra-low queuing delay without
    compromising link utilization, even during high load. Examples of new active queue
    management (AQM) marking algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like
    or real- time) are specified separately. The new L4S identifier is the key piece
    that enables them to interwork and distinguishes them from 'Classic' traffic.
    It gives an incremental migration path so that existing 'Classic' TCP traffic
    will be no worse off, but it can be prevented from degrading the ultra-low delay
    and loss of the new scalable transports.</p>"
