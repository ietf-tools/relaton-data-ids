abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) [RFC6824] adopts Selective
    Acknowledgements (SACKs) at the subflow level to allow an MPTCP receiver to acknowledge
    the receipt of out-of-order data. In MPTCP, SACK information is expected (but
    not mandated)--though SACKs notify a data sender the reception of specific out-of-order
    data, the out-of-order data cannot be delivered to application layer until it
    has been cumulatively acknowledged at the connection-level. The MPTCP data receiver
    is permitted to later abandon the out-of-order data cached in the receive buffer.
    The out-of-order data is called renegable. Since the delivery of a SACKed out-of-order
    data is renegable, the sender has to maintain copies of SACKed data in the send
    buffer until it is cumulatively acked. As a result, the send buffer is inevitably
    wasted and the transmission rate is restricted even though the network is not
    congested.</p>"
