abstract:
- content: <p>This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended
    for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers - "real time
    communication on the Web". It intends to serve as a starting and coordination
    point to make sure all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable,
    and that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully specified
    and on the right publication track. This work is an attempt to synthesize the
    input of many people, but makes no claims to fully represent the views of any
    of them. All parts of the document should be regarded as open for discussion,
    unless the RTCWEB chairs have declared consensus on an item. This document is
    a candidate to become a work item of the RTCWEB working group.</p>
