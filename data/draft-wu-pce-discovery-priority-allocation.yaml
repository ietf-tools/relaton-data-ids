abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC5088][RFC5089] define a method to advertise path computation capabilities
    using IGP flooding. OSPF and ISIS are extended to support such capabilities advertisement.
    However [RFC5088][RFC5089]don't provide a method to advertise PCEP over TLS support
    capability. This document proposes new capability flag bit for PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub-
    TLV that can be announced as attribute in the IGP advertisement (defined in [RFC5088
    ][RFC5089]) to distribute transport support information.</p>"
