abstract:
- content: "<p>XRUDP (eXtended Reliable UDP) is a modern UDP-based transport protocol
    providing reliable, in-order, message-oriented delivery with congestion control,
    security, NAT traversal, and extensibility. It is designed for scenarios demanding
    reliable and efficient message delivery over unreliable networks, such as real-time
    signaling, IoT, gaming, and edge computing. This document specifies the XRUDP
    packet format, state machine, negotiation, and interaction with applications.</p>"
