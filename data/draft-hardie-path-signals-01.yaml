abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP's state mechanics uses a series of well-known messages that are
    exchanged in the clear. Because these are visible to network elements on the path
    between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used
    as signals by those network elements. In transports that do not exchange these
    messages in the clear, on- path network elements lack those signals. This document
    discusses the nature of the signals as they are seen by on-path elements and reflects
    on best practices for transports which encrypt their state mechanics.</p>"
