abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft suggests a standard form for transforming SPKI certificates
    encoded using S-expressions from and to XML documents. We present a XML Schema
    for the encoding and validation of SPKI certificates and other SPKI objects such
    as sequences and ACLs, and discuss different possibilities for the transformation
    of S- expressions into an XML document and vice-versa. The XML Schema is based
    on the 'SPKI Certificate Structure' [SPKI].</p>"
