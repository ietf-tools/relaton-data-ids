abstract:
- content: "<p>Generic Security Services API (GSS-API), the Simple Authentication
    and Security Layer (SASL), the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) are examples of four different security frameworks within
    the IETF. Each of these frameworks have evolved separately towards a common goal
    of authentication and establishing a cryptographic context. They support different
    types of security mechanisms and have historically evolved to integrate with different
    security infrastructures. This document discusses their similarities and differences
    and how these security mechanisms might start to converge into a more uniform
    approach involving generally useful authentication mechanisms that can be used
    in any of these frameworks with a variety of different security infrastructures.</p>"
