abstract:
- content: "<p>The current ALTO transport is based on HTTP/1.x connections between
    ALTO servers and ALTO clients. On the other hand, recent extensions to HTTP/1.x
    such as HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/3 [I-D.ietf-quic-http] introduce capabilities
    such as server push and stream multiplexing, which can potentially be integrated
    into ALTO to improve ALTO capabilities such as incremental updates. This document
    identifies use cases of ALTO and its extensions that may benefit from the advanced
    features of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and proposes ALTO extensions to fully leverage
    the benefits.</p>"
