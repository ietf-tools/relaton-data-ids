abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 nodes (clients) need a way to offer credentials to the AAA infrastructure
    in order to be granted access to the local network. For IPv6, it will be more
    efficient and thus reasonable to expect such access controls to be exerted by
    IPv6 routers, possibly as part of performing their role as DHCPv6 relays. Routers
    and DHCPv6 servers are expected to work in conjunction with AAA servers to determine
    whether or not the client's credentials are valid. Routers can exert such network
    access control by the device of carefully controlling entries in their packet
    filter and Neighbor Cache.</p>"
