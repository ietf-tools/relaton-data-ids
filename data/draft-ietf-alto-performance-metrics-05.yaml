abstract:
- content: <p>Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO). It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the Endpoint Cost Service.
    Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics. For example, a
    Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that offer a low delay delivery
    to the Resource Consumer. However the base ALTO protocol [ALTO] has documented
    only one single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2
    of ALTO base specification [ALTO]). This document, proposes a set of Cost Metrics,
    derived and aggregated from routing protocols with different granularity and scope,
    such as BGP-LS,OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end-to-end traffic management tools.
    It currently documents Network Performance Cost Metrics reporting on network delay,
    jitter, packet loss, hop count, and bandwidth. These metrics may be exposed by
    an ALTO Server to allow applications to determine "where" to connect based on
    network performance criteria. Additional Cost Metrics involving ISP specific considerations
    or other network technologies may be documented in further versions of this draft.</p>
