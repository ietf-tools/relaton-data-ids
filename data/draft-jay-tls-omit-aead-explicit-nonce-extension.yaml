abstract:
- content: '<p>With emergence of Internet of Things(IoT), DTLS is being widely considered
    as a protocol of choice for communication security in IoT applications. Further,
    AES_CCM has emerged as the cipher of choice in constrained environments. Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), which is the application layer protocol for resource
    constrained environments, mandates DTLS as underlying security protocol and proposes
    AES_CCM based ciphers to be used with different key exchange methods. AEAD ciphers
    requires an explicit nonce of 8 bytes must be carried in each transmitted record.This
    document defines a TLS (and DTLS) extension, which will allow clients and servers
    to omit the explicit nonce sent in TLS/DTLS records. This document can be considered
    as an extended version of "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: Extension
    Definitions". The extension defined in this document apply equally to both DTLS
    and TLS protocols.</p>'
