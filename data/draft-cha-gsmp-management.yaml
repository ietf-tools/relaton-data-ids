abstract:
- content: "<p>General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface between
    a label switch and a controller, and it provides connection, configuration, event,
    performance management and synchronization. The managed objects of RFC 3295 are
    only defined to configure, monitor and maintain the protocol entity. Traditionally,
    network management services are classified into five categories: those are configuration,
    performance, fault, accounting, and security management. These services are provided
    by the network management functions, which can be located either in the controller
    or in the label switch. In the GSMP interface, there are no managed objects for
    the network management services and the location of network management functions
    is not clearly defined. We discussed the complexity of switch implementation and
    the efficiency of resource usage according to the location of network management
    functions.</p>"
