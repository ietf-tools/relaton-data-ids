abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework for using Session Initiation Protocol
    sessions to create user interface components for network application interaction.
    These Network Applications Sessions provide a number of services to the application
    server and user agent including application identification, co-operation, association,
    and authentication. In addition to these services the framework allows for differing
    modes of interaction to be managed in a homogenous manner with similar expectations
    for security, establishment, update, closure and the handling of certain user
    interface operations.</p>"
