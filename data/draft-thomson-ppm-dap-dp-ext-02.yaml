abstract:
- content: "<p>Report extensions to the Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) are
    defined to support new modes of operation for the protocol. This includes a batched
    submission mode where an intermediary can collect reports prior to settling on
    an exact task configuration. It also includes more flexibility for modes where
    a differential privacy mechanism is applied as part of the aggregation process.
    Report extensions bind the content of reports to the chosen options to ensure
    that the guarantees that both DAP and differential privacy provide are maintained.</p>"
