abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines an event package that allows a network entity to
    request to be notified of changes in the registration state of a particular user.
    Subscription and notification of registration state is supported by defining an
    event package within the general SIP event notification event framework. This
    event package is based on the Presence event package as specified in [3] and therefore
    this draft only describes the deltas to the Presence event package.</p>"
