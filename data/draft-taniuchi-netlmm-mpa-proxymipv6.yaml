abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proactive mechanism to provide fast- handover
    involving PMIPv6. In particular, it describes how one can achieve fast handoff
    for PMIPv6 using Media-independent Pre- Authentication (MPA) technique. It discusses
    the need for a fast- handoff for PMIPv6 environment. It then describes how MPA
    techniques could be used during different steps involving both intra-domain and
    inter-domain handoff for PMIPv6. MPA-based fast-handover takes advantage of the
    pre-authentication mechanism so that the mobile can perform the access authentication
    while in the previous local mobility (PMA) domain and thus would be able to complete
    many of the handoff related operations while still in the previous network.</p>"
