abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a standard form for digital certificates and
    access control lists. These structures bind either names or authorizations to
    keys or names that resolve to keys. The name and authorization structures can
    be used separately or together. We use S-expressions as the standard format for
    these certificates and define a canonical form for those S-expressions. These
    structures are also known under the name SDSI 2.0.</p>"
