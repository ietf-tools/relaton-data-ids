abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents provides background for the work on VoIP peering and
    tries to provide guidance on what kind of work is needed to facilitate widespread
    SIP-based peering of telephony networks. It is intended to spur discussion on
    the work about peering (in the SPEERMINT and DRINKS WGs) and should also serve
    as input to the ongoing discussions on reducing Spam for Internet Telephony (SPIT).</p>"
