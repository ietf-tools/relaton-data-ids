abstract:
- content: <p>This specification addresses how to request that a device should enter
    a "power locator" mode for a limited period of time. The mode involves a device
    cycling between a low and high power level in a predictable manner so that a power
    metering device upstream in the power distribution system can sense the signal
    and so determine where the device draws its power from. This will be useful in
    many types of buildings, particularly data centers and large commercial buildings.
    This draft addresses operation of the device carrying out the request, but not
    detailed operation of the device that makes the request and interprets the results.
    This draft is an initial discussion document to generate feedback and improvement.</p>
