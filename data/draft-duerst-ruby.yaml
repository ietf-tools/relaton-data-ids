abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create
    hypertext documents that are platform independent. Initially HTML was designed
    primarily for Western European languages; most of the issues of basic internationalization
    to make HTML better usable for other languages have in the meantime been addressed.
    Ruby are important phonetic annotations used mainly for ideographic characters
    in East Asia. This document proposes markup for ruby in HTML and explains its
    usage.</p>"
