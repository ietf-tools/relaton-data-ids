abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a methodology for IPv6 Header Compression via
    mapping the source and destination addresses into a flow label value per address
    pair sessions with a specific traffic class field value to identify the packet
    as “address-less” compressed header. The resultant headers, sans addresses shrink
    from 320 bits to 64 bits. This mapping is locally specific to the router port
    and the connecting hosts/router ports. Specifically written for use on low bandwidth
    links (less than T1 or 1.544Mbps), IPv6 AMP’s applicability goes to integration
    of cellular/WiFi appliances and will be critical for tactical uses for military
    and first responder applications.</p>"
