abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism to advertise IPv6 prefixes in BGP
    which are associated with Color Extended Communities to establish end-to-end intent-aware
    paths for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) services. Such IPv6 prefixes are called
    "Colored Prefixes", and this mechanism is called Colored Prefix Routing (CPR).
    In SRv6 networks, the Colored prefixes are the SRv6 locators associated with different
    intent. SRv6 services (e.g. SRv6 VPN services) with specific intent could be assigned
    with SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SIDs) under the corresponding SRv6 locators, which
    are advertised as Colored prefixes. This operational methodology allows the SRv6
    service traffic to be steered into end-to-end intent-aware paths simply based
    on the longest prefix matching of SRv6 Service SIDs to the Colored prefixes. The
    existing IPv6 Address Family and Color Extended Community are reused for the advertisement
    of IPv6 Colored prefixes without new BGP extensions, thus this mechanism is easy
    to interoperate and can be deployed incrementally in multi-domain networks.</p>
