abstract:
- content: "<p>The absence of appropriate mechanisms for information exchange between
    Network Operators and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and content providers leads
    to avoidable inefficiency for the delivery of contents to end users in situations
    like congestion, selection of best distributed delivery end point, etc. This document
    describes the need of an information exchange interface between Network Operators
    and CDNs to collaborate in order to provide the best service quality to the end
    users.</p>"
