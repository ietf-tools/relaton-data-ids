abstract:
- content: "<p>In the current ACL Model draft [2], the kinds of permissions that an
    LDAP server understands are limited to those defined in clause 4.1.1. Certain
    LDAP integrated applications need to store their own Application Defined Permissions
    (ADP) as well. For example, consider an application that allows users to perform
    several different actions on various types of objects.</p>"
