abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose requirement to implement MPLS technology
    for Ethernet switched network. Ethernet has become major building block in local
    area network and the area of deployment is quickly expanding to core network.
    While there have been industry needs to overcome weakness of Ethernet, MPLS has
    not been considered as key technology to improve Ethernet. Currently MPLS [RFC3031]
    and GMPLS [GARCH] architecture do not define label-switching function on L2SC
    interface, i.e. over LAN media. Hence, it is necessary to discuss lightweight
    implementation of MPLS for Ethernet. Since there is disparity in requirements
    depending on hierarchy of Ethernet, it is appropriate to separate discussion in
    Customer Premise Network (CPN), Access Network (AN) and Core Network (CN). Some
    candidate methods to consider for label encoding for Ethernet are discussed.</p>"
