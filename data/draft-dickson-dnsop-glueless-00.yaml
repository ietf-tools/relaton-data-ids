abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft proposes a Best Current Practice for protecting
    authority servers against MITM and poisoning attacks, using a domain naming strategy
    to not require glue A/AAAA records and use of DNSSEC. This BCP assumes the use
    of validating resolvers, which should already be a BCP itself. MITM and poisoning
    attacks should only be effective/possible against unsigned domains. However, until
    all domains are signed, this guidance is relevant, in that it can limit the attack
    surface of unsigned domains. This guidance should be combined with [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]</p>"
