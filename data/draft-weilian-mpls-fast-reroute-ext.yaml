abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the Fast Reroute (FRR) mechanism
    of Facility Backup defined in RFC4090. Through the extensions, the node that has
    set up FRR relation is capable of notifying the tail node of backup tunnel to
    act as Merge Point (MP) of the protected and backup tunnels. In addition, after
    the FRR switchover, PLR and MP nodes can refresh the protocol state of protected
    tunnel by the Refresh message of backup tunnel, so that the protocol messages
    of protected tunnel don't need to be refreshed through the backup tunnel.</p>"
