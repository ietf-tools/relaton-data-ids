abstract:
- content: "<p>Ordered Metric Adjustment (OMA) as specified in [I-D.zxd-rtgwg-ordered-metric-adjustment]
    has provided a mechanism whereby global transient forwarding loops can be avoided
    through graceful link metric adjustment. This document provides an implementation
    report for OMA algorithm and mechanism on different network topologies. What's
    more, it gives an analysis on efficiency and performance of OMA, comparing with
    other well-known loop- preventing algorithm.</p>"
