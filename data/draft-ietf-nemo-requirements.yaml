abstract:
- content: "<p>Network mobility arises when a router connecting a network to the Internet
    dynamically changes its point of attachment to the Internet thereby causing the
    reachability of the said network to be changed in relation to the fixed Internet
    topology. Such a type of network is referred to as a mobile network. With appropriate
    mechanisms, sessions established between nodes in the mobile network and the global
    Internet can be maintained after the mobile router changes its point of attachment.
    This document outlines the goals expected from network mobility support and defines
    the requirements that must be met by the NEMO Basic Support solution. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
