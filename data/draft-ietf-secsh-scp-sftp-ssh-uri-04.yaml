abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers used to locate
    resources for the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and the Secure Shell (SSH)
    protocols. The document describes the generic syntax involved in URI definitions
    as well as specific definitions for each protocol. These specific definitions
    may include user credentials such as username and also may include other parameters
    such as host key fingerprint. In addition, security considerations and examples
    are also provided within this document.</p>"
