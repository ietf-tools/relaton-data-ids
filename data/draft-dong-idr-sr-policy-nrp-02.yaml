abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated information. The header of a packet
    steered in an SR Policy is augmented with an ordered list of segments associated
    with that SR Policy. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of network
    resources allocated in the underlay network which can be used to support one or
    a group of IETF network slice services. In networks where there are multiple NRPs,
    an SR Policy may be associated with a particular NRP. The association between
    SR Policy and NRP needs to be specified, so that for service traffic which is
    steered into the SR Policy, the header of the packets can be augmented with the
    information associated with the NRP. An SR Policy candidate path can be distributed
    using BGP SR Policy. This document defines the extensions to BGP SR policy to
    specify the NRP which the SR Policy candidate path is associated with.</p>"
