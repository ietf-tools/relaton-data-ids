abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP[RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability between
    domains and between the edges of a domain. As such, BGP assumes the next hop towards
    any reachable destination may not reside on the advertising speaker, but rather
    may either be through a router connected to the same subnet as the speaker, or
    through a router only reachable by traversing multiple hops through the network.
    Because of this, as per [RFC4291] - BGP does not recognize IPv6 link-local addresses,
    as a valid next hop for the forwarding purposes. However, in many current deplyments,
    BGP peering is often deployed on point-to-point links in networks where multihop
    reachability of any kind is not assumed or desired (all next hops are assumed
    to be the speaker reachable through a directly connected point-to-point link).
    This is common, for instance, in data center fabrics[RFC7938]. In these situations,
    a global IPv6 address is not required for the advertisement of reachability information;
    in fact, providing global IPv6 addresses in these kinds of networks can be detrimental
    to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). This draft standardizes the operation of BGP
    over a point-to-point link using link-local IPv6 addressing only. Since link-local
    IPv6 addresses are not required to be globally unique, implementations must ensure
    that they are strictly associated with a specific interface.</p>"
