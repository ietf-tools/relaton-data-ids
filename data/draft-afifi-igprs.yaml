abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose an architecture (IGPRS) for the integration of the IPv6
    protocol in the GPRS infrastructure. The data and signalling protocol suite will
    be based on mobile IPv6 protocol (instead of the GTP protocol). This new infrastructure
    will take advantage of the available internet protocols for routing and security.
    Since it is targetted to co-exist with the GPRS, it is a partial translation of
    MAP specifications to Internet protocols. This document uses some of the GPRS
    Service document and some of its terminology.</p>"
