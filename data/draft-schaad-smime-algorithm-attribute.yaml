abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), unlike X.509/PKIX certificates,
    is vulnerable to algorithm substitution attacks. In an algorithm substitution
    attack, the attacker changes either the algorithm being used or the parameters
    of the algorithm in order to change the result of a signature verification process.
    In X.509 certificates, the signature algorithm is protected because it is duplicated
    in the TBSCertificate.signature field with the proviso that the validator is to
    compare both fields as part of the signature validation process. This document
    defines a new attribute that contains a copy of the relevant algorithm identifiers
    so that they are protected by the signature or authentication process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
