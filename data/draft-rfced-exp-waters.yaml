abstract:
- content: "<p>In this administrative framework, a security model defines the mechanisms
    used to achieve an administratively-defined level of security for protocol interactions.
    Although many such security models might be defined, it is the purpose of this
    document, User-based Security Model for SNMPv2, to define the first, and, as of
    this writing, only, security model for this administrative framework. This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
