abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) has provided some means, such as CNAME
    or DNAME, where a query can be redirected to a different name. The zone operator
    should be careful about this redirection, which may forms a loop. The detail analysis
    of xNAME loop detection and its impacts are not specified in the RFC 1035 and
    RFC 2672. This document gives a detail analysis of xNAME loop and its impacts.
    It also gives some advices for using xNAME.</p>"
