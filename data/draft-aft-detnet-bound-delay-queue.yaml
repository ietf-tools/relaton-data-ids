abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a distributed mechanism to enforce strict delay
    bounds for some network flows in large scale networks. It leverages on the capacity
    of modern network devices to adapt their queue's capacities to bound the maximum
    time spent by packets in those devices. It is using a reservation protocol to
    guarantee the availability of the resources in the devices' queues to serve packets
    belonging to specific flows while enforcing an end-to-end delay constraint.</p>"
