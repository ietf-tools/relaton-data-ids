abstract:
- content: "<p>The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) is a new naming and
    addressing architecture to solve the Internet's routing scaling problem. It separates
    global routing in the Internet from local routing and naming in end-user networks.
    The basic LISP architecture does not support mobility. The mobility extension
    LISP Mobile Node (LISP-MN) describes a mechanism that extends LISP to support
    mobile nodes and enables them to roam into LISP and non-LISP networks while being
    reachable under the same address. Currently, LISP-MN does not support networks
    that use network address translation (NAT). This document presents an extension
    for LISP-MN that makes LISP mobile nodes behind a NAT globally reachable.</p>"
