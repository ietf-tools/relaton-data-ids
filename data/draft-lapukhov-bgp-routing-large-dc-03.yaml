abstract:
- content: <p>Some service providers build and operate data centers that support over
    100,000 servers. In this document, such data centers are referred to as "large-scale"
    to differentiate them the from more common smaller infrastructures. The environments
    of this scale have a unique set of network requirements, with emphasis on operational
    simplicity and network stability. This document summarizes ideas and experience
    of many people involved in designing and operating large scale data centers using
    BGP as the only control-plane protocol. The intent here is to report a proven
    and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry.</p>
