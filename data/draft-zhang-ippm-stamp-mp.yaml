abstract:
- content: "<p>STAMP is typically used to perform the measurement of one-way and round-trip
    performance metrics. However, when using active measurement mechanisms in a multi-path
    topology, the default forwarding behavior is to go through one path. So, it cannot
    collect the information of all the paths at one time. This document extends STAM
    with a Multi-path TLV to implement the multi-path performance measurement, which
    can help the operators to know the performance of network comprehensively and
    efficiently.</p>"
