abstract:
- content: "<p>Route Origin Validation (ROV) using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) enables BGP routers to identify illegitimate routes that violate Route
    Origin Authorizations (ROAs). However, widespread deployment of RPKI requires
    validation systems to process high volumes of route announcements against increasingly
    large ROA datasets, where ROV adoption faces significant barriers due to concerns
    about its processing efficiency. This document identifies a performance issue
    inherent in current ROV procedure, which could be exacerbated as the expanding
    coverage of ROAs.</p>"
