abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-subnetted IEEE 802.11 WLAN networks are being widely deployed
    in Enterprise Intranets –(in many cases requiring a VPN tunnel to connect back
    and access Intranet resources), and public areas such as airports, coffee shops,
    convention centers and shopping malls. Many of these WLAN networks also employ
    NAT to translate between non-routable and routable IPv4 care-of (point of attachment)
    addresses. WWAN networks such as those based on GPRS, 1xRTT and eventually EDGE,
    1xEV, CDMA2000 and UMTS are also starting to see deployment. These deployments
    are paving the way for applications and usage scenarios requiring TCP/IP session
    persistence and constant reachability while connecting back to a secured (VPN
    protected), target “home” network. This in turn drives the need for a mobile VPN
    solution that is multi-vendor interoperable, providing seamless access with persistent
    VPN sessions - through NAT gateways when needed. This draft proposes a solution
    framework that enables efficient, seamless operation of Mobile IPv4 when combined
    with an IPsec-based VPN and supporting NAT traversal when needed. The solution
    has no link layer dependencies and can be applied to other 802.3-compatible wired
    and wireless physical media as well.</p>"
