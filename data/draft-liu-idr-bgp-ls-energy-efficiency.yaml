abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-liu-spring-sr-policy-energy-efficiency-00] describes the types
    of energy consumption information, how to collect energy consumption information,
    and the framework for path selection based on energy consumption information.
    This document elaborates on extending BGP-LS to carry energy consumption information
    and transmit it to the controller, enabling the controller to perform routing
    calculations based on energy consumption metrics.</p>"
