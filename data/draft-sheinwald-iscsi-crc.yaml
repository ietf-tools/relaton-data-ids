abstract:
- content: "<p>Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes [Peterson] are shortened cyclic
    codes used for error detection. A number of CRC codes have been adopted in standards:
    ATM, IEC, IEEE, CCITT, IBM-SDLC, and more [Baicheva]. The most important expectation
    from this kind of code is a very low probability for undetected errors. The probability
    of undetected errors in such codes has been, and still is, subject to extensive
    studies that have included both analytical models and simulations. Those codes
    have been used extensively in communications and magnetic recording as they demonstrate
    good 'burst error' detection capabilities, but are also good at detecting several
    independent bit errors. Hardware implementations are very simple and well known;
    their simplicity has made them popular with hardware developers for many years.
    However, algorithms and software for effective implementations of CRC are now
    also widely available [Williams]. The probability of undetected errors depends
    on the polynomial selected to generate the code, the error distribution (error
    model), and the data length. In this memo, we attempt to give some estimates for
    the probability of undetected errors to facilitate the selection of an error detection
    code for iSCSI. We will also attempt to compare CRCs with other checksum forms
    (Fletcher, Adler, weighted checksums), as permitted by available data.</p>"
