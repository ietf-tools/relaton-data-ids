abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Publish-Subscribe model, subscribers express their interest
    in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently notified of any event
    generated by a publisher that matches their registered interest. The model is
    well suited for communication in large-scale and loosely coupled distributed systems.
    This document describes how the model fits into Interface to the Routing System
    (I2RS) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectures, and analyzes its advantages,
    its security requirements, and its use in providing security within I2RS.</p>"
