abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the support of Mobile Networks, as defined
    in Mobile IPv4, by the Mobile Router and Home Agent. A Mobile Router is responsible
    for the mobility of one or more network segments or subnets moving together. The
    Mobile Router hides its mobility from the nodes on the mobile network. The nodes
    on the Mobile Network may be fixed in relationship to the Mobile Router and may
    not have any mobility function. Extensions to Mobile IPv4 are introduced to support
    Mobile Networks.</p>"
