abstract:
- content: "<p>(Insert justification, possibly copied wholesale from section 1.1 and
    maybe 2.1/2.2 of draft-kelly-ipsra-userauth-00.txt) We consider inadvisable to
    change IKE [RFC2409] to meet these needs. IKE is a complex protocol; adding more
    features to it is a bad idea. Instead, we propose a layered approach: use standard
    IKE, with certificates, but provide a simple mechanism to provide clients with
    keys and certificates. A number of objections have been raised to using certificates.
    The most important is that we lack a public key infrastructure (PKI). We do not
    agree that this is an obstacle. Our proposal provides a simple mechanism for certificate
    generation and retrieval, while still relying on legacy authentication infrastructures.
    Furthermore, we provide for an easy migration path to certificate use once organizational
    PKIs are deployed. Our purpose at this point is not to present a firm protocol.
    Rather, we sketch several ideas for what such a protocol could look like. Final
    details can be determined if and when the working group opts for this path. In
    the interests of simplicity, we have chosen to reuse standard protocols and components.
    In particular, we use HTTP [RFC2616] for transport, HTML [RFC1866] as a data representation
    and TLS [RFC2246] for confidentiality. However, we do not mandate (or even necessarily
    encourage) use of a actual Web browser for certificate retrieval. As an alternative,
    we present a transient shared secret generation mechanism for IKE.</p>"
