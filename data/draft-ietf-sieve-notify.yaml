abstract:
- content: "<p>Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that
    they have received new mail. Most of these methods involve polling to check for
    new messages periodically. A push method handled by the final delivery agent gives
    users quicker notifications and saves server resources. This document does not
    specify the notification method, but it is expected that using existing instant
    messaging infrastructure such as Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP),
    or Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Short Message Service (SMS) messages
    will be popular. This document describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering
    language that allows users to give specific rules for how and when notifications
    should be sent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
