abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select
    the appropriate response for a given request, based upon the user agent's characteristics,
    as expressed in request headers. In practice, user agents are often unwilling
    to send those request headers, because it is not clear whether they will be used,
    and sending them impacts both performance and privacy. This document defines an
    Accept-CH response header that servers can use to advertise their use of request
    headers for proactive content negotiation, along with a set of guidelines for
    the creation of such headers, colloquially known as "Client Hints."</p>
