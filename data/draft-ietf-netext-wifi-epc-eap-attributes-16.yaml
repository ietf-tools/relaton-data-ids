abstract:
- content: "<p>With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile service
    providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available in
    3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well. Such functions include Access
    Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and
    seamless mobility between Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks. The EAP Authentication and
    Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), and EAP-AKA', protocol is required for mobile devices
    to access the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks. This document
    defines a few new EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned functions in such
    networks. The attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a Mobile Node
    (MN)) and its network counterpart (such as an Authentication, Authorization, and
    Accounting (AAA) server) in the service provider's infrastructure.</p>"
