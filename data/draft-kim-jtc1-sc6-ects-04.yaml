abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is the final Committee Draft of the Enhanced Transport Service
    Definition under development within ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6/WG7 since last several years
    in order to provide to the upper-layer applications enhanced transport services
    over the current OSI transport service; major enhancements include multicast services
    and enhanced QoS. This memo is distributed to possibly interested grops within
    IETF, especially to experts in Transport Area, to make noticed the efforts being
    made within SC6 to come up with a new transport service definition meeting the
    wide range of requirements of the both current and future multimedia multicast
    applications. It is to be noted that a protocol maned ECTP(Enhanced Communications
    Transport Protocol) supporting this ECTS is also under development within SC6
    and will be made public in the near future. Experts interested in this topic might
    compare the services defined by ECTS with those provided by more known protocols
    including RTP, MTP, RMP, and RAMP. The ultimate apparent objective of ECTS is
    the multimedia multicast transport service with varying degrees of reliability
    and multicast QoS.</p>"
