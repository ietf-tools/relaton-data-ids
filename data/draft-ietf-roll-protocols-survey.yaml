abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and smart objects,
    present difficult constraints: very limited memory, little processing power, and
    long sleep periods. As most of these devices are battery-powered, energy efficiency
    is critically important. Wireless link qualities can vary significantly over time,
    requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology change energy
    costs. Routing over such low power and lossy networks introduces requirements
    that existing routing protocols may not fully address. Using existing application
    requirements documents, this document derives a minimal and not exhaustive set
    of criteria for routing in low-power and lossy networks. It provides a brief survey
    of the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols with respect to these criteria.
    From this survey it examines whether existing and mature IETF protocols can be
    used without modification in these networks, or whether further work is necessary.
    It concludes that no existing IETF protocol meets the requirements of this domain.</p>"
