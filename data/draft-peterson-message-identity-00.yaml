abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the concept of identity in Internet
    messaging systems as a means of preventing impersonation. It describes the architectural
    roles necessary to provide identity, and details some approaches to the generation
    of identity assertions and the transmission of such assertions within messages.
    The trade-offs of various design decisions are explained.</p>"
