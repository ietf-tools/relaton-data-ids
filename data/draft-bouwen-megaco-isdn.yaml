abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the concept of an ISDN access gateway in the
    context of Megaco/H.248 and Sigtran protocols. For these ISDN access gateways,
    the ISDN B channels may be controlled by the Media Gateway Controller using megaco/H.248
    while the User-to-Network signaling running over the D channels may be relayed
    to the Media Gateway Controller using either megaco/H.248 or the Sigtran protocols.
    The main issues involved are: * Megaco/H.248 and Sigtran protocols may interwork
    in different ways in ISDN access gateways, leaving room for non - interoperable
    solutions; * Megaco needs additional packages in order to support ISDN terminations
    in the ISDN access gateway; * A data service may be offered to ISDN users via
    the ISDN D- channel, introducing the need to introduce a NAS package for the D-channel.
    This document addresses these issues, proposes and explains different solutions
    and suggests best practice guideline for megaco / sigtran interworking in ISDN
    access gateways.</p>"
