- content: "<p>This document discusses benefits of complementing existing email standards
    by means that allow to replace or extend text-based email messages with message
    parts that describe content (full or in parts) in a machine-readable way. This
    would enable rich and structured interaction for its recipients - may it be human
    users or agents on their behalf.</p>"
