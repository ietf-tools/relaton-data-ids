abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium. This
    openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can allow
    communications that may be viewed as either desirable or undesirable by different
    parties. Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent
    and impact of abusive or allegedly illegal communications. Recently, there has
    been an increasing emphasis on "blocking", the active prevention of abusive or
    allegedly illegal communications. This document examines several technical approaches
    to Internet content blocking in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet
    architecture. In general, the approach to content blocking that is most coherent
    with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable
    services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.</p>
