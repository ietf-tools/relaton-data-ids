abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast re-
    route mechanisms which provide protection against link or router failure by invoking
    locally determined repair paths. Unlike MPLS Fast-reroute, the mechanisms are
    applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding. An essential
    part of such mechanisms is the prevention of packet loss caused by the loops which
    normally occur during the re-convergence of the network following a failure.</p>"
