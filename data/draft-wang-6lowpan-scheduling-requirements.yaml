abstract:
- content: <p>Industrial automation field either process automation or factory automation
    has its special characteristics and requirements because of the crucial environment
    and the safety of industrial production itself. 6LoWPAN working group standard
    Rfc4944 "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks" introduces
    the methods of transmitting IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. This document
    describes the function requirements of industrial scheduling for transmission
    of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks to extend the 6LoWPAN resolution method
    for industrial application space.</p>
