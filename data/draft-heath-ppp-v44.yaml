abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol [PPP] provides a standard means for transporting
    multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. The PPP Compression Control
    Protocol [CCP] provides a means to negotiate and utilize compression protocols
    over PPP encapsulated links. This memo describes a means for compressing PPP encapsulated
    datagrams by utilizing the data compression algorithm that is described in International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) Recommendation V.44 [V44]. Recommendation V.44
    is a modem standard but Annex B of the recommendation describes the implementation
    of V.44 in packet networks. This memo defines the application of V.44, with single
    or multiple compression dictionaries,to the PPP Compression Control Protocol (RFC
    1962).</p>"
