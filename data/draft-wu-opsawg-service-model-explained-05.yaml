abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has produced a considerable number of data models in the YANG
    modelling language. The majority of these models are used to model devices or
    monolithic functions and they allow access for configuration and to read operational
    status. A small number of YANG modules have been defined to model services (for
    example, the Layer Three Virtual Private Network Service Model produced by the
    L3SM working group). This document briefly sets out the scope of and purpose of
    an IETF service model, and it also shows where a service model might fit into
    a Software Defined Networking architecture. Note that service models do not make
    any assumption of how a service is actually engineered and delivered to a customer;
    details of how network protocols and devices are engineered to deliver a service
    are captured in other models that are not exposed through the Customer- Provider
    Interface.</p>"
