abstract:
- content: "<p>In large network deployments, a single Diameter peer can support over
    a million concurrent Diameter sessions. Recent use cases have revealed the need
    for Diameter peers to apply the same operation to a large group of Diameter sessions
    concurrently. The Diameter base protocol commands operate on a single session
    so these use cases could result in many thousands of command exchanges to enforce
    the same operation on each session in the group. In order to reduce signaling,
    it would be desirable to enable bulk operations on all (or part of) the sessions
    managed by a Diameter peer using a single or a few command exchanges. This document
    specifies the Diameter protocol extensions to achieve this signaling optimization.</p>"
