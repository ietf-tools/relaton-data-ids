abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the mechanism of OLIA, the "Opportunistic Linked
    Increases Algorithm". OLIA is a congestion control algorithm for MPTCP. The current
    congestion control algorithm of MPTCP, LIA [4], forces a tradeoff between optimal
    congestion balancing and responsiveness. OLIA's design departs from this tradeoff
    and provide these properties simultaneously. Hence, it solves the identified performance
    problems with LIA while retaining non-flappiness and responsiveness behavior of
    LIA, as shown by different studies [5, 6, 7, 8]. OLIA is now part of the UCLouvain's
    MPTCP implementation [9, 11].</p>
