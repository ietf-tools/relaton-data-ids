abstract:
- content: "<p>Nameserver selection algorithms employed by DNS resolvers are not currently
    standardized in the DNS protocol, and this has lead to variation in the methods
    being used by implementations in the field. Recent research has shown that some
    of these implementations suffer from significant security vulnerabilities. This
    document provides an in-depth analysis of nameserver selection utilized by mainstream
    DNS software and summarizes uncovered vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it provides
    recommendations to defend against these security and availability risks. Designers
    and operators of recursive resolvers can adopt these recommendations to improve
    the security and stability of the DNS.</p>"
