abstract:
- content: "<p>LDAP provides some simple primitives to construct search filters. Complex
    LDAP search queries such as those involving joins or functional evaluation of
    simple query results require client side processing of the intermediate search
    results. The network overhead of retrieving intermediate results can be substantial
    for large databases. This document defines an LDAP extension for supporting server
    side evaluation of complex search queries. Custom search logic can be sent across
    to the server, encapsulated as a Java Object. The LDAP server supporting this
    extension would instantiate the java object and invoke its well known interfaces
    in a JVM. The java object running at the server end acts as the client-proxy,
    and makes a local search query to the LDAP server. The directory entries are evaluated
    using the custom logic embedded in the client-proxy, and those that satisfy the
    evaluation function are returned as the search result to the LDAP server, which
    passes it back to the originating client. Even non-Java LDAP clients can use this
    method, provided the search query is written as a java object.</p>"
