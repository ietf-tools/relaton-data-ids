abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent era of Information Technology the data traffic over the Internet
    is increasing uncontrollably. This proliferation of data traffic is due to general
    shift towards e-business and other application of Information Technology. The
    businesses relying on Internet lose billions of dollars each year due to slow
    or failed web services. Therefore, in Internet research, the most conspicuous
    issue is to develop methodologies to reduce net traffic over the Internet. In
    this paper, an algorithm is proposed to reduce net data traffic, which works at
    Internet layer in TCP/IP reference model. The algorithm monitors data repetitions
    in IP datagram and prepares a compression code in response of this repetition.
    If no IP datagrams are repeated, no compression code is sent. Therefore, the algorithm
    does not put any overhead on the system. Furthermore, as the proposed algorithm
    works at IP datagrams only, therefore, it remains transparent from all client-server
    applications.</p>"
