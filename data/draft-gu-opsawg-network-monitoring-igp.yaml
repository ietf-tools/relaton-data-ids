- content: "<p>To evolve towards automated network OAM (Operations, administration
    and management), the monitoring of control plane protocols is a fundamental necessity.
    This document proposes network monitoring for IGP to facilitate troubleshooting
    by collecting the IGP monitoring data and reporting it to the network monitoring
    server in real-time. In this document, the operations of network monitoring for
    ISIS are described, and the corresponding network monitoring message types and
    message formats are defined.</p>"
