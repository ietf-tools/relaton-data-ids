abstract:
- content: <p>The "ZONEVERSION" EDNS option allows a DNS querier to request a DNS
    authoritative server to add an EDNS option in the answer of such query with a
    token field representing the version of the zone which contains the answered Resource
    Record, such as the SOA serial field in zones when this number corresponds to
    the zone version. This "ZONEVERSION" data allows to debug and diagnose problems
    by helping to recognize the data source of an answer in an atomic single query,
    by associating the response with a respective zone version.</p>
