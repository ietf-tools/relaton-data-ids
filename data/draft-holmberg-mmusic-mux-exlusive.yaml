abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how an endpoint can indicate exclusive support
    of RTP/RTCP multiplexing using the Session Description Protocol (SDP). The document
    updates RFC 5761, by defining how the SDP 'rtcp' attribute is used, together with
    the SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute, to indicate exclusive support of RTP/RTCP multiplexing.
    Editor's note: 'exclusive' is probably not the best terminology, so feel free
    to suggest something more appropriate.</p>"
