abstract:
- content: "<p>Long term evolvability of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol requires
    the ability to support change. Greasing is one technique that exercises the regular
    use of unallocated protocol extension points to prevent ossification of their
    current usage patterns by middleboxes or DNS implementations. This document describes
    considerations and proposals for applying grease to the DNS protocol. Discussion
    Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Source for this
    draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/ietf-wg-dnsop/draft-ietf-dnsop-grease.</p>"
