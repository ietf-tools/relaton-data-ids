abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF currently meets three times per year in various parts of the
    world. Somewhere around 1,000 people all get into planes, consume carbon, and
    then attend various meetings in what often is a jetlagged stupor. We gotta stop
    meeting like this. This draft calls on the LLC to research on the community's
    behalf new modalities for IETF face-to-face meetings.</p>"
