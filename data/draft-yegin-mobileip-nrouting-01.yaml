abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP working group is currently examining proposals to assist
    in minimizing the latency and packet loss due to handoffs when a Mobile IPv6 node
    moves from one point of attachment to another. One of the desires to reduce this
    latency and packet loss is a result of the strict requirements of real-time network
    services. This proposal specifies a solution whereby the mobile node sends a binding
    update with multiple care-of-addresses which match the current link and other
    links that the mobile node may possibly visit next. After receiving such a binding
    update, the correspondent nodes and home agent use a new routing header extension
    to route the packet that will be received by the mobile node at one of the possible
    care-of-addresses. Thus, the correspondent nodes and home agent can still communicate
    with the mobile node despite not knowing its exact location while the mobile node
    moves across links. The proposal presents no new networking entities and the resulting
    architecture describes a natural extension to the Mobile IPv6 protocol.</p>"
