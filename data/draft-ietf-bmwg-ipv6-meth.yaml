abstract:
- content: "<p>The benchmarking methodologies defined in RFC 2544 are IP version independent.
    However, RFC 2544 does not address some of the specificities of IPv6. This document
    provides additional benchmarking guidelines, which in conjunction with RFC 2544,
    lead to a more complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance of network
    interconnect devices. IPv6 transition mechanisms are outside the scope of this
    document. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
