abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes few 5G mobility scenarios and how mobile network
    functions map its SST criteria to identifiers in IP packets that transport segments
    use to grant transport layer services. This is based on mapping between mobile
    and IP transport underlays (IPv6, MPLS, IPv4) and a new transport network underlay
    routing mechanism, Preferred Path Routing (PPR), which brings slice properties
    and works with any underlying transport (L2, IPv4, SR and MPLS) is described.</p>"
