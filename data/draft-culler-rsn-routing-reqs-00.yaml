abstract:
- content: "<p>The need for high quality routing for Sensor networks comprised of
    highly constrained devices (CPU, memory,...) in sometimes unstable wireless environments
    is critical now and will continue to increase. Interest in this class of applications
    has grown dramatically in recent years and a routing solution addressing the specific
    environments of such networks is highly required considering the numerous, incompatible
    open-source and proprietary routing protocols as well as several industrial forums.
    The aim of this document is to define the routing requirements for Sensor Networks
    at the IP layer. Such routing protocol(s) would need to address several unique
    aspects of this class of embedded devices and would operate in networks comprising
    links of various nature.</p>"
