abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) introduces new mobility entities: the local
    mobility anchor (LMA) and the mobile access gateway (MAG). The LMA and MAG manage
    bi-directional tunnels between themselves to provide a network-based mobility
    service to mobile nodes (MNs) within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain (PMIPv6-Domain).
    The failure of LMA connected with its MAGs causes the communication failure of
    MNs attached to the MAGs. Thus, the early failure detection of LMA is desirable
    for appropriate countermeasures. This document specifies a heartbeat mechanism
    for LMAs to detect the current reachability between the LMAs.</p>"
