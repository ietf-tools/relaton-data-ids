abstract:
- content: "<p>Enterprise networks provide a secured data communications infrastructure
    built for the purpose of information sharing and increased productivity for end
    users within the organization. Enterprise networks are often organized as private
    Internets unto themselves that connect to the global Internet either not at all
    or via firewalls, proxies, and/or other network securing devices. This document
    discusses an AERO enterprise network profile that outlines new and more flexible
    methods for connecting, tracking and managing mobile organizational assets.</p>"
