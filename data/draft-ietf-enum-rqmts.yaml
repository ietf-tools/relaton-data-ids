abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper defines the requirements for a DNS-based architecture and
    protocols for mapping a telephone number to a set of attributes (e.g., URLs) which
    can be used to contact a resource associated with that number. There are many
    possible protocols that can be considered for a telephone number mapping service.
    The purpose of this document is to focus discussion on a DNS-based solution. The
    intention is to enumerate the expectations of such a solution and to clarify the
    scope.</p>"
