abstract:
- content: <p>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses that
    are not globally-unique. Examples are the addresses designated in RFC 1918 for
    private use within individual sites. Devices in such environments may occasionally
    originate Domain Name System (DNS) queries (so-called "reverse lookups") corresponding
    to those private-use addresses. Since the addresses concerned have only local
    significance, it is good practice for site administrators to ensure that such
    queries are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to
    follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered
    within the site. It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers
    to such queries. In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use addresses
    and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large
    and growing. The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed sink for such queries
    in order to reduce the load on the corresponding authoritative servers. The AS112
    project is named after the Autonomous System Number (ASN) that was assigned to
    it. RFC6304 described the steps required to install a new AS112 node, and offered
    advice relating to such a node's operation. This document updates that advice
    to facilitate the addition and removal of zones for which query traffic will be
    sunk at AS112 nodes, using DNAME, whilst still supporting direct delegations to
    AS112 name servers. This document obsoletes RFC6304.</p>
