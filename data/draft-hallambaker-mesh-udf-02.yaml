abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the naming and addressing schemes used in the
    Mathematical Mesh. The means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint (UDF) values
    and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs are described. A UDF consists
    of a binary sequence, the initial eight bits of which specify a type identifier
    code. Type identifier codes have been selected so as to provide a useful mnemonic
    indicating their purpose when presented in Base32 encoding. Two categories of
    UDF are described. Data UDFs provide a compact presentation of a fixed length
    binary data value in a format that is convenient for data entry. A Data UDF may
    represent a cryptographic key, a nonce value or a share of a secret. Fingerprint
    UDFs provide a compact presentation of a Message Digest or Message Authentication
    Code value. A Strong Internet Name (SIN) consists of a DNS name which contains
    at least one label that is a UDF fingerprint of a policy document controlling
    interpretation of the name. SINs allow a direct trust model to be applied to achieve
    end-to-end security in existing Internet applications without the need for trusted
    third parties. UDFs may be presented as URIs to form either names or locators
    for use with the UDF location service. An Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locator
    (EARL) is a UDF locator URI presenting a service from which an encrypted resource
    may be obtained and a symmetric key that may be used to decrypt the content. EARLs
    may be presented on paper correspondence as a QR code to securely provide a machine-
    readable version of the same content. This may be applied to automate processes
    such as invoicing or to provide accessibility services for the partially sighted.
