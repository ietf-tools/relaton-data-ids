abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the enforcement
    of an IP forwarding policy by COPS-PR-enabled routers. Instances of such classes
    reside in a virtual information store, which is called the IP Forwarding Policy
    Information Base. The corresponding IP forwarding policy provisioning data are
    intended for use by a COPS-PR IP TE Client-Type, and they complement the PRC classes
    that have been defined in the Framework PIB.</p>"
