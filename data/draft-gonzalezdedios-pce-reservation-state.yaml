abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. A limited form of statefulness is useful to
    improve PCE functionality in situations in which the local TED might not be up
    to date, or in the case of concurrent requests where most of the LSPs are computed
    before the end of the set-up of the LSPs, when the TED is updated. The PCC is
    responsible to setup or not the TE-Path computed by the PCE. By providing an indication
    that it intends to use the resources on the TE-Path a PCC can help the PCE to
    get a more accurate dynamic TED view and thus the PCE can avoid suggesting the
    use of the same resources for subsequent TE LSPs. This document proposes an extension
    to the PCEP protocol to allow the PCC to indicate to the PCE to block or reserve
    the resources computed in a path request of a TE LSP for subsequent requests for
    a certain time and can help to reduce the number of crankbacks.</p>"
