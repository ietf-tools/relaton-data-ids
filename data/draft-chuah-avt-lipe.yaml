abstract:
- content: "<p>Several application level multiplexing/compression schemes have been
    proposed in the IETF Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group [1][2][9] to improve
    the transport efficiency of packet-voice traffic over IP-based networks. These
    approaches generally assume voice packets are encapsulated in RTP/UDP/IP by the
    communicating end- points (e.g., IP phones, mobile terminal, media gateways, etc.).
    In some transport scenarios, e.g., CDMA/GSM cellular networks, using RTP for voice
    packet is unnecessary as only the data transfer services provided by the IP/UDP
    layer, not the media control functions of RTP, are required.</p>"
