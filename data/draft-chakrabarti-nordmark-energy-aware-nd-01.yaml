abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for neighbor's
    address resolution, unreachability detection, address autoconfiguration, router
    advertisement and solicitation. With the progress of Internet adoption on various
    industries including home, wireless and machine-to-machine communications, there
    is a desire for optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol for energy-
    efficient networks and nodes. Research indicates that often networked- nodes require
    more energy than stand-alone nodes because a node's energy usage depends on network
    messages it receives and responds. While reducing energy consumption is essential
    for battery operated nodes in some machines, saving energy actually a cost factor
    in business in general as the explosion of more device usage is leading to usage
    of more servers and network infrastructure in all sectors of the society and business.
    This document describes a method of optimizations by reducing periodic multicast
    messages, frequent Neighbor Solicitation messages and discusses interoperability
    with legacy IPv6 nodes. This document also addresses the ND denial of service
    issues by introducing node Registration procedure.</p>"
