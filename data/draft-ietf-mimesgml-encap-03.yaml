abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an encapsulation of a Standard Generalized
    Markup Language (SGML) document within a MIME message. The document may be represented
    in the message by some or all of its components. The MIME message may also include
    auxiliary information to be used by the recipient in processing the encapsulated
    SGML. This document proposes a new content sub-type Application/SGML-notation,
    and a new header, Content-SGML-Entity. This specification uses the proposed Multipart/Related
    Content-Type [RFC-1872] which provides the mechanism for treating the set of SGML
    components as a single object.</p>"
