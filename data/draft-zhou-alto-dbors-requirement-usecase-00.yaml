abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces the new challenges for the network brought by
    massive access services under the background of the convergence of the cloud and
    the network which acquires the network to identify and convey the information
    of fine-grain user and application requirements, aiming to fulfill differentiated
    service provisioning and improve the comprehensive utilization of network resources.
    The draft raises the scope of current solution gap analysis and further proposes
    the definition of DB-ORS in which network capabilities are abstracted as atomic
    services and can be orchestrated by applications. Scenarios of cloud access and
    DCI are outlined to clarify the concepts and principles of DB-ORS in overcoming
    challenges.</p>"
