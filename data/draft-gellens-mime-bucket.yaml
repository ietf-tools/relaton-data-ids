abstract:
- content: <p>Several MIME type/subtype combinations exist that can contain different
    media formats. A receiving agent thus needs to examine the details of such media
    content to determine if the specific elements can be rendered given an available
    set of codecs. Especially when the end system has limited resources, or the connection
    to the end system has limited bandwidth, it would be helpful to know from the
    Content-Type alone if the content can be rendered. This document adds a new parameter,
    "codecs", to various type/subtype combinations to allow for unambiguous specification
    of the codecs indicated by the media formats contained within. By labeling content
    with the specific codecs indicated to render the contained media, receiving systems
    can determine if the codecs are supported by the end system, and if not, can take
    appropriate action (such as rejecting the content, sending notification of the
    situation, transcoding the content to a supported type, fetching and installing
    the required codecs, further inspection to determine if it will be sufficient
    to support a subset of the indicated codecs, etc.) [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
