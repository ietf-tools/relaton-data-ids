abstract:
- content: "<p>Network security incidents, such as system compromises, worms, viruses,
    phishing incidents, and denial of service, typically result in the loss of service,
    data, and resources both human and system. Network providers and Computer Security
    Incident Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating
    and tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence
    of an attack. Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network
    communication method to facilitate sharing incident handling data while integrating
    existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms
    for a complete incident handling solution. Combining these capabilities in a communication
    system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks. Policy guidelines
    for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium
    using the security recommendations and considerations. RID has found use within
    the international research communities, but has not been widely adopted in other
    sectors. This publication provides the specification to those communities that
    have adopted it, and communities currently considering solutions for real-time
    inter-network defense. The specification may also accelerate development of solutions
    where different transports or message formats are required by leveraging the data
    elements and structures specified here. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
