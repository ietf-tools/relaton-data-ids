abstract:
- content: "<p>Used in a Massive Data Center (MDC), BGP-LS and BGP-SPF need link neighbor
    discovery, liveness, and addressability data. Link State Over Ethernet protocols
    provide link discovery, exchange AFI/SAFIs, and discover addresses over raw Ethernet.
    These data are pushed directly to BGP-LS/SPF, obviating the need for centralized
    controller architectures. This protocol is more widely applicable, and has been
    designed to support a wide range of routing and similar protocols which need link
    discovery and characterisation.</p>"
