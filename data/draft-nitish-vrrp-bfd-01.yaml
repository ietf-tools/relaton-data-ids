abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents an enhanced failure detection mechanism to detect
    the failure of VRRP Master router on the LAN using a peer learning mode. Typically
    the VRRP protocol is able to perform the transparent fail-over detection within
    a time period of 3 seconds with default fail-over timers. Real-time protocols
    (voice/video/real-time transactional) require a maximum network disruption in
    the order of 150ms for traffic on the network. A failure detection and fail-over
    time of 150ms on conventionally configured VRRP protocol is extremely aggressive
    and may impact the reliability and performance of the network. A more efficient
    mechanism for real-time failure detection can be enabled in VRRP protocol by building
    a peer table, using a new VRRP Advert packet type. This will help in forming a
    mesh of BFD sessions. Once the BFD sessions are created, VRRP can receive faster
    notification of failures, without the overhead of increased VRRP protocol Advert
    messages.</p>"
