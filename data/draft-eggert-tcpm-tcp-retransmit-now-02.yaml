abstract:
- content: "<p>This document classifies connectivity disruptions along an end-to-end
    path into four types and describes how standard TCP mechanisms can lead to inefficient
    or over-aggressive sending behavior when connectivity resumes. The proposed techniques
    for TCP mobility detection and response (LMDR) can improve behavior for some types
    of disruptions. This document describes another, complementary and orthogonal
    modification to TCP's retransmission scheme that improves performance for disruption
    types that TCP LMDR does not address. This extension is based on connectivity
    indicators, i.e., generic network events that may indicate that end-to-end connectivity
    has resumed. This document focuses on TCP modifications that use connectivity
    indicators to increase performance, but does not define the specifics of such
    connectivity indicators itself.</p>"
