abstract:
- content: <p>Many service providers have been exploring distributed computing techniques
    to achieve better service response time and optimized energy consumption. Such
    techniques rely upon the distribution of computing services and capabilities over
    many locations in the network, such as its edge, the metro region, virtualized
    central office, and other locations. In such a distributed computing environment,
    providing services by utilizing computing resources hosted in various computing
    facilities (e.g., edges) is being considered, e.g., for computationally intensive
    and delay sensitive services. Ideally, services should be computationally balanced
    using service-specific metrics instead of simply dispatching the service requests
    in a static way or optimizing solely connectivity metrics. For example, systematically
    directing end user-originated service requests to the geographically closest edge
    or some small computing units may lead to an unbalanced usage of computing resources,
    which may then degrade both the user experience and the overall service performance.
    We have named this kind of network with dynamic sharing of edge compute resources
    "Computing-Aware Networking" (CAN). This document provides the problem statement
    and the typical scenarios of CAN, which is to provide the service equivalency
    by steering traffic dynamically to the appropriate service instance based on the
    basic edge computing deployment.</p>
