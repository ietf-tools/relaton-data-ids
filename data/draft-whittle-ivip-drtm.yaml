abstract:
- content: <p>Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM) is intended for Ivip, but may be
    useful for other Core-Edge Separation solutions to the routing scaling problem,
    such as LISP. End-user networks - or other organizations they appoint - control
    the mapping of each or their one or more micronets (ranges of "edge" space with
    a single mapping) via sending commands to the organizations from whom they lease
    this space. This is conveyed to all ITRs which need it in "real-time" such as
    a second or two, globally. There is no need for any single set of servers to handle
    all the mapping updates, or to store all the mapping databases for all the MABs
    (Mapped Address Block) of "edge" space. Networks with ITRs use purely caching
    Resolving query servers (QSRs), in contrast to previous Ivip arrangements which
    required them to run a query server which contained the real-time updated full
    mapping database for all MABs.</p>
