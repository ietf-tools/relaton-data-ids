abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous
    Internet connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support). In contrast, network
    mobility support is concerned with situations where an entire network changes
    its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the topology.
    We shall refer to such a network as a mobile network (MONET). This document tries
    to identify what constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of a
    potentially and ideally good solution, and what requirements solutions must comply
    to. Our main aim is to raise the discussion on the mailing list.</p>"
