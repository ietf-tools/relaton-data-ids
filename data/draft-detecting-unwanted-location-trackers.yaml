abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists a set of best practices and protocols for accessory
    manufacturers whose products have built-in location- tracking capabilities. By
    following these requirements and recommendations, a location-tracking accessory
    will be compatible with unwanted tracking detection and alerts on mobile platforms.
    This is an important capability for improving the privacy and safety of individuals
    in the circumstance that those accessories are used to track their location without
    their knowledge or consent.</p>"
