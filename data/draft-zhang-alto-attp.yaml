abstract:
- content: <p>Currently P2P applications have accounts for large cross-ISP traffic.
    This document proposes a method to reduce cross-ISP traffic by setting cooperative
    ISP-friendly trackers in the ISP's network. Through improving the random node
    selection mechanism in P2P tracker-based application, we can effectively reduce
    cross-ISP traffic as well as the cost of network equipments and network operation.
