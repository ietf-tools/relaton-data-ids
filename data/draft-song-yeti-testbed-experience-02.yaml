abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports and discusses issues in DNS root services, based
    on experiences from the experiments in the Yeti DNS project. These issues include
    IPv6-only operation, the root DNS server naming scheme, DNSSEC KSK rollover, root
    server renumbering, multiple root zone signer, and so on. This project was founded
    in May 2015 and has since built a live root DNS server system testbed with volunteer
    root server and resolver operations. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: Although this
    document is submitted as an independent submission, comments are welcome in the
    IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) working group mailing list. The source of the document
    is currently placed at GitHub [xml-file].</p>"
