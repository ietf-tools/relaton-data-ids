abstract:
- content: "<p>According to RFC 7176, DRB on a link uses the Appointed Forwarders
    sub-TLV to inform other ISs on the link that they are the designated VLAN-x forwarder
    for one or more ranges of VLAN IDs. Appointed Forwarders sub-tlv has Appointed
    Information field which carries information about Appointee Nickname, Start.VLAN
    and End.VLAN. Both Start.VLAN and VLAN.end to the same value indicates a range
    of one VLAN ID, if they are different then the Appointed RBridge is AF for that
    range of VLAN ID's. If end-station's VLAN's are configured in discontiguous/discreet
    [1,3,5,7 etc] way then DRB has to send Appointed Information equal to number of
    Discreet VLAN's Appointed for a particular RBridge. The problem will worsen if
    huge number of endstation VLAN's are discreet. This paper is an attempt to handle
    such scenarios.</p>"
