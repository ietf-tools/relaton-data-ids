abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum is a companion document to the current version of the
    RTP protocol specification draft-ietf-avt-rtp-*.{txt,ps}. It discusses aspects
    of transporting real-time services (such as voice or video) over the Internet.
    It compares and evaluates design alternatives for a real-time transport protocol,
    providing rationales for the design decisions made for RTP. Also covered are issues
    of port assignment and multicast address allocation. A comprehensive glossary
    of terms related to multimedia conferencing is provided. This document is a product
    of the Audio-Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task
    Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing
    list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the author(s).</p>"
