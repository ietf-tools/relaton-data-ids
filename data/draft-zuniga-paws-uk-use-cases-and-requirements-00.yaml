abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simplification of the PAWS database discovery
    use case, two new use cases for indoor networking and machine to machine communications,
    and a set of requirements that drop out of all the use cases included so far in
    the working document. These use cases and requirements especially address the
    TV White Spaces needs in the United Kingdom, as currently known.</p>"
