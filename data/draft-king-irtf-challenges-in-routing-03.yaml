abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an
    interface on a network device. Routing protocols were developed based on the assumption
    that a destination address had this semantic. Over time, routing decisions were
    enhanced to route packets according to additional information carried within the
    packets and dependent on policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers.
    Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP addresses. The intent is
    usually to facilitate routing decisions based solely on the address and without
    the need to find and process information carried in other fields within the packets.
    This document describes the challenges to the existing routing system that are
    introduced by the addition of semantics to IP addresses. It then summarizes the
    opportunities for research into new or modified routing protocols to make use
    of new address semantics. This document is presented as study to support further
    research into clarifying and understanding the issues. It does not pass comment
    on the advisability or practicality of any of the proposals and does not define
    any technical solutions.</p>"
