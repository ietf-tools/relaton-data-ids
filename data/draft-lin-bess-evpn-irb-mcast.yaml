abstract:
- content: <p>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) provides a service that allows a single Local Area
    Network (LAN), i.e., a single IP subnet, to be distributed over multiple sites.
    The sites are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone. Intra-subnet traffic (either
    unicast or multicast) always appears to the endusers to be bridged, even when
    it is actually carried over the IP backbone. When a single "tenant" owns multiple
    such LANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those LANs.
    This document specifies new procedures that allow inter- subnet IP multicast traffic
    to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant, while still making intra-subnet
    IP multicast traffic appear to be bridged. These procedures can provide optimal
    routing of the inter-subnet multicast traffic, and do not require any such traffic
    to leave a given router and then reenter that same router. These procedures also
    accommodate IP multicast traffic that needs to travel to or from systems that
    are outside the EVPN domain.</p>
