abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes security threats related to the network mobility
    base protocol (NEMO). Threats of Mobile IPv6 for Mobile Hosts are only briefly
    touched when in need of support of related NEMO threats. The NEMO signalling between
    MR and HA, as well as the forwarding information at HA and nested mobility configurations
    are considered to be the main sensitive points of the protocol. Existing tools
    of Mobile IPv6 protection between MH and HA (IPsec), dynamic routing protocol
    authentication, NEMO prefix table, ingress filtering checks at HA and tunnel encapsulation
    limiting are presented as protocol features affording protection against threats.
    NEMO threats for which there are no protections are briefly mentioned.</p>"
