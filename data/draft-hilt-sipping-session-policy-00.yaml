abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the establishment
    of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In that role, they define
    and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call features. However,
    there is no standard means by which network elements can have any influence on
    session policies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc and
    non-conformant techniques have been deployed to allow for such session policy
    mechanisms. In this document, we discuss a complete and standards-based mechanism
    for session policies.</p>"
