abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to provide operational guidelines for datacenter
    operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their infrastructures. It aims to offer a
    reference framework for evaluating different products and architectures, and therefore
    it is also addressed to manufacturers and solution providers, so they can use
    it to gauge their solutions. We believe this will translate in a smoother and
    faster IPv6 transition for datacenters of these infrastuctures. The document focuses
    on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation, and the aspects related to DC
    interconnection through IPv6. It does not consider the particular mechanisms for
    making Internet services provided by applications hosted in the DC available through
    IPv6 beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployment on the Data Center
    (DC) infrastructure. Apart from facilitating the transition to IPv6, the mechanisms
    outlined here are intended to make this transition as transparent as possible
    (if not completely transparent) to applications and services running on the DC
    infrastructure, as well as to take advantage of IPv6 features to simplify DC operations,
    internally and across the Internet.</p>"
