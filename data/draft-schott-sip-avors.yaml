abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the AVORS (Avoiding Registration Storms) concept
    that allows the resumption of active registrations. The concept can be mapped
    on any architecture having a distributed structure and could work for different
    protocols. The concept is exemplary explained here regarding an architecture for
    voice and is mapped on a 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) architecture.
    This document describes the AVORS (Avoiding Registration Storms) concept that
    allows the resumption of active UE (User Equipment) registrations on other Outbound
    Proxies (P-CSCF) within the SIP voice architecture. The AVORS concept increases
    service continuity, improves network resilience, and offers savings potential.
    Additionally, this document gives an outlook regarding stateless voice architectures,
    load calculation aspects, and Service Based Interfaces (SBI) in context data base
    interworking. Security aspects are considered in the security chapter. As stated
    above the AVORS principle is not only limited to the SIP protocol and could be
    adopted by other protocols.</p>"
