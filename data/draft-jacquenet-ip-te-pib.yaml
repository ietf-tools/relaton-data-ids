abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the enforcement
    of an IP traffic engineering policy by COPS-PR ([2])- capable routers. Instances
    of such classes reside in a virtual information store, which is called the IP
    Traffic Engineering Policy Information Base (IP TE PIB). The corresponding IP
    TE policy provisioning data are intended for use by the COPS-PR IP TE Client-
    Type([3]), and they will complement the PRC classes that have been defined in
    the Framework PIB ([4]).</p>"
