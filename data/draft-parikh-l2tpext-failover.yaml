abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) [RFC 2661] provides a standard
    method for tunneling PPP [RFC 1661] packets. This document describes an extension
    to L2TP that provides a mechanism to support a failover to a hot standby unit
    and a continued L2TP operation with a goal to minimize payload data loss during
    fail over</p>"
