abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF ALTO protocol provides guidance to content delivery applications
    such as P2P or Content Delivery Networks (CDN), which have to select one or several
    hosts or endpoints from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired
    data resource. This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance
    and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, for instance the topological
    distance or the routing cost between them. To this end, ALTO Servers deployed
    by Network Operators (NO), provide requesting ALTO Clients with information, currently
    such as the NO- centric view on the network topology, the candidate application
    endpoints with attributes such as their connectivity type. The present draft proposes
    to extend the cost information provided by the ALTO protocol by providing, for
    a same cost metric, several possible cost values. Which value to provide depends
    on qualitative criteria as opposed to quantitative criteria such as time. The
    purpose is to allow a finer grained decision on which application endpoint or
    sub network to access given that their routing cost values may depend on criteria
    suh as the access technology of the end system consuming the resources or the
    policy applied for the client requesting ALTO information.</p>"
