abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the Management Information Base (MIB) for the
    Next Hop Routing Protocol (NHRP). The NHRP protocol is a protocol for allowing
    IP source stations on a switched Non Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) network
    such as ATM or X.25 to determine the NBMA switched circuit (i.e. 'physical') address
    of other stations attached to the same NBMA network. Protocols such as ARP provide
    this function only for IP destinations in the same Logical IP Subnet (LIS) as
    the source. NHRP permits this resolution for destinations on a different LIS.
    NHRP is described in [NHRP].</p>"
