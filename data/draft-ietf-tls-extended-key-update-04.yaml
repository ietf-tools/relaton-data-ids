abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 specification provides forward
    secrecy by utilizing an ephemeral key exchange during the initial handshake. Forward
    secrecy ensures that even if an attacker later obtains a party's long-term private
    key, past encrypted sessions cannot be decrypted. This protects against adversaries
    who record encrypted conversations in the hope of decrypting them later. TLS 1.3
    also includes a Key Update mechanism, allowing cryptographic keys to be refreshed
    during an ongoing session. However, this update does not establish new forward-secret
    key material. While this is generally not an issue for short-lived sessions, it
    can pose a security risk for long-lived connections, such as those in industrial
    IoT or telecommunication networks, where an attacker could compromise application
    traffic secrets after the initial handshake. Earlier versions of TLS supported
    session renegotiation, a mechanism that allowed peers to establish new cryptographic
    parameters within an existing session. This included the ability to update the
    originally used long-term keys (certificates) with renewed credentials. However,
    due to security vulnerabilities, the renegotiation mechanism was modified via
    RFC 5746 and later removed entirely in TLS 1.3, leaving a gap in TLS's ability
    to refresh cryptographic material securely. This specification introduces an extended
    key update mechanism that supports forward secrecy, forcing attackers to continuously
    exfiltrate key material throughout the session to decrypt the entire conversation.</p>"
