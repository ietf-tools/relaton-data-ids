abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used by
    Internet application protocols is the transmission of clear-text passwords over
    a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS). There are some significant
    security concerns with that mechanism, which could be addressed by the use of
    a challenge response authentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately,
    the HTTP Digest challenge response mechanism presently on the standards track
    failed widespread deployment, and have had success only in limited use. This specification
    describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge
    Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which addresses security concerns with
    HTTP Digest and meets the deployability requirements. When used in combination
    with TLS or an equivalent security layer, a mechanism from this family could improve
    the status-quo for HTTP authentication.</p>"
