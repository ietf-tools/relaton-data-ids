abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes those features of a service which processes
    signed doucments which must be present in order for that service to constitute
    a 'technical non-repudiation' service. A technical non-repudiation service must
    permit an independent verifier to determine whether a given signature was applied
    to a given data object by the private key associated with a given valid certificate,
    at a time later than the signature. The features of a technical non-repudiation
    service are expected to be necessary for a full non-repudiation service, although
    they may not be sufficient. This document is intended to clarify the definition
    of the 'non-repudiation' service in RFC 2459. It should thus serve as a guide
    to when the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage extension should be used and to
    when a Certificate Authority is required to archive CRL's.</p>"
