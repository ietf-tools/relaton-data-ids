abstract:
- content: <p>Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing depend on that the
    target data does not change during serialization, transport, or parsing. By applying
    the rules defined by JCS (JSON Canonicalization Scheme), data provided in the
    JSON [RFC8259] format can be exchanged "as is", while still being subject to secure
    cryptographic operations. JCS achieves this by combining the strict serialization
    of JSON primitives defined in ECMAScript [ES6] with a platform independent sorting
    scheme. The intended audiences of this document are JSON tool vendors, as well
    as designers of JSON based cryptographic solutions.</p>
