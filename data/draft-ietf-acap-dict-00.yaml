abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] is designed to
    support remote storage and access of common application option, configuration
    and preference information. Its main benefits are in providing a way for users
    to gain access to personal information from any computer at a location supporting
    an internet connection, by keeping this information stored centrally on a server.
    Additionally, it allows 'kiosk' style use of computers so that users do not need
    to store data locally on a shared or public workstation or network computer. This
    specification defines a standard dataset class for personal dictionaries that
    would allow users to keep one or more 'user dictionaries' stored on an ACAP server
    for access by any ACAP-aware application that requires such information, for example
    any application that uses a spell checker.</p>"
