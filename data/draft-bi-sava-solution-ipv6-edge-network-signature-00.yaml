abstract:
- content: "<p>Today's Internet is suffering from reflection-type DoS/DDoS attacks,
    such as TCP SYN flood, Smurf attack, DNS reflection, etc. These attacks often
    rely on the IP source address spoofing. Current source address spoofing prevention
    methods have a coarse granularity, and the attackers can still in some cases launch
    reflection-type DoS/DDos attacks or other attacks while being difficult to trace.
    Aiming to solve this problem, this document proposes a fine-granularity source
    address spoofing prevention method, which can prevent the attackers from forging
    source addresses that belong to the same edge network to send packets to somewhere
    outside the IPv6 edge network. The proposed method includes source address authentication
    using session key and hash digest algorithms and replay attack prevention by combining
    a sequence number method with a timestamp method.</p>"
