abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the use of triggers coming from layers higher
    than the link layer to initiate the Low Latency Handoff in Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4)
    . The Low Latency Handoff for MIPv4 assumes availability of Layer 2 (L2) triggers
    that contain Layer 3 (L3) information for the Mobile Node (MN) to handoff. However,
    the low latency draft does not describe the method by which the L2 trigger is
    produced neither does it explicitly describe by what mechanism the L3 information
    present in the L2 trigger is acquired. The Low Latency Handoff for MIPv4 relies
    on availability of the L2 trigger. However relying only on the link information
    to initiate a handoff does not generally gather enough information for the MN
    to handoff to the most suitable available access network. Information from higher
    layers such as Higher Layer Triggers can be used to command a MN to quickly move
    from one access to another one. Using Higher Layer Triggers to initiate the handoff
    enables the implementation of policy based handoff to garantee load balancing
    of the wireless networks and Quality of Services to the end users.</p>"
