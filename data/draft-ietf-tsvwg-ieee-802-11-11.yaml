abstract:
- content: "<p>As Internet traffic is increasingly sourced from and destined to wireless
    endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service (QoS) be aligned between wired
    and wireless networks; however, this is not always the case by default. This document
    specifies a set of mappings from Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to
    IEEE 802.11 User Priority (UP) to reconcile the marking recommendations offered
    by the IETF and the IEEE so as to maintain consistent QoS treatment between wired
    and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.</p>"
