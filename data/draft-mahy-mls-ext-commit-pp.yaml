abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows authorized non-
    members to join a group via external commits, however it disallows most pending
    proposals in those commits, which causes unfortunate side effects. This document
    describes an MLS extension to include pending proposal in external commits when
    the extension is present in a group.</p>"
