abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a procedure for performing the downgrading
    of old Proposed and Draft standards described in RFC 2026 without placing an unreasonable
    load on groups charged with performing other tasks in the IETF. It defines a new
    group, called the 'Commission for Protocol Obsolesence', which shall recommend
    to the IESG downgrading or progressing documents on the IETF standards track.
    Ultimate decisions still rest of with the IESG, with appeal to the IAB.</p>"
