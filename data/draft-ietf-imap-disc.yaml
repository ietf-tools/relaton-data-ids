    a disconnected IMAP4 client. In particular, it deals with the issues of what might
    be called the 'driver' portion of the synchronization tool: the portion of the
    code responsible for issuing the correct set of IMAP4 commands to synchronize
    the disconnected client in the way that is most likely to make the human who uses
    the disconnected client happy.</p>"
