abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection,
    yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple
    paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network, and
    thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience
    to network failure. Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple
    paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional
    TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service
    to applications as TCP - reliable bytestream - and provides the components necessary
    to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</p>"
