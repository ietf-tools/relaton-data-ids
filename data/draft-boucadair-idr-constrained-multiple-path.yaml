abstract:
- content: "<p>It is commonly agreed the continuous increase of routing tables is
    a sensitive issue which may question the sustainability of the Internet. This
    document describes a solution which makes use of multiple paths without inducing
    drastic increase of routing tables. A constrained procedure to install additional
    paths in the RIB is described. Multiple paths are installed according to rules
    agreed between adjacent peers and also based on external events (e.g., pro- active
    detection of link congestion).</p>"
