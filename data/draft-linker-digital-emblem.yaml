abstract:
- content: "<p>In times of armed conflict, the protective emblems of the red cross,
    red crescent, and red crystal are used to mark _physical_ assets. This enables
    military units to identify assets as respected and protected under international
    humanitarian law. This draft explores how one could apply the protective emblems
    to _digital_, network- connected infrastructure using a _digital emblem_, and
    defines the requirements of a digital emblem, emphasizing security requirements.
    Notably, a digital emblem has a unique combination of security requirements, namely,
    authentication, accountability, and a property that we call _covert inspection_.
    Covert inspection means that those wishing to authenticate assets as protected
    must be able to do so without revealing that they may attack unprotected entities.</p>"
