abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Proof Token (JPT) is a compact, URL-safe, privacy-preserving representation
    of claims to be transferred between three parties. The claims in a JPT are encoded
    as base64url-encoded JSON objects that are used as the payloads of a JSON Web
    Proof (JWP) (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-proof- 00.html)
    structure, enabling them to be digitally signed and selectively disclosed. JPTs
    also support reusability and unlinkability when using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs).</p>"
