abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology
    information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to
    Internet routing tables at looking glass servers are available and can be practically
    downloaded to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of
    the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words,
    what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute
    it. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides network
    information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network
    paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while
    maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information of ALTO
    is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified view,
    yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize
    them. Additional services are built on top of the maps. This document describes
    a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. Although the ALTO Service would primarily
    be provided by ISPs, other entities such as content service providers could also
    operate an ALTO Service. Applications that could use this service are those that
    have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples of such applications are
    peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"
