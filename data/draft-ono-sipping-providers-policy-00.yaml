abstract:
- content: "<p>Some service providers who operate SIP proxy servers and registrars
    need to be able to express various types of policies to their customers, such
    as media policies and security policies. Discussion needs to take place about
    the types of policies and how they will have an impact on SIP User Agents (UA)s.
    This document presents an overview of the types of policies that might be available,
    and how the operations of policies might be executed to aid in advancing the current
    discussions on session policies.</p>"
