abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to provide a list of the frequently asked questions
    (FAQs) posed by IETF meeting attendees regarding travel logistics and local information.
    It is intended to assist those who are willing to provide local information, so
    that if they wish to pre-populate answers to some or all of these questions either
    in the IETF wiki or a meeting-specific site, they have a reasonably complete list
    of ideas to draw from. It is not meant as a list of required information that
    the host or Secretariat needs to provide; it merely serves as a guideline. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
