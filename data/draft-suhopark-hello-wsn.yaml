abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, We consider Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) security
    and focus our attention to tolerate damage caused by an adversary who has compromised
    deployed sensor node to modify, block, or inject packets. We adopt a probabilistic
    secret sharing protocol where secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not
    exposed to any other nodes. Adapting to WSN characteristics, we incorporate these
    secrets with bidirectional verification and multipath routing to multiple base
    stations to defend against HELLO flood attacks. We then analytically show that
    our defense mechanisms against HELLO flood attack can tolerate damage caused by
    an intruder</p>"
