abstract:
- content: "<p>With the quick deployment of 5G networks in the world, cloud-based
    interactive applications (services) such as cloud gaming have gained substantial
    attention and are regarded as potential killer applications. To ensure users'
    quality of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may require not only
    high bandwidth (e.g., high- resolution media transmission) but also low delay
    (e.g., low latency and low lagging). However, the bandwidth and delay experienced
    by a mobile and wireless user can be dynamic, as a function of many factors, and
    unhandled changes can substantially compromise the user's QoE. In this document,
    we investigate network-aware applications (NAA), which realize cloud based interactive
    services with improved QoE, by efficient utilization of a solution named Mobile
    and Wireless Information Exposure (MoWIE). In particular, this document demonstrates,
    through realistic evaluations, that mobile network information such as MCS (Modulation
    and Coding Scheme) can effectively expose the dynamicity of the underlying network
    and can be made available to applications through MoWIE; using such information,
    the applications can then adapt key control knobs such as media codec scheme,
    encapsulation, and application layer processing to minimize QoE deduction. Based
    on the evaluations, we discuss how the MoWIE features can define extensions of
    the ALTO protocol, to expose more lower-layer and finer grain network dynamics.</p>"
