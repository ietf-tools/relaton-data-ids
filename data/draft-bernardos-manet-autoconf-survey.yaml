abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft provides a detailed description of most of the
    existing IP autoconfiguration solutions proposed so far. The main aim of this
    document is to serve as a general reference for the AUTOCONF solution space. We
    present most of the previously proposed IP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs, showing
    their key characteristics. Furthermore, each solution is analysed based on a number
    of evaluation considerations.</p>"
