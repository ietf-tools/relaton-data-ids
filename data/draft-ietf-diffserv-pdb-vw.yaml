abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an edge-to-edge behavior, in diffserv terminology
    a per-domain behavior, called `Virtual Wire' (VW) that can be constructed in any
    domain supporting the diffserv EF PHB plus appropriate domain ingress policers.
    The VW behavior is essentially indistinguishable from a dedicated circuit and
    can be used anywhere it is desired to replace dedicated circuits with IP transport.
    Although one attribute of VW is the delivery of a peak rate, in VW this is explicitly
    coupled with a bounded jitter attribute. The document is a edited version of the
    earlier draft-ietf-diff- serv-ba-vw-00.txt with a new name to reflect a change
    in Diffserv WG terminology. A pdf version of this document is available at ftp://ftp.packet-
    design.com/ietf/vw_pdb_0.pdf</p>"
