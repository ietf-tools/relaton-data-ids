abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the IOAM DEX option,
    referred to as IOAM Marking. Similar to IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not carry
    the telemetry data in user packets but send the telemetry data through a dedicated
    packet. Unlike IOAM DEX, IOAM Marking does not require an extra instruction header.
    IOAM Marking raises some unique issues that need to be considered. This document
    formally describes the high level scheme and cover the common requirements and
    issues when applying IOAM Marking in different networks. IOAM Marking is complementary
    to the other on-path telemetry schemes such as IOAM trace and E2E options.</p>"
