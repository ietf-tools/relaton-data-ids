abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft outlines how a dual stack mobile node can be reached and
    communicate by means of both IPv4 and IPv6, even in situations where the mobile
    node is in reach of only either IPv4 or IPv6 networks. A Dual Stack Mobility Agent
    accommodates mobility and translates between IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It may operate
    as a mobility agent in its own right or as a module that relays traffic between
    existing single stack Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 home agents.</p>"
