abstract:
- content: <p>NTP's Reference ID, or REFID, identifies the source of time in a timestamp
    or time packet. In NTP packets sent over the network the REFID is used to identify
    the "system peer", and in the long-term general case its fundamental purpose is
    to prevent a one-degree timing loop. Each instance of NTP decides for itself what
    REFID it will put in its outgoing packets, and there is currently no way for an
    external time source to tell or recommend this value in the case where that external
    time source is selected as the "system peer." The SUGGESTED-REFID NTP Extension
    Field proposal is a backward- compatible way for a time source to tell its peers
    or clients "If you use me as your system peer, use this nonce as your REFID."</p>
