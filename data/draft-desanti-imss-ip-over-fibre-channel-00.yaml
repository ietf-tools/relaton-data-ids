- content: "<p>This document specifies the way of encapsulating IPv6, IPv4 and ARP
    packets over Fibre Channel. This document specifies also the method of forming
    IPv6 link-local addresses and statelessly autoconfigured IPv6 addresses on Fibre
    Channel networks, and a mechanism to perform IPv4 address resolution over Fibre
    Channel networks.</p>"
