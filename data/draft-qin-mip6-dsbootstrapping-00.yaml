abstract:
- content: "<p>DSMIPv6 [V4TRAVERSAL] defines how the dual-stack mobile node roams
    in the IPv4 network. It assumes that home agent and mobile node support mipv4
    and mipv6 protocol, and home agent could assign an IPv4 address for the mobile
    node. This assumption works during many scenarios. However, as the IPv4 address
    is a scarce resource in many countries, the mobile IPv6 home agent does not own
    Ipv4 address pools, not support IPv4 protocol and mobile IP4 protocol. In such
    scenario, a temporary ipv4 home address is more useful. [Routing] Focuses on the
    solution to such scenario. In this solution, mobile nodes get temporary IPv4 home
    addresses from the foreign home agent . The scenarios and solutions defined in
    [Routing] are the preliminary of this document. This document describes the bootstrapping
    of the dual-stack MIPv6-homed mobile entity in Mobile IPv4 network.</p>"
