abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an authenticated encryption algorithm called
    Double Nonce Derive Key AES-GCM (DNDK-GCM). It operates with a 32- byte root key
    and is designed to encrypt with a 24-byte random nonce (IV), and to provide for
    key commitment. Encryption takes the root key and a random nonce (IV), derives
    a fresh encryption key and a key commitment value, invokes AES-GCM with the derived
    key and a 12-byte zero nonce, and outputs the ciphertext, authentication tag and
    the key commitment value. Although this is not the primary targeted usage, it
    is also possible, under some restrictions, to use DNDK-GCM with a non-repeating
    but non-random nonce The low collision probability in a collection of 24-byte
    random nonces, together with the per-nonce derivation of an encryption key, extend
    the lifetime of the root key, and the scheme can support processing up to 2^64
    bytes under a given root key. DNDK-GCM introduces relatively small overhead compared
    to using AES- GCM directly, and its security relies only on the standard assumption
    that AES acts as a pseudorandom permutation</p>"
