abstract:
- content: "<p>Being able to trust information from sensors and to securely control
    actuators are essential in a world of connected and networking things interacting
    with the physical world. In this memo we show that just using COAP with a security
    protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not enough. We describe several serious
    attacks any on-path attacker can do, and discusses tougher requirements and mechanisms
    to mitigate the attacks. While this document is focused on actuators, some of
    the attacks apply equally well to sensors.</p>"
