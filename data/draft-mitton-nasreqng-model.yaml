abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the terminology and an operational model of
    typical Network Access Server (NAS). The purpose of this effort is to set the
    reference space for describing and evaluating NAS service protocols, such as RADIUS
    (RFC 2138, 2139) and follow-on efforts like Diameter (draft-calhoun-diameter-04.txt).
    These are protocols for carrying authentication, authorization, and user configuration
    information between a Network Access Server which desires to authenticate its
    calls and a shared Authentication Server.</p>"
