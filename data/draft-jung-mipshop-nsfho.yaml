abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses a network side solution of fast handover in
    Mobile IPv6. Existing FMIPv6 basically assumes the involvement of mobile nodes
    in handover procedure. However, in some cases, it may not be easy to realize fast
    handover function into all mobile nodes. In the case, a network operator may want
    to provide fast handover service to users by using only networks entities. To
    achieve network side fast handover, this document basically uses bi-directional
    tunnel between a previous access router and new access router. The proposed fast
    handover scheme has simpler procedure than the existing FMIPv6 and mostly uses
    the existing messages.</p>"
