abstract:
- content: "<p>MoQ is designed to serve live tracks over a CDN to viewers with varying
    latency and quality targets: the entire spectrum between real-time and VOD. However,
    it's difficult to understand how to use the transport given the layering and complexity
    of live media delivery. This document outlines how an application could use MoQ
    to deliver video, audio, and metadata in a variety of scenarios.</p>"
