abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a novel system called Mangrove for obtaining
    global visibility across the Internet. It achieves this through constructing a
    comprehensive, unified representation of the Internet's topology and routing behavior
    by aggregating and indexing diverse data sources. he core challenge is obtaining
    an accurate, up-to-date model of how packets traverse the global Internet given
    the Internet's vast scale, dynamic nature, and fragmented visibility across multiple
    organizations collecting data in different formats. Mangrove addresses this by
    leveraging the hierarchical structure and natural abstractions of Internet architecture.
    It collects and integrates data from traceroute measurements, BGP routing tables,
    IP allocation records, and active broadband measurements. This multi-source data
    is partitioned and indexed across multiple granularity levels - geographic regions,
    autonomous systems, and IP prefixes - allowing effective storage, querying, and
    scalable processing. Mangrove constructs a unified topology and routing representation
    augmented with an extensible ruleset derived from Internet axioms and measured
    data. For arbitrary source-destination pairs, it computes estimated packet paths
    and associated performance metrics at the highest feasible granularity level based
    on available information completeness. The system handles real-time Internet dynamics
    through incremental rule refinement using detected changes in routing data and
    measurements. This enables timely updates to the topology model without full recomputation.
    Mangrove aims to provide researchers and operators an unprecedented unified Internet
    view for analysis, optimization, planning, security, and regulatory tasks.</p>"
