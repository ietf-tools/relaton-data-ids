abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of
    SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the LSP can be calculated/set
    up/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a
    centralized PCE server to each network device along the path while leveraging
    the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This document specifies the
    procedures and PCEP extensions when a PCE-based controller is also responsible
    for configuring the forwarding actions on the routers, in addition to computing
    the paths for packet flows in a segment routing (SR) network and telling the edge
    routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter the network. PCECC
    is further enhanced for SR-MPLS SID (Segment Identifier) allocation and distribution.</p>"
