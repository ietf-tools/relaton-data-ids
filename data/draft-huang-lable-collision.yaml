abstract:
- content: "<p>Upstream Label Suggestion and upstream label allocation schemes are
    introduced and simply defined in [OVER][UPSTREAM]. But it is possible that the
    same label will be allocated for unicast LSP and multicast LSP on the same link.
    In upstream label allocation, it solves the collision through layer 2 encapsulation
    and context-specific label space. But in the Upstream Label Suggestion allocation
    scheme, the collision can not be solved if downstream LSRs do not support context-specific
    label space. This document details the solution of label collision between multicast
    and unicast for the Upstream Label Suggestion allocation scheme.</p>"
