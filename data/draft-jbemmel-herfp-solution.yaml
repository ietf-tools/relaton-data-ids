abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to the Heterogeneous Error Response
    Forking Problem (HERFP), a situation in which a UAC remains unaware of elements
    that are responding to its INVITE with a 'repairable' error response, because
    a forking proxy in the signalling path only forwards what it considers the 'best'
    final response. This issue may cause communication establishment to be delayed
    or even fail. To address this issue this document proposes a new method [preliminarily
    called 'FIX'] to be used by a forking proxy that detects a HERFP to notify the
    UAC of a repairable error.</p>"
