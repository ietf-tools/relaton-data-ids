abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which has a
    customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network resources
    allocated from the underlying physical network. Multiple VTNs can be created by
    network operator for using as the underlay for one or a group of VPNs services
    to provide enhanced VPN (VPN+) services. In packet forwarding, some fields in
    the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so
    that the VTN-specific processing can be executed on the packet. In the context
    of network slicing, a VTN can be instantiated as a Network Resource Partition
    (NRP). This document proposes a mechanism to carry the data plane VTN ID in an
    MPLS packet to identify the VTN the packet belongs to. The procedure for processing
    the VTN ID is also specified.</p>"
