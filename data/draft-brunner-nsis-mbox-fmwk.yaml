abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group has started looking
    into signaling for QoS in various cases. In this draft, we show the similarities
    and differences of signaling for QoS versus signaling for NAT and firewall traversal.
    It seams that there are quite a number of similarities, which might make sense
    to use a potential NSIS protocol for NAT and firewall traversal as well.</p>"
