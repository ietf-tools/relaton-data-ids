abstract:
- content: "<p>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly
    IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small home/office
    networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that
    IPv4 continues to provide satisfactory internal routing and addressing services
    for most applications. As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed in the
    Internet, however, end user devices within such sites will increasingly require
    at least basic IPv6 functionality for external access. It is also expected that
    more and more IPv6-only devices will be deployed within the site over time. This
    document therefore discusses updates to the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing
    Protocol (ISATAP) to better accommodate these needs.</p>"
