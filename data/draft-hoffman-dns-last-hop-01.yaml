abstract:
- content: <p>DNS queries from one resolver to an upstream resolver are often run
    over connections with no protection of any kind. The stub resolvers that initiate
    queries for an application are ofte called "last-hop", and their queries go to
    trusted recursive resolvers. The connection between last-hop resolvers and their
    upstream resolver is currently susceptible to both malicious and unintentional
    alteration that prevents the querying resolver from being sure that the results
    it receives are valid. Some middleboxes can prevent a stub resolver, even one
    that does DNSSEC validation, from getting enough information to validate a response.
    Further, a non-validating stub resolver is susceptible to active attacks in which
    the results are purposely altered. The protocol described in this document provides
    a method to avoid these problems and thus make resolution significantly more secure.
    This protocol can be used between any two DNS resolvers, but the focus of this
    document is on last-hop resolvers.</p>
