abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to address problems of scaling and address space, the Simple
    Internet Protocol Plus (SIPP) has been proposed as the new version of the Internet
    Protocol (IP). If SIPP is to be widely adopted in the global Internet, the transition
    from the current IP must be simple and easy for users as well as network operators.
    In order for this to occur, hosts and routers implementing the new protocol must
    interoperate with the large installed base of systems which continue to use the
    existing IP. In addition, the transition process must not disrupt the operation
    of the Internet. This paper provides an overview of a set of mechanisms, operational
    practices, and transition plans that can be used for transitioning the Internet
    from IPv4 to SIPP. These techniques are collectively termed the Simple SIPP Transition
    (SST). While specifically designed to transition the IPv4 Internet to SIPP, the
    methods used in SST could be adapted to transition other internet layer protocols
    such as IPX or CLNP to SIPP.</p>"
