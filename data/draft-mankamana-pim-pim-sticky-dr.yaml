abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a mechanism to enhance the stability of Protocol
    Independent Multicast (PIM) Designated Router (DR) election by introducing the
    concept of a Sticky DR. In traditional PIM operations, the DR role on a LAN may
    change dynamically in response to router availability or priority changes, leading
    to potential multicast service disruptions or state reinitialization. The Sticky
    PIM DR approach aims to retain the previous DR role whenever feasible. By minimizing
    DR churn, this mechanism improves multicast session continuity, reduces unnecessary
    Join/Prune message propagation, and enhances operational stability in dense multicast
    deployments. The draft outlines the procedural extensions to existing PIM DR election,
    compatibility considerations, and configuration guidelines to support backward
    interoperability.</p>"
