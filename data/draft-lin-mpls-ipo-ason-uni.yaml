abstract:
- content: "<p>Work already done on the automatic switched optical network (ASON)
    has identified several requirements and architectural features. In particular
    several interfaces have been identified, however there are no detailed requirements
    for these interfaces. This document presents our understanding of requirements
    from the point of view of what an ASON customer can be expected to do with ASON.
    These are mainly requirements at the Client Application Programming Interface
    (API). Note that the Client API is the logical interface between a network client
    (user domain) and the network server (service provider domain).</p>"
