abstract:
- content: <p>Notification and filtering mechanisms can make email more enjoyable
    on mobile and other constrained devices (such as those with limited screen sizes,
    memory, data transfer rates, etc.). Notifications make the client aware of significant
    events (such as the arrival of new mail) so it can react (such as by fetching
    interesting mail immediately). Filtering reduces the visible mail to a set of
    messages that meet some criteria for "interesting". This functionality is included
    in the goals of the Lemonade (Enhancements to Internet email to Support Diverse
    Service Environments) Working Group. This document also discusses the use of server-to-server
    notifications, and how server to server notifications fit into an architecture
    that provides server to client notifications. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>
