abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility solutions at the IP layer have been specified in the IETF
    for IPv4 and IPv6. These solutions include host and network based mobility. All
    of the mobility protocols enable IP session continuity by providing the mobile
    host with an IP address or prefix that remains constant even as the host moves
    and attaches to different access networks and points of attachment. Mobile hosts
    are anchored at a gateway via a tunnel and the address/prefix provided to the
    host via the gateway remains unchanged across mobility events. All IP sessions
    initiated or terminated at a mobile host are anchored via the gateway. A gateway
    centric approach such as Mobile IP, raises certain concerns in terms of cost and
    efficiency. A mobility model wherein the network entities enabling mobility are
    distributed is a way of alleviating the concerns of a gateway centric approach.
    This document considers ways to alleviate anchored mobility issues with approaches
    that could be considered in a deployment.</p>"
