abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lays out the problem space of possibly conflicting standards
    between multiple organizations for URLs and things like them, and proposes some
    actions to resolve the conflicts. From a user or developer point of view, it makes
    no sense for there to be a proliferation of definitions of URL nor for there to
    be a proliferation of incompatible implementations. This shouldn't be a competitive
    feature. Therefore there is a need for the organizations involved to update and
    reconcile the various Internet Drafts, Recommendations, and Standards in this
    area.</p>"
