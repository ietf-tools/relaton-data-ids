abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and
    return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform link-specific fragmentation (also
    known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6. This latter category of links
    is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific fragmentation
    to the point that it would be highly desirable to push the fragmentation burden
    back to the IPv6 source. A common case that exhibits these link characteristics
    is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels. This document therefore proposes an update
    to the base IPv6 specification to support link adaptation avoidance.</p>
