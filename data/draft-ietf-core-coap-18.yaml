abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer
    protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained (e.g., low-power, lossy)
    networks. The nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM
    and RAM, while constrained networks such as IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
    Area Networks (6LoWPANs) often have high packet error rates and a typical throughput
    of 10s of kbit/s. The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications
    such as smart energy and building automation. CoAP provides a request/response
    interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of
    services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and
    Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration
    with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support,
    very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments.</p>"
