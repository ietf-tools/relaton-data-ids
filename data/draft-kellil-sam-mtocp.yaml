abstract:
- content: "<p>To cope with the lack of IP multicast support in today's Internet,
    a multiparty transport overlay architecture is presented in this document. The
    goal behind placing the overlay paradigm at the transport layer is to support
    both multicast-capable and non- multicast IP networks while providing an application-agnostic
    delivery service for group communications. In particular, this document specifies
    the Multiparty Transport Overlay Control Protocol (MTOCP) used to create, update
    and remove multiparty transport trees in an IP network.</p>"
