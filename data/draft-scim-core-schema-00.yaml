abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Cloud Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed
    to make managing user identity in cloud based applications and services easier.
    The specification suite builds upon experience with existing schemas and deployments,
    placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while
    applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. Its intent
    is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing
    a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide
    patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols. In essence, make
    it fast, cheap, and easy to move identity in to, out of, and around the cloud.
    This document provides a platform neutral schema and extension model for representing
    users and groups in JSON and XML formats. This schema is intended for exchange
    and use with cloud service providers. Additional binding documents provide a standard
    REST API, SAML binding, and use cases.</p>"
