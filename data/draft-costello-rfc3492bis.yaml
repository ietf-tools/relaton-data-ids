abstract:
- content: "<p>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax designed
    for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA). It uniquely
    and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into an ASCII string. ASCII characters
    in the Unicode string are represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are
    represented by ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters,
    digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm called Bootstring
    that allows a string of basic code points to uniquely represent any string of
    code points drawn from a larger set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that
    uses particular parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for IDNA.</p>"
