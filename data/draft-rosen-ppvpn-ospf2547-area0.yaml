abstract:
- content: "<p>[VPN] describes a method of providing a VPN service. That method allows
    a variety of different protocols to be used as the routing protocol between the
    Customer Edge (CE) router and the Provider Edge (PE) router. [OSPF-VPN} specifies
    the procedures which must be implemented within the Provider's network when the
    PE/CE routing protocol is OSPF [OSPF], and the PE/CE link is not an area 0 link.
    This document specifies the additional, optional, procedures that must be implemented
    to support the case in which the PE/CE link is an area 0 link.</p>"
