abstract:
- content: "<p>Experimental RFCs are often considered beneficial approaches to developing
    new protocol features. To that end, sub-ranges of code point registries are often
    designated as for experimental use. IANA assigns values to the Path Computation
    Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). According
    to RFC 5440 as updated by RFC 8356, the allocation policies for the registries
    for PCEP messages, objects, and TLV types are IETF Review with some sub-ranges
    of these registries being assigned for Experimental Use. However, the registry
    of PCEP Error-Types and Error-values has only the IETF Review assignment policy
    meaning that experimentation is somewhat limited. This document updates RFC 5440
    by designating a range of PCEP Error- Types for Experimental Use.</p>"
