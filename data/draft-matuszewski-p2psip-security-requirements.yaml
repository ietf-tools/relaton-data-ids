abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a security overview and analysis for the Peer-
    to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network. It discusses security
    threats for the P2PSIP architecture and its components. It compares security difference
    between client/server (C/S) and P2P implementations of SIP, and then partitions
    the P2PSIP architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each layer
    and the security relationship among the layers.</p>"
