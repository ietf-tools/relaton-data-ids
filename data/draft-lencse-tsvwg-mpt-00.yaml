abstract:
- content: "<p>Although several contemporary IT devices have multiple network interfaces,
    communication sessions are restricted to use only one of them at a time due to
    the design of the TCP/IP protocol stack: the communication endpoint is identified
    by an IP address and a TCP or UDP port number. The simultaneous use of these multiple
    interfaces for a communication session would improve user experience through higher
    throughput and improved resilience to network failures. MPT is a network layer
    multipath solution, which provides a tunnel over multiple paths using the GRE-in-UDP
    specification, thus being different from both MPTCP and Huawei's GRE Tunnel Bonding
    Protocol. MPT can also be used as a router, routing the packets among several
    networks between the tunnel endpoints, thus establishing a multipath site-to-site
    connection. The version of tunnel IP and the version of path IP are independent
    from each other, therefore MPT can also be used for IPv6 transition purposes.</p>"
