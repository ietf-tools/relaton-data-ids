abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Secure RADIUS (SRADIUS), which is a transport
    profile for RADIUS. There are three changes from traditional RADIUS transport
    protocols. First, TLS transport is required and insecure transports are forbidden.
    Second, the shared secret is no longer used, and all MD5-based packet signing
    and attribute obfuscation methods are therefore no longer necessary. Finally,
    the now unused Authenticator field is repurposed to contain an explict request
    / response identifier, called a Token. SRADIUS connections can transport all RADIUS
    attributes. Implementation of SRADIUS requires only minor changes to packet encoder
    and decoder functionality. Nothing else is changed from traditional RADIUS.</p>"
