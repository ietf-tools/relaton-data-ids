abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an integrated framework for automated security
    management in 5G edge networks using the Interface to Network Security Functions
    (I2NSF) architecture. The proposed system leverages Intent-Based Networking (IBN)
    to allow users or administrators to declare high-level security intents, which
    are then translated into enforceable network and application policies. Network-level
    policies are delivered to 5G core components via the Network Exposure Function
    (NEF), while application-level policies are enforced directly at user equipment
    through distributed IBN Controllers. This architecture supports adaptive, context-aware,
    and distributed policy enforcement, enabling real-time response to dynamic edge
    conditions and user mobility scenarios such as handovers. By integrating closed-loop
    monitoring and analytics, the system ensures consistent and autonomous security
    across heterogeneous 5G environments.</p>"
