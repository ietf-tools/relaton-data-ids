abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys the processes by which the NFS protocol has been
    extended in the past, including all of the NFS major and minor versions. A particular
    focus is on how the minor versioning model of NFSv4 has worked and what might
    be done to enhance version management within NFSv4. The work already done in the
    new NFSv4 version management document is summarized, and there is a discussion
    of further issues the working group will need to address in moving that work forward.</p>"
