abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need in the Internet community for an unencumbered encryption
    algorithm with a range of key sizes that can provide security for a variety of
    cryptographic applications and protocols. This document describes an existing
    algorithm that can be used to satisfy this requirement. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of
    any kind.</p>"
