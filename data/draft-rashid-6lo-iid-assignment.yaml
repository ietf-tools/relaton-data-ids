abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing the
    interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy. If there are
    a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in several use cases, the
    effect will to proportionately increase the number of IIDs. A duplicate address
    detection (DAD) cycle is needed for each configured IID, introducing more and
    more overhead into the network. Each failed DAD requires the initiating node to
    regenerate a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again. This document proposes an
    optimized approach when higher privacy is required in a given network by allowing
    a 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a unique IID, avoiding any potential
    duplication. Such practice also prevents failure of time-critical applications,
    by enabling 6LBR to provide a unique IID, in case of address collision. Further
    improvements are proposed to enable multiple concurrent DAD cycles, and to return
    the randomized IID from 6LBR to 6LN in a space- efficient manner.</p>"
