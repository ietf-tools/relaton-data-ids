abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a password-authenticated key exchange protocol
    called PAK [PAK,PAK-Orig] that is secure against both a passive eavesdropper and
    an active attacker, i.e., one who may insert, block, or modify messages sent over
    a network. In particular, it does not allow either type of attacker to obtain
    any information that would enable an off-line dictionary attack on the password.
    We discuss how this password-authenticated key exchange protocol may be used with
    iSCSI [iSCSI].</p>"
