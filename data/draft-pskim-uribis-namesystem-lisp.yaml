abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft suggests a name space and system for the locator/ identifier
    split Internet architecture. The suggested name system considers a host-centric
    for the current stage as well as an object-centric for the next stage. Firstly,
    a name space for various communication objects is defined. To consider scalability
    and distributed architecture, the format of the name space consists of object
    category, local name, domain name, and parameters. Secondly, registries and servers
    are introduced to manage mapping between identifier and object names with one-to-many
    relationship. Then, name registration and resolution using these registries and
    servers are described.</p>"
