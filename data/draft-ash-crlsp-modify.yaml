abstract:
- content: "<p>After a CR-LSP is set up, its bandwidth reservation may need to be
    changed by the network operator, due to the new requirements for the traffic carried
    on that CR-LSP [2]. This contribution presents an approach to modify the bandwidth
    and possibly other parameters of an established CR-LSP using CR-LDP [3] without
    service interruption. The LSP modification feature can be supported by CR-LDP
    with a minor extension of an _action indicator flag_. This feature has application
    in dynamic network resources management where traffic of different priorities
    and service classes is involved.</p>"
