abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures requirements for Client-Facing interface to
    the Security Controller as defined by [RFC8327]. The interface is expressed using
    objects and constructs understood by Security Admin as opposed to vendor or device
    specific expressions associated with individual product and feature. This document
    identifies a broad set of requirements needed to express Security Policies based
    on User- constructs which are well understood by the User Community. This gives
    ability to decouple policy definition from policy enforcement on a specific security
    functional element, be it a physical or virtual.</p>"
