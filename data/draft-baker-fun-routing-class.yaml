abstract:
- content: <p>This note addresses the concept of routing a traffic class. This has
    many possible implementations, IGP and BGP, and link state as well as distance
    vector. The fundamental impetus is the question raised in RFC 3704 and shim6 of
    exit routing, the question raised by Mike O'Dell of source/destination routing,
    and the "fish" problem, raised in many networks, in which distinct traffic classes
    that could conceivably use the same route predictably use different routes. Instead
    of handling these as "destination routing with a twist", the paper looks at the
    matter systemically. Requirements</p>
