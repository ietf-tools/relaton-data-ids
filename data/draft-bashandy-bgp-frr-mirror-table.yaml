abstract:
- content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,
    PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm.
    If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally disconnected from the core,
    it is desirable for a core router "P" carrying traffic to the failed edge router
    PEi to immediately restore traffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi and destined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers that advertised
    P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. This draft proposes a BGP FRR scheme that
    relies on having the repairing edge router mirror the protected edge router forwarding
    table. The repairing edge router uses a locally allocated context label to identify
    the correct mirrored table.</p>
