abstract:
- content: "<p>According to IPv6 operation in cellular networks, one prefix can only
    be assigned to one interface of a mobile node by an access router and different
    mobile nodes can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MN interface prefixes is likely
    to increase the processing load at the access router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6
    servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in
    which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes
    to an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6 server. The access router next advertises the prefix
    information to the mobile node with a Router Advertisement message. When the mobile
    node hands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We also describe
    how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation.</p>"
