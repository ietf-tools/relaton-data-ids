abstract:
- content: "<p>The presence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)
    would render state-of-the-art, public-key cryptography deployed today obsolete,
    since all the assumptions about the intractability of the mathematical problems
    that offer confident levels of security today no longer apply in the presence
    of a CRQC. This means there is a requirement to update protocols and infrastructure
    to use post- quantum algorithms, which are public-key algorithms designed to be
    secure against CRQCs as well as classical computers. These new public-key algorithms
    behave similarly to previous public key algorithms, however the intractable mathematical
    problems have been carefully chosen so they are hard for CRQCs as well as classical
    computers. This document explains why engineers need to be aware of and understand
    post-quantum cryptography. It emphasizes the potential impact of CRQCs on current
    cryptographic systems and the need to transition to post-quantum algorithms to
    ensure long-term security. The most important thing to understand is that this
    transition is not like previous transitions from DES to AES or from SHA-1 to SHA-2.
    While drop-in replacement may be possible in some cases, others will require protocol
    re-design to accommodate significant differences in behavior between the new post-quantum
    algorithms and the classical algorithms that they are replacing.</p>"
