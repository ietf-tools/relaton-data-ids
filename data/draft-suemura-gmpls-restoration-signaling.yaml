abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to RSVP-TE for supporting multiple
    protection/restoration types (LSP Protection Types) in end-to-end protection/restoration.
    We propose the LSP Protection Type field to be defined in the Protection Object.
    Another aim of this document is prevention of an unintended connection for extra
    traffic when traffic from a failed working LSP is switched over to a backup LSP.
    We address this issue and propose a 3-way switchover signaling procedure.</p>"
