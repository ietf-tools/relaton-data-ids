- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the MPLS pseudowire format to
    enhance pseudowire user-plane security. The extension, called PWsec, provides
    confidentiality, data integrity, and source authentication. The extension is based
    on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) using the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).</p>"
