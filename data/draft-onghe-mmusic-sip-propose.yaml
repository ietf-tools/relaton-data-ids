abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol,
    RFC-2543[3]. The extension adds the PROPOSE method to the SIP protocol. The intend
    of the PROPOSE method is to allow a Media Gateway or other types of server that
    is serving a SIP node in a live session to propose a revised session setting to
    the node due to changes in network or other constraints of the current session.
    An example of revised session setting could be a suggestion to the node to lower
    its quality of service or choose a lower bandwidth codec due to an increase in
    network traffic.</p>"
