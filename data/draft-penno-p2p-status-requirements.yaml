abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of P2P protocols by end users is widespread. These protocols
    are meant to exchange, replicate, stream or download files with little human intervention,
    trying at the same time to minimize the download time of the files requested by
    any single peer. The ubiquity of such P2P networks has created a steep rise in
    subscriber bandwidth</p>"
