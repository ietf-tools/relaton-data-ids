abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB has been working toward establishing a liaison relationship
    between the Internet Society and ISO/JTC 1. A liaison with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6
    has been offered, and there have been indications that liaisons with any of the
    other SCs will be granted without problems as needed. Further progress is subject
    to the preparation and approval of a 'cooperative agreement' between the two organizations.
    The present document is a draft of that cooperative agreement. It stresses the
    main points of agreement: mutual recognition of standards, information on work
    programs, information sharing and possible collaborative efforts. In line with
    JTC 1 decisions, this draft cooperative agreement covers liaison with SC 6. The
    Internet Society looks forward to establishing similar liaisons with other appropriate
    JTC 1 subcommittees in the near future. This version is a draft. It will have
    to be reviewed by the members of the Internet community and discussed with ISO/IEC
    JTC 1. The term 'organization' in the following refers either to the Internet
    Society or to SC 6.</p>"
