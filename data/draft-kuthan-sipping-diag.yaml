abstract:
- content: "<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides only limited space for communicating
    diagnostic information when errors occur. To facilitate troubleshooting, automated
    error detection, and reporting we propose to create new protocol extensions. The
    extensions will be used for richer reporting on request processing status. Particularly,
    we suggest that User Agent Servers (UAS) include additional information about
    error reasons in negative replies, and proxy servers indicate in relayed requests
    the routing logic they used.</p>"
