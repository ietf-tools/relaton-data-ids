abstract:
- content: '<p>Relentless congestion control is a simple modification that can be
    applied to almost any AIMD style congestion control: instead of applying a multiplicative
    reduction to cwnd after a loss, cwnd is reduced by the number of lost segments.
    It can be modeled as a strict implementation of van Jacobson''s Packet Conservation
    Principle. During recovery, new segments are injected into the network in exact
    accordance with the segments that are reported to have been delivered to the receiver
    by the returning ACKs. This algorithm offers a valuable new congestion control
    property: the TCP portion of the control loop has exactly unity gain, which should
    make it easier to implement simple controllers in network devices to accurately
    control queue sizes across a huge range of scales. Relentless Congestion Control
    conforms to neither the details nor the philosophy of current congestion control
    standards. These standards are based on the idea that the Internet can attain
    sufficient fairness by having relatively simple network devices send uniform congestion
    signals to all flows, and mandating that all protocols have equivalent responses
    to these congestion signals. To function appropriately in a shared environment,
    Relentless Congestion Control requires that the network allocates capacity through
    some technique such as Fair Queuing, Approximate Fair Dropping, etc. The salient
    features of these algorithms are that they segregate the traffic into distinct
    flows, and send different congestion signals to each flow. This alternative congestion
    control paradigm is described in a separate document, also under consideration
    by the ICCRG. The goal of the document is to illustrate some new protocol features
    and properties might be possible if we relax the "TCP-friendly" mandate. A secondary
    goal of Relentless TCP is to make a distinction between the bottlenecks that belong
    to protocol itself, vs standard congestion control and the "TCP-friendly" paradigm.</p>'
