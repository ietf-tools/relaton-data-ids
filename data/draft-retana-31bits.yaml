abstract:
- content: "<p>With ever-increasing pressure to conserve IP address space on the Internet,
    it makes sense to consider where relatively minor changes can be made to fielded
    practice to improve numbering efficiency. One such change, proposed by this document,
    is to halve the amount of address space assigned to point-to-point links (common
    throughout the Internet infrastructure) by allowing the use of 31-bit subnet masks
    in a very limited way. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
