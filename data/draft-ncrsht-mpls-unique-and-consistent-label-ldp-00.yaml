abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to extend LDP control plane with
    path control feature, improved remote LFA support and allow easier monitoring
    of labelled packet flows in a LDP signaled MPLS network. The mechanism introduces
    a method in LDP to propagate a label for loopback address of a router such that
    each label identifies a LDP speaking router in the network. The method enhances
    the scope of unique label for loopback address of each LDP speaking router in
    a network from a platform or an interface level to an autonomous system. The procedures
    described in this mechanism apply to all LDP speaking routers running with ordered
    downstream unsolicited label distribution. Extending these procedures to independent
    or downstream on demand label distribution is a case of further study and thus
    beyond the scope of this document.</p>"
