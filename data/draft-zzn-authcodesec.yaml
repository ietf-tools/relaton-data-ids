abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism to enhance domain transfer security
    by transitioning from a shared-secret authorization model to a cryptographic signature-based
    validation system that enables authorization based on PKIs (Public Key Identification)
    and hands over control of the domain to a specific next controller identified
    by their PKI. The process is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing
    EPP systems through staged incremental upgrades.</p>"
