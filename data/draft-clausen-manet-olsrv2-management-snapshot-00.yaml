abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are typically
    managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as rationale and means
    of monitoring and management of MANET routers running the routing protocol OLSRv2
    and its constituent protocol NHDP. Apart from pre-deployment management for setting
    up IP addresses and security related credentials, OLSRv2 only needs routers to
    agree one single parameter (called "C"). Other parameters for tweaking network
    performance may be determined during operation of the network, and need not be
    the same in all routers. This, using MIB modules and related management protocols
    such as SNMP (or other, less "chatty" protocols). In addition, for debugging purposes,
    monitoring data and performance related counters can be sent to the Network Management
    Station (NMS) via standardized management protocols.</p>
