    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a set of managed objects for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based
    management of Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)-compliant
    Cable Modem Termination Systems. These managed objects facilitate protection of
    the cable network from misuse by subscribers. The Differentiated Services MIB
    (RFC 3289) provides the filtering functions needed here, making use of classification
    items defined in this specification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
