abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines various limits that may be applied to receiving,
    sending, and otherwise processing packets that contain IPv6 extension headers.
    The need for such limits is pragmatic to facilitate interoperability amongst hosts
    and routers in the presence of extension headers and thereby increasing the feasibility
    of deployment of extension headers. The limits described here establish the minimum
    baseline of support for use of extension headers in the Internet. If it is known
    that all communicating parties for a particular commumication, including end hosts
    and any intermediate nodes in the path, are capable of supporting more than the
    baseline then these default limits may be freely exceeded.</p>"
