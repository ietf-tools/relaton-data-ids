abstract:
- content: "<p>The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides reference
    models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network
    interface (NNI). This document updates those reference models to show detailed
    reference points for these interfaces, along with further clarification of the
    functional architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI. This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T. This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at
    achieving IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to an
    IETF Last Call. [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an
    RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published
    RFC has IETF onsensus.]</p>"
