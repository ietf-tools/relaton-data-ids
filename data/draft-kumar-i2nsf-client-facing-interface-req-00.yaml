abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework and information model for the definition
    of northbound interfaces for a security controller. The interfaces are based on
    user-intent instead of vendor-specific or device-centric approaches that would
    require deep knowledge of vendor products and their security features. The document
    identifies the common interfaces needed to enforce the user-intent based policies
    onto network security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions are
    realized. The function may be physical or virtual in nature and may be implemented
    in networking or dedicated appliances.</p>"
