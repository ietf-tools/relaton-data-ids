abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic ECDSA
    and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their security does
    not depend on a source of high-quality randomness. Recent research, however, has
    found that implementations of these signature algorithms may be vulnerable to
    certain side-channel and fault injection attacks due to their deterministic nature.
    One countermeasure to such attacks is hedged signatures where the calculation
    of the per-message secret number includes both fresh randomness and the message.
    This document updates RFC 6979 and RFC 8032 to recommend hedged constructions
    in deployments where side- channel attacks and fault injection attacks are a concern.
    The updates are invisible to the validator of the signature and compatible with
    existing ECDSA and EdDSA validators.</p>"
