abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a means to integrate Certificate Management
    Service for The Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) with presence. Presentities employing
    the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) can use the extensions in this draft
    to advertise their ability to exchange signalling using S/MIME, and thus allow
    secure signalling between the two peers. In a presence application, the presence
    of this information could be displayed to watchers as the padlock "secure signalling
    available" of the presentity.</p>
