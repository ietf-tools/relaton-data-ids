abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a terminology for defining the problem faced
    by network mobility. Network mobility is concerned with situations where an entire
    network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability
    in the topology. We shall refer to such a network as a mobile network. Network
    mobility support is to maintain session continuity between nodes in the mobile
    network and nodes in the global Internet.</p>"
