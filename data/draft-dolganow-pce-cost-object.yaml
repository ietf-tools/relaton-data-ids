abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new object (named the COST object) used to
    specify the cost of a Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Path (LSP). The
    COST object can be carried within an RSVP message so as to record a TE LSP cost
    during LSP establishment or within a Path Computation Element (PCE) path computation
    protocol message so as to provide the cost of a computed path to a Path Computation
    Client (PCC).</p>"
