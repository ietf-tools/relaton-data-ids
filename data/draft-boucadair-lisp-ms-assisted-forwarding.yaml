abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the issues with current LISP operation is that some packets
    are likely to be lost when there is no matching mapping entry maintained by the
    Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR). This document proposes a solution to address this
    issue with a particular focus on LISP deployments at large scale. This document
    introduces the concept of Implicit Map-Request and Unsolicited Map-Reply messages.
    Also, it describes a solution to disable data gleaning for a given flow at the
    upstream Egress Tunnel Router (ETR).</p>"
