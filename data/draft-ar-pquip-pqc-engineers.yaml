abstract:
- content: "<p>The presence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)
    would render state-of-the-art, public-key cryptography deployed today obsolete,
    since all the assumptions about the intractability of the mathematical problems
    that offer confident levels of security today no longer apply in the presence
    of a CRQC. This means there is a requirement to update protocols and infrastructure
    to use post- quantum algorithms, which are public-key algorithms designed to be
    secure against CRQCs as well as classical computers. These algorithms are just
    like previous public key algorithms, however the intractable mathematical problems
    have been carefully chosen, so they are hard for CRQCs as well as classical computers.
    This document explains why engineers need to be aware of and understand post-
    quantum cryptography. It emphasizes the potential impact of CRQCs on current cryptographic
    systems and the need to transition to post- quantum algorithms to ensure long-term
    security. The most important thing to understand is that this transition is not
    like previous transitions from DES to AES or from SHA-1 to SHA2, as the algorithm
    properties are significantly different from classical algorithms, and a drop-in
    replacement is not possible.</p>"
