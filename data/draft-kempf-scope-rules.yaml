abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2608, RFC 2610, and RFC 2614 provide rules for configuring SLP
    agents with scopes and DAs from the protocol, DHCP, and API view- points, respectively.
    The rules presented in these three documents, while not in conflict, are ambiguous
    in certain cases. There are also cases that fall into the cracks between the three
    documents. For example, if the mandatory byte is off in DHCP for scopes and there
    are no statically configured scopes, but there are DHCP scopes, should an agent
    use the DHCP scopes or not? This document specifies a sequence of steps that interoperable
    implementations of SLP must follow in order to obtain a clear and unambiguous
    scope and DA configuration.</p>"
