abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework for
    performing authentication and key management using the AAA infrastructure. The
    framework deals with a model which includes a peer, a pass-through authenticator
    and a backend authentication server. Some of the emerging mobile networks use
    EAP in handover scenarios in ways that go beyond currently defined EAP keying
    framework. This document provides a problem statement for the usage of EAP in
    these emerging mobile networks.</p>"
