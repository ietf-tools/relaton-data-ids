abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the results of an ADD-PATH implementation survey.
    The survey had 22 questions about implementations' support for advertising multiple
    paths in BGP. After a brief summary of the results, each response is listed. This
    document contains responses from six implementers who completed the survey. The
    editor did not use external means to verify the accuracy of the information submitted
    by the respondents. The respondents are considered experts on the products they
    reported on.</p>"
