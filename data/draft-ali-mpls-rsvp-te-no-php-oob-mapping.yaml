abstract:
- content: <p>There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress LSR to receive
    binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload identification, using
    some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This document proposes protocol mechanisms
    to address this requirement. The procedures described in this document are equally
    applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to- multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.</p>
