abstract:
- content: <p>A mechanism for BGP that helps minimize the negative effects on routing
    caused by BGP restart has already been developed and is described in a separate
    document ("Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP"). This document extends this mechanism
    to minimize the negative effects on MPLS forwarding caused by the Label Switching
    Router's (LSR's) control plane restart, and specifically by the restart of its
    BGP component when BGP is used to carry MPLS labels and the LSR is capable of
    preserving the MPLS forwarding state across the restart. The mechanism described
    in this document is agnostic with respect to the types of the addresses carried
    in the BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) field. As such, it works
    in conjunction with any of the address families that could be carried in BGP (e.g.,
    IPv4, IPv6, etc.). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
