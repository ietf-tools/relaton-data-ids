abstract:
- content: "<p>The Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2 workshop,
    sponsored by the Internet Society, took place on 28 February and 1 March 2019
    in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned regional, national, international,
    and enterprise Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), operators,
    service providers, network and security operators, transport operators and researchers,
    incident response researchers, vendors, and participants from standards communities.
    This workshop continued the work started at the first CARIS workshop, with a focus
    on scaling incident prevention and detection as the Internet industry moves to
    a stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment of session encryption.</p>"
