abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT-PT (RFC2766) is an address translation mechanism designed to facilitate
    communications between IPv6-only and IPv4-only nodes. This mechanism was designed
    to be used when tunneling transition mechanisms cannot be used. This document
    is intended to be a compilation of known security issues related to NAT-PT and
    includes a few new ones. These issues are discussed in some detail, and suggestions
    on how to deal with them are included in this document.</p>"
