abstract:
- content: "<p>This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be used
    between gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra- ITAD communications
    environment. The registration protocol is used by a GW just to inform its transport
    address and reachable alias addresses including telephone numbers through it along
    with other information (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic, usage, QoS, GoS) to the
    Server and does not deal with any routes or path attributes. The registration
    protocol is also used to negotiate capabilities between the peers.</p>"
