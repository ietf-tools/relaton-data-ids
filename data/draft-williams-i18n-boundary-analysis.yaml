abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalization of protocols and programs often requires determining
    where to use one or another character repertoire, codeset, encoding, where to
    perform localization, and so on. This document aims to serve as a guide to Internet
    protocol designers in determining what they may or should recommend or require
    of protocol implementors. Of particular interest in this document are filesystem
    protocols.</p>"
