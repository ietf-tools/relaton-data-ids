abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an XML format for the representation of civic
    location. This format is designed for use with PIDF Location Object (PIDF-LO)
    documents. The format is based on the civic address definition in PIDF-LO, but
    adds several new elements based on the civic types defined for DHCP. The format
    also includes support for the xml:lang language tag and restricts the types of
    elements where appropriate.</p>"
