abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays, many authoritative servers support GeoIP feature, they guess
    the client's geolocation by the client subnet of EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) or by
    the source IP address of DNS query, return tailor DNS response based on the client's
    geolocation. However, ECS raises some privacy concerns because it leaks client
    subnet information on the resolution path to the authoritative server. This document
    describes an improved GeoIP solution, defines an EDNS ISP Location (EIL) extension
    to address the privacy problem of ECS, tries to find the right balance between
    privacy improvement and user experience optimization. EIL is defined to convey
    isp location &lt; COUNTRY, AREA, ISP &gt; information that is relevant to the
    DNS message. It will directly provide sufficient information for the GeoIP-enabled
    authoritative server as ECS, decide the response without guessing client's geolocation.</p>"
