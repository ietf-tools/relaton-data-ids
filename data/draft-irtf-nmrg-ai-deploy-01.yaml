abstract:
- content: "<p>As the development of AI technology has matured and AI technology has
    begun to be applied in various fields, AI technology is changing from running
    only on very high performance servers to commodity servers with small affordable
    hardware, including microcontrollers, low performance CPUs, and AI chipsets. This
    document considers how to configure the network and system in terms of AI inference
    service to provide AI service in a distributed manner. It also describes the points
    to consider in the environment where a client connects to a cloud server and an
    edge device and requests an AI service. Some use cases of deploying network-based
    AI services, such as self-driving vehicles and network digital twins, are described.?</p>"
