abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces filter rules as a means for a multi-homed node
    to perform per flow interface selection. Per flow interface selection is typically
    needed when there exist multiple network interfaces, each with different network
    characteristics, and an application has specific performance requirements for
    a data flow that makes one network interface more suitable than another. The use
    of OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF) syntax is proposed to describe the filter rules.</p>"
