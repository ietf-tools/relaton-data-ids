abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 binding management has been designed for break-before-
    make handoffs, which can be performed by hosts equipped with a single interface.
    However, a Mobile Node may be equipped with multiple interfaces, allowing it to
    perform Make-Before-Break handoffs by connecting simultaneously to two overlapping
    access networks during the handoff. In theory these handoffs can be lossless,
    provided that there is sufficient overlap between the two networks. However, unless
    Mobile IPv6 bindings are managed carefully Mobile Node and Correspondent Node
    will have inconsistent binding state during the handoff, which will lead to packet
    loss. In this draft we propose changes to binding management for lossless make-before-break
    handoffs. The proposed changes do not affect the interoperability with Mobile
    IPv6 nodes not implementing these changes.</p>"
