abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an architecture for security policy management
    for IPSEC based on the principle of ``compliance checking.'' We describe a two-level
    policy hierarchy, in which security association policy is managed by a highly
    flexible policy language, which in turn provides input to packet policies that
    are managed by a fast packet filtering language. We provide a sample SA policy
    language, based on KeyNote, and describe interoperability issues for this architecture.</p>"
