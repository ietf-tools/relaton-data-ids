abstract:
- content: "<p>Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) supporting Scalable Video Coding
    (SVC) typically parse the RTP payload in the forwarding plane, and often utilize
    codec-specific control messages within the control plane. As a result, the control
    and/or forwarding planes of these implementations need to be modified (sometimes
    substantially) in order to support additional video codecs. With SFUs now supporting
    VP8 in addition to H.264/SVC, and with additional video codecs expected to become
    popular, the inflexibility of SFU designs that depend on RTP payload parsing has
    become increasingly apparent. In addition, these designs cannot function where
    the RTP payload is inaccessible, such as when it is encrypted with a key not available
    to the SFU. Based on a summary of SFU implementation practice, this document develops
    requirements for codec-independent SFUs.</p>"
