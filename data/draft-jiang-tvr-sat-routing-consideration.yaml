abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3GPP has done tremendous work to either standardize or study various
    types of wireless services that would depend on a satellite constellation network.
    While the ISLs, or Inter-Satellite Links, along with the routing scheme(s) over
    them are critical to help fullfil the satellite services, the 3GPP considers them
    out-of-scope. This leaves somewhat significant work to be explored in the IETF
    domain. This draft stems from the latest 3GPP satellite use cases, and lands on
    summarizing the restrictions &amp; challenges in term of satellite-based routing.
    Based on some unique &amp; advantageous characteristics associated with satellite
    movement, the draft raises briefly the general design principles and possible
    algorithms for the integrated NTN+TN routing, while leaves the implementation
    details for further expansion.</p>"
