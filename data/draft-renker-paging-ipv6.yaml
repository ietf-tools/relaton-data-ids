abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports a registered
    idle state of a mobile node and coordinates paging independent of the underlying
    layer-2 medium. The concept specifies a generic protocol that allows to abstract
    away from layer-2 paging capabilities up to the Access Routers, providing wired
    or wireless network access to idle mobile terminals. A new entity, called Paging
    Agent, is introduced. This Paging Agent supports employment of several different
    paging strategies. The reference mobility architecture of this specification is
    Mobile IPv6. Avoiding modifications of Mobile IPv6 entities, the paging concept
    integrates modularly into the mobility environment</p>"
