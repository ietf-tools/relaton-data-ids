abstract:
- content: "<p>Event service is an asynchronous communication model between interacting
    parties, e.g. autonomic functions (AFs), instead of a tightly coupled point-to-point
    (P2P) synchronous communication model. Event service enables autonomic nodes in
    ANI to publish data information, which will be made network distributable autonomously,
    and subscribers who register interests to specific events will be notified if
    the information is available. This draft describes how to support event service
    (ES) for autonomic networking.</p>"
