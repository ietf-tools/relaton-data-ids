abstract:
- content: "<p>TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy records as
    a means to authorize Third-Party domains. This mechanism allows first-party domains
    to autonomously authorize a range of third-party domains in a scalable, individual
    DNS transaction. This authorization extends the scope of DKIM policy assertions
    to supplant more difficult to administer mechanisms. Alternatives for facilitating
    third-party authorizations currently necessitate the coordination between two
    or more domains by setting up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations,
    or the regular exchange of public/ private keys. Checking DKIM policies may occur
    when a From header email-address is not within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.
    When a Third-Party signature is found, TPA-labels offer an efficient means for
    email address domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains. The scope
    of the authorization may separately assert identity authentication for From and
    Sender and Resent-* headers for email- addresses within the authorizing domain.
    Identity authentication can be asserted by the scope of the authorization, even
    when signed by a Third-Party domain. In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom domain
    can authorize domains for controlling DSNs.</p>"
