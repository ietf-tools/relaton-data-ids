abstract:
- content: "<p>The current usage based IPv4 address assignment policies might have
    prolonged the useful lifetime of IPv4 address space but this has to the detriment
    of the the end-to-end architecture of the Internet. This memo proposes the adoption
    of an address assignment strategy that releases large blocks of IPv4 address space
    into the Internet. The objective of this policy is to encourage healthy Internet
    deployment models with end-to-end transparency and association of permanent connectivity
    with a stable IP address. This is intended to encourage provider support for open
    transparent Internet service environments that can be sustained with the adoption
    of IPv6.</p>"
