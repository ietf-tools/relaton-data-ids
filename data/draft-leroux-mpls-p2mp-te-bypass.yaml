abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines procedures for fast reroute protection of Point-To-MultiPoint
    (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE-LSP) in MultiProtocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) networks, based upon Point-To-MultiPoint bypass tunnels. The
    motivation for using P2MP bypass tunnels is to avoid potentially expensive data
    duplication along the backup path that could occur if point-to-point bypass tunnels
    where used, i.e. to optimize the bandwidth usage, during fast reroute protection
    of a link or a node. During link or node failure the traffic carried onto a protected
    P2MP TE-LSP is tunnelled within one or several P2MP bypass tunnels towards a set
    of Merge Points. To avoid data duplication backup labels (i.e. inner labels) are
    assigned by the Point of Local Repair (PLR) following the RSVP-TE upstream label
    assignment procedure.</p>"
