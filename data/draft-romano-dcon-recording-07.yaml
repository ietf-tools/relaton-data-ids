abstract:
- content: "<p>This document deals with session recording, specifically for what concerns
    recording of multimedia conferences, both centralized and distributed. Each involved
    media is recorded separately, and is then properly tagged. A SMIL [W3C.CR-SMIL3-20080115]
    metadata is used to put all the separate recordings together and handle their
    synchronization, as well as the possibly asynchronous opening and closure of media
    within the context of a conference. This SMIL metadata can subsequently be used
    by an interested user by means of a compliant player in order to passively receive
    a playout of the whole multimedia conference session. The motivation for this
    document comes from our experience with our conferencing framework, Meetecho,
    for which we implemented a recording functionality.</p>"
