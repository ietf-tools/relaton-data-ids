abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft describes protocols, procedures, and conventions
    to be employed by peers implementing a generic cryptographic application program
    interface. Version 4.0 of this API was implemented inside RSA Data Security, Inc.'s
    BSAFE product. The API provides a model for implementing symmetric ciphers, message
    digests, message authentication, random number generation, public-key algorithms,
    digital signatures, and secret sharing. The API is documented here for the benefit
    of others who might also adopt and use the API, thus providing increased portability
    of security applications.</p>"
