abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Domain Name System (DNS) resource record
    type called the IPSECA RR that is used to associate an X.509 certificate or a
    public key to an Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) gateway in a similar manner
    TLSA RR is used in the DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) protocol
    does that for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in order to make the credential discovery
    easier through DNS and to allow credential discovery to be performed in a secure
    manner leveraging DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). Among the issues addressed
    in this draft is the danger of IP address spoofing that can be a liability to
    IPsec endpoints. It is important to note that the "right destination" in this
    document is strictly defined by the response of the DNS and does not attest to
    the identity of the organization or the ownership of the IP address space. The
    identity of the organization shall be attested in an X.509 certificate issued
    by a certification authority if desired and the ownership of the IP address space
    shall be attested by other mechanisms such as Towards A Secure Routing System
    (TASRS) architecture or Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).</p>
