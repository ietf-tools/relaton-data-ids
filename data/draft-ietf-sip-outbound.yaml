abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate
    TCP connections or to send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order
    to deliver requests. However, in a large number of real deployments, many practical
    considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators
    (NATs) or the use of TLS with server-provided certificates, prevent servers from
    connecting to User Agents in this way. This specification defines behaviors for
    User Agents, registrars, and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered
    on existing connections established by the User Agent. It also defines keep-alive
    behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple
    connections from the User Agent to its registrar. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
