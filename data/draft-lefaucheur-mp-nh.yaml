abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new BGP attribute, called the BGP-4 Multiprotocol
    Next Hop (MP_NEXT_HOP), which can optionally be used in conjunction with the MP_REACH_NLRI
    defined in [MP-BGP] (or the NLRI field defined in BGP-4) to advertise next hop
    information associated with a different Network Layer protocol to the one associated
    with the NLRI. This is desirable or required in a number of environments, but
    is not currently possible with [MP-BGP]. In addition, the MP_NEXT_HOP provides
    the generic capability to advertise information (set of TLVs) associated with
    the next hop. Finally, provision is made for a future potential extension to allow
    advertisement of multiple next hops.</p>"
