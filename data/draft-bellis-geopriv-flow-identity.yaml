abstract:
- content: "<p>Identity Extensions using an IP address and port number to request
    a location based on an individual packet flow have been previously specified by
    the GEOPRIV Working Group. However certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers
    for both ends of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously satisfy
    the location request. This document specifieds a Flow Identity Extension for the
    HTTP- Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) Protocol to support this requirement.</p>"
