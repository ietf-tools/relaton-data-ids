- content: "<p>IPsec offers much promise as a secure remote access mechanism. However,
    there are a number of differing remote access scenarios, each having some shared
    and some unique requirements. A thorough understanding of these requirements is
    necessary in order to effectively evaluate the suitability of a specific set of
    mechanisms for any particular remote access scenario. This document enumerates
    the requirements for a number of common remote access scenarios. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
