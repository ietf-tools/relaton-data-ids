abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of the KeyNote trust-management system
    as an authorization extension in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake
    Protocol, according to guidelines in RFC 5878. Extensions carried in the client
    and server hello messages confirm that both parties support the desired authorization
    data types. Then, if supported by both the client and the server, KeyNote credentials
    are exchanged in the supplemental data handshake message. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
