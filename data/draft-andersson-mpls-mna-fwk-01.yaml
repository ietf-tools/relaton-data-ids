abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an architectural framework for the MPLS Network
    Actions (MNA) technologies. MNA technologies are used to indicate actions for
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and/or packets and to transfer data needed for these
    actions. The document describes a common set of protocol actions and information
    elements supporting additional operational models and capabilities of MPLS networks.
    Some of these actions are defined in existing MPLS specifications, while others
    require extensions to existing specifications to meet the requirements found in
    "Requirements for MPLS Label Stack Indicators and Ancillary Data". This document
    is the result of work started in MPLS Open Desgign Team, with participation by
    the MPLS, PALS and DETNET working groups.</p>
