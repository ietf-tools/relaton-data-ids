abstract:
- content: "<p>Some zones are small, public and stable, but very important. They might
    deal with millions of queries every day. But many of the queries are junky. For
    examples, many queries DNS root servers receive are junky. The queried junky names
    are not in the root, but the root servers have to waste a lot of resources to
    deal with them. It has been an obstacle to increase the performance of DNS root
    query. In order to save the resource caused by the DNS junky queries, this document
    proposes a new mechanism by aggressive use of the owner name list of the DNS zone.</p>"
