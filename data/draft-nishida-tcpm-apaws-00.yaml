abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents describe a technique called A-PAWS which can provide
    protection against old duplicates segments like PAWS. While PAWS requires TCP
    to set timestamp options in all segments in a TCP connection, A-PAWS supports
    the same feature without using timestamps. A-PAWS is designed to be used complementary
    with PAWS. TCP needs to use PAWS when it is necessary and activates A-PAWS only
    when it is safe to use. Without impairing the reliability and the robustness of
    TCP, A-PAWS can provide more option space to other TCP extensions.</p>"
