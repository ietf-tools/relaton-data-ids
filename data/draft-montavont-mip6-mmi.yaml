abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 [1] allows a MN to maintain its IPv6 communications while
    moving between subnets. This document presents the problematic for a MN that has
    multiple network interfaces. It discusses how to perform vertical handovers (flow
    redirection between interfaces) and propose MMI (Mobile IPv6 for Multiple Interfaces)
    which describes the use of Mobile IPv6 to support multiple interfaces. One one
    hand, these extensions focus on the MN ability to use a backup interface for communications
    and on the other hand to spread flows between the MN own interfaces.</p>"
