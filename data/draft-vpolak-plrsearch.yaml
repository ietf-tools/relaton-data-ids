abstract:
- content: <p>This document addresses challenges while applying methodologies described
    in [RFC2544] to benchmarking NFV (Network Function Virtualization) over an extended
    period of time, sometimes referred to as "soak testing". More specifically to
    benchmarking software based implementations of NFV data planes. Packet throughput
    search approach proposed by this document assumes that system under test is probabilistic
    in nature, and not deterministic.</p>
