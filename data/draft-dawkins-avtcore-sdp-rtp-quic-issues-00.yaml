abstract:
- content: <p>This document is intended to capture SDP aspects of RTP over QUIC design
    issues that have arisen, been discussed by the AVTCORE working group, and have
    reached a resolution that can be included in "SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC
    as Transport". This document is a companion document to "SDP Offer/Answer for
    RTP using QUIC as Transport". That document focuses on the description and registration
    of SDP "proto" attribute parameters with IANA, to allow applications that rely
    on SDP Offer/Answer to negotiate the QUIC protocol as an encapsulation for RTP.
    "SDP Offer/Answer for RTP using QUIC as Transport" is itself a companion document
    to "RTP over QUIC", and follows the lead of the latter specification as it evolves.</p>
