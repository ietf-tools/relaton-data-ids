abstract:
- content: "<p>This work derives itself from [1] which proposes a ECMP redirect from
    a PIM upstream neighbor that instructs or advices the PIM downstream neighbor
    to choose another of its own ECMP links between the former and the latter. What
    we propose in this document is a criterion based on power consumed in the linecards
    that comprise the ECMP links between the former and the latter. Also the multicast
    replication capacity available within the said linecards which form the ECMP links
    between the two is taken into consideration while making a ECMP redirect. A PIM
    router uses RPF procedure to select an upstream interface and router to build
    forwarding state. When there are equal cost multiple paths (ECMP), existing implementations
    often use hash algorithms to select a path. Such algorithms do not allow the spread
    of traffic among the ECMPs according to administrative metrics. This usually leads
    to inefficient or ineffective use of network resources. This document introduces
    the ECMP Redirect, a mechanism to improve the RPF procedure over ECMPs. It allows
    ECMP path selection to be based on administratively selected metrics, such as
    data transmission delays, path preferences and routing metrics.</p>"
