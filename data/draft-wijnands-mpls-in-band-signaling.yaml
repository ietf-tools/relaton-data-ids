abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IP multicast tree needs to pass through an MPLS domain, it
    is advantageous to map the tree to a Point-to-Multipoint or Multipoint- to-Multipoint
    Label Switched Path. This document specifies a way to provide a one-one mapping
    between IP multicast trees and Label Switched Paths. The IP multicast control
    messages are translated into MPLS control messages when they enter the MPLS domain,
    and are translated back into IP multicast control messages at the far end of the
    MPLS domain. The IP multicast control information is coded into the MPLS control
    information in such a way as to ensure that a single Multipoint Label Switched
    Path gets set up for each IP multicast tree.</p>"
