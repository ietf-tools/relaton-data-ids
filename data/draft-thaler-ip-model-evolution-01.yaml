abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft attempts to document various aspects of the IP service model
    and how it has evolved over time. In particular, it attempts to document the properties
    of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications, and
    especially properties which were (and at times still are) incorrectly perceived
    to exist, as well as properties that changing would cause problems.</p>"
