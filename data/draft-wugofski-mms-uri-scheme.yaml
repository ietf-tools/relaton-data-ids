abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies URI (Universal Resource Identifier) schemes used
    in Multimedia Messaging, as specified by the 3GPP. The 'mmsto' URI scheme is used
    to designate the MMS address of an individual or service. In its simplest form,
    an 'mmsto' URI contains either an E.164 phone number or an Internet mail address.
    For greater functionality, because interaction with some resources may require
    message headers or message bodies to be specified as well as the MMS address,
    the 'mmsto' URI scheme may optionally include MMS header fields and the message
    body. The 'mms' URI scheme is used to designate an MMS message and the sending
    of that message from the message originator.</p>"
