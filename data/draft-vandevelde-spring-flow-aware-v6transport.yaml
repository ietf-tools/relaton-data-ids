abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-Aware transport of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet Switched Network
    (RFC6391) introduces an ECMP use-case, making assumption that the payload of a
    pseudowire comprises of a number of distinct flows. RFC6391 provides a mechanism
    for fine flow granularity beyond the individual pseudowire, helping better flow
    granularity for ECMP purpose. To identify the granular pseudowire flows the concept
    of MPLS Flow Label is introduced. Furthermore RFC6391 defines the required LDP
    protocol extensions to exchange the MPLS Flow Label between LDP speakers. Another
    method to exchange MPLS flow labels is found in draft-ietf- bess-fat-pw-bgp. Draft-ietf-bess-fat-pw-bgp
    defines extensions required to synchronise flow label state between PEs using
    BGP-based signalling procedures. This draft assumes MPLS is the transport technology
    used. This draft extends the applicability of draft-ietf-bess-fat-pw-bgp and uses
    the BGP derived flow label for IPv6 Segment Routing transport. The PE responsible
    for imposing the IPv6 Segment Routing top level header will in addition to an
    IPv6 header AND the IPv6 Source Routing header ALSO impose the BGP derived Flow
    Label as the IPv6 outer header flow Label. This functionality will provide fine
    ECMP granularity of IPv6 Segment routing enabled pseudowire transport services.</p>"
