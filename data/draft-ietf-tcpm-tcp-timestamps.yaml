abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an algorithm for processing incoming SYN segments
    that allows higher connection-establishment rates between any two TCP endpoints
    when a TCP Timestamps option is present in the incoming SYN segment. This document
    only modifies processing of SYN segments received for connections in the TIME-WAIT
    state; processing in all other states is unchanged. This memo documents an Internet
    Best Current Practice.</p>"
