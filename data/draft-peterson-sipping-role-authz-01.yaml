abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lays out a set of requirements related to role-based
    authorization for the Session Initiation Protocol. While numerous authentication
    mechanisms are described in the base SIP specification, role-based authorization
    provides information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of
    a participant in a session. This approach provides a richer framework for authorization,
    as well as allow greater privacy for users of an identity system.</p>"
