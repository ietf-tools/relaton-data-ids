abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Cooperation for the Integration of Processes in Prepress,
    Press, and Postpress (CIP4) is an international worldwide standards body located
    in Switzerland. The purpose of CIP4 is to encourage computer based integration
    of all processes that have to be considered in the graphic arts industry. CIP4
    has defined two document formats that are encoded in W3C Extensible Markup Language
    (XML): (1) CIP4 Job Definition Format (JDF) - an open standard for integration
    of all computer aided business and production processes around print media; (2)
    CIP4 Job Messaging Format (JMF) - an open standard for job messaging using Hyper
    Text Transport Protocol/1.1 (HTTP/1.1, RFC2616) that defines Query, Command, Response,
    Acknowledge, and Signal message families. This document defines two new MIME sub-types
    for IANA registration: (1) 'application/vnd.cip4-jdf+xml' for CIP4 Job Definition
    Format; (2) 'application/vnd.cip4-jmf+xml' for CIP4 Job Messaging Format.</p>"
