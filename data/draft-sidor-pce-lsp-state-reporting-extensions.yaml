abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is defined
    in multiple RFCs for enabling communication between Path Computation Elements
    (PCEs) and Path Computation Clients (PCCs). Although PCEP defines various LSP
    identifiers, attributes, and constraints, there are operational attributes available
    on the PCC that can enhance path computation and improve the debugging experience,
    which are not currently supported in PCEP. This document proposes extensions to
    PCEP to include: * Support for explicit or dynamic path types * Mechanisms to
    mark LSPs as eligible for use as transit LSPs * Allowing instantiation of LSP
    and optionally do fallback to Binding label/Segment Identifier (SID) allocation
    by the PCC when the binding value specified by the PCE is unavailable These extensions
    aim to address the existing gaps, enhancing the overall functionality and operational
    efficiency of PCEP.</p>"
