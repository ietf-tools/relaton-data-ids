abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined
    both the endpoint cost service (ECS) and cost maps to provide information to applications
    about network path properties (e.g., routingcost) from a set of source network
    points to a set of destination network points, where each network point can be
    a single endpoint (in ECS) or a PID which represents a set of endpoints (in a
    cost map). Considering, conceptually, both ECS and cost map as returning a matrix,
    indexed by sources and destinations as row and column, the current ALTO protocol
    [RFC7285] allows the elements in the matrix to be only scalar (i.e., numerical
    or ordinal). This, however, is limiting in many use cases. This document discuss
    multiple use cases where scalar-elements can be limitations. It then defines new
    cost types to allow general cost types, such as vectors to represent use cases
    such path vectors.</p>"
