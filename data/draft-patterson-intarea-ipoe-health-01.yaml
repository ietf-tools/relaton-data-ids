abstract:
- content: "<p>PPP over Ethernet clients have the functionality to detect path unavailability
    by using PPP Keepalives. IP over Ethernet does not have this functionality, and
    it's not specified when an IP over Ethernet client should consider its WAN connectivity
    down, unless there is a physical layer link down event. This document describes
    a way for IP over Ethernet clients to achieve connectivity validation, similar
    to that of PPP over Ethernet, by using BFD Echo, or ARP and Neighbor Discovery
    functions.</p>"
