abstract:
- content: "<p>A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public
    key and associated data. The public key is used to verify digital signatures and
    the associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the
    trust anchor is authoritative. A relying party uses trust anchors to determine
    if a digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital signature using the
    trust anchor's public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated
    data for the trust anchor. This document describes some of the problems associated
    with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism as well as problems
    that must be addressed by such a mechanism. This document discusses only public
    keys as trust anchors; symmetric key trust anchors are not considered.</p>"
