abstract:
- content: "<p>Since cryptographic algorithms can become weak over the years, it is
    necessary to evaluate their security suitability. When signing or verifying data,
    or when encrypting or decrypting data, these evaluations must be considered. This
    document specifies a data structure that enables an automated analysis of the
    security suitability of a given cryptographic algorithm at a given point of time,
    which may be in the past, the present, or the future. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
