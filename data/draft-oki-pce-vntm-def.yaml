abstract:
- content: "<p>A network may be built from multiple layers that may be technology-
    specific divisions, or may be administrative divisions. It is important to globally
    optimize network resource utilization, taking into account all layers, rather
    than optimizing resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows
    better network efficiency to be achieved through a process that we call inter-
    layer traffic engineering (TE). The Virtual Network Topology (VNT) is defined
    as the network topology formed by lower-layer LSPs and advertised to the higher
    layer as TE links. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to
    achieve inter-layer traffic engineering, but requires a separate function to manage
    and control the VNT. This document defines the VNT Manager (VNTM), which manages
    and controls the VNT for PCE-based inter-layer traffic engineering.</p>"
