abstract:
- content: <p>This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extend
    MPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a single MPLS
    domain ("Seamless MPLS"). The Seamless MPLS approach is based on existing and
    well known protocols. It provides a highly flexible and a scalable architecture
    and the possibility to integrate 100.000 of nodes. The separation of the service
    and transport plane is one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to
    end service independent transport. Therefore it removes the need for service specific
    configurations in network transport nodes (without end to end transport MPLS,
    some additional services nodes/configurations would be required to glue each transport
    domain). This draft defines a routing architecture using existing standardized
    protocols. It does not invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existing
    protocols.</p>
