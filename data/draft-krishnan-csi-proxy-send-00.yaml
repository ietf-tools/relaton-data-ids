abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing Neighbor
    Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats. As specified today, SEND assumes
    that the node advertising an address is the owner of the address and is in possession
    of the private key used to generate the digital signature on the message. This
    means that the Proxy ND signaling initiated by nodes that do not possess knowledge
    of the address owner's private key cannot be secured using SEND. This document
    extends the current SEND specification with support for Proxy ND, the Secure Proxy
    ND Support for SEND.</p>"
