abstract:
- content: "<p>The base WebDAV protocol [WebDAV] provides basic support for collections.
    It defines a MKCOL method for creating collections and specifies how other HTTP
    and WebDAV methods interact with collections. It supports internal members of
    collections, which it defines as members whose URIs are immediately relative to
    the URI of the collection. This draft sets out requirements for more advanced,
    optional collection functionality. It extends the base functionality in two general
    directions: support for referential resources, and support for ordered collections.
    A separate WebDAV specification is expected to define protocol elements providing
    the functionality described here.</p>"
