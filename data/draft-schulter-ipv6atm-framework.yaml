abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for adapting IPv6 and its base
    protocols [IPv6-SPEC, IPV6-ND, IPV6-ADDRCONF, IPV6-ADDRARCH, IPV6-DHCP] to ATM
    networks while maintaining the complete functionality and semantics of these protocols.
    This is done by defining an IPv6 `link'' for ATM (and NBMA) networks in a way
    which preserves all the fundamental IPv6 concepts and functionality while still
    taking advantage of the unique capabilities of ATM.</p>"
