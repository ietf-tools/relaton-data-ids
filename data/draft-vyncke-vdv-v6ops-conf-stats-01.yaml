abstract:
- content: "<p>During the Cisco [Cisco] European networkers Conference 2009 that ran
    from 26th to 29th January in Barcelona native IPv6 was added to the traditional
    IPv4 infrastructure. During this conference the 3500 attendees had dual stack
    access to both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. The goal of this IPv6 deployment
    project was to gather usage statistics in a situation where the end-user just
    wants to access his/her enterprise VPN or simply get onto the Internet. The collected
    statistics are not only useful per se but this document presents easy ways to
    measure the quality of the IPv6 connectivity offered on such events. In essence
    the users were not conducting IPv6 technology tests, but were just using Internet
    services. The statistics collected give some pieces of information on the size
    and impact of IPv6 onto the normal userbase and will also derive the importance
    of IPv6 onto the infrastructiure and end-user operating systems and firewall technologies.
    The experiment ran in collaboration with Google [Google] and Tata-Communications
    [Tata].</p>"
