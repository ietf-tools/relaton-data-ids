abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport Layer Security protocol or the
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol. The TLS and DTLS protocols
    provide authentication and privacy services for SNMP applications. This document
    describes how the TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of
    a SNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in an interoperable
    way. This transport model is designed to meet the security and operational needs
    of network administrators. The TLS mode can make use of TCP's improved support
    for larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode provides potentially superior operation
    in environments where a connectionless (e.g. UDP or SCTP) transport is preferred.
    Both TLS and DTLS integrate well into existing public keying infrastructures.
    This document also defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for monitoring and managing the TLS Transport Model for SNMP.</p>"
