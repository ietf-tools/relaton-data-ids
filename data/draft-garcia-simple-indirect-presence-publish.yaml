abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP is extended by the SIP-events framework to provide subscriptions
    and notifications of SIP events. One example of such event notification mechanism
    is 'presence' and this presence information is carried in Presence Information
    Data Format (PIDF) documents. The SIP PUBLISH method specified in RFC 3903 carrying
    a PIDF document is typically used when presentities publish their own presence
    since these presentities are typically the source of the information. However,
    there are cases when the presentity is not the direct source of the presence information.
    One such example is location information where the end host may obtain a reference
    to location information as opposed to as a value. The endpoint is typically not
    interested in knowing its own location information, but other users or entities
    might be. So, if the endpoint gets its own location information with a reference
    and wants to publish it embedded in its presence information, it first needs to
    de-reference it for getting a value, and then it can embed that value in its presence
    information. While this is certainly a correct sequence, it adds a round-trip
    to the presence publication, in addition to a demand processing power and network
    bandwidth consumption. There is a need for a mechanism that the presentity can
    use to publish indirect references, such as indirect location references. This
    document discusses a few variants that may be used to provide this functionality.</p>"
