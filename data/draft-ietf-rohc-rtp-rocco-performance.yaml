abstract:
- content: "<p>The ROCCO header compression scheme [ROCCO] has been designed to compress
    the RTP/UDP/IP headers in an reliable, efficient and robust way also when used
    over links with high error rates and long round trip times, such as cellular links.
    This document evaluates the performance of ROCCO in such environments. It also
    summarizes how the scheme fulfills the requirements for a new RTP/UDP/IP compression
    scheme, as stated by the ROHC working group.</p>"
