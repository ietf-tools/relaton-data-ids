abstract:
- content: "<p>General requirements for signaling across the Optical UNI (O-UNI) are
    discussed in [1]. This draft describes extensions to the LDP protocol [2] to support
    those requirements. The LDP extensions described here address two areas: - The
    addition of new TLVs to support the attributes required for lightpath establishment
    at the O-UNI - Two new LDP messages to allow for the exchange of lightpath status
    information across the UNI. The content of this draft is expected to evolve as
    work progresses on the optical UNI. This draft is a work in progress.</p>"
