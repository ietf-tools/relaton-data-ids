abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) working group has
    defined many encapsulations of various layer 1 and layer 2 service- specific PDUs
    and circuit data. In most of these encapsulations, use of the Pseudowire (PW)
    Control Word is required. However, there are several encapsulations for which
    the Control Word is optional, and this optionality has been seen in practice to
    possibly introduce interoperability concerns between multiple implementations
    of those encapsulations. This survey of the Pseudowire / Virtual Circuit Connectivity
    Verification (VCCV) user community was conducted to determine implementation trends
    and the possibility of always mandating the Control Word.</p>"
