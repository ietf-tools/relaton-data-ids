abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to extend the Interface to Network Security
    Function (I2NSF) framework to make it suitable for attacks intelligent detection.
    Intelligent detection means that the network can dynamically adjust detection
    policies based on resource status, traffic features, or detection results. This
    document describes the application of I2NSF Framework for Security Management
    Automation (SMA) for attacks intelligent detection in Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) and Service Function Chaining (SFC) environment. This document will extend
    the YANG data model of Monitoring Interface, Analytics Interface and NSF-Facing
    Interface in I2NSF for SMA framework to make it suitable for attacks intelligent
    detection in SDN and SFC environments.</p>"
