abstract:
- content: <p>While the URI specification has been widely deployed, it has long been
    recognized that many valid URIs, especially those that contain extensive information
    in the "tail" are unsuitable for user presentation, especially for internationalized
    environments. IRIs have been proposed as a solution for that problem but inherit
    (and are constrained by) the complex and sometimes method-dependent syntax model
    of URIs as well as positional and ordering assumptions that make them more difficult
    to localize than is desirable. This specification illustrates a way to define
    an "above URI" model for a localization-friendly simple reference identifier (SRI)
    that explicitly identifies fields and is more appropriate than IRIs to support
    localization. The current version is intended simply to initiate a discussion.
    In particular, while it is written to use an XML element syntax model, variations
    using JSON or some other system with explicitly-labeled data fields might be as,
    or more, appropriate.</p>
