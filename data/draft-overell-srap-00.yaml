abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Roaming Authentication Protocol is intended to provide an
    authentication facility for other non-authenticated protocols. It utilises registered
    SASL [SASL] mechanisms. This protocol has been developed in order that an ISP's
    roaming customers can be authenticated when connecting via other networks or ISPs.
    Rather than deploying new client software to handle authenticating versions of
    all protocols (SMTP, POP3, NNTP etc) a single SRAP applet is deployed that handles
    the authentication for all other protocols. When the server of a non-authenticated
    protocol wishes to authenticate a client the server starts another connection
    back to the client using SRAP. The SRAP conversation authenticates the client
    to the server. The original non-authenticated protocol can now proceed. For example
    with SMTP consider two machines Alice's and Bob's. Alice's runs an SMTP client
    and a SRAP authenticatee; Bob's runs an SMTP server and a SRAP authenticator.
    Alice's machine connects to Bob's using SMTP. SMTP does not support authentication
    so another connection is made back from Bob's machine to Alice's, this time using
    SRAP. The SRAP conversation authenticates Alice to Bob. The SMTP conversation
    can now proceed.</p>"
