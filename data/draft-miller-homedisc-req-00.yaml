abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks in the home and similar environments typically do not have,
    and should not be expected to have a full range of network services such as DHCP
    servers, DNS and the like. Further, networks in the home and similar environments
    may have only occasional connectivity to a larger network such as the Internet
    where these types of services may exist. Typical users of home networks may not
    have the skills or desire to install, configure, administer and maintain a sophisticated
    home network. To enable the effective use of networks in the home and similar
    environments, methods for discovering devices and services in the network are
    needed. These methods need to work for occasionally connected and often resource-poor
    networks such as are typically found in the home. These methods also need to be
    self-configuring, requiring only minimal involvement of users of a home or similar
    network to configure and maintain that network. This document presents requirements
    for the discovery of devices and services in a home network or similar environment.
    These requirements are intended to form a basis that enables further work toward
    solutions in this area.</p>"
