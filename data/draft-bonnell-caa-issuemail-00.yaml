abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record type
    provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certificate Authorities
    that may issue certificates for the domain. The core CAA specification ([RFC8659])
    solely defines Property Tags that restrict the issuance of certificates that certify
    domain names; it does not define a mechanism for domains to restrict the issuance
    of certificates that include email addresses. This specification defines a Property
    Tag that grants authorization to Certificate Authorities to issue certificates
    which certify email addresses.</p>"
