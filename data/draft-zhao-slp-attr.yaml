abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes enabling global service attributes in the Service
    Location Protocol (SLP). A global service attribute describes a service property
    common to all service types. Its name begins with the "service-" prefix. It is
    defined via an attribute template, and can be imported into any service template.
    A single Service Request (SrvRqst) message can use global service attributes to
    search services across multiple service types. Global service attributes can be
    associated with certain special characteristics so as to support advanced discovery
    scenarios, such as URL changes, multi-access-point services, multi-function devices
    and replicated services.</p>
