abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides design considerations for application designers
    on how to add Merkle Tree Ladder (MTL) Mode signatures into their applications.
    It provides general considerations relevant to any signature algorithm in addition
    to specific considerations for MTL mode such as for grouping and ordering messages
    to be signed, computing and signing ladders, and forming signatures exchanged
    between application components, including handling caching between the signer
    and the verifier.</p>"
