abstract:
- content: <p>The key problem in routing is to map from an O/R Address onto an MTA
    (next hop). This shall be an MTA which in some sense is "nearer" to the destination
    UA. This is done repeatedly until the message can be directly delivered to the
    recipient UA. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
