abstract:
- content: "<p>In space-terrestrial integrated networks, the motion of LEO satellites
    relative to ground terminals is inevitable and can trigger the reassignment of
    terminal IP addresses, disrupting ongoing TCP connections. The traditional Mobile
    IP protocol solves this problem using a home agent and tunneling mechanism. However,
    for space- terrestrial integrated networks, Mobile IP is inefficient due to increased
    latency when registering with the remote home agent, high packet loss caused by
    large registration latency, and triangular routing to the remote home agent. To
    address these issues, this draft proposes LISP-LEO, a location/identity separation-based
    mobility management protocol for LEO satellite networks. Specifically, LISP-LEO
    divides the Earth's surface into partitions and maintains a partition-satellite
    mapping table in real-time based on the regularity of satellite motion. LISP-LEO
    always routes traffic to the satellite above the destined terminal by querying
    the partition-satellite mapping table, eliminating triangular routing and related
    performance overheads. Additionally, LISP-LEO proposes a last-hop relay to handle
    the corner case when multiple satellites occur above the destined terminal.</p>"
