abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the requirement of lightweight authentication
    and key agreement protocols for Internet of Things (LAKAPIoT). The authentication
    and key agreement protocols are very crucial for IoT since it can prevent unauthorized
    or malicious IoT devices from accessing the network. However, most IoT devices
    have limited storage, computing and communication capacity. Moreover, the network
    archi- tecture of IoT is very different from the traditional network. Therefore,
    designing authentication and key agreement protocols for IoT is an essential step
    to ensure its security. In this draft, the requirement of lightweight authentication
    and key agreement protocols for IoT is proposed.</p>"
