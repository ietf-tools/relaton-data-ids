abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for embedding a new path attribute,
    known as the FC path attribute, into BGP UPDATE messages. The FC (Forwarding Commitment)
    is a cryptographically signed object to certify an AS's routing intent on its
    directly connected hops. By incorporating the FC path attribute into BGP UPDATE
    messages. This mechanism provides enhanced route authenticity and lays the groundwork
    for improved data-plane forwarding verification. This mechanism is backward compatible,
    which means a router that supports the attribute can interoperate with a router
    that doesn't, allowing partial deployment across the Internet.</p>"
