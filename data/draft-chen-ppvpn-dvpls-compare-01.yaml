abstract:
- content: "<p>The scope of this draft is regarding the VPLS solutions - it describes
    commonalities and differences among different VPLS solutions in terms of distributed
    and non-distributed access topologies. The metrics used for comparison are derived
    from [L2VPN- METRICS] and [L2VPN-FRMK]. The current VPLS solutions that are taken
    in consideration are: GVPLS [GVPLS], DTLS [DTLS], and VPLS/HVPLS [VPLS-MPLS].
    This list of solutions is not exhaustive; other solutions may be taken into account
    in future versions of this draft.</p>"
