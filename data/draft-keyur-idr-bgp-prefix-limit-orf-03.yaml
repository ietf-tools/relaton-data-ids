abstract:
- content: <p>The BGP specification allows for "the ability to impose an (locally
    configured) upper bound on the number of address prefixes the speaker is willing
    to accept from a neighbor". In this specification, we define a new Outbound Route
    Filter type for BGP, termed "Prefix Limit Outbound Route Filter", which the speaker
    can use to communicate that upper bound to its peer. The peer is then required
    to abide by the limit. This is expected to have benefits in terms of resource
    consumption and more importantly, transparency of operation.</p>
