abstract:
- content: "<p>Today there is a growth in the number of blockchain and decentralized
    ledger networks (DLN) around the world, and interoperability across different
    networks represents a challenge for the value proposition of these networks. One
    approach for blockchain interoperability to be achieved is to employ gateways
    that permit assets to flow across the relevant networks of blockchains. However,
    a core requirement for interoperability is the correct identification of computer
    systems that act as gateways and the correct validation of the ownership of the
    gateway. A secondary requirement is for a gateway to inquire as to the existence
    of an entity address (public key) within a given decentralized ledger network.
    This memo discusses options with regards gateway identification and verification
    strategies. It looks at addressing the problem from the application layer and
    from the network layer. It also discusses other options, such as relying on a
    third-party blockchain-registered identifiers and resolver services</p>"
