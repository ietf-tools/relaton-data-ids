abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines some of the fundamental requirements and issues
    related to the control and maintenance of quality of service (QoS) in an Open
    Base Station Transport (OBAST) architecture. It begins with a review of a baseline
    OBAST architecture, highlighting those elements that are particularly relevant
    to QoS provisioning, then discusses the requirements for QoS within this framework.
    In particular, the requirements for control and maintenance of QoS during mobility
    handoffs, and for support of adaptive applications, is addressed.</p>"
