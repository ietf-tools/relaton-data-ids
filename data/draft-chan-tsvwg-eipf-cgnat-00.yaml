abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need for peer-to-peer (P2P) communication under the use
    of CGNAT in service providers. With the combination of home gateway, this becomes
    NAT444. In RFC5128, methods of using UDP hole punching solves the problem partially
    when EIM (Endpoint-Independent Mapping) is supported in NAT device in the path,
    and there exists a common rendezvous server. The success rate of UDP hole punching
    is high, but not TCP hole punching in practical world. Also, the P2P solution
    requires a common server in the public internet to exchange the IP and port information.
    In this draft, a method is described to achieve incoming TCP or UDP session without
    a common rendezvous server in NAT444 situation.</p>"
