abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream switching is a technique used to change the data rate of a media
    being streamed, typically for the purpose of adaptation to the effectively available
    bandwidth of the network. A backward compatible and independent RTSP 'SWITCH'
    command is proposed in order to enable RTSP-based stream switching.</p>"
