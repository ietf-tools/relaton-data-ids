abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a method to allow a QUIC session to carefully
    resume using a previously utilised Internet path. The method uses a set of computed
    congestion control parameters that are based on the previously observed path characteristics,
    such as the bottleneck bandwidth, available capacity, or the RTT. These parameters
    are stored and can then used to modify the congestion control behaviour of a subsequent
    connection. The draft discusses assumptions around how a server ought to utilise
    the parameters to provide opportunities for a new flow to more quickly get up
    to speed (i.e. utilise available capacity). It discusses how these changes impact
    the capacity at a shared network bottleneck and the response that is needed after
    any indication that the new rate is inappropriate.</p>"
