abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method of embedding alternative sets of cryptographic
    materials into X.509v3 digital certificates, X.509v2 Certificate Revocation Lists
    (CRLs), and PKCS #10 Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs). The embedded alternative
    cryptographic materials allow a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to use multiple
    cryptographic algorithms in a single object, and allow it to transition to the
    new cryptographic algorithms while maintaining backwards compatibility with systems
    using the existing algorithms. Three X.509 extensions and three PKCS #10 attributes
    are defined, and the signing and verification procedures for the alternative cryptographic
    material contained in the extensions and attributes are detailed.</p>"
