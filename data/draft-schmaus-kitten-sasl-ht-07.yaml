abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms
    which enable a proof-of-possession-based authentication scheme and are meant to
    be used for quick re-authentication of a previous session. The Hashed Token SASL
    mechanism's authentication sequence consists of only one round-trip. The usage
    of short-lived, exclusively ephemeral hashed tokens is achieving the single round-
    trip property. The SASL mechanism specified herin further provides hash agility,
    mutual authentication and is secured by channel binding.</p>"
