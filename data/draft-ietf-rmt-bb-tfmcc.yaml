abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies TCP-Friendly Multicast Congestion Control (TFMCC).
    TFMCC is a congestion control mechanism for multicast transmissions in a best-effort
    Internet environment. It is a single-rate congestion control scheme, where the
    sending rate is adapted to the receiver experiencing the worst network conditions.
    TFMCC is reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP flows and has a
    relatively low variation of throughput over time, making it suitable for applications
    where a relatively smooth sending rate is of importance, such as streaming media.
    This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
