abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the integration of the Areion cryptographic
    permutation into IPsec. Areion is a novel cryptographic primitive designed to
    achieve significantly lower latency for encryption and hashing operations compared
    to traditional algorithms like AES-GCM, making it particularly suitable for high-performance
    VPNs and data center interconnect scenarios. This specification defines the use
    of Areion within Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), including the associated
    keying materials and the necessary parameters for Internet Key Exchange (IKE).
    The Areion permutation is fully described in [I-D.sakemi-areion]. This document
    focuses on incorporating Areion into IPsec.</p>"
