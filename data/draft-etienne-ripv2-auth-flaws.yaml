abstract:
- content: "<p>The current strongest authentication method for RIPv2 (RFC2453[6])
    is the MD5 authentication (RFC2082[5]) which uses shared secret key to authenticate
    the packets. This memo explains the different security flaws we found in the anti-replay
    and the MACs calculation. The second part presents practical exploitations of
    these weaknesses: an attacker directly connected to a link, can (i) break neighborhood,
    (ii) flap routes and (iii) inject obsolete routes.</p>"
