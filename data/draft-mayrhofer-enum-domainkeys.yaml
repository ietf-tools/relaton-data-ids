- content: "<p>This document creates a decentralized indentity infrastructure by combining
    technology from E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).
    This infrastructure uses E.164 numbers as identities, ENUM DNS for key distribution,
    and leverages the trust relations from ENUM validation to actual messages signed
    by the number holder.</p>"
