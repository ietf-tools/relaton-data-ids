abstract:
- content: "<p>IMAP4 is being used to serve rich media content in environments that
    extend beyond traditional text-based e-mail. One example is a cellular telephone
    that can retrieve and send MIME-encoded audio data through IMAP4. While this type
    of content can be exchanged natively using IMAP4, some applications will work
    better if the message content can be manipulated using schemes external to the
    IMAP4 connection. In our cellular telephone example, it might be preferable for
    the telephone client to retrieve the audio data using RTSP. This specifications
    defines a mechanism for an IMAP4 client to request message content from a server
    through an external scheme.</p>"
