- content: "<p>With the current multicast address architecture and the proposed multicast
    address architecture, a set of guidelines is needed for multicast address allocation
    servers to use in assigning IPv6 multicast addresses. The purpose of these rules
    is to reduce the possibility of address collision not only at layer 3, but also
    on devices at layer 2.</p>"
