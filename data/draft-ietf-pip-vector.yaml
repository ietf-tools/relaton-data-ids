abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes protocols that are part of the Multi-Level
    Path Vector (MLPV) routing scheme being developed for use in PIP internets. MLPV
    is a hierarchical routing scheme. It allows an arbitrary number of levels in the
    topological hierarchy and arbitrary interconnections within and across levels.
    Conceptually, the execution of MLPV in a PIP router consists of running multiple,
    independent instances of a path vector routing algorithm, one for each level of
    the hierarchy that routes are being computed. This document describes the MLPV
    topological model and specifies the basic path vector routing schemes used at
    various levels of the hierarchy.</p>"
