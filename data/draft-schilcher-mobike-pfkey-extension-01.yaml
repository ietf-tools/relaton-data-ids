abstract:
- content: "<p>PF_KEY is a generic key management API used for communication between
    a trusted user level key management daemon and a key engine within the operating
    system. With the extension of IKEv2 for mobility and multihoming (MOBIKE) the
    existing capabilities of PF_KEY with regard to the creation, maintenance and deletion
    of security associations became insufficient. This document defines an extension
    to update an entity in the security association database. Additionally, it is
    necessary to reflect the newly offered integrity and encryption algorithms with
    IKEv2 in PF_KEY.</p>"
