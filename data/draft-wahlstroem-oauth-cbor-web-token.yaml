abstract:
- content: "<p>CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be
    transferred between two parties. CWT is a profile of the JSON Web Token (JWT)
    that is optimized for constrained devices. The claims in a CWT are encoded in
    the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
    (COSE) is used for added application layer security protection. A claim is a piece
    of information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/ value pair
    consisting of a claim name and a claim value.</p>"
