abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of cloud computing technology, cloud datacenters
    have been influenced. Co-deployment of SDN and NFV technology shows its distinct
    advantages of vitalizing network resources in providing VPC services and SFC services.In
    order to deploy SDN and NFV in cloud datacenters, a resolution test has been conducted.
    According to the resolution test, SDN and NFV technology has been mature already
    for the commercial deployment in operators' network. However, there are some key
    problems on network architecture, virtualized platform, standard interfaces and
    so on to be working out in practical practice.</p>"
