abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by GMPLS technology is “how it
    can be deployed” in a manner least impacting to existing IP/ MPLS networks. GMPLS
    architecture document lists [RFC3945] three different scenarios in which GMPLS
    technology can be deployed: overlay, augmented and integrated. Reference [GMPLS-mig]
    addresses the problem of migration from MPLS to GMPLS networks using the integrated
    model. This draft addresses the same problem space for augmented model and illustrates
    the applicability of augmented model in deploying GMPLS technology in existing
    IP/ MPLS networks.</p>"
