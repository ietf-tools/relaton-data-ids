abstract:
- content: "<p>Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD) workload,
    and says that it takes the first full term to understand the job. Empirically,
    the AD workload is high sometimes causing backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts
    and stressing the ADs. After some discussions in the GENDISPATCH working group
    and arising from an Internet-Draft postulating changes that might reduce the AD
    workload, several ADs reported some data on how they spent their time in a few
    weeks chosen at random. This document collates that data and presents it for information.
    This document does not attempt to draw any conclusions from the limited data currently
    available, and there is no intention to publish this document as an RFC.</p>"
