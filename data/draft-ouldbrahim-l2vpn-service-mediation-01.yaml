abstract:
- content: '<p>[SWALLOW-IW] describes an approach for interworking a native ATM SPVC
    segment with an ATM/FR-based pseudowire. The approach requires that an ATM edge
    device to encode the remote MPLS provider edge IP address within the NSAP destination
    address per call-basis, and covers mostly ATM and FRF.8 specifications. This draft
    covers other scenarios where a) the native layer-2 edge doesnâ€™t have a priori
    knowledge of the remote PE IP addresses, b) the Layer-2 Provider Edge and the
    layer-2 network can be native Frame Relay (FR) using native layer-2 signaling
    protocols, c) the native layer-2 network can use not only NSAP addressing but
    as well E.164, X.121, or any preferred native addressing scheme, and d) the interface
    between the MPLS/IP network and native layer-2 network can be FRF.10/X.76 interface.
    We refer to the above problem space as "Service Mediation" to indicate that the
    native layer-2 signaling is terminated at the MPLS/IP device attached to the layer-2
    network and the "mediated" service is an end-to-end connection built from two
    segments: one segment is in its native layer-2 form which we denote as Native
    Wire (NW) established using native layer-2 signaling protocols and the other segment
    is a pseudowire (PW) established using PWE3/L2VPN signaling protocols.</p>'
