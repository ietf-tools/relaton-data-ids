abstract:
- content: "<p>Recording of a conversation presents a possible breach of privacy.
    This document presents a use of the SIP Preconditions Framework to negotiate the
    recording guidelines for the session. One party may assert either their desire
    to record or their restriction of the other party's recording. In order to establish
    the session, the other party must respond that it agrees to the conditions. While
    this does not have the power to limit the physical recording by the user on the
    end system, it provides evidence of the expressed wishes of one party and the
    agreement of the other.</p>"
