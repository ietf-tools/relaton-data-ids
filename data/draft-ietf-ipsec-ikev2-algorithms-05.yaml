abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms
    in order to provide security services. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE (RFC 2409)
    and IKEv2) provide a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms should be used in
    any given association. However, to ensure interoperability between disparate implementations,
    it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure
    that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available.
    This document defines the current set of algorithms that are mandatory to implement
    as part of IKEv2, as well as algorithms that should be implemented because they
    may be promoted to mandatory at some future time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
