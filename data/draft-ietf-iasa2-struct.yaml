abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established
    in 2005. In the 13 years from 2005 to 2018, the needs of the IETF have evolved
    in ways that require changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this
    document is to outline a proposed new "IASA 2.0" structure and to document the
    decisions made by the IASA2 Working Group over the past 20 months in developing
    the proposed structure. The proposal is for the work of the IETF's administrative
    and fundraising tasks to be conducted by a new administrative organization, the
    IETF Administration Limited Liability Company ("LLC"). Under the proposal, the
    Internet Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) will be eliminated, and its
    oversight and advising functions transferred to the new LLC Board.</p>
