abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) is defined in RFC7854. Most of the
    types of messages in BMP are extensible via the mechanism of TLVs. However, the
    most important type of message, the route-monitoring message, has a fixed format.
    This document proposes a relatively small change to the format of BMP route-monitoring
    messages. The new format of route-monitoring messages is no longer fixed-format,
    but tlv-encoded. This document also proposes to split the route-monitoring message-type
    into 3 new message-types. For Adj-RIB-In, Adj-RIB-Out and Loc-RIB. This document
    proposes two types of TLVs to be used in this new format. A TLV to report the
    BGP update message itself. And a flags- field TLV, to report state of the reported
    routes.</p>"
