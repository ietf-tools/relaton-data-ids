abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHC)
    Option for client requesting and/or receiving a Public Safety Answering Point
    (PSAP) or Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) URI to be used by higher layer
    protocols during emergency calling. In some network models, an ESRP URI and a
    PSAP URI will be equivalent from the client's point of view, therefore this document
    purposely vague differentiating between the two, as the difference does not matter
    to DHCP.</p>"
