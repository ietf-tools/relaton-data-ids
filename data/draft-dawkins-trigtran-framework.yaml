abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF-standardized unicast transport protocols have been designed to
    allow two end points to maintain communications by individually reacting to loss
    or degraded packet arrival times. Historically, those protocols have assumed loss
    is congestive and have reacted by decreasing the packet transmission rate to ease
    congestion. There are a number of cases, however, where these assumptions are
    incorrect, and one or more path segments present losses due to intermittent connectivity,
    a high uncorrected error rate, or the need for access path changes ('hand-off's).
    Previous work [PILC] has addressed these conditions using end-to-end mechanisms.
    This draft examines the use of an on-path signaling mechanisms capable of providing
    advisory notifications for use in modifying the behavior of the transport in order
    to better respond to actual network conditions. This draft serves to create discussion
    in this area as there are many ways to skin the cat. We are interested in hearing
    about them through open discussion.</p>"
