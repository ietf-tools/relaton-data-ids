abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use
    an IP backbone to provide VPNs for its customers. MPLS is used for forwarding
    packets over the backbone, and BGP is used for distributing routes over the backbone.
    The primary goal of this method is to support the case in which a client obtains
    IP backbone services from a Service Provider or Service Providers with which it
    maintains contractual relationships. The client may be an enterprise, a group
    of enterprises which need an extranet, an Internet Service Provider, an application
    service provider, another VPN Service Provider which uses this same method to
    offer VPNs to clients of its own, etc. The method makes it very simple for the
    client to use the backbone services. It is also very scalable and flexible for
    the Service Provider, and allows the Service Provider to add value.</p>"
