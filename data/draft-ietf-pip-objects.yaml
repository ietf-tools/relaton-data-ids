abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip has a strong separation of packet syntax and semantics. Each Pip
    system determines its own syntax for the Handling Directive (HD) and Routing Context
    (RC) fields. While the syntax can be local, the semantics that the syntax represents
    must be globally unambiguous. This document 1) describes the syntax for globally
    unambiguous Pip HD and RC semantics, 2) a packet format for exchanging the mappings
    between semantics and HD and RC syntax, and 3) lists objects defined for Pip operation.</p>"
