abstract:
- content: "<p>Although Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) contributes
    the population of the Internationalized Domains, it forces human DNS managers
    to handle unreadable DNS records. In order to enable human managers to easily
    edit or modify DNS records, DNS servers should allow Unicode resource records.
    This document defines the formats of DNS Resource Records and a translation process
    that supports Unicode Resource Records without ruining the interoperability with
    existing DNS infrastructure.</p>"
