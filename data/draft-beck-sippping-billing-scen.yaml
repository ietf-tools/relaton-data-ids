abstract:
- content: "<p>In contrast to other Internet services, most SIP sessions take place
    between individuals. Today's billing schemes (flat rate or volume based) do not
    reflect that. A caller causes costs on the callee's side. With SIP's authentication
    methods and few additional headers, a SIP billing service could be established
    that would enable callees to charge their callers. Call stateful proxies are not
    required.</p>"
