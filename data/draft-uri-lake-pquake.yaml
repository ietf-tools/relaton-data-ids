abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Post-Quantum Authenticated Key Exchange (PQuAKE)
    protocol that addresses the needs of bandwidth- and/or power-constrained environments,
    while maintaining strong security guarantees. It accomplishes that by minimizing
    the number of bits that need to be exchanged and by utilizing an implicit peer
    authentication approach similar to Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV) design. This protocol
    is suitable for integration into protocols that establish dynamic secure sessions,
    such as Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), Internet Key Exchange Version
    2 (IKEv2), or Secure COmmunications Interoperability Protocol (SCIP). This protocol
    has proofs in the verifiers Verifpal and CryptoVerif for security properties such
    as secrecy of the session key, mutual authentication, identity hiding with a preshared
    secret, and forward secrecy of the session key. The authors are in the process
    of publishing the proofs.</p>"
