abstract:
- content: "<p>This document includes comments and recommendations by the IAB on some
    architectural and policy issues related to the chartering of Open Pluggable Edge
    Services (OPES) in the IETF. OPES are services that would be deployed at application-level
    intermediaries in the network, for example, at a web proxy cache between the origin
    server and the client. These intermediaries would transform or filter content,
    with the explicit consent of either the content provider or the end user. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
