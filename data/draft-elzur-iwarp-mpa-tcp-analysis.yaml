abstract:
- content: "<p>Further explanation and analysis of architectural recommendations contained
    in the recent Internet-Draft, Marker PDU Aligned Framing for TCP Specification
    [MPA], is provided. The impact of the following three attributes of MPA over TCP
    is examined: * packing of multiple DDP ULPDUs into one TCP segment; * simplifying
    the receiver due to transmitter alignment of DDP headers with TCP headers; and
    * mistakenly attempting to interoperate an MPA-enabled endpoint with a non-MPA-enabled
    endpoint.</p>"
