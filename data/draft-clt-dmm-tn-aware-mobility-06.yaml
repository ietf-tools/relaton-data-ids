abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework and mapping from slices in 5G mobile
    systems to transport slices in IP and Layer 2 transport networks. Slices in 5G
    systems are characterized by latency bounds, reservation guarantees, jitter, data
    rates, availability, mobility speed, usage density, criticality and priority should
    be mapped to transport slice characteristics that include bandwidth, latency and
    criteria such as isolation, directionality and disjoint routes. Mobile slice criteria
    need to be mapped to the appropriate transport slice and capabilities offered
    in backhaul, midhaul and fronthaul connectivity segments between radio side network
    functions and user plane function (gateway). This document describes how mobile
    network functions map its slice criteria to identifiers in IP packets that transport
    segments use to grant transport layer services. This is based on mapping between
    mobile and IP transport underlays (IPv6, MPLS, IPv4, Segment Routing). Applicability
    of this framework and a new transport network underlay routing mechanism, Preferred
    Path Routing (PPR), which brings slice properties and works with any underlying
    transport (L2, IPv4, SR and MPLS) is also discussed.</p>"
