abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a keyed-MD5 mechanism for use as a message
    authentication code (MAC) (or, integrity check value -- ICV). It is mainly intended
    for integrity verification of information transmitted over open networks (e.g.,
    Internet) between parties that share a common secret key. The proposed mechanism
    combines the (key-less) MD5 hash function [RFC-1321] with a shared secret key.
    The description of keyed-MD5 in this document is independent of its use in any
    particular protocol. An analogous mechanism can be used in combination with other
    iterative hash functions, e.g., SHA.</p>"
