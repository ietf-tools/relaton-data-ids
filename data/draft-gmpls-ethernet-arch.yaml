abstract:
- content: <p>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities
    of Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding
    into "transport networks" that previously were the domain of other technologies
    such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM. This document defines an architecture and framework
    for a GMPLS based control plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity.
    GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies. Some additional extensions
    to the GMPLS control plane are needed and this document provides a framework for
    these extensions.Contents</p>
