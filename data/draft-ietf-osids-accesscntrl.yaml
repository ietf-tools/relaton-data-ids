abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extended ACL (Access Control List) mechanism for
    the OSI Directory. It is intended to meet strong operational requirements to restrict
    searching and listing externally, while allowing much more freedom within an organization.
    In particular, this mechanism makes it possible to restrict searches to certain
    sets of attributes, and to prevent ``trawling'': the disclosure of large organizational
    data or structure information by repeated searches or lists. This capability is
    necessary for organizations that want to hide their internal structure, or to
    prevent dumping of their entire database. This memo describes functionality beyond,
    but compatible with, that expected in the 1992 X.500 standard.</p>"
