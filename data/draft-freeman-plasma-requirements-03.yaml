abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many situations where organizations want to protect information
    with robust access control, either for implementation of intellectual property
    right protections, enforcement of contractual confidentiality agreements or because
    of legal regulations. The Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME defines
    an access control mechanism which is enforced by the recipient's client after
    decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore is dependent on the correct
    access policy configuration of every recipient's client. This mechanism also provides
    full access to the data to all recipients prior to the access control check, this
    is considered to be inadequate due to the difficulty in demonstrating policy compliance.
    This document lays out the deficiencies of the current ESS security label, and
    presents requirements for a new model for doing/providing access control to messages
    where the access check is performed prior to message content decryption. This
    new model also does not require policy configuration on the client to simplify
    deployment and compliance verification. The proposed model additionally provides
    a method where non-X.509 certificate credentials can be used for encryption/decryption
    of S/MIME messages.</p>"
