abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a discussion on possible methods for extending
    Layer 2 Virtual LANs across MPLS networks through the use of CR-LDP or RSVP. Special
    note is taken on extending 802.1Q Tagged VLANs across MPLS networks. A new Forward
    Equivalence class called VLAN Forwarding Equivalence class (VFEC) is defined.
    Creating traffic engineered LSP based on P bit of the 802.1Q Tag is also a key
    focus of this document.</p>"
