abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the trust concept and design of the SCION _control-plane
    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)_, SCION's public key infrastructure model. SCION
    (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) is a path-aware,
    inter-domain network architecture. The control-plane PKI, or short CP-PKI, handles
    cryptographic material and lays the foundation for the authentication procedures
    in SCION. It is used by SCION's control plane to authenticate and verify path
    information, and builds the basis for SCION's special trust model based on so-called
    Isolation Domains. This document first introduces the trust model behind the SCION's
    control-plane PKI, as well as clarifications to the concepts used in it. This
    is followed by specifications of the different types of certificates and the Trust
    Root Configuration. The document then specifies how to deploy the whole infrastructure.</p>"
