abstract:
- content: "<p>Many services on the Internet need to verify ownership or control of
    a domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034] [RFC1035]. This verification
    is often done by requesting a specific DNS record to be visible in the domain.
    This document surveys various techniques in wide use today, the pros and cons
    of each, and proposes some practices to avoid known problems.</p>"
