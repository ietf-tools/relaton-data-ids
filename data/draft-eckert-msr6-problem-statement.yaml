abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft summarizes additional personal opinions of the author for
    why existing stateless multicast solutions BIER/BIER-TE are not sufficient to
    support the operator, architecture and use-case goals that MSR6 proposes to solve.
    This document is complementary to problems outlined in I-D.liu-msr6- problem-statement
    and in no way affects any of them. Instead, it attempts to look more at lower-layer
    functional challenges of current stateless source routing multicast solutions
    (BIER/BIER-TE), as well as architectural, network and protocol design ecosystem
    requirements of operators.</p>"
