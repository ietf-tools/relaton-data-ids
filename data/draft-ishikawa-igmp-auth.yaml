abstract:
- content: "<p>The security enhancement is one of the most important enhancements
    to IP multicast. IP multicast requires many security functions that include user
    authentication of IP multicast, encryption of IP multicast datagrams and key management
    protocols for IP multicast. Among them, the user authentication function for IP
    multicast is considered one of the most important security functions for IP multicast.
    This document describes the extension to IGMP, version 2 (IGMPv2) [1] for the
    authentication of IP multicast senders and receivers, which prevents an unauthorized
    user from sending and receiving IP multicast datagrams.</p>"
