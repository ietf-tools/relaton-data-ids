abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Optional Parameter, called Capabilities
    TLV, that is expected to facilitate the introduction of new capabilities in the
    Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) by providing graceful capability advertisement
    without requiring that LDP peering be terminated. The "LDP peering" in this document
    refers to the TCP connection between the 2 routers and not the actual session.
    The "LDP session" refers to the connection after the initialization message has
    been successfully processed and the session is marked operational.</p>
