abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] outlines the problem space for
    CDN Interconnection within the IETF. This documents provides a complimentary set
    of technical use cases for how CDNs may be interconnected. The goal of this document
    is to outline real world use-cases for CDN Interconnect, for the IETF, with the
    intention of supporting the case for formation of a Working Group which would
    work on the definition of standardised, interoperable methods of Interconnecting
    CDNs. The goal of this document is NOT to define the technical solutions to be
    used. The intent of this document is to outline a set of technical use cases.
    While the technical use cases may be influenced by business- related and other
    non-technical factors, this document does not attempt to detail any non-technical
    aspects of CDN Interconnect.</p>"
