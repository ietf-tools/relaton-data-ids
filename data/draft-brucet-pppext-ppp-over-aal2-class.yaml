abstract:
- content: "<p>PPP over AAL2 [1] defines the encapsulation that allows a PPP session
    to be transported over an ATM virtual circuit using the AAL2 adaptation layer.
    Using AAL2 as an adaptation layer for PPP transport over ATM provides a bandwidth
    efficient transport for IP applications that generate small packets. An example
    IP application that generates small packets is RTP encapsulated voice (Voice over
    IP).</p>"
