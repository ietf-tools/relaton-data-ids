abstract:
- content: <p>Provider Provisioned Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) may have
    different "provisioning models", i.e., models for what information needs to be
    configured in what entities. Once configured, the provisioning information is
    distributed by a "discovery process". When the discovery process is complete,
    a signaling protocol is automatically invoked to set up the mesh of pseudowires
    (PWs) that form the (virtual) backbone of the L2VPN. This document specifies a
    number of L2VPN provisioning models, and further specifies the semantic structure
    of the endpoint identifiers required by each model. It discusses the distribution
    of these identifiers by the discovery process, especially when discovery is based
    on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). It then specifies how the endpoint identifiers
    are carried in the two signaling protocols that are used to set up PWs, the Label
    Distribution Protocol (LDP), and the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).
