abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a standard format and a standard navigation
    mechanism so that mail stores can provide interoperable access to mailboxes and
    messages over HTTP. Mailbox contents and listings of mailboxes are exposed as
    Atom Feeds, while messages themselves are downloaded as a document of type message/822.
    Each mailbox and each message is assigned an HTTP URL, and if permissions checks
    are satisfied, each message may be downloaded independently.</p>"
