abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a modification of the use of the SIP protocol to
    perform route reservation. These modifications are applied to two of the existing
    SIP Methods: INVITE and REGISTER. The modifications allow the INVITE method to
    be used to find the best path across a particular network based on QoS metrics.
    The route choice is able to be restricted at the network edge. The proposed modifications
    also allow the REGISTER method to be used as a means of disseminating information
    necessary to determine these QoS metrics. This information can be used to route
    INVITEs away from known areas of congestion.</p>"
