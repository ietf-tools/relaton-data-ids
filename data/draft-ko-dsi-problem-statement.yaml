- content: "<p>This document examines the problems and challenges associated with
    the process of setting up secure interconnections between authorized network nodes.
    The network nodes can be located anywhere in a private or public network, directly
    connected or behind one or more levels of NAT [NAT]. Setting up a secure interconnection
    in this environment entails the resolution of various issues such as authentication,
    peer discovery, virtual network address management, and connection parameters
    determination.</p>"
