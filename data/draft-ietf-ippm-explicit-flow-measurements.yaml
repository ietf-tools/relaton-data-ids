abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes protocol independent methods called Explicit
    Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques that can be applicable to transport-layer
    protocols between client and server. These methods employ just a few marking bits
    inside the header of each packet for performance measurements and require collaborative
    client and server. Both endpoints cooperate by marking packets and, possibly,
    mirroring the markings on the round-trip connection. The techniques are especially
    valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt transport headers, since they
    enable loss and delay measurements by passive on- path network devices. This document
    describes several methods that can be used separately or jointly, depending of
    the availability of marking bits, desired measurements, and properties of the
    protocol to which the methods are applied.</p>"
