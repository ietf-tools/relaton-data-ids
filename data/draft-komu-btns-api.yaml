abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec based security is usually transparent for applications and and
    they h have no common mechanism for gathering information about protected network
    connections and being aware of underlying security mechanisms. This document specifies
    an API that increases the visibility of IPsec to applications. The API allows
    applications to use the Stand-alone BTNS mode, control the channel bindigs, and
    control also other network security properties related to IPsec.</p>"
