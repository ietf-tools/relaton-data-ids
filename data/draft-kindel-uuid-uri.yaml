abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a Universal Resource Identifier (URI) scheme that
    allows resources to be uniquely named over time and space using Universally Unique
    Identifiers (UUIDs). A UUID URI is a pure URI, in that it contains no information
    about location. However due to the uniqueness of UUIDs, a UUID URI is persistent
    over time, much like URNs. UUID URIs are useful in situations where a unique identifier
    is required that cannot or should not be tied to a particular physical root namespace
    (such as a DNS name).</p>"
