abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies guidelines that must be implemented by any
    entity responsible for allocating IPv6 multicast addresses. This includes, but
    is not limited to, any documents or entities wishing to assign permanent IPv6
    multicast addresses, allocate dynamic IPv6 multicast addresses, and define permanent
    IPv6 multicast group identifiers. The purpose of these guidelines is to reduce
    the probability of IPv6 multicast address collision, not only at the IPv6 layer,
    but also at the link-layer of media that encode portions of the IP layer address
    into the MAC layer address.</p>"
