abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests an advanced mail transfer protocol in order to find
    a modern, flexible, extensible, efficient, and robust successor of SMTP. The presented
    protocol uses a HTTP-ish syntax. It is designed to give the receiver of a message
    finer control over accepting or rejecting the message, and to allow negotiation
    of transport details. The memo is still in a very early state and intended to
    initiate a discussion, not to present a finished protocol. The protocol can be
    understood as a workbench for future mail extensions.</p>"
