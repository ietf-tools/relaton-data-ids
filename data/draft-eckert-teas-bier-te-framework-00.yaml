abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER-TE is an application-state free, (loose) source routed multicast
    forwarding method where every hop and destination is identified via bits in a
    bitstring of the data packets. It is described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch]. BIER-TE
    is a variant of [RFC8279] in support of such explicit path engineering. This document
    described the traffic engineering control framework for use with the BIER-TE forwarding
    plane: How to enable the ability to calculate paths and integrate this forwarding
    plane into an overall TE solution.</p>"
