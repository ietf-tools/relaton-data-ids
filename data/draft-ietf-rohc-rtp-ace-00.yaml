abstract:
- content: "<p>When Real-Time Multimedia over IP is applied to cellular systems, it
    is critical to minimize the overhead of the IP/UDP/RTP header, as spectral efficiency
    is a top requirement. Robustness to errors and error bursts is also a must. Existing
    IP/UDP/RTP header compression schemes such as that presented in IETF RFC 2508
    [CRTP], do not provide sufficient performance in such environments. This report
    describes a new scheme (ACE, or Adaptive header ComprEssion) , which like RFC
    2508, is based on the idea that most of the time IP/UDP/RTP fields are either
    constant or can be extrapolated in a linear fashion. However, ACE incorporates
    several additional concepts which enable it to provide excellent compression efficiency
    (exceeds the performance of [CRTP]) along with a high degree of error-resiliency.
    Some of the concepts employed, such as Variable Length Encoding (VLE), enable
    ACE to adapt to changing behavior in the IP/UDP/RTP header fields, such that good
    efficiency and robustness characteristics are maintained over a wide range of
    operating conditions. ACE is a general framework that can be parameterized to
    account for the existence/non-existence and performance characteristics of the
    feedback channel. Thus, ACE is applicable over both bi-directional and unidirectional
    links. ACE is also able to perform a seamless handoff, i.e. the scheme can resume
    efficient compression operation immediately after handoff.</p>"
