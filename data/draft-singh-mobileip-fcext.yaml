abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes extensions to the mobile IP as used in third generation
    wireless network [7,1,14] to provide a flow control mechanism on a per-session
    basis for data sent from the packet data servicing node (PDSN) to a radio network
    node (RNN). This extension solves the problem of significant performance degradation
    when packets are dropped at the RNN due to channel setup latency and rate mismatch
    between the air interface and link between the RNN and PDSN (RP link).</p>"
