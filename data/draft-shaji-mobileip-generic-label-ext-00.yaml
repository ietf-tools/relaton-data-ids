abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is regarding extended label distribution method using
    Mobile IP registration and binding protocols. The document specifies a novel method
    in which the label mapping information for a particular mobile registration is
    piggybacked or placed in the same Mobile IP registration request and response
    message. To apply this same method to the route optimization protocol in Mobile
    IP, the label mapping information is piggybacked or placed in the binding update
    request message. The label mapping information is carried using Mobile IP registration
    extensions. The document also addresses the applicability of this label distribution
    method in GRE, MPLS and IPv6 networks.</p>"
