abstract:
- content: "<p>As mobile nodes move to new links, they need to resume their communications
    in a timely fashion. To communicate, IPv6 nodes need to complete router discovery,
    address auto-configuration, and other tasks. Unfortunately, this depends on prior
    completion of the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) protocol, introducing a mandatory
    delay of up to one second. This document discusses where this can be problematic
    and proposes solutions that can alleviate the problem.</p>"
