abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) plays a crucial role in
    network diagnostics and error reporting. However, it is a challenge to verify
    the legitimacy of a received ICMP error message, particularly when the ICMP error
    message is embedded with stateless protocol data. As a result, adversaries can
    forge ICMP error messages, leading to potential exploitation and off-path attacks.
    This document proposes a novel method to enhance ICMP authentication by introducing
    a challenge-confirm mechanism. This mechanism embeds random numbers in the IP
    options field to strengthen the authentication of ICMP error messages. By doing
    so, it mitigates the risks associated with forged messages, improves the overall
    robustness of the protocol, and enhances network security. The proposed solution
    includes details on the challenge-confirm mechanism, random number generation
    and management, and integration with IP options. Additionally, it discusses security
    and deployment considerations to ensure its practical implementation.</p>"
