abstract:
- content: "<p>NEMO basic support enables Mobile Networks by extending Mobile IP to
    Mobile Routers. In the case of nested Mobile Networks, this involves the overhead
    of nested tunnels between the Mobile Routers and their Home Agents, and causes
    a number of security issues. This proposal alleviates those problems as well as
    other minor ones, by using a source routing within the mobile nested structure,
    introducing a new routing header, called the reverse routing header.</p>"
