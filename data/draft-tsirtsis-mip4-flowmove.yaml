abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv4 allows Mobile Nodes (MN) to create mobility bindings between
    their Home Address (HoA) and their current Care-of Address (CoA) in a Home Agent
    (HA) so that the HA can redirect traffic for the MN to its current location. This
    draft extends MIPv4 so that the binding granularity is on a per flow basis. Extensions
    are defined to allow the registration of multiple CoAs and the definition of individual
    flows. Individual flows can then be pointed to the registered CoAs.</p>"
