abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides general guidelines to assist the authors of
    Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) building block and protocol instantiation definitions.
    The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that any building block and protocol
    instantiation definitions produced contain sufficient information to fully explain
    their operation and use. In addition these guidelines provide directions to specify
    modular and clearly defined RMT building blocks and protocol instantiations that
    can be refined and augmented to safely create new protocols for use in new scenarios
    for which any existing protocols were not designed. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
