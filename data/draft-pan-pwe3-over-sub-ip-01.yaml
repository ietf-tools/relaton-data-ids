abstract:
- content: "<p>Several recent developments have significantly affected the carrier
    access networks. First, all large carrier backbones have migrated to MPLS. Second,
    carriers are upgrading access circuits with less expensive and high-speed Ethernet.
    Finally, the carriers will be offering advanced data services over the access
    network infrastructure. Subsequently, the carriers have to face challenges in
    migration cost, data transport efficiency and edge-to-edge user traffic management.
    The Dry-Martini architecture is designed to help the carriers to alleviate these
    challenges. It provides an approach to establish and maintain pseudo-wires over
    any access network infrastructure, while stripping off much of the IP/MPLS routing
    and signaling features that are irrelevant in access network. As a result, all
    the existing transport equipment, such as SONET/SDH MSPP, can provide MPLS pseudo-
    wire functionality without much change to the existing platform. Further, due
    its simplicity, this approach allows the new access devices, such as PON’s and
    Ethernet CPE’s, to maintain low cost, while being able to interface with MPLS
    networks. This document assumes that the reader has at least some familiarity
    with MPLS and pseudo-wire technologies.</p>"
