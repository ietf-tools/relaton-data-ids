abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is used to
    record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source to a destination
    host. This collects a minimum recorded MTU along the path to the destination.
    The value can then be communicated back to the source using the return Path MTU
    field in the option. This Hop-by-Hop option is intended to be used in environments
    like Data Centers and on paths between Data Centers, to allow them to better take
    advantage of paths able to support a large Path MTU.</p>"
