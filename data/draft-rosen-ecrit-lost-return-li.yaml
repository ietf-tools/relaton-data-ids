- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) to permit a location
    information to be returned in a findservice response. When the validation is requested
    in the findservice request, the location information supplied in the request may
    have enough valid address components (CAtypes) to be considered valid, but the
    LoST server may wish to return address components CAtypes not found in the query.</p>"
