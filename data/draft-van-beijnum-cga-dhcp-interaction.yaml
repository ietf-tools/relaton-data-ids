abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographically Generated Addresses as defined for IPv6 Secure Neighbor
    Discovery are generated locally on the host using the CGA. However, it can be
    desireable for other systems to be involved in the generation and use of CGAs
    in a number of ways: offloading the heavy cryptography for generating or validating
    CGAs, proxy-generation of CGAs for hosts that don't support the CGA-related protocols
    themselves or registration of CGA addresses for the purposes of central address
    administration. When additional hosts are involved in aspects of CGA, it's necessary
    to discover these other hosts and/or additional configuration items such as the
    Sec value. The DHCPv6 is a natural choice for doing this. This document provides
    an overview of the opportunities and issues in this area.</p>"
