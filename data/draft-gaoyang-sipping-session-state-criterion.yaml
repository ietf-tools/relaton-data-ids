abstract:
- content: <p>There is debate on the topic of "Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer on
    Unsuccessful re-INVITE". The reason of the confusion is some application/session
    usages of offer/answer imply the nest transaction(mean transaction theory, not
    mean sip transaction) concept, but whitout unambiguous definition. This paper
    reveal the concept of nest transactions in current RFC and other well known application/session
    usages. And then clarify that there is no ambiguous state of session modification
    using current RFC definition.</p>
