abstract:
- content: "<p>Connectivity checks as proposed by Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) are used to detect problems that cause endpoints not to receive media. However,
    in some cases connectivity checks are not seen as necessary, or such checks are
    not feasible for certain bearer types. This document defines a new candidate address
    type for which connectivity checks are not performed.</p>"
