abstract:
- content: "<p>In many flavors of the nowadays address translators, real addresses
    are assigned to private hosts without preserving uniqueness; the same real address
    can be shared among multiple private hosts and the same private host can also
    obtain different addresses over the time as well. As a result the addresses used
    for private hosts reflect some kind of ambiguity on those hosts. This proposal
    introduces the IDNAT model as a solution for that address ambiguity problem. This
    solution concentrates on defining another virtual identity to identify private
    hosts in replacement of the ambiguous assigned real IP address. Through agile
    practices this identity can be assigned to each of the private hosts, and the
    hosts themselves will be aware of their assigned Ids which are going to be quite
    unique throughout the private region as well as the entire Internet realm. Moreover,
    the new Id will play a centric role in the packets transmission so as to identify
    the private host outside the private region and hence defeating the undesired
    ambiguity.</p>"
