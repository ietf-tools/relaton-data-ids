abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extension to PCEP to configure LSP parameters.
    Some of LSP parameters are needed to configure S-BFD for candidate paths. Each
    candidate path is identified in PCEP by its uniquely assigned PLSP-ID. The mechanism
    proposed in this document is applicable to to all path setup types. The need for
    these definitions first appeared for Segment Routing path setup type, both MPLS
    and IPv6 data planes of SR.</p>"
