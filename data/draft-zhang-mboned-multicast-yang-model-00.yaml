abstract:
- content: "<p>This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast
    YANG data model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full advantages
    of existed multicast protocol models to control the multicast network, and guides
    the deployment of multicast service. And also, there will define several possible
    RPCs about how to interact between multicast YANG data model and multicast protocol
    models. This multicast YANG data model is mainly used by the management tools
    run by the network operators in order to manage, monitor and debug the network
    resources used to deliver multicast service, as well as gathering some data from
    the network.</p>"
