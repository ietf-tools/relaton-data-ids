- content: "<p>This document describes IGP extensions to support Traffic Engineering
    (TE) of deterministic routing, by specifying new information that a router can
    place in the advertisement of neighbors. This information describes additional
    details regarding the state of the network that are useful for deterministic traffic
    engineering path computations.</p>"
