abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses how to securely achieve the nested tunnels
    optimization using nested path information that reflects the optimized path from
    Top Level Mobile Router(TLMR) to Mobile Router(MR) in nested mobile networks.
    The solution is based on Reverse Routing Header(RRH) idea and the concern of security
    problem in RRH. By carefully taking a look at the simplicity of Routing Header
    Type 2 routing mechanism and the complexity of Access Router Option(ARO) based
    solution to get rid of the threat of possible attack for RRH, the proposed solution
    has been considered to preserve the efficiency of RRH without the lack of security.</p>"
