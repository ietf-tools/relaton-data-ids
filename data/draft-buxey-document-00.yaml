abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 822 [RFC0822] defines many headers which can be applied to email
    messages and RFC 2076 [RFC2076] provides a simple summary of the commonly occurring
    headers in headings of e-mail messages. Both of these RFCs define the 'In-Reply-To'
    and 'References' fields - which have since had their definitions improved in RFC
    2822 [RFC2822] and RFC 1036 [RFC1036] respectively. These fields are used by 'thread
    capable' email clients to display messages grouped together in organised parent/child
    relationships that enable the reader to follow a train of thought or a process
    of information dissemination. However, if a reply to such a threaded message does
    not contain relevant follow-up information or is used as a platform to deliver
    a new message with new subject, then that reply is put within the already existing
    thread. This is known as 'Thread-Jacking'. This draft proposes a couple of techniques
    which can be undertaken to resolve this issue within the scope of email.</p>"
