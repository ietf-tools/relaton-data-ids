abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses issues with assigning an IP address to a host
    interface such that the IP address may only be used with a restricted set of ports.
    This concept is referred to herein as a port- restricted IP address. A number
    of issues with this concept are documented, and the issues are contrasted with
    other approaches to dealing with IPv4 address exhaustion.</p>"
