abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3588 allows a Diameter redirect agent to specify one or more individual
    hosts to which a Diameter message may be redirected by an upstream Diameter node.
    However, in some circumstances an operator may wish to redirect messages to an
    alternate domain without specifying individual hosts. This document specifies
    the means by which this can be achieved.</p>"
