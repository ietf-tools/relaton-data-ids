abstract:
- content: <p>The "ISD" model for specifying the definition, status, and content of
    Internet Standards does not appear to be satisfactory for the documents that describe
    IETF procedures, structure, or relationships with other bodies. Those documents
    have traditionally be published as BCPs and described as "process" BCPs. This
    document proposes an special document series for those process documents, paralleling
    the ISDs.</p>
