abstract:
- content: "<p>On-path telemetry techniques can provide high-precision inband flow
    insight and real-time network performance monitoring. Although they are benefical,
    network operators still face challenges applying such techniques, especially flow
    identification when deploying flow- oriented monitoring on a large scale. This
    document introduces the real network scenarios, and intends to address the problems
    by proposing the requirements of inband flow learning mechenism that can be used
    to implement inband flow information telemetry for deployability and flexibility.</p>"
