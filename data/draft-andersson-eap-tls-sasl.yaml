abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    mechanism for mutual authentication and session key generation in a roaming environment.
    The server authentication and the negotiation of the session key is done using
    the PPP EAP Transport Layer Security Authentication Protocol. The user authenticates
    using a SASL mechanism, the SASL authentication being protected by TLS. An important
    application discussed in this document is to provide a strong form of authentication
    of access points and stations within an IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network
    (WLAN), but other applications such as LAN access over Bluetooth might also be
    considered in the future.</p>"
