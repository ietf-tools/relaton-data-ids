abstract:
- content: <p>The Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) contains a number of XML
    elements and XML attributes carrying keys and related information. Not all algorithms,
    however, are able to use all elements and for other algorithm certain information
    is mandatory. This lead to the introduction of PSKC algorithm profiles that provide
    further description about the mandatory and optional information elements and
    their semantic, including extensions that may be needed. The main PSKC specification
    defines two PSKC algorithm profiles, namely "HOTP" and "PIN". This document extends
    the initial set and specifies nine further algorithm profiles for PKSC.</p>
