abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism that enhances Proxy Mobile IPv6
    protocol signaling to support the creation of a transient binding cache entry
    that is used to optimize the performance of dual radio handover, as well as single
    radio handover. This mechanism is applicable to the mobile node's inter-MAG (Mobility
    Access Gateway) handover while using a single interface or different interfaces.
    The handover problem space using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol is analyzed
    and the use of transient binding cache entries at the local mobility anchor is
    described. The specified extension to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol ensures optimized
    forwarding of downlink as well as uplink packets between mobile nodes and the
    network infrastructure and avoids superfluous packet forwarding delay or even
    packet loss. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
