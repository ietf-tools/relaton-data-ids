abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to introduce a mobility support framework
    for information centric networking (ICN) that is capable of supporting dynamic
    mobility scenarios associated with both consumer and producer applications, in
    a mobile device connected to a wireless LAN or WAN point of attachment (PoA).
    Due to rapidly evolving user trends that shift towards increased mobility and
    increased access to mobile content delivery (as both content producer and consumer),
    it is essential for an ICN architecture to offer active mobility support to end
    hosts, and present them with varying degrees of quality of experience. We enable
    this through the use of a network-driven mobility support architecture, which
    operates in a distributed and anchorless manner, and relies on late-binding and
    in--band signaling with the use of forwarding labels.</p>"
