abstract:
- content: "<p>IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have been
    proposed to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains. These methods are not
    all mutually exclusive, and we propose that IVI (along with its variants) along
    with SIPNAT may be considered together as a more complete solution for enabling
    access from today's IPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains. This would likely
    have the effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with such access enablements
    there would be much reduced incentive for new deployments to require IPv4 addressability.
    As part of the discussion, we also include a comparison of the various techniques
    so the relative trade-offs may be more easily understood.</p>"
