abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
    to support stateful Path Computation Elements (PCEs) are defined in RFC 8231.
    One of the extensions is the Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP) object. That
    object includes a Flags field that is a set of 32 bit flags, and RFC 8281 defines
    an IANA registry for tracking assigned flags. However, RFC 8231 does not explain
    how an implementation should set unassigned flags in transmitted messages, nor
    how an implementation should process unassigned, unknown, or unsupported flags
    in received messages. This document updates RFC 8231 by defining the correct behaviors.</p>"
