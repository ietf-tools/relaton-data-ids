abstract:
- content: "<p>Networking applications today already have access to a great amount
    of Inter-Provider network topology information. For example, views of the Internet
    routing table are easily available at looking glass servers and entirely practical
    to be downloaded by clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network
    topology from the ISP or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point
    of view. In other words, what an Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization
    -- and a way to distribute it. The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences
    of network resources with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns
    while maintaining or improving application performance. This document describes
    a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. While such service would primarily be
    provided by the network (i.e., the ISP), content providers and third parties could
    also operate this service. Applications that could use this service are those
    that have a choice in connection endpoints. Examples of such applications are
    peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"
