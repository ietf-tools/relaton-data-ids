abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides enhancements of real-time text (as specified
    in RFC 4103) suitable for mixing in a centralized conference model, enabling source
    identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from different sources.
    The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable
    of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multiparty real-time
    text session. The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the Contributing
    Source (CSRC) list in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet for source
    identification. The method makes use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats
    as for two-party sessions. Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP
    session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP-mixer
    model. The RTP-mixer model was selected to be used for the fully specified solution
    in this document because it can be applied to a wide range of existing RTP implementations.
    A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a mixer and
    a participant can handle the multiparty-coded real-time text stream using the
    RTP-mixer method. The capability is indicated by the use of a Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) (RFC 8866) media attribute, "rtt-mixer". This document updates
    RFC 4103 ("RTP Payload for Text Conversation"). A specification for how a mixer
    can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multiparty aware is also
    provided.</p>
