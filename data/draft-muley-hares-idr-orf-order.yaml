abstract:
- content: <p>Currently BGP-4 is capable of carrying multiple (Outbound Route Filters)
    ORFs entries for a given "AFI/SAFI". Each ORF provides a filter that a route whose
    NLRI matches AFI/SAFI, must pass through to be transmitted in the BGP Update message.
    Efficient processing of ORF filters may require ordering of individual ORFs in
    certain sequence and grouping of ORFs that should be applied together. The grouping
    functionality also provides the support for logical OR operation between the grouped
    ORFs. This group ORF provides an ORF type that specifies that ordering and grouping.
    The route set that passes set of ORFs running in a "Group ORF" will pass the same
    ORFs sent in normal ORFs.</p>
