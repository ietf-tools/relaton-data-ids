abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories are being
    used at the backend of many internet and intranet applications. LDAP servers that
    cache entries which are returned as search results (queries) for recently evaluated
    search requests, can use the semantic information associated with these requests,
    to answer subsequent search requests which are contained in them. This document
    describes LDAP schema for representing the semantic information and for supporting
    query containment of LDAP queries.</p>"
