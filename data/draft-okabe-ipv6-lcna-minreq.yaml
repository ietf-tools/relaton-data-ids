abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource limitations and cost constraints associated with small-embedded
    devices make it difficult to implement the entire IPv6 specification. We call
    such non-PC embedded devices (e.g. game-machines, AV devices, sensors, digital
    cameras, LCD projectors, and home appliances) 'Low Cost Network Appliances', and
    define the IPv6 host requirements for them. In this document, we will also point
    out several items to be discussed for the deployment of IPv6 on LCNAs.</p>"
