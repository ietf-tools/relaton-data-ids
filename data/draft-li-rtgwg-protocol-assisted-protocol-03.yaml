abstract:
- content: "<p>For routing protocol troubleshooting, different approaches exibit merits
    w.r.t. different situations. They can be generally divided into two categories,
    the distributive way and the centralized way. A very commonly used distributive
    approach is to log in possiblly all related devices one by one to check massive
    data via CLI. Such approach provides very detailed device information, however
    it requires operators with high NOC (Network Operation Center) experience and
    suffers from low troubleshooting efficiency and high cost. The centralized approach
    is realized by collecting data from devices via approaches, like the streaming
    Telemetry or BMP(BGP Monitoring Protocol) RFC7854 [RFC7854], for the centralized
    server to analyze all gathered data. Such approach allows a comprehensive view
    fo the whole network and facilitates automated troubleshooting, but is limited
    by the data collection boundary set by different management domains, as well as
    high network bandwidth and CPU computation costs. This document proposes a semi-distributive
    and semi-centralized approach for fast routing protocol troubleshooting, localizing
    the target device and possibly the root cause, more precisely. It defines a new
    protocol, called the PAP (Protocol assisted Protocol), for devices to exchange
    protocol related information between each other in both active and on-demand manners.
    It allow devices to request specific information from other devices and receive
    replies to the requested data. It also allows actively transmission of information
    without request to inform other devices to better react w.r.t. network issues.</p>"
