abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two application scenarios where Network Service
    Header (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR) techniques can be deployed together to support
    Service Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while maintaining separation
    of the service and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.
    In the first scenario, an NSH-based SFC is created using SR as the transport between
    Service Function Forwarders (SFFs). SR in this case is just one of many encapsulations
    that could be used to maintain the transport-independent nature of NSH-based service
    chains. In the second scenario, SR is used to represent each service hop of the
    NSH-based SFC as a segment within the segment-list. SR and NSH in this case are
    integrated. In both scenarios SR is responsible for steering packets between SFFs
    along a given Service Function Path (SFP) while NSH is responsible for maintaining
    the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance context, and any associated
    metadata. These application scenarios demonstrate that NSH and SR can work jointly
    and complement each other leaving the network operator with the flexibility to
    use whichever transport technology makes sense in specific areas of their network
    infrastructure, and still maintain an end-to-end service plane using NSH.</p>"
