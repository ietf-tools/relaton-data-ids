abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the TLS protocol to allow TLS
    clients to authenticate with legacy credentials using the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP). This work follows the example of IKEv2, where EAP has been added
    to the IKEv2 protocol to allow clients to use different credentials such as passwords,
    token cards, and shared secrets. When TLS is used with EAP, additional records
    are sent after the ChangeCipherSpec protocol message, effectively creating an
    extended handshake before the application layer data can be sent. Each EapMsg
    handshake record contains exactly one EAP message. Using EAP for client authentication
    allows TLS to be used with various AAA back-end servers such as RADIUS or Diameter.
    TLS with EAP may be used for securing a data connection such as HTTP or POP3,
    where the ability of EAP to work with backend servers can remove that burden from
    the application layer. This document is a protocol model, rather than a full protocol
    specification.</p>"
