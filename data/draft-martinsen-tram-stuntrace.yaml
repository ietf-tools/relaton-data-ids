abstract:
- content: "<p>After a UDP protocol such as RTP determines a network path is experiencing
    problems, a traceroute is often useful to determine which router or which link
    is contributing to the problem. However, operating system traceroute commands
    follow a different path than the actual UDP flow which complicates troubleshooting.
    A superior method is shown which is absolutely path-congruent with the UDP protocol
    itself, works on IPv4 and IPv6, and does not require administrative privileges
    on most operating systems.</p>"
