abstract:
- content: <p>The early Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) documents defined the
    form of the MPLS label stack entry. This includes a three-bit field called the
    "EXP field". The exact use of this field was not defined by these documents, except
    to state that it was to be "reserved for experimental use". Although the intended
    use of the EXP field was as a "Class of Service" (CoS) field, it was not named
    a CoS field by these early documents because the use of such a CoS field was not
    considered to be sufficiently defined. Today a number of standards documents define
    its usage as a CoS field. To avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be
    used, it has become increasingly necessary to rename this field. This document
    changes the name of the field to the "Traffic Class field" ("TC field"). In doing
    so, it also updates documents that define the current use of the EXP field. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
