abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives a brief comparison of DECADE and CDNi, two working
    groups on content delivery. CDNi aims at overcoming the limited resource and footprints
    of a single CDN by interconnecting multiple CDNs. While DECADE is mainly concerned
    with reducing the last-mile bandwidth bottleneck and inter-domain traffics with
    in- network storage. This in-network storage can also be utilized by Content Service
    Providers (CSPs) as a CDN, whose footprints be across multiple Internet Service
    Providers (CSPs). In this sense, DECADE can also be a possible approach to overcome
    the limited footprints of a single CDN. This document attempts to gain some understanding
    on the relationship of these two solutions.</p>"
