abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet
    today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks. One technique
    to improve the network efficiency of P2P applications is to introduce storage
    capabilities within the network. The DECADE Working Group has been formed with
    the goal of developing an architecture to provide this capability. This document
    presents an architecture, discusses the underlying principles and identifies core
    components and protocols supporting the architecture.</p>"
