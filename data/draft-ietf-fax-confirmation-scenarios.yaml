abstract:
- content: "<p>The simple mode for Internet fax described in [1] does not provide
    positive confirmation of message delivery or disposition. There is a widespread
    view that an important benefit of traditional fax [2] is the fact that it provides
    a delivery confirmation which is trusted by fax system users. This memo describes
    some of the options for message confirmation in Internet fax, taking account of
    the particular nature and goals of the application [3], with a view to informing
    the debate over what mechanisms should be used for this purpose.</p>"
