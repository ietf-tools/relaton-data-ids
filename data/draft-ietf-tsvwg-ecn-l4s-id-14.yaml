abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the protocol to be used for a new network
    service called low latency, low loss and scalable throughput (L4S). L4S uses an
    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) scheme at the IP layer that is similar
    to the original (or 'Classic') ECN approach, except as specified within. 'Classic'
    ECN marking is required to be equivalent to a drop, both when applied in the network
    and when responded to by a transport. Unlike 'Classic' ECN marking, for packets
    carrying the L4S identifier, the network applies marking more immediately and
    more aggressively than drop, and the transport response to each mark is reduced
    and smoothed relative to that for drop. The two changes counterbalance each other
    so that the throughput of an L4S flow will be roughly the same as a non-L4S flow
    under the same conditions. Nonetheless, the much more frequent control signals
    and the finer responses to them result in much more fine-grained adjustments,
    so that ultra-low and consistently low queuing delay (typically sub-millisecond
    on average) becomes possible for L4S traffic without compromising link utilization.
    Thus even capacity-seeking (TCP-like) traffic can have high bandwidth and very
    low delay at the same time, even during periods of high traffic load. The L4S
    identifier defined in this document distinguishes L4S from 'Classic' (e.g. TCP-Reno-friendly)
    traffic. It gives an incremental migration path so that suitably modified network
    bottlenecks can distinguish and isolate existing traffic that still follows the
    Classic behaviour, to prevent it degrading the low queuing delay and low loss
    of L4S traffic. This specification defines the rules that L4S transports and network
    elements need to follow to ensure they neither harm each other's performance nor
    that of Classic traffic. Examples of new active queue management (AQM) marking
    algorithms and examples of new transports (whether TCP-like or real-time) are
    specified separately.</p>"
