abstract:
- content: "<p>As operators struggle to optimize their network for different applications
    while maximizing network resources usage, there's growing business pressure to
    minimize operational tasks and the deployment time of new services. New automation
    paradigms are meant to help reach these goals, including the optimization of network
    functions through application control. This control could be signaled directly
    by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a centralized manner. The
    current version of the Shared Unified Policy Automation (SUPA) group charter identifies
    two fields where standardization would be desirable for operators: the definition
    of a generic model for the description of network topologies at any layer and
    with any degree of granularity, and the definition of a standardized model for
    applications to push policies toward a central network controller. The first of
    these topics, the topology modeling, is meant to support the definition and application
    of the second. The present memo analyses the current state of the art of the industries
    regarding these two topics and discusses whether an IETF standardization is desirable
    and for which reasons.</p>"
