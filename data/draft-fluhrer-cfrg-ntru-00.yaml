abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents NTRU as a post-quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanism
    (KEM) scheme. The NTRU method from KEM is believed to be IPR free and cryptographically
    sound for both classical and post- quantum threat environments. NIST has run a
    competition to select post-quantum primitives and preliminary selected Kyber for
    standarization as a KEM. Kyber unfortunately has plausible patent claims against
    it and there are currently undisclosed agreements with the patent holders and
    NIST. It is unknown whether those agreements would be universally acceptable;
    if not, there will be organizations for which Kyber is unusable until the patents
    expire. This lack of clarity around licensing or other restrictions on Kyber has
    provided the motivation to author this draft. This document does not define any
    new cryptography, only describes an existing cryptographic system.</p>"
