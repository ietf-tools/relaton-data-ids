abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC 8806 (often called "LocalRoot") defines a mechanism whereby a recursive
    resolver can fetch the contents of an entire zone and place this information into
    the resolver''s cache. This has several benefits, including increased reliability,
    increased performance, improved privacy, and decreased or mitigating the effect
    of some types of DoS attacks. While the majority of DNS resolver implementations
    natively support RFC 8806, it remains tricky to configure and maintain. This document
    recommends that DNS resolver software simplify this configuration, and further
    suggests that configuration becomes the default. This document updates Section
    2 of RFC8806 by relaxing the requirement that implementations MUST run an authoritative
    service. /* Ed (WK): Open questions / ToDo / Notes (to be removed before publication):</p>'
