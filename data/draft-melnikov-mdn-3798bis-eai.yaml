abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user
    agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message
    after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient. This content-type is
    intended to be machine-processable. Additional message header fields are also
    defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by
    the sender of a message. The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality
    often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary "LAN-based"
    systems, and often referred to as "read receipts," "acknowledgements", or "receipt
    notifications." The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns,
    which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the
    past. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging
    systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary "LAN-based" systems), the MDN protocol
    is designed to be useful in a multi- protocol messaging environment. To this end,
    the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of "foreign" addresses,
    in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may
    also be defined to support "tunneling" of foreign notifications through Internet
    Mail. This document obsoletes RFC 3798 and updates RFC 2046, RFC 3461 and replaces
    MDN definition in RFC 6533. Note: This draft shows how a combined MDN and EAI
    MDN document might look like. This work represents opinion of editors about possible
    future direction for a combined specification and is not the result of consensus
    of any IETF WG. This draft can be used as a replacement or update to draft-melnikov-mdn-3798bis-eai.</p>'
