abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests the GR enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and PIM-SM.
    -This draft suggests a mechanism to refresh E-BSR state and to learn RP-Set on
    Rebooted E-BSR Router quickly. -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-BIDIR
    Downstream Routers to refresh the (*, G) state only after 'Rebooted Upstream Router
    has learnt the RP Information and DF election is complete'. -This draft suggests
    a mechanism for PIM-SM Downstream Router to delay the (*, G) joins to allow RP
    Information to be learnt on Rebooted Upstream Router. It also suggests the mechanism
    to refresh the Assert-Winner or Assert-Loser state on Rebooting Router.</p>"
