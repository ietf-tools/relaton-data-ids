abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol, CoAP, and related extensions
    are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems where one
    or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for low power wireless sensor
    networks. This document defines publish- subscribe message queuing functionality
    for CoAP that extends the capabilities for supporting nodes with long breaks in
    connectivity and/or up-time.</p>"
