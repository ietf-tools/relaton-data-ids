abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPAKE2 which is a protocol for two parties
    that share a password to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the password.
    This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient, and SPAKE2
    has a security proof. This document predated the CFRG PAKE competition and it
    was not selected, however, given existing use of variants in Kerberos and other
    applications it was felt publication was beneficial. Applications that need a
    symmetric PAKE and where hashing onto an elliptic curve at execution time is not
    possible can use SPAKE2. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research
    Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>"
