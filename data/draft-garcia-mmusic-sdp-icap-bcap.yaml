    that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes. This

    allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities. This negotiation
    is embedded into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures. This memo extends
    the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow endpoints to negotiate two additional
    SDP capabilities. In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media
    titles ("i=" line for each media) and media bandwidth ("b=" line).</p>
