abstract:
- content: "<p>Attacks on public servers by deliberate overloading with TCP sessions
    is emerging as a significant problem on the Internet. This form of attack is similar
    to that used against 800 numbers of some organizations by those opposed to their
    views. Proposed here is a technique that can be implemented in most routers at
    or near the periphery of the network, which would reduce the efficacy of such
    attacks and provide network administrators with indication when users of their
    networks attempt such an attack. The purpose of this memo is to propose a solution
    to this problem, and hopefully result in a discussion of the issue.</p>"
