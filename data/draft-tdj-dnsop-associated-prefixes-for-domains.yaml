- content: "<p>RFC9000 defines a mechanism that allows servers to migrate clients
    to another IP address without name resolution. The new address may not be discoverable
    as A/AAAA records for that domain name. This draft defines a mechanism that allows
    a client to get advance notice of associated IP addresses for a domain name as
    part of the DNS query.</p>"
