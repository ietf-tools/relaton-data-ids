- content: "<p>This document defines an LDAP extension to efficiently import LDIF
    into an LDAP server. The extension utilizes a protocol that maximizes the speed
    with which LDIF data can be presented to the LDAP server and yet allows the LDAP
    client to be kept apprised of errors and the progress of its request.</p>"
