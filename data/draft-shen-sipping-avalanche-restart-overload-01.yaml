abstract:
- content: "<p>When a large number of clients register with a SIP registrar server
    at approximately the same time, the server may become overloaded. Near-simultaneous
    floods of SIP SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH requests may have similar effects. Such request
    avalanches can occur, for example, after a power failure and recovery in a metropolitan
    area. This document describes how to avoid such overload situations. Under this
    mechanism, a server estimates an avalanche restart backoff interval during its
    normal operation and conveys this interval to its clients through a new Restart-Timer
    header in normal response messages. Once an avalanche restart actually occurs,
    the clients perform backoff based on the previously received Restart-Timer header
    value before sending out the first request attempt. Thus, the mechanism spreads
    all the initial client requests and prevents them from overloading the server.</p>"
