abstract:
- content: "<p>Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning
    program information including addresses of the multicast groups corresponding
    to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver. During the transition from IPv4
    to IPv6, scenarios can occur where the IP version supported by the receiver differs
    from that supported by the source. This memo examines and evaluates alternative
    strategies for allowing the receiver to acquire multicast address information
    in the version it supports in such scenarios. Operators may find this review useful
    when planning their own transition strategy.</p>"
