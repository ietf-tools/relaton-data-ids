abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic
    hash functions, following the seminal work in this area. It specifies a one-time
    signature scheme based on the work of Lamport, Diffie, Winternitz, and Merkle
    (LDWM), and specifies a general signature system using a Merkle tree. These systems
    provide asymmetric authentication without using large integer mathematics, and
    achieve a high security level. They are suitable for compact implementations,
    are relatively simple to implement, and naturally resist side-channel attacks.
    Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures would still be secure
    even if it proves feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer.</p>"
