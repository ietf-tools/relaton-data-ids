abstract:
- content: "<p>A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g.,
    Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly combine the connectivity
    over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to improve quality of experience
    for applications that do not have built in multi-path capabilities. This document
    presents a new control protocol to manage traffic steering, splitting, and duplicating
    across multiple connections. The solution has been developed by the authors based
    on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including the IETF and 3GPP,
    is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the
    IETF. This document will enable other developers to build interoperable implementations
    in order to experiment with the protocol.</p>"
