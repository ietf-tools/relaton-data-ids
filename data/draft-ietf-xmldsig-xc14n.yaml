abstract:
- content: <p>Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied
    to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of
    the namespace declarations and attributes in the "xml:" namespace. However, some
    applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor
    context from a canonicalized subdocument. For example, one might require a digital
    signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break
    when that subdocument is removed from its original message and/or inserted into
    a different context. This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.
