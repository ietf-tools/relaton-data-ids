abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) push and pull
    directories (RFC 7067) specified in draft-ietf-trill-directory- assist-mechanisms
    provide directory services to TRILL switches but not to end stations. This document
    extends those services so that end stations can pull directory information from
    Pull Directory severs and can have directory information pushed to them from Push
    Directory servers. In each case, at least one co-operating edge TRILL switch is
    required.</p>"
