abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol has been
    standardized in RFC7285 to ease better-than-random overlay connection management.
    Due to various reasons, optimization capabilities of ALTO servers are limited
    by the fact that it may not be possible for an ALTO server to compute costs for
    source/destination pairs correctly if a source and/or a destination is outside
    the administrative domain it belongs to. In other words, an ALTO server may be
    generally unable to optimize the traffic with only locally available topology
    information. Therefore, it is proposed that operators of distinct administrative
    domains may agree on topology- and policy-related information exchange through
    a standardized inter-ALTO communication framework. This document provides a rationale
    for design, standardization, and implementation of the inter-ALTO communication
    framework.</p>"
