abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocols frequently have fields where the contents are a series of
    bits that have specific meaning. When modeling operational state for such protocols
    in YANG, the 'bits' YANG built-in type is a natural method for modeling such fields.
    The YANG 'bits' built-in type is best suited when the meaning of a bit assignment
    is clear. When bits that are currently RESERVED or otherwise unassigned by the
    protocol are received, being able to model them is necessary in YANG operational
    models. This cannot be done using the YANG 'bits' built- in type without assigning
    them a name. However, YANG versioning rules do not permit renaming of named bits.
    This draft proposes a methodology to represent unknown bits in YANG operational
    models and creates a YANG typedef to assist in uniformly naming such unknown bits.</p>"
