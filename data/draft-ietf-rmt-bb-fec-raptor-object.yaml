abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) scheme, corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 1, for the Raptor forward error
    correction code and its application to reliable delivery of data objects. Raptor
    is a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated
    by the encoder on-the-fly from the source symbols of a source block of data. The
    decoder is able to recover the source block from any set of encoding symbols only
    slightly more in number than the number of source symbols. The Raptor code described
    here is a systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding
    symbols that can be generated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
