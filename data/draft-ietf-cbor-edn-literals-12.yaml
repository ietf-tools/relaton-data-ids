abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949) is
    a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code
    size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version
    negotiation. In addition to the binary interchange format, CBOR from the outset
    (RFC 7049) defined a text-based "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to converse
    about CBOR data items without having to resort to binary data. RFC 8610 extended
    this into what is known as Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN). This document consolidates
    the definition of EDN, sets forth a further step of its evolution, and is intended
    to serve as a single reference target in specifications that use EDN. It specifies
    an extension point for adding application-oriented extensions to the diagnostic
    notation. It then defines two such extensions that enhance EDN with text representations
    of epoch-based date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes (RFC 9164). A few further
    additions close some gaps in usability. The document modifies one extension originally
    specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC 8610 to enable further increasing usability.
    To facilitate tool interoperation, this document specifies a formal ABNF grammar,
    and it adds media types. // The present revision -12 reflects the branch "roll-up"
    in the // repository, an attempt to contain the entire specification of EDN //
    in this document, instead of describing updates to the existing // documents RFC
    8949 and RFC 8610. While the WG hasn't taken a // decision to follow this updated
    editorial approach, the feedback // has been sufficiently positive that the author
    believes it is not // misleading to make this revision available as the current
    WG // Internet-Draft as well. That said, this is still a snapshot. The // editorial
    work on the branch "roll-up" is not complete. Content // will continue to move
    between sections. The exact reflection of // this document being a replacement
    for both Section 8 of RFC 8949 // and Appendix G of RFC 8610 needs to be recorded
    in the metadata // and in abstract and introduction.</p>
