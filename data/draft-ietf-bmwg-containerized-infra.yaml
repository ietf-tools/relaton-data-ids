abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has extended the
    laboratory characterization from physical network functions (PNFs) to virtual
    network functions (VNFs). Considering the network function implementation trend
    moving from virtual machine-based to container- based, system configurations and
    deployment scenarios for benchmarking will be partially changed by how the resources
    allocation and network technologies are specified for containerized network functions.
    This draft describes additional considerations for benchmarking network performance
    when network functions are containerized and performed in general-purpose hardware.</p>"
