abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a technique to generate valid DNSSEC answers
    on demand for non-existing names by claiming the name exists and returning a NSEC
    record for it. These answers require only one NSEC record and allow live-signing
    servers to minimize signing operations, packet size, disclosure of zone contents
    and required knowledge of the zone layout.</p>"
