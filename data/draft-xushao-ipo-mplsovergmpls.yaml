abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS over GMPLS-based optical networks (MPLS over GMPLS) is a subset
    of IP over optical networks. To be more specific, in this draft it refers to the
    technology of interconnection between MPLS networks and GMPLS-based optical networks
    with an overlay model or an interdomain model. It is an important milestone in
    the evolutionary roadmap from IP over static WDM to a peer model of network interconnections.
    The most significant feature of the requirements for MPLS over GMPLS is a much
    more dynamic interface between the two layers. The draft discusses the evolutionary
    roadmap of IP over optical networks and then highlights the significance of the
    concept of MPLS over GMPLS. Some new requirements will be identified, including
    multi-lightpath connections, MPLS network topology dynamic changes and dynamic
    traffic grooming and so on. It is these requirements that bring some challenges
    to the present routing, signaling and UNI protocols.</p>"
