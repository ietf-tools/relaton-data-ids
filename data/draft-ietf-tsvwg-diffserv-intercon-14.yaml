abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a limited common set of Diffserv Per-Hop Behaviors
    (PHBs) and Diffserv Codepoints (DSCPs) to be applied at (inter)connections of
    two separately administered and operated networks, and it explains how this approach
    can simplify network configuration and operation. Many network providers operate
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) using Treatment Aggregates for traffic marked
    with different Diffserv Per-Hop Behaviors and use MPLS for interconnection with
    other networks. This document offers a simple interconnection approach that may
    simplify operation of Diffserv for network interconnection among providers that
    use MPLS and apply the Short Pipe Model. While motivated by the requirements of
    MPLS network operators that use Short Pipe Model tunnels, this document is applicable
    to other networks, both MPLS and non-MPLS.</p>"
