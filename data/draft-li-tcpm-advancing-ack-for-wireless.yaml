abstract:
- content: "<p>Acknowledgement (ACK) is a basic function and implemented in most of
    the ordered and reliable transport protocols [RFC0793]. Legacy TCP ACK is designed
    with high frequency to guarantee correct interaction between sender and receiver.
    However, the shared nature of the wireless medium over wireless local area network
    (WLAN) induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such
    as acknowledgement. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead
    which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially for WLAN scenarios.
    This document conducts the ACK frequency breakdown, analyzes several ways of reducing
    ACK frequency, and discusses the compatibility issues with existing systems in
    detail.</p>"
