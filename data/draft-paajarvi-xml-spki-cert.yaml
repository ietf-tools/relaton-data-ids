abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft suggests a standard form for encoding SPKI certificates
    in XML as opposed to the original s-expression encoding defined in [SPKI]. The
    standard form is defined as an XML document type definition (DTD). The main emphasis
    is on the XML-encoding of an authorization certificate that is the basic SPKI
    certificate form. This draft provides also a brief introduction to XML and a short
    discussion about the benefits of choosing XML as the certificate encoding format.
    In addition, this draft discusses the problems of automatic processing of tags
    (attributes and authorizations transferred by a certificate are called tags in
    SPKI) when reducing certificates. An example of encoding Java permissions in an
    SPKI certificate is given to demonstrate the problem and, finally, a solution
    to this problem is suggested.</p>"
