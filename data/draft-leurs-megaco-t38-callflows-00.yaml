abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the handling of realtime fax calls in Megaco/H.248
    controlled MGs. The call setup and capability negotiation is done with support
    of the control domain with Megaco commands. The switch over to fax or modem, upon
    detection of the relevant tones, is done in an autonomous way, without intervention
    of the control domain. In the Appendix, the Megaco messages for a call setup scenario
    with capability negotiation are shown, to point out the structure of the to the
    transmitting MG. Switching to T.38 is done after reception of V.21 flags. In the
    other flows, T.38 is not enabled, both MGs switch to the fallback case, fax pass-through
    mode. This document is based on the superior framework (reference [2]). The reader
    should be familiar with [2]. SDP sessions in the local and remote descriptors.
    Call flow diagrams are given as example: In the first flow, a T.30 CNG tone is
    generated by the transmitting terminal, the transmitting MG signals the detection
    towards the receiving MG. Switching to T.38 is done by both MGs as soon as possible.
    In the second example, a T.30 CED tone is sent by the receiving terminal. As this
    tone is no clear indication that a FAX will be sent, the receiving MG will switch
    to VBD after signaling this event</p>"
