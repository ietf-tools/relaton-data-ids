abstract:
- content: <p>The inspiration for this document came from RFC 1855 ("Netiquette"),
    which is now partially obsolete and no longer maintained. A lot has happened on
    the Internet since then (social media, video conferencing, deepfakes, ad networks),
    which should be applied in a netiquette. Like in RFC 1855 this is only a minimal
    standard.</p>
