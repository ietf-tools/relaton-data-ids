abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives
    an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to reset the session
    over which the offending attribute was received. This behavior is undesirable
    as a session reset would impact not only routes with the offending attribute,
    but also other valid routes exchanged over the session. This document partially
    revises the error handling for UPDATE messages, and provides guidelines for the
    authors of documents defining new optional attributes. Finally, it revises the
    error handling procedures for several existing attributes.</p>"
