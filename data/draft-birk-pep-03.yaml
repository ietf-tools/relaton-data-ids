abstract:
- content: "<p>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols describe a set of conventions
    for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to the use and
    deployment of secure end-to-end interpersonal messaging. These include, but are
    not limited to, key management, key discovery, and private key handling (including
    peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices).
    pEp also introduces means to verify communication peers and proposes a trust-rating
    system to denote secure types of communications and signal the privacy level available
    on a per-user and per-message level. Significantly, the pEp protocols build on
    already available security formats and message transports (e.g., PGP/MIME), and
    are written with the intent to be interoperable with already widely-deployed systems
    in order to facilitate and ease adoption and implementation. This document outlines
    the general design choices and principles of pEp.</p>"
