abstract:
- content: <p>This memo focuses on the evolving networking technology within and among
    relatively small "residential home" networks. The goal of this memo is to define
    the architecture for IPv6-based home networking that supports the demands placed
    on it. This architecture shows how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can
    be employed in home networking, and outlines the need for specific protocol extensions
    for certain additional functionality.</p>
