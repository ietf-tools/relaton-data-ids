abstract:
- content: "<p>The quality of a codec has to be measured by multiple parameters such
    as audio quality, speech quality, algorithmic efficiency, latency, coding rates
    and their respective tradeoffs. During standardization, codecs are tested and
    evaluated multiple times to ensure a high quality outcome. As the upcoming Internet
    codec is likely to have unique features, there is a need to develop new quality
    testing procedures to measure these features. Thus, this draft reviews existing
    methods on how to measure a codec's qualities, proposes a couple of new methods,
    and gives suggestions which may be used for testing the Internet Interactive Audio
    Codec (IIAC). This document is work in progress.</p>"
