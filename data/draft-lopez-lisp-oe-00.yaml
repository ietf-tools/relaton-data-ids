abstract:
- content: "<p>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), allows the creation of VPNs
    between routing locators (RLOCs). As LISP encapsulated packets are generally expected
    to traverse publically routed spaces, it is desirable to encrypt the payloads
    of these packets, to protect them from pervasive surveillance attacks. This document
    describes a methodology to encrypt LISP encapsulated packets, as they traverse
    between RLOCs. For a full description of LISP, please consult [RFC6830].</p>"
