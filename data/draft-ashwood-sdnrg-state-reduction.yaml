abstract:
- content: "<p>This document makes the argument that to support the centralized control
    of a substantial number of forwarding devices (as Software Defined Networking
    (SDN) proposes) that the scale, speed, cost and general quality of such a solution
    will be improved by reducing the state needed to be distributed into the network
    of devices by the controller(s). To this end we re-visit forms of Source Routing
    (SR), in particular Strict Link Source Routing (SLSR) and suggest that light weight
    SLSR could allow substantial reduction in controller burden while potentially
    reducing the costs/complexity on forwarding devices. We discuss some simulation
    results that demonstrate these advantages and how the advantages grow substantially
    as the network diameter grows. We also look at various implementation possibilities
    including existing IPV4, V6, MPLS, new/modified MPLS vs. something brand new that
    could possibly be implemented with new SDN technology like Protocol Oblivious
    Forwarding-POF.</p>"
