abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the network management framework for the Transport
    Profile for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP). This framework relies on
    the management terminology from the ITU-T to describe the management architecture
    that could be used for an MPLS-TP management network. The management of the MPLS-TP
    network could be based on multi-tiered distributed management systems. This document
    provides a description of the network and element management architectures that
    could be applied and also describes heuristics associated with fault, configuration,
    and performance aspects of the management system. This document is a product of
    a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
