abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing
    multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation,
    and other forms of multimedia session initiation. SDP was not intended to provide
    capability indication or capability negotiation, however over the years, SDP has
    seen widespread adoption and as a result it has been gradually extended to provide
    limited support for these. SDP and its current extensions however do not have
    the ability to negotiate one or more alternative transport protocols (e.g. RTP
    profiles) which makes it particularly difficult to deploy new RTP profiles such
    as secure RTP and RTP with RTCP-based feedback. The purpose of this document is
    to identify a set of requirements for SDP Capability Negotiation and evaluate
    existing work in this area. The document does not provide any solutions to SDP
    Capability Negotiation</p>"
