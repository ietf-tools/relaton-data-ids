abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the history of IPv6 address delegation and examines
    some of the technical implications of various allocation policies in terms of
    their impact on long-term address space utilization and aggregation. The purpose
    of this document is to stimulate discussion and foster improved understanding
    of the implications of various policies, so that appropriate policies are adopted
    that preserve the long-term scalability of IPv6.</p>"
