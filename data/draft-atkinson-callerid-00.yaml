abstract:
- content: "<p>When e-mail is handed off today from one organization to another, as
    a rule no authentication of the sender of the e-mail or the computers delivering
    it on the sender’s behalf takes place. There are some simple steps which can be
    taken to significantly alleviate this problem, steps which mimic within the e-mail
    infrastructure the caller ID mechanism found in today’s telephone system. This
    proposal specifies that in addition to today’s practice of publishing in DNS the
    addresses of their incoming mail servers, administrators of domains also publish
    the addresses of their outgoing mail servers, the addresses of the computers from
    which mail legitimately originating from that domain will be sent. This information
    will then be used in enhancements to software that receives incoming mail to verify
    that computers handing off a message to them in fact are authorized to do so by
    the legitimate administrator of the domain from which the message is purported
    to have been sent.</p>"
