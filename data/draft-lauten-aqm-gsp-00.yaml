abstract:
- content: "<p>Transmission capacity sharing TCP flows tend to synchronize among each
    other. This way rate variations of the individual flows, which are caused by the
    congestion control algorithms, do not even out. The effect is known as global
    synchronization. Large queuing buffer demand and large latency and jitter are
    the consequences. Global Synchronization Protection (GSP) is an extension of regular
    tail drop packet queuing schemes that prevents global synchronization. For large
    traffic aggregates the de-correlation between the individual flow variations reduces
    buffer demand and packet sojourn time by an order of magnitude and more. Even
    though quite simple, the solution has a theoretical rationale and is not heuristic,
    and it has been tested with a Linux implementation.</p>"
