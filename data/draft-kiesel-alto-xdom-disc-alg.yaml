abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of
    candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server
    protocol. Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one
    or more ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance. This document contains
    a strawman proposal for an ALTO Cross-Domain Server Discovery procedure (also
    known as Third-Party Discovery). Technically, the algorithm specified in this
    document takes one IP address and a U-NAPTR Service Parameter (i.e., "ALTO:http"
    or "ALTO:https") as parameters. It performs several DNS lookups (for U-NAPTR and
    SOA resource records) and returns one or more URI(s) of information resources
    related to that IP address. The functionality has been validated in a lab environment.
    However, the feasibility and possible side-effects of Internet-wide "production
    use" are not yet understood. The purpose of this document is to foster further
    discussion within the ALTO working group. Readers of this document should exercise
    caution in evaluating its value for implementation and deployment.</p>
