abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a generalized architecture for implementing
    mobility in the transport layer rather than the network layer. In addition, the
    document discusses the advantages of this approach, the basic mechanisms and interactions
    required to support transport layer mobility, and examples of how to enable mobility
    in various transport protocols, using this architecture.</p>"
