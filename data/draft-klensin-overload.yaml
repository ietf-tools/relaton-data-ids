abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the key proposals in the PACT [PACT] draft is a limit on the
    duration of Working Groups. The authors believe that limitations of that type
    are too constraining on IESG ability to manage working groups and areas and that
    they will not be effective in practice. We propose an alternate restriction --
    on the total number of working groups in an Area -- that we believe will have
    a number of desirable effects (a superset of those suggested with the PACT model)
    and that it is more likely to operate as intended.</p>"
