abstract:
- content: "<p>Geopriv defines the concept of a 'using protocol', a protocol that
    carries geopriv location objects. Geopriv also defines various scenarios for the
    distribution of location objects that require the concept of subscriptions and
    asynchronous notifications. This document examines some existing IETF work on
    the concept of presence, shows how presence architectures map onto geopriv architectures,
    and presents one pre-existing using presence protocol that might carry location
    objects.</p>"
