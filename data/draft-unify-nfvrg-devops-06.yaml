abstract:
- content: "<p>Carrier-grade network management was optimized for environments built
    with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment, integration
    and maintenance efforts from network service providers. The introduction of virtualization
    technologies, from the physical layer all the way up to the application layer,
    however, invalidates several well-established assumptions in this domain. This
    draft opens the discussion in NFVRG about challenges related to transforming the
    telecom network infrastructure into an agile, model-driven environment for communication
    services. We take inspiration from data center DevOps on the simplification and
    automation of management processes for a telecom service provider software-defined
    infrastructure (SDI). A number of challenges associated with operationalizing
    DevOps principles at scale in software-defined telecom networks are identified
    in relation to three areas related to key programmable management processes.</p>"
