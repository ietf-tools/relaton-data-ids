abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to the Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols over a horizontal
    unified, defragmented IoT architecture. Such an architecture will make objects
    accessible to applications across organizations and domains. Towards this goal,
    quite a few proposals have been made to build an application-layer based unified
    IoT platform on top of today's host-centric Internet. However, there is a fundamental
    mismatch between the host-centric nature of todays Internet and mostly information-centric
    nature of the IoT system. To address this mismatch, an information-centric network
    (ICN) architecture can provide a common set of protocols and services, called
    'ICN-IoT', which can be used to build IoT platforms. ICN-IoT leverages the salient
    features of ICN, and thus provides naming, security, mobility support,scalability,
    and efficient content and service delivery. This draft summarizes general IoT
    demands, and covers the challenges and design considerations ICN faces to realize
    a ICN-IoT framework based on ICN architecture.</p>
