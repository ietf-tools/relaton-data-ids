abstract:
- content: '<p>When we use DHCPv6 to bootstrap Mobile IPv6 service, stateful DHCP
    should be used to assign the home address. In [RFC3315], two types of IA are specified:
    IA_NA and IA_TA. When stateful DHCPv6 is used in a local network, the "care-of
    address" is carried as one of the IA_NA options. On the other hand, when autoconfiguration
    [FRC2462] is used, care-of address is generated on mobile node and there is no
    way to assign home address stateful. Thus, we introduce a new IA type to assign
    the home address.</p>'
