abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes these new SDP "proto" attribute values: "QUIC",
    "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", and "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF", and describes how SDP
    Offer/Answer can be used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC as a transport
    protocol. These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an underlying
    transport protocol for applications such as SIP and WebRTC that commonly use SDP
    as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections.</p>'
