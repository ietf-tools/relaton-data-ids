abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPV6-only
    hosts at the same time. This makes prioritizing the DNS servers for hosts tricky
    due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol stacks causing optimal behavior to occur
    only when the host stack re- initializes. The networks infrastructure is usually
    well equipped to be aware of single/dual-stack nature of hosts. This specification
    extends DHCPv6 so that the DHCPv6 Relay Agent can dynamically influence the priority
    of DNS servers provided to the host, so that the host can use the optimal DNS
    server for resolution.</p>"
