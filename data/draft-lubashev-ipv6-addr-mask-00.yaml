abstract:
- content: '<p>With significantly longer IPv6 address prefixes assigned to ISPs, operators
    sometimes find opportunities to assign special meaning to lower-order bit patterns.
    Often, these bit patterns cannot be expressed as an address prefix. This RFC introduces
    IPv6 Address/Mask notation that allows one to express address groupings beyond
    "all addresses that share a single prefix". The notation is similar to the IPv4
    Address/Mask notation in its expressiveness, but its syntax is derived from the
    traditional Address/Prefix-length notation. The traditional Address/Prefix- length
    notation is a special case of the Address/Mask notation. For example, using this
    notation, both 2001:db8::/32 and 2001:db8::/ ffff:ffff:: have the same meaning.
    However, the following requires the new notation: 2001:db8::1234/ffff:ffff::ffff
    or, equivalently, 2001:db8::1234/32+::ffff.</p>'
