abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the test specifications for M2UA (MTP2 User
    Adaptation) protocol (RFC 3331), which can be used to test M2UA implementations
    for conformance to the protocol definition. The list of test is exhaustive and
    covers almost all the categories of test. This draft can also be used in conjunction
    with M2UA specification by implementers of protocol as implementers guide, as
    the pictorial representation of various scenarios help easy understanding of the
    protocol. Next revision of the draft will cover the additions done to the protocol
    revision and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.</p>"
