abstract:
- content: "<p>Protecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices against attacks is not
    enough. IoT deployments need to make sure that they are not used for Distributed
    Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks are typically done with compromised
    devices or with amplification attacks using a spoofed source address. This document
    gives examples of different theoretical amplification attacks using the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP). The goal with this document is to raise awareness
    and to motivate generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage of
    CoAP. Some of the discussed attacks can be mitigated by not using NoSec or by
    using the Echo option.</p>"
