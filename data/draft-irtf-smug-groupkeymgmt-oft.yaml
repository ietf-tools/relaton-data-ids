abstract:
- content: "<p>We present and implement a scalable method for establishing group session
    keys for secure large, dynamic groups such as multicast sessions. Our method is
    based on a novel application of One-Way Function Trees (OFTs). The number of keys
    stored by group members, the number of keys broadcast to the group when new members
    are added or evicted, and the computational efforts of group members, are logarithmic
    in the number of group members. The method provides perfect forward and backward
    security: evicted members cannot read future messages, even with collusion by
    arbitrarily many evicted members, and newly admitted group members cannot read
    previous messages. In comparison with the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) of Wallner
    et al., our algorithm roughly halves the number of bits that need to be broadcast
    to members in order to re-key after a member is added or evicted. In addition,
    and unlike LKH, our algorithm has the option of being member contributory in that
    members can be allowed to contribute entropy to the group key. Running on a Pentium
    with 64 MB of RAM, our prototype has handled groups with up to 100,000 members.</p>"
