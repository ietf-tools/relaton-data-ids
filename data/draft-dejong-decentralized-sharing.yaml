abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the steps and challenges of sharing documents
    between persons, using internet-connected servers. We investigate the situation
    where a document exists on a server to which the sender has access through some
    software application, but the recipient(s) don't. All recipient(s) do, however,
    have access to software applications that run on least one other server. We discuss
    existing and proposed methods for the sender to initiate the communication, for
    each recipient to become aware of the sender's intent to share a document, for
    each recipient to access the document directly, for the document contents to be
    transmitted to server(s) to which the recipient(s) have access, for the sender
    to make and announce changes in the document after it was initially sent, and
    for the recipient(s) to communicate comments and proposed changes to the document
    back to the sender. We also discuss how semantics of the document may be communicated,
    and how versioning conflicts may then in some cases be resolved programmatically.
    Given that users of personal servers don't all run the same compatible software
    on their server, the sending application needs to discover which application-level
    protocols are supported by the receiving application(s).</p>"
