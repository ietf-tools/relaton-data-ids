- content: "<p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) ASSOCIATION object is defined
    in the context of GMPLS-controlled label switched paths (LSPs). In this context,
    the object is used to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.
    This document reviews how the association is to be provided in the context of
    GMPLS recovery. No new procedures or mechanisms are defined by this document,
    and it is strictly informative in nature. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
