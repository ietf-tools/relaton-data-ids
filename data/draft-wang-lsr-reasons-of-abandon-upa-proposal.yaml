abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-lsr-igp-ureach-prefix-announce] (UPA draft) proposes the
    solution to announce the prefix unreachable information within the IGP domain.
    It utilizes the LSInfinity concept that is introduced in [RFC2328], without analysis
    the dormant and flawed design. It defines some new flags to convey the maintenance
    information, which is not the role of IGP protocols and finally, there are several
    parts that are overlap with another precedent draft that discusses the corresponding
    contents more throughly. This document analyzes the above issues, suggests the
    IETF commuity abandon the UPA draft, replace it with other more comprehensive
    document [I-D.wang-lsr-prefix-unreachable-annoucement](Founder Draft), to provide
    the IETF community the more optimal solution.</p>"
