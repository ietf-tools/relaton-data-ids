abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet
    Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT).
    The workshop was hosted by the University of Cambridge on December 4th and 5th
    of 2013 in Cambridge, UK. The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption
    of Internet protocols, through examination of a variety of economic models, with
    particular emphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the protocol
    stack). This report summarizes contributions and discussions. As the topics were
    wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants
    to pursue at this time. Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop
    noted areas that deserve further exploration. Note that this document is a report
    on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions documented in this
    report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB
    views and positions.</p>"
