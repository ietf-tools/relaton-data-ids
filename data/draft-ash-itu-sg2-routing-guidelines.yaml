abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents the ongoing work in ITU-T SG2 Question 2/2 on Recommendation
    E.352 'Routing Guidelines for Efficient Routing Methods.' Routing policies typically
    used in ATM- and IP-based networks do not fully consider the possible instabilities
    and drastic loss of throughput that can occur under congestion. Use of bandwidth
    reservation and avoidance of long paths are recommended under such congestion,
    which can lead to more efficient use of network resources. Also, there is an emphasis
    in ATM- and IP-based networks on the use of state-dependent-routing (SDR) methods.
    However, the flooding methods typically used by these SDR methods to disseminate
    network status information can lead to inefficient use of network resources. Use
    of event-dependent-routing (EDR) methods and/or more efficient dissemination of
    network status information are recommended as other possible approaches to consider.
    Finally, QoS routing rules are recommended to ensure service performance quality,
    such as avoidance of excessive transfer delay by limiting the number of satellite
    hops in an end-to-end connection.</p>"
