- content: "<p>The security of BGP is critical to the continued health and well being
    of internetworking. While securing a link between two BGP peers is a relatively

    themselves. In this document, we describe a set of requirements for securing BGP
    is described, both in the areas of peering relationships and prefix authentication.</p>"
