abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows calls to both addresses
    of record (AORs) such as sip:alice@example.com and telephone numbers with either
    sip or tel schemes such as tel:+12127771234. As opposed to the AOR where the domain
    specifies the exact location or realm of the user and a reject code provides enough
    visiblity to the calling party to exit gracefully (e.g. a 404 indicates that there
    is no point in trying further as the requested user either does not exist or is
    offline with no voicemail) with telephone numbers (TNs) this is not the case.
    With more and more TNs representing actual IP endpoints there is a need to differentiate
    in an error code between rejecting a call due to a misdialed number (i.e. the
    number does not exist) and a number that is just not associated with an IP endpoint
    (for example in a case where there is no billing relationship and as such the
    rejecting proxy cannot forward to a PSTN termination provider. This specification
    defines a new SIP response code (No Service Reject - nsr) for this purpose.</p>"
