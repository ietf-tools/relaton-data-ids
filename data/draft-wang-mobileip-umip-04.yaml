abstract:
- content: "<p>Global roaming is one of the design objectives for next generation
    (3G) cellular networks. To efficiently support real-time applications for mobile
    users in these networks, signaling and payload traffic delays must be minimal.
    It has been identified that one of the sources causing long delays is triangle
    routing. That is, for example, in the registration process the registration requests
    have to be transmitted from a foreign agent in the visited network all the way
    to the home network every time the mobile node initiates a call or when the mobile
    node roams into a different visiting network [2].</p>"
