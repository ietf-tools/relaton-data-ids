abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the eXtensible Service Discovery
    Framework (XSDF). It defines a collection of extensible protocols and agents for
    the dynamic location of network services. XSDF Service Discovery Framework is
    scalable and can be deployed from unmanaged LANs up to Internet-wide Service Location.
    XSDF also provides several mechanisms to select among the available services discovered.
    This allows service providers to implement load sharing or active/backup policies
    among multiple servers providing the same service.</p>"
