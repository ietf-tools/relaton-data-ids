abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft proposes a new model for the use of IP over ATM
    networks, to be known as the Integrated Routing &amp; Addressing (IRA) model.
    The basic idea is simple, namely to use IPv6/IPv4 addresses for IP/ATM nodes by
    embedding them in an ATM NSAP address, and then using the same hierarchical prefix
    routing for both the ATM and IP layers, thus providing a seamless integration
    of the two technologies. The basic purpose of the IRA model is to recognize the
    commonality of requirements between the existing Internet and a new global ATM
    infrastructure, avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, and allow each technology
    to take maximal advantage of the strengths of the other. This model is briefly
    compared with other models such as the 'Classical IP and ARP over ATM' model and
    the 'NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)' model. The method by which IP hosts
    and routers would utilize the IRA model is presented, including a protocol called
    Prefix Route Exchange (PRE), which would be used to exchange prefix routes between
    an IP router or host and its directly attached ATM switch.</p>"
