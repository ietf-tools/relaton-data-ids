abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an inter Home Agents (HAHA) protocol to provide
    multiple Home Agents support for both Mobile IPv6 and the Nemo Basic Support protocol.
    The HAHA protocol provides Home Agent redundancy and load-balancing for both protocols.
    The HAHA protocol allows multiple Home Agents to be placed at different links.
    It also allows a Mobile Node/Router to utilize multiple Home Agents simultaneously.
    The protocol consists of 3 mechanisms, Home Agent List management, Binding Synchronization,
    and Home Agent Switching. A Mobile Node/Router picks one Home Agent as its primary
    Home Agent and registers with it. The primary Home Agent synchronizes the binding
    cache information with other Home Agents. Any of Home Agents can intercept a packet
    meant for the Mobile Node/Router and tunnel the packet directly to its current
    Care-of address. Alternatively, the Home Agent can tunnel the packet to the primary
    Home Agent.</p>"
