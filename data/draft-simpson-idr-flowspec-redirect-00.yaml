abstract:
- content: "<p>Flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of
    traffic flow specifications. This has several applications, but one of key interest
    to many network operators is network-wide distribution of traffic filtering rules
    as part of a threat mitigation strategy. Every flowspec route is effectively a
    rule, consisting of a matching part (encoded in the NLRI field) and an action
    part. The current standards support common filter actions including discard, rate
    limit, sample, etc. and all of these actions are encoded in BGP extended communities.
    For policy-based forwarding the current standards also define a redirect-to-VRF
    action (again encoded in a BGP extended community), but for some flowspec applications
    this can be complex to implement, particularly in networks where L3 VPNs are not
    prevalent. This draft proposes a generalized flowspec redirect action that allows
    a more complete set of policy-based forwarding actions to be signaled with a flowspec
    route. This generalized action is encoded in a BGP path attribute and uses a TLV-style
    encoding for future extensibility. Two redirect action TLVs are defined in this
    draft: one for redirecting matched packets towards a remote IPv4 destination and
    the other for redirecting matched packets towards a remote IPv6 destination. Many
    routers already support these filter actions in the datapath and so the proposed
    flowspec extensions are simply filling a control plane gap.</p>"
