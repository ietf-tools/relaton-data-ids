abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the procedures that the Internet Assigned Numbers
    Authority (IANA) uses when handling assignment and other requests related to the
    Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number registry. It also discusses the
    rationale and principles behind these procedures and how they facilitate the long-term
    sustainability of the registry. This document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting
    the previous UDP and TCP port assignment procedures defined in Sections 8 and
    9.1 of the IANA Allocation Guidelines, and it updates the IANA service name and
    port assignment procedures for UDP-Lite, the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    (DCCP), and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). It also updates the
    DNS SRV specification to clarify what a service name is and how it is registered.
    This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
