abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Congestion Manager (CM), an end-system
    module that (i) enables an ensemble of multiple concurrent flows from a sender
    destined to the same receiver and sharing the same congestion properties to perform
    proper congestion avoidance and control, and (ii) allows applications to easily
    adapt to network congestion. This CM framework integrates congestion management
    across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters
    (available aggregate and per-flow bandwidth, per-receiver round-trip times, etc.)
    and exports an API that enables applications to learn about network characteristics,
    pass information to the CM, share congestion information with each other, and
    schedule data transmissions. This document focuses on applications and transport
    protocols with their own independent per-byte or per-packet sequence number information,
    and does not require modifications to the receiver protocol stack. The receiving
    application must provide feedback to the sending application about received packets
    and losses, and the latter uses the CM API to update CM state. This document does
    not address networks with reservations or service discrimination.</p>"
