abstract:
- content: "<p>Given the limited resources available to a lot of embedded systems,
    dual-stack solutions are not always feasible for such hosts. A mechanism that
    supports a direct transition from IPv4-only to IPv6-only may prove beneficial
    in getting the smallest hosts to make a transition to IPv6 at a much earlier stage
    than would otherwise be possible. This calls for tunnels, but no current tunnel
    technique appears to be optimal for embedded systems. This specification details
    an IPv6 tunneling technique over UDP and IPv4. The technique is specifically designed
    to benefit embedded systems, and to work without end user configuration. The working
    principle for obtaining a routable IPv6 address is through stateless autoconfiguration
    from an anycast tunnel service.</p>"
