- content: "<p>This document describes how to efficiently implement certain mechanisms
    of unidirectional operation in ROHC-TCP (robust header compression scheme for
    TCP/IP), RFC XXX, which can significantly improve the compression efficiency compared
    to using simple control scheme. All the operational modes and state machines mentioned
    in this document are the same as the ones described in [ROHC-TCP].</p>"
