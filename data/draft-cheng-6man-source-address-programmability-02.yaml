abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6-based tunneling technologies, such as SRv6, have been deployed
    by provider on transport networks to provide users with services such as VPN and
    SD-WAN. After the service traffic enters the provider's transport network, it
    will be encapsulated by tunnel (SRv6 encapsulation). In order to better meet the
    SLA requirements of users, some technologies need to carry relevant information
    along with the flow to guide the processing of packets during forwarding. This
    document discusses the programmability of IPv6 source addresses to carry the necessary
    flow information</p>"
