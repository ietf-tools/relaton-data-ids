    for the collection of activities that allow the IETF to carry out its work. The
    current description of the IETF's work can be found in [2]. The proposal is based
    on the observations and recommendations outlined in the IAB Advisory Committee
    report ([1]). The motivation for this proposal is described separately ([3]).
