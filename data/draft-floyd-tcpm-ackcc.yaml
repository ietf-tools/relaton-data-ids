abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a possible congestion control mechanism for
    acknowledgement (ACKs) traffic in TCP. The document specifies an end-to-end acknowledgement
    congestion control mechanism for TCP that uses participation from both TCP hosts:
    the TCP data sender and the TCP data receiver. The TCP data sender detects lost
    or Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-marked ACK packets, and tells the TCP
    data receiver the ACK Ratio R to use to respond to the congestion on the reverse
    path from the data receiver to the data sender. The TCP data receiver sends roughly
    one ACK packet for every R data packets received. This mechanism is based on the
    acknowledgement congestion control in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol's
    (DCCP's) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) 2. This acknowledgement congestion
    control mechanism is being specified for further evaluation by the network community.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
