abstract:
- content: "<p>Network telemetry is a technology for gaining network insight and facilitating
    efficient and automated network management. It encompasses various techniques
    for remote data generation, collection, correlation, and consumption. This document
    describes an architectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by challenges
    that are encountered as part of the operation of networks and by the requirements
    that ensue. This document clarifies the terminologies and classifies the modules
    and components of a network telemetry system from different perspectives. The
    framework and taxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection of related
    work and provide guidance for related technique and standard developments.</p>"
