abstract:
- content: <p>An email address has two parts - local part and domain part - separated
    by "@" sign. This document describes a basic solution to internationalized email
    address (IMA) and includes some preliminary survey results. The proposed solution
    enables SMTP servers to support IMA. The solution discussed in this document is
    immediately deployable by interested parties without affecting or breaking any
    other existing systems.</p>
