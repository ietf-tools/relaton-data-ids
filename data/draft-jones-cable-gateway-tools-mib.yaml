abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of CableHome
    compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home routers. Specifically, this MIB defines
    managed objects for both a connection speed tool and an ICMP 'ping' tool between
    the Gateway and devices on the LAN. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner
    that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2. The set of objects is consistent with the
    SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.</p>"
