abstract:
- content: "<p>In an environment where multiple PCEs are responsible for computing
    paths in a domain, there is a greater possibility of race conditions compared
    to traditional methods. Fast convergence of network state, e.g. TED, LSPs, is
    more important for PCEs. Furthermore, load balancing of computation should be
    considered among these PCEs. This document is not intended to provide a detailed
    description of all the architectural components of the PCE communication protocol.
    Rather, it specifies the Global Computing Table (GCT) along with corresponding
    mechanisms and procedures to resolve some predictable problems in PCEs, especially
    in situations where multiple PCEs are responsible for computing TE LSPs path in
    a domain. It is hoped that these mechanisms can cooperate with the PCE communication
    protocol to improve the abilities of the protocol.</p>"
