abstract:
- content: <p>The distribution of clients of L2 domain across extended, networks leveraging
    overlay fabric, needs to deal with synchronizing the Client Binding Database.
    The 'Client IP Binding' indicates the IP, MAC and VLAN details of the clients
    that are learnt by security protocols. Since learning 'Client IP Binding database'
    is last mile solution, this information stays local to the end point switch, to
    which clients are connected. When networks are extended across geographies, that
    is, both layer2 and layer3, the 'Client IP Binding Database' in end point of switches
    of remote fabrics should be in sync. This literature intends to align the synchronization
    of 'Client IP Binding Database" through an extension to BGP control plane constructs
    and as BGP is a typical control plane protocol configured to communicate across
    network boundries.</p>
