abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobile communication becomes the mainstream because more and more
    mobile devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, notebooks,
    etc., are used to access the Internet. In order to be reachable, the mobile devices
    need frequently change their communication IP addresses in mobile IPv6 network
    according to its current attached domain. However, the conventional firewalls
    are primarily based on IPv4 network where the security criteria are specified
    only to the fixed IP addresses or subnets. The goal of the document is to solve
    the conflict and propose some approaches to make the firewall friendly in mobile
    IPv6 network.</p>"
