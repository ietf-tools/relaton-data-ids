abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses an extension of the algorithmic translation
    between IPv4 and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses. The extended address format
    contains transport-layer port set identification (PSID) which allows several IPv6
    nodes to share a single IPv4 address with each node managing a different range
    of ports. This address format extension can be used for IPv4/IPv6 translation,
    as well as IPv4 over IPv6 tunneling.</p>"
