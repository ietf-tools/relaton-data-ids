abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposal discusses technical issues related to delivery
    and control of IP multimedia services, such as video-conferencing, involving heterogeneous
    end terminals. In particular, it describes the design and implementation of an
    experimental system for interworking between IETF SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
    and ISO MPEG-4 DMIF (Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework) session and call
    control signaling protocols. This IP videoconferencing interworking system is
    composed of two core units for supporting delivery of audio-video streams from
    a DMIF domain to a SIP domain (i.e. DMIF2SIP unit) and from a SIP domain to a
    DMIF domain (i.e. SIP2DMIF unit). These units perform various translation functions
    for transparent establishment and control of multimedia sessions across IP networking
    environment, including, session protocol conversion, service gateway conversion
    and address translation.</p>"
