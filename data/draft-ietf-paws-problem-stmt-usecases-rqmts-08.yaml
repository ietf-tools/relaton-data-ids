abstract:
- content: <p>Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use
    but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white
    space". The concept of allowing additional transmissions (which may or may not
    be licensed) in white space is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new
    use. An obvious requirement is that these additional transmissions do not interfere
    with the assigned use of the spectrum. One approach to using the white space spectrum
    at a given time and location is to verify with a database for available channels.
    This document describes a number of possible use cases of white space spectrum
    and technology as well as a set of requirements for the database query protocol.
    The concept of TV white spaces is described including the problems that need to
    be addressed to enable white space spectrum for additional uses without causing
    interference to currently assigned use. Use of white space is enabled by querying
    a database which stores information about the channel availability at any given
    location and time.</p>
