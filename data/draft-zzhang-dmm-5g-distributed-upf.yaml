abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes evolution of mobile user plane in 5G, including
    distributed UPFs and alternative user plane implementations that some vendors/operators
    are pushing without changing 3GPP architecture/signaling. This also sets the stage
    for discussions in a companion document about potentially integrating UPF and
    Acess Node (AN) in a future generation (xG) of mobile network.</p>"
