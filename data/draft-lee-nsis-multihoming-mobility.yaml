abstract:
- content: "<p>A host that is an initiator or responder of NSIS signaling messages
    can be not only mobile but also multihomed. Multihomed hosts and scenarios may
    be common in the future IPv6-based Internet. Benefits of multihoming include increased
    bandwidth, load balancing, load sharing, ubiquitous access, bi-casting, resilience,
    and etc. NSIS signaling should be able to support various multihoming scenarios.
    This draft describes NSIS operations and applicability in multihomed environments.</p>"
