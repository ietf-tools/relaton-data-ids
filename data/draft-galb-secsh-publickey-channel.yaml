abstract:
- content: "<p>SECSH defines an authentication mechanism that is based on public keys,
    but does not define any mechanism for key distribution. No common key management
    solution exists in current implementations. This document describes a channel
    that can be used to configure public keys in an implementation-independent fashion,
    allowing client software to take on the burden of this configuration. The public
    key channel provides a server-independent mechanism for clients to add public
    keys, remove public keys, and list the current public keys known by the server.
    Rights to manage public keys are specific and limited to the authenticated user.
    A public key may also be associated with a mandatory command.</p>"
