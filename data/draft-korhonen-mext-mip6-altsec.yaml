abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 signaling between the mobile node and home agent is secured
    using IPsec. The security association between a mobile node and the home agent
    is established using IKEv1 or IKEv2. The security model specified for Mobile IPv6,
    which relies on IKE/IPsec, requires interaction between the Mobile IPv6 protocol
    part of the IP stack and the IKE/IPsec part of the IP stack. The IPsec/IKEv2 based
    security architectures makes implementation and deployment of the protocol infeasible
    for numerous reasons. This document proposes an alternate security framework,
    which relies on Transport Layer Security for establishing keying material and
    other bootstrapping parameters required to protect Mobile IPv6 signaling and data
    traffic between the mobile node and home agent.</p>"
