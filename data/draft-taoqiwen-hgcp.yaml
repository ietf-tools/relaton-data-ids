abstract:
- content: "<p>In an era where AI-generated content has become indistinguishable from
    human writing, the Human-Generated Content Protocol (HGCP) proposes a voluntary
    signing framework that enables human authors to take responsibility for their
    expressions. Instead of relying on probabilistic detection methods or enforcing
    centralized identity, HGCP encourages a simple yet powerful act: a signer publicly
    declares responsibility for authored content through a structured signature block.
    The protocol is platform-neutral, supports both real-name and anonymous identities,
    and prioritizes transparency, accountability, and human agency. HGCP defines minimal
    signature structures, integration suggestions for platforms and tools, and philosophical
    guidance for fostering expression trust in an increasingly synthetic information
    ecosystem.</p>"
