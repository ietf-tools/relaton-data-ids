abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a traffic shaping solution for DetNet service
    with bounded latency in large-scale networks. The traffic shaping solution includes
    the edge access control, enqueue cycle mapping and jitter compression mechanisms.
    These mechanisms support appropriate resource reservation algorithms, reasonably
    calculate the end-to-end delay in DetNet IP network in advance, and adjust, manage
    and control the resources after real-time detection. Using the traffic shaping
    solution, it is possible for an implementer, user, or standards development organization
    to realize bounded delay based on the existing TSN/DetNet queuing models.</p>"
