abstract:
- content: "<p>The Initial Window (IW) provides the starting point for TCP's feedback-based
    congestion control algorithm. Its value has increased over time to increase performance
    and to reflect increased capability of Internet devices. This document describes
    a mechanism to adjust the IW over long timescales, to make future changes more
    safely deployed and to potentially avoid reexamination of this value in the future.</p>"
