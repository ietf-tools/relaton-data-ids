abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for a DNS recursive resolver to use
    opportunistic encryption when communicating with authoritative servers. The method
    here is optional for both the recursive resolver and the authoritative server.
    A motivating use case for this method is that more encryption on the Internet
    is better, and opportunistic encryption is better than no encryption at all. Nothing
    in this method prevents use cases that require better encryption.</p>"
