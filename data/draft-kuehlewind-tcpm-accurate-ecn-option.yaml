abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an TCP option to get accurate Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) feedback from the receiver. ECN is an IP/TCP mechanism where
    network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate congestion
    to the end-points. An ECN- capable receiver will feedback this information to
    the sender. ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal
    can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recently new TCP mechanisms like
    ConEx or DCTCP need more accurate feedback information in the case where more
    than one marking is received in one RTT. This TCP extension can be used in addition
    to the classic ECN as well as with a more accurate ECN scheme recently proposed
    which reuses the ECN bit in the TCP header.</p>"
