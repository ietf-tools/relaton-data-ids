abstract:
- content: '<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing
    multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation,
    and other forms of multimedia session initiation. Together with Offer/Answer model
    it defines a mechanism, how two entities can reach a common view of a multimedia
    session between them. In certain cases, there are dependencies between media streams,
    for example a text stream for subtitling make sense only together with a video
    stream. To avoid senseless connections, the SDP mechanism can be extended with
    a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level attribute: "dependency".
    The "dependency" attribute allows the offerer to define dependencies of media
    streams. The updated offer/ answer mechanism used with new "dependency" attribute
    can be used furthermore, that in a multi-party SIP session all participants share
    at least one common media type.</p>'
