abstract:
- content: "<p>We present, QoSMIC, a multicast protocol for the Internet that supports
    QoS-sensitive routing, and minimizes the importance of a priori configuration
    decisions (such as core selection). The protocol is resource-efficient, robust,
    flexible, and scalable. In addition, our protocol is provably loop-free. Our protocol
    starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) and individual receivers switch
    to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-Based Tree) when necessary. In both trees, the
    new destination is able to choose the most promising among several paths. An innovation
    is that we use dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchange
    protocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre- configuration decisions
    drastically, by separating the management from the data transfer functions; administrative
    routers are not necessarily part of the tree. This separation increases the robustness,
    and flexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adapt dynamically
    to the conditions of the network. The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas
    that make it more flexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many
    of the other protocols, (such as YAM, PIM-SM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as special
    cases of QoSMIC. The goal of this document is to present the motivation behind,
    and the design of QoSMIC, and to provide both analytical and experimental results
    to support our claims. NOTE: The text version of the draft is missing several
    figures, that facilitate the understanding of the work. For this, the authors
    suggest the postscript version.</p>"
