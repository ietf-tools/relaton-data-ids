abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP- BGP)now plays
    an important role in the transition of their Provider (P) core network as well
    as Provider Edge (PE) Inter-AS peering network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators must
    be able to continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge networks
    are IPv6-Only. This document details an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-PE Inter-AS
    IPv6-Only peering design that leverages the MP-BGP capability exchange by using
    IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing both IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be
    carried over the same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session for all Address
    Family Identifiers (AFI) and Subsequent Address Family Identifiers(SAFI). The
    design change provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that exists today
    with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today. With this design change
    from a control plane perspective a single IPv6-Only peer is required for both
    IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates and from a data plane forwarindg perspective an
    IPv6 address need only be configured on the PE to PE Inter-AS peering interface
    for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding. This document extends the IPv6-Only
    PE- CE peering architecture defined in [I-D.ietf-bess-ipv6-only-pe-design] to
    PE-PE inter-as peering architecture where the 4to6 softwire is now extended to
    Inter-AS L3 VPN options Option-A, Option-AB and Option-C and now applies to all
    AFI/SAFI ubiquitously. As service providers migrate to Segment Routing architecture
    SR-MPLS and SRv6, VPN overlay exsits as well, and thus Inter-AS options Option-A,
    Option-AB and Option-C are still applicable and thus this extension of IPv6-Only
    peering architecure extension to Inter-AS peering is very relevant to Segment
    Routing as well.</p>"
