abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for referencing and validating user
    attributes in SIP communication. User attributes, such as an organizational affiliation
    and role, are helpful for the recipients of a communication request to decide
    whether or not to grant the sender access to the recipient's resources, especially
    when the sender identity is unknown to the recipients. This mechanism allows the
    sender to claim her attributes to recipients using an attribute reference identifier
    without needing to prove the sender identity. This document defines a new SIP
    "Sender-References" header field to convey one or more attribute reference identifiers.
    This mechanism satisfies all the requirements for trait-based authorization defined
    in RFC 4484, except that it provides only one assertion scheme.</p>
