abstract:
- content: "<p>In the traffic congestion management of routers, queueing technology
    is generally used to classify and transmit traffic. Therefore, queue information
    indirectly reflects the congestion status of the router. This document makes the
    necessary expansion of the BGP-LS mechanism to send queue information to the network
    controller in a scalable way, enabling the network controller to understand the
    router's traffic congestion status and make appropriate adjustments to the network
    traffic.</p>"
