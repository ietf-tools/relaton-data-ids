abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version
    4. Pip is a general purpose internet protocol, designed to handle all forseeable
    internet protocol requirements. This specification is one of a number of documents
    that specify the operation of Pip. This specification describes the operation
    of Pip hosts. In particular, it describes how a Pip host picks among multiple
    Pip Addresses, and how a Pip host responds to various PCMP Packet Not Delivered
    (PDN) messages.</p>"
