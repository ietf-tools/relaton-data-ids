abstract:
- content: "<p>Data Centers may be spread across different locations for a particular
    enterprise. Different locations may mean within the same country but across different
    geographical locations, or outside the country even in a different continent.
    These data centers may be serving the enterprise or multiple enterprises / tenants
    wherein the regular enterprise site may request data from a data center site which
    could be one of the data center sites proximal to the enterprise site. Proximity
    is usually calculated based on a metric that is bandwidth driven or in terms with
    regard to the number of hops to reach that data center site hence bringing into
    play delay characteristics. Assume a topology where the data center sites and
    the enterprise sites are MPLS based L3VPN sites that are being provided connectivity
    through a Service Provider deploying Layer 3 VPNs. Given such a topology it is
    possible that replication of data happens across the data centers in a timely
    manner to keep the data active and refreshed across all data center sites. Suitable
    mechanisms for such replication will come into play for this purpose. Thus any
    of the data centers can cater to the request from a user site. It is possible
    that power consumption in each data center may vary according to the load on each
    data center. It would be prudent to introduce a scheme where the power metric
    coupled with other metrics such as bandwidth and delay be used by a Provider Edge
    router in a L3VPN scenario to direct the packets or requests from regular user
    sites to such data centers with the least such metric. This is in line with the
    follow-the-moon strategy of directing requests for data and compute to data centers
    which are power-wise more efficient during the night or during the day. This draft
    document lays out one such proposal.</p>"
