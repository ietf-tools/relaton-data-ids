abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP and ETSI TISPAN are defining PSTN/ISDN simulation services and
    in particular the Communication Diversion (CDIV) using IP Multimedia (IM) core
    Network (CN) subsystem supplementary service. As part of CDIV, a (SIP) Event Notification
    Framework-based mechanism is used for notifying Users about diversions (re-directions
    or forwarding) of their incoming communication sessions. A new event package is
    proposed for allowing users to subscribe for and receive such notifications. Users
    have further capability to define filters controlling the selection, rate and
    content of such notifications. This SIP event package is applicable to the IMS
    and may not be applicable to the general Internet.</p>"
