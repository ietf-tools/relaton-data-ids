abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines extensions to RFC 4279, "Pre-Shared Key Ciphersuites
    for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", to enable dynamic key sharing in distributed
    environments using a Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
    mechanism, and then import that shared key as the "Pre-Shared Key" to complete
    the TLS handshake. This is a modular approach to perform authentication and key
    exchange based on off-shelf libraries. And it obviates the need of pair-wise key
    sharing by enabling the use of the widely-deployed Kerberos alike trust infrastructures
    that are highly scalable and robust. Furthermore, conforming implementations can
    provide server authentication without the use of certificates.</p>
