abstract:
- content: <p>In a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environment, the procedures of RFC 3263
    by which a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client contacts a server may not
    suffice to provide a good user experience. This document describes "Happy Eyeballs"
    modifications -- modifications of the procedures of RFC 3263, as well as additional
    client procedures -- which improve the SIP user experience in many circumstances.</p>
