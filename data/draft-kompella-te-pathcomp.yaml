abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents some notes on Constraint-Based Routing. The main
    purpose is to standardize the terminology used, and define the semantics of the
    various constructs used in Constraint-Based Routing so that implementations from
    a wide variety of vendors will have (at least to the first order) similar results
    in path selection. A secondary goal is to define the semantics of optimization,
    which we define as the recalculation of routes that have already been computed
    and established.</p>"
