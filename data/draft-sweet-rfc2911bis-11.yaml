abstract:
- content: '<p>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies. This document
    describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and operations
    that is independent of encoding and transport. The model consists of several objects,
    including Printers and Jobs. Jobs optionally support multiple Documents. IPP semantics
    allow End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities; submit Print Jobs;
    inquire about the status of Print Jobs and Printers; and cancel, hold, and release
    Print Jobs. IPP semantics also allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.
    Security, internationalization, and directory issues are also addressed by the
    model and semantics. The IPP message encoding and transport are described in "Internet
    Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding and Transport" (RFC 8010). This document obsoletes
    RFCs 2911, 3381, and 3382.</p>'
