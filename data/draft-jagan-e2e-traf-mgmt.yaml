abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the end-to-end traffic management issues in
    IP/ATM internetworks. In the internetwork environment, the ATM control mechanisms
    (e.g., Available Bit Rate (ABR) and UBR with Early Packet Discard (EPD)) are applicable
    to the ATM subnetwork, while the TCP flow control extends from end to end. We
    investigated the end to end performance in terms of TCP throughput and file transfer
    delay in cases using ABR and UBR in the ATM subnetwork. In this document, we also
    discuss the issue of trade-off between the buffer requirements at the ATM edge
    device (e.g., Ethernet-ATM switch, ATM router interface) versus ATM switches inside
    the ATM network. Our simulation results show that in certain scenarios (e.g.,
    with limited edge device buffer memory) UBR with EPD may perform comparably to
    ABR or even outperform ABR. We show that it is not sufficient to have a lossless
    ATM subnetwork from the end-to-end performance point of view. The results illustrate
    the necessity for an edge device congestion handling mechanism that can couple
    the ABR and TCP feedback control loops. We present an algorithm that makes use
    of the ABR feedback information and edge device congestion state to make packet
    dropping decisions at the edge of the ATM network. Using the algorithm at the
    edge device, the end-to-end performance in throughput and delay are improved while
    using ABR as the ATM subnetwork technology and with small buffers in the edge
    device.</p>"
