abstract:
- content: "<p>Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 requires all communications to go through the
    local mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, local routing has been defined
    to allow mobile nodes attached to the same or different mobile access gateways
    to exchange traffic by using local forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways.
    This document proposes an initiation method and fast handover mechanisms for local
    routing. The solutions aim at reducing handover delay and packet loss.</p>"
