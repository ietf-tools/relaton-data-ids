abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links PPP also defines
    an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an Authentication
    Protocol for authentication of its peer before allowing Network Layer protocols
    to transmit over the link. The Certificate exchange protocol is an extension to
    PPP that is in the form of an additional phase, called the certificate exchange
    phase, that would allow for a PPP entity to request certificates from a peer.
    If configured, this phase would be negotiated during the LCP exchange. This exchange
    of certificates is aimed at easing configuration issues by providing for the exchange
    of certificate path information in a standard manner across different strong,
    or public-key certificate-based, authentication protocols. The certificate exchange
    protocol accomodates arbitrary sized certificates.</p>"
