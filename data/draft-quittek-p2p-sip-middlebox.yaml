abstract:
- content: "<p>Middleboxes, particularly firewalls and network address translators,
    are essential components of today's Internet infrastructure. They are designed
    to support client-server applications well, but very often they are obstacles
    for peer-to-peer communication. This memo discusses middlebox traversal issues
    of SIP-based peer-to-peer communication. Required communication steps are analyzed
    concerning their potential constraints caused by middleboxes. The requirements
    derived from this analysis are compared with the capabilites of currently available
    middlebox traversal methods and SIP signaling standards. The comparison identifies
    open issues that need to be considered when designing standards for a SIP-based
    peer-to-peer communication infrastructure.</p>"
