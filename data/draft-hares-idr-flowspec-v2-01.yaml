abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC8955, RFC8956) describes the distribution
    of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are distributed via
    BGP to BGP peers. Multiple applications utilize the BGP distributed traffic filter
    policy. These applications include: (1) mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS),
    (2) enabling of traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNS, (3)centralized traffic control
    for networks utilizing either SDN control of router firewall functions. During
    the deployment of BGP flow specification v1, the following issues were detected:
    1) problems due to the lack of clear TLV encoding for rules for flow specifications,
    2) desire to order filters rules, and 3) ordering of actions to provide deterministic
    actions. Version 2 of the BGP flow specification protocol addresses these features.
    BGP Flow Specification v2 is encapsulated in a different NLRI which encapsulates
    previous flow specification informatino.</p>"
