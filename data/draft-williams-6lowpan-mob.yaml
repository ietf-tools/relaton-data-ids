abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been discussion recently within the 6LoWPAN community regarding
    mobile usage scenarios. Mobility considerations is required for the deployment
    of SmartGrids. The mobility analysis for SmartGrid and 6lowpan deployment is required
    to ensure proper performance for the mobile usage cases. Also, mobility in 6LoWPAN
    sensor networks may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPAN architecture. Hence
    it is best to have mobility as a consideration upfront rather than an after thought
    in the development of 6LoWPAN milestones. This document provides a mobility perspective
    to the 6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.</p>"
