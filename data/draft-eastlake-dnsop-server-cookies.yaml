abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS cookies, as specified in RFC 7873, are a lightweight DNS transaction
    security mechanism that provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients
    against a variety of denial-of-service and amplification, forgery, or cache poisoning
    attacks by off-path attackers. This document specifies a means of producing interoperable
    strong cookies so that an anycast server set including diverse implementations
    will interoperate with standard clients. This document updates RFC 7873.</p>"
