abstract:
- content: "<p>The X.509 public key certificate format is overly verbose for Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) constrained environments, where nodes with limited memory and networks with
    limited bandwidth are not uncommon. The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format
    is a pruned down and encoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which reuses much
    of the X.509 semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically 40%. We are
    proposing that IETF recognize the M2M format as an optional replacement for X.509
    in Internet applications including, but not limited to, TLS and DTLS.</p>"
