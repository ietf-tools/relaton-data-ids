abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how an ACME server may provide suggestions
    to ACME clients as to when they should attempt to renew their certificates. This
    allows servers to mitigate load spikes, and ensures clients do not make false
    assumptions about appropriate certificate renewal periods. Current Implementations
    Draft note: this section will be removed by the editor before final publication.
    Let's Encrypt's Staging environment (available at [lestaging], source at [boulder])
    implements this draft specification.</p>"
