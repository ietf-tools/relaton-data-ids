abstract:
- content: "<p>A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching criteria
    that can be applied to IP traffic. Application-aware Networking (APN) is a framework,
    where APN data packets convey APN attribute (incl. APN ID and/or APN Parameters).
    The dynamic Flow Spec mechanism for APN is designed for the new applications of
    traffic filtering in an APN domain as well as the traffic control and actions
    on the policy enforcement points in this domain. These applications require coordination
    among the ASes within a service provider. This document specifies a new BGP Flow
    Spec Component Type in order to support APN traffic filtering. The match field
    is the APN ID. It also specifies traffic filtering actions to enable the creation
    of the APN ID in the outer tunnel encapsulation when matched to the corresponding
    Flow Spec rules.</p>"
