abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained IoT devices often operate more efficiently in a loosely
    coupled environment without maintaining end-to-end connectivity between nodes.
    Information Centric Networking naturally supports this demand by replicated data
    distribution and hop wise forwarding. This document outlines a deployment option
    for NDN in low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) that follows a publish-subscribe
    pattern. The proposed protocol scheme simplifies name-based routing significantly
    and facilitates even large off-duty cycles for constrained nodes.</p>"
