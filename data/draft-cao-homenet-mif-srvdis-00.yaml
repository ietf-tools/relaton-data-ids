abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the problems of service discovery in a homenet
    multiple connection environment. A multiple connection environment consists of
    multiple-interfaced nodes connecting to multiple networks or multiple provisioning
    domains. Given a type of service a multiple-interfaced client is looking for,
    the discovery progress ought to return a correct pointer to the service instance
    that the client is able to access without trying every available channel.</p>"
