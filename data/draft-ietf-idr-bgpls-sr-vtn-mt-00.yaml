abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
    some applications' needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network. A
    Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which consists of
    a subset of the network topology and network resources allocated from the physical
    network. A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.
    When Segment Routing is used as the data plane of VTNs, each VTN can be allocated
    with a group of Segment Identifiers (SIDs) to identify the topology and resource
    attributes of network segments in the VTN. The association between the network
    topology, the network resource attributes and the SR SIDs may need to be distributed
    to a centralized network controller. For network scenarios where each VTN can
    be associated with a unique logical network topology, this document describes
    a mechanism to distribute the information of SR based VTNs using BGP-LS with Multi-Topology.</p>"
