abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol.
    Web-based systems are increasing with the advancement of Web technologies and
    emergence of cloud computing. Management systems that support browser-based interface
    are also getting common. It's natural to expect network devices to have browser-based
    managemaent interface. Currently, however, few network management protocols support
    being transported over HTTP. NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743].
    But, it falls short of fulfilling NETCONF specification in that it can't provide
    NETCONF notification[RFC5277] because of HTTP's lack of bi-directional capabilty.
    At present, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP with bi-directional capability,
    is available[RFC6455]. This memo describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket
    protocol.</p>"
