abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the INFO usage examples for network based mid-call
    service. Mid-call based services are for example, Call Transfer, Call Waiting,
    and Three-Way Calling. Other possible mid- call services are useful and important,
    even more in IP multimedia network. The cases described in SIP service examples
    (draft-ietf- sipping-service-examples-05) are Terminal-basis. Since the service
    procedures are fixed in the Terminal, the features are not extensible. This document
    propose network-based mid-call control mechanism with INFO and show examples that
    simple mid-call request (INFO) from the Terminal, the network application server
    provide various mid-call services by prompting user through the Media Server,
    according to the subscription information of the user.</p>"
