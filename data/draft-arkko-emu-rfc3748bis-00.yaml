abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),
    an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication methods. EAP
    typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol
    (PPP), IEEE 802, or 3GPP 5G without requiring IP. EAP provides its own support
    for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering
    guarantees. Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual
    EAP methods may support this. This document obsoletes RFC 3748, which in turn
    obsoleted RFC 2284. This document updates some of the security considerations,
    terms, references, the IANA considerations, and few other minor updates. A summary
    of the changes between this document and RFC 3748 is in Appendix A, and the changes
    from RFC 2284 were listed in RFC 3748.</p>"
