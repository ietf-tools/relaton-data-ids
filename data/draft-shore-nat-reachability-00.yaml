abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the most persistent, difficult problems introduced with NATs
    is voluntary reachability -- a NATted device making itself avail- able to the
    public internet. This paper is an overview of the cur- rent status of reachability,
    a decomposition of the problem and a proposal for going forward.</p>"
