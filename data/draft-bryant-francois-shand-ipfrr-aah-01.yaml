abstract:
- content: <p>IPFRR and loop-free convergence techniques can deal with single topology
    change events, multiple correlated change events, and in some cases even certain
    uncorrelated events. However, in all cases there are events which cannot be dealt
    with and the mechanism needs to quickly revert to normal convergence. This is
    known as "Abandoning All Hope" (AAH). This document describes the nature of the
    problem, and various proposed mechanisms to deal with it.</p>
