abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual links
    using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO). Nodes attached to AERO links
    can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding
    services to reach off-link destinations and route optimization services for improved
    performance. AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation
    of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding. Dynamic
    link selection, mobility management, quality of service (QoS) signaling and route
    optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates, while
    IPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) is supported by network services such as the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6). AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling
    solution especially well-suited to aviation services, mobile Virtual Private Networks
    (VPNs) and other applications as described in this document.</p>"
