abstract:
- content: '<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable
    of selecting paths through a traffic engineering network. These paths may be supplied
    in response to requests for computation, or may be unsolicited requests issued
    by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may be categorized
    and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC 8955 defines the Flow Specification
    and describes how Flow Specification Components are used to describe traffic flows.
    RFC 8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP to allow
    specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. RFC XXXX specifies a set
    of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications. This allows
    a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware
    of. The extensions defined in this document extends the support for Ethernet Layer
    2 (L2) and Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) traffic filtering rules either
    by themselves or in conjunction with L3 flowspecs. RFC Editor Note: Please replace
    XXXX in the Abstract with the RFC number assigned to draft-ietf-pce-pcep-flowspec
    when it is published. Please remove this note.</p>'
