abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance
    assessment. The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as Active
    or Passive. Some methods may use a subset of both active and passive attributes,
    and we refer to these as Hybrid Methods.</p>"
