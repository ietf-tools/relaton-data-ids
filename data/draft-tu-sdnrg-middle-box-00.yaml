abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a middle box to improve the utilization of
    data centers. By first combining Clos network with Software Defined Network (SDN),
    the middle box is programmable and nonblocking. SDN controller in the middle box
    can collect information such as traffic load, port speed, and resources utilization,
    which can be used to get better efficiency. The nonblocking feature can effectively
    reduce the delay caused by the middle box thus get the better performance. Furthermore,
    the middle box is transparent for the original network, so it can be readily implemented
    for today's data centers.</p>"
