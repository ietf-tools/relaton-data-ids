abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses three major questions that were posed and discussed
    at some length at the interim meeting in San Diego, June 2002: (1) Should geopriv
    facilitate the misrepresentation of location information? (2) Should the geopriv
    Location Object (LO) accommodate multiple locations as part of a single positioning
    transaction? (3) If so, should the Location Object hold multiple locations in
    a single object, or should the multiple locations be contained in multiple objects?
    In this paper we propose an answer to those questions.</p>"
