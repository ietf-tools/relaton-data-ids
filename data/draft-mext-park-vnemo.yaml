abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile network can be multihomed as described in [RFC4980]. This
    document describes the experimental result of service differentiation using multihoming
    with multiple prefixes. The multiple prefixes in IPv6 NEMO implements multiple
    virtual mobile networks on a single physical NEMO. The multiple virtual mobile
    networks provide service differentiation on a single mobile network. Each mobile
    network node inside the mobile network prioritizes for service differenciation.
    It can be differenciated among the virutal mobile networks or forwarding traffic
    from each virtual mobile network to different access networks. In this experiment,
    a mobile router with multiple interfaces can make connection to several access
    networks simultaneoulsly.</p>"
