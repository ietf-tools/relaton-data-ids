abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many situations where organizations want to protect information
    with robust access control, either for implementation of intellectual property
    right protections, enforcement of contractual confidentiality agreements or because
    of legal regulations. The Enhanced Security Services (ESS) for S/MIME defines
    an access control mechanism for email which is enforced by the recipient's client
    after decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore is dependent on the
    correct access policy configuration of every recipient's client. This mechanism
    also provides full access to the data to all recipients prior to the access control
    check, which is considered to be inadequate for robust access control due to the
    difficulty in demonstrating policy compliance. This document lays out the deficiencies
    of the current ESS security label, and presents requirements for a new model for
    providing access control to messages where the access check is performed prior
    to message content decryption. This new model also does not require policy configuration
    on the client thereby simplifying deployment and compliance verification. The
    proposed model additionally provides a method where non-X.509 certificate credentials
    can be used for encryption/decryption of S/MIME messages.</p>"
