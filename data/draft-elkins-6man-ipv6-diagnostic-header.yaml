abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IPID for fragmentation and
    reassembly. This field was commonly used by network diagnosticians for tracking
    packets on multi-tier networks. In IPv6, the IPID has been moved to the Fragment
    header. A new Diagnostic header for IPv6 which can be sent with every packet as
    a part of the Destination Options header with a 64-bit IPID is defined in this
    document.</p>"
