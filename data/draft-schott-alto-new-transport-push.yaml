abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO New Transport [draft-ietf-alto-new-transport] introduces ALTO
    transport information structures (TIS) at an ALTO server. The introduction of
    ALTO TIS allows at least two types of efficient transport using HTTP: (1) HTTP/2/3
    independent client long poll allowed by non-blocking, newer HTTP, and (2) HTTP/2
    specific server push. This document defines HTTP/2 specific server-push ALTO transport
    based on ALTO TIS.</p>"
