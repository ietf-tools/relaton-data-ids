abstract:
- content: "<p>IKEv2 specifies that EAP authentication must be used together with
    public key signature based responder authentication. This is necessary with old
    EAP methods that provide only unilateral authentication using, e.g., one-time
    passwords or token cards. This document specifies how EAP methods that provide
    mutual authentication and key agreement can be used to provide extensible responder
    authentication for IKEv2 based on methods other than public key signatures.</p>"
