abstract:
- content: <p>Within the Domain Name System, several names have been reserved or used
    for special purposes, some at the top level and some at other levels. IANA registries
    of Reserved and Special Names can reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and
    the consequent ambiguity. This specification establishes those registries. Status
