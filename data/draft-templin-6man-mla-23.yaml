abstract:
- content: "<p>Ad Hoc networks often present a challenging environment for IPv6 addressing
    due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes
    assign IPv6 addresses to their Ad Hoc network interface connections that must
    be locally unique but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes must
    therefore be able to assign topology-independent addresses to their interfaces
    when topology-oriented IPv6 address delegation services are either absent or only
    intermittently available. This document introduces a new IPv6 address type that
    a node can autonomously assign to its Ad Hoc network interfaces.</p>"
