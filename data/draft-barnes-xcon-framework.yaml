abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing (XCON),
    which is applicable to participants using different call control signaling protocols
    and exchanging media over networks with potentially different characteristics.
    The XCON Framework defines the XCON data model, the XCON logical entities, the
    naming conventions, and outlines the standard conferencing protocols (complementary
    to the call control signalling protocols) for building advanced conferencing applications.
    The framework binds all the defined components together for the benefit of conferencing
    system builders.</p>"
