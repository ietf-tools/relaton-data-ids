abstract:
- content: "<p>A framing protocol is defined for TCP that is fully compliant with
    applicable TCP RFCs and fully interoperable with existing TCP implementations.
    The framing mechanism is designed to work as an 'adaptation layer' between TCP
    and the Direct Data Placement [DDP] protocol, preserving the reliable, in-order
    delivery of TCP, while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record
    boundaries that DDP requires.</p>"
