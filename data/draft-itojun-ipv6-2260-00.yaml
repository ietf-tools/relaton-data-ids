abstract:
- content: "<p>The document describes a mechanism for basic IPv6 multihoming support,
    and its operational requirements. The mechanism can be combined with more sophisticated
    (or complex) multihoming support mechanisms, and can be used as a foundation for
    other mechanisms. The document is largely based on RFC2260 [Bates, 1998] by Tony
    Bates.</p>"
