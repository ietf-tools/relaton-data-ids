abstract:
- content: "<p>As one of the requirements of link state based routing protocols such
    as OSPF, link state update packets are intervally or reactively disseminate in
    the network in order to keep the information of topology and links resource synchronized
    at each control node. Considering large scale networks, massive messages are flooded
    in the control plane of General Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) based multi-area
    networks. The convergence time of link state based routing protocols will have
    a significant impact on the performance of the networks. So measuring and analyzing
    the convergence time of information flooding in multi-areas becomes very important.
    This document provides suggestions for measuring OSPF multi-area control plane
    convergence. A performance metric of convergence time of information flooding
    is proposed to characterize the ability of information synchronization in multi-area
    networks.</p>"
