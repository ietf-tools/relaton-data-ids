abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification dictates
    that a transport layer connection can carry SIP requests in only one direction
    i.e. from the client to the server. This presents scalability problems as twice
    the number of connections are needed for each pair of SIP entities that communicate
    with each other. The internet-draft [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse] specifies a mechanism
    for reusing SIP over TLS connections. However, that document is predicated on
    secure TLS mutual authentication and specifically refrains connection reuse for
    transports such as SIP over TCP and SCTP. There are many situations, such as in
    Trust Domains [RFC3324], where TLS mutual authentication may not be required but
    where connection reuse is beneficial. This document specifies connection reuse
    for SIP over connection-oriented transports such as TCP and SCTP. It specifies
    the same mechanism for connection reuse as specified in [I-D.ietf-sip-connect-reuse],
    however, the solution is presented in the context of Trust Domains.</p>"
