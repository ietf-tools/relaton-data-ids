abstract:
- content: <p>This document introduces a method for transporting PTP messages over
    an MPLS network supported by an Ethernet physical layer. The MPLS layer itself
    is not used to carry the PTP messages with this method; instead, a link local
    Ethernet channel is used. Several advantages related to this method are highlighted
    in this document. The method targets in particular telecom applications requiring
    accurate phase/time synchronization, with "link-by-link" PTP architectures, where
    all the network nodes support a PTP function, such as Boundary Clock or Transparent
    Clock.</p>
