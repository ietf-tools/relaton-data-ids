abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-time communication,
    and live media streaming, use a significant amount of Internet resources. Such
    applications often transfer large amounts of data in direct peer-to-peer connections.
    However, they usually have little knowledge of the underlying network topology.
    As a result, they may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics
    that, in many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices. This document describes
    problems related to optimizing traffic generated by peer-to-peer applications
    and associated issues such optimizations raise in the use of network-layer information.</p>"
