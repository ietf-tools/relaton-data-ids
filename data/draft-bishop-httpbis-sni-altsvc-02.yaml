abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP Alternative Services provides a mechanism for an origin to declare
    that its content is accessible via some other combination of host, port, and protocol.
    In the process of using such an alternative, an observer can identify that the
    client is requesting resources from a particular hostname. This document extends
    HTTP Alternative Services, in combination with Secondary Certificate Authentication,
    to enable clients not to disclose the origin to which they intend to connect.</p>"
