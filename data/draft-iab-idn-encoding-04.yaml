abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores issues with Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
    that result from the use of various encoding schemes such as UTF-8 and the ASCII-Compatible
    Encoding produced by the Punycode algorithm. It focuses on the importance of agreeing
    on a single encoding and how complicated the state of affairs ends up being as
    a result of using different encodings today.</p>"
