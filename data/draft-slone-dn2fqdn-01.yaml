abstract:
- content: "<p>A Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) request must be directed
    to an appropriate server for processing. This document specifies an extension
    to the Domain Name System (DNS) and specifies a method for discovering such servers
    using information in DNS. This document complements and enhances previously specified
    methods of locating an appropriate server in that it works for distinguished names
    constructed with or without the 'dc' attribute type. The DNS extension is specified
    as an AVA Resource Record. The method of discovering servers queries DNS for AVA
    records to resolve a DN to a fully qualified domain name, then queries DNS for
    SRV records to complete the location process.</p>"
