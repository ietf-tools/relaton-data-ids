abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the inclusion of the Network Access Identifier (NAIs) into the
    mobile ip fabric, home agents have had a way to identify mobile nodes which do
    not have home IP addresses. After authenticating the registration request from
    such a mobile node, the home agent is then expected to assign a home addresses
    to the mobile node in the registration reply to be used on a semi-permanent basis.
    Unfortunately, no specific mechanism has yet been proposed. Ideally, as DHCP centralizes
    address management, a home agent should contact a DHCP server to allocate an address
    for the mobile node, thereby preserving DHCP as the central address maintainer.
    The technology does exist for a Home Agent to use DHCP controlled addresses, namely
    for the Home Agent to behave as a DHCP proxy agent.</p>"
