abstract:
- content: <p>In dense topologies, such as data center fabrics based on the Clos and
    butterfly fabric topologies, flooding mechanisms designed for sparse topologies,
    when used in these dense topologies, can "overflood," or carry too many copies
    of topology and reachability to fabric devices. This results in slower convergence
    times and higher resource utilization. The modifications to the flooding mechanism
    in the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) link state protocol
    described in this document reduce resource utilization to a minimum, while increaseing
    convergence performance in dense topologies. Note that a Clos fabric is used as
    the primary example of a desne flooding topology throughout this document. However,
    the flooding optimizations described in this document apply to any dense topology.</p>
