abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a persistent
    transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint. While the Synchronization Source
    (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may change if a collision is detected or
    when the RTP application is restarted, its RTCP CNAME is meant to stay unchanged,
    so that RTP endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP
    media streams. For proper functionality, RTCP CNAMEs should be unique within the
    participants of an RTP session. However, the existing guidelines for choosing
    the RTCP CNAME provided in the RTP standard are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness.
    RFC 6222 was published to update those guidelines to allow endpoints to choose
    unique RTCP CNAMEs. Unfortunately, later investigations showed that some parts
    of the new algorithms were unnecessarily complicated and/or ineffective. This
    document specifies a replacement for those parts.</p>"
