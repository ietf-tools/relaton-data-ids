abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes in detail the WCOR ("Welcomed Correspondence",
    or WCor/WC for short) extension to ESMTP. "Welcomed Correspondence" is explained
    in detail in Internet-Draft draft-szego-wcor-overview-00.txt [WCor-Overview].
    This extension is based on the standard SMTP "Service Extensions" described in
    RFC 1869 [RFC1869]. ESMTP extensions themselves are not formally described here.
    Welcomed Correspondence capabilities are identified by the X-WCOR (while this
    document is in draft state) and eventually the WCOR keyword (when and if accepted
    to standards state) in the ESMTP commands list presented by a compliant ESMTP
    server implementation in response to an EHLO greeting.</p>
