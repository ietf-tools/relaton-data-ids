abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. [Stateful-pcep] specifies
    a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) via PCEP and maintaining of these LSPs at the stateful PCE.
    This document describes the mechanisms for incremental LSP Database (LSP- DB)
    synchronization as well as PCE control of the LSP-DB synchronization process.</p>"
