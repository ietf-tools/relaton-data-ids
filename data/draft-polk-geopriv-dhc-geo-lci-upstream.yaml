abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC 3825 to allow explicitly the transmission
    of DHCP option 123, "Location Configuration Information", from a DHCP client to
    a DHCP server. Transmission of option 123 from a client to a server allows a client
    that knows its location through some other means to communicate that location
    to the DHCP server.</p>
