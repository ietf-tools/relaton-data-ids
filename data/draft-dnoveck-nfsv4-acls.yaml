abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is part of the set of documents intended to update the
    description of NFSv4 Minor Version One as part of the rfc5661bis effort. It describes
    the structure and function of Access Control Lists within all minor versions of
    NFSv4. It describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4 security
    architecture. While the focus of this document is on the role of ACLs in providing
    a more flexible approach to file access authorization than is made available by
    the POSIX-derived authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of
    other security-related functionality is covered as well. Because of the failure
    of previous specifications to provide a satisfactory approach to either of the
    two ACL models for which support was intended, this document will include some
    small protocol extensions to correct protocol defects, as provided for in RFC8178.
    In this document, the relationship among the multiple ACL models supported has
    changed. A core set of functionality, derived from a subset of that provided by
    the now-withdrawn draft POSIX ACLs is presented as the conceptual base of the
    feature set. Two additional sets of features used to provide the functionality
    within the NFSv4 ACL model and the full draft POSIX ACL model are presented as
    OPTIONAL extensions to that core. The current version of the document is intended,
    in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding repairing problems
    with previous specifications of ACL-related features and to enable work to provide
    a greater degree of interoperability than has been available heretofore. The drafts
    provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus
    regarding necessary changes. When the resulting document is eventually published
    as an RFC, it will supersede the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics appearing
    in existing minor version specification documents for NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby
    updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.</p>"
