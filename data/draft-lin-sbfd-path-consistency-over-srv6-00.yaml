abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor paths
    between nodes. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism which is suitable
    for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a large scale network.
    In SRv6, when a headend use S-BFD to monitor the segment list/CPath of SRv6 Policy,
    the forward path of S-BFD packet is indicated by segment list, the reverse path
    of BFD packet is via the shortest path from the reflector back to the initiator
    (headend) as determined by routing. The forward path and reverse path of S-BFD
    packet are likely inconsistent going through different intermediate nodes or links.
    This document describes a method to keep the forward path and reverse path of
    S-BFD consistent when detecting SRv6 Policy.</p>"
