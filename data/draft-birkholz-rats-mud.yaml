abstract:
- content: "<p>Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files and the MUD URI that point
    to them are defined in RFC 8520. This document introduces a new type of MUD file
    to be delivered in conjunction with a MUD file signature and/or to be referenced
    via a MUD URI embedded in an IEEE 802.1AR Secure Device Identifier (DevID). A
    DevID is a device specific pub- key identity document that can be presented to
    other entities, e.g. a network management system. If this entity is also a verifier
    as defined by the IETF Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture, this
    verifier can use the references found in the MUD file specified in this document
    in order to discover appropriate Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM), Endorsement
    Documents, or even globally suitable Remote Attestation Services (RAS). All three
    types of theses resources are required to conduct RATS. Hence, the MUD file defined
    in this document enables remote attestation procedures by supporting the discovery
    of these required resources or services.</p>"
