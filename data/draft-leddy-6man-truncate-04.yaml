abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines IPv6 packet truncation procedures. When an IPv6
    source node originates a packet, it can mark the packet as being eligible for
    truncation and forward it towards its destination. If an intermediate node cannot
    forward the packet because of an MTU issue, it truncates the packet, marks it
    as being truncated, and, again, forwards it towards its destination. When the
    destination node receives the packet, it detects that it has been truncated and
    sends an ICMP message to the source node. The ICMP message contains MTU information
    that the source node uses to update its Path MTU estimate. The above-mentioned
    procedures enhance Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) by eliminating its reliance on the
    network's ability to deliver ICMP messages from an intermediate node to the source
    node. However, the above-mentioned procedures require the network to deliver ICMP
    messages from the destination node to the source node.</p>"
