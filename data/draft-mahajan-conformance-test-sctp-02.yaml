abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the conformance test specification for SCTP
    prototcol (ver 07), which can be used to test SCTP implementations for conformance
    to the protocol definition. The list of test is exhaustive and covers almost all
    the categories of test, except few (test for timer calculation and congestion)
    which will be added in the next revision of the draft. This draft can also be
    used in conjunction with SCTP specification by implementor of protocol as implementors
    guide, as the pictorial representation of various scenarios help understand the
    protocol. Next revision of the draft will also cover the additions done to the
    protocol revision SCTP-09 and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.</p>"
