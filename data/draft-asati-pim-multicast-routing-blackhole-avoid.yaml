abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism to avoid blackholing of IP Multicast
    traffic due to the disruption of multicast tree during the time when the RPF neighbor
    is yet to become the PIM neighbor. Such scenario is possible during the topology
    change (e.g. link UP) in an IP network that employs PIM-SM (or SSM) as the multicast
    routing protocol and a unicast routing protocol (including static routing). Conventions
    used in this document In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client
    and server respectively. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].</p>
