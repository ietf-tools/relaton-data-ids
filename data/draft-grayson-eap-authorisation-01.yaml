abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    mechanism for authorization information exchange. EAP TLV is a Container type
    for EAP messages. This mechanism describes an EAP TLV for exchange of authorization
    related information which can take place within the EAP framework and allows an
    authentic user to provide the network with additional information in order to
    determine which Internet Service is being requested. This mechanism may be chained
    after any EAP-Authentication mechanism.</p>"
