abstract:
- content: "<p>When NAT is used in address resource restricted environment, or when
    a lot of users are located under a NAT device, IP address and port resources may
    be eaten up, and it brings severe bad effects on user experiences. This situation
    can be greatly mitigated by tweaking mapping behavior and session timer handling
    at NAT function. This document proposes to NAT IP address and port resource optimizing
    extension for address resource restricted environment. One extension is to enable
    simultaneous use of a port for different transport sessions, and the other is
    to make use of TCP timestamp for TIME_WAIT Assassination.</p>"
