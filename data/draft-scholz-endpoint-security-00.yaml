abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP endpoints are subject to unwanted communication often perceived
    as Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT). This document describes caveats on various
    layers which can be abused to send unsolicited messages. As a result users receive
    a degraded experience. The issues found are based on case studies of various events
    seen in VoIP provider networks.</p>"
