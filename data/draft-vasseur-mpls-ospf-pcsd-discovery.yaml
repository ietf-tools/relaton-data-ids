abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE to support a new message
    type called a 'Path computation' message. This message is to be used between an
    LSR and a Path Computation Server, which may be an LSR or a centralized path computation
    tool. An RSVP Path Computation Request message is used by the head-end LSR to
    send its request to the Path Computation Server. The Path Computation Server in
    turn sends an RSVP Path Computation Reply message containing either: - a positive
    reply, containing one or more paths, if the request can be satisfied. - a negative
    reply if no path obeying the requested constraints can be found. The Path Computation
    Server may also optionally suggest new constraint values for which one or several
    paths could be found. There are many situations where a Path Computation Server
    may be used. A typical example is in the context of Inter-area MPLS TE. A head-end
    LSR could request that a Path Computation Server compute one or more paths obeying
    a specified set of constraints for a TE LSP spanning multiple areas. The path
    computation server could be a centralized path computation server or an ABR. Another
    example is the use of a Path Computation Server to compute diversely routed paths
    between two end points. This may be useful in the context of MPLS TE LSP Path
    protection or GMPLS LSP Path protection. The computation of Multi-constraints
    paths requires intensive CPU resources, and may be yet another usage example.
    Lastly, those protocol extensions could be used as a 'UNI' like protocol between
    a CE (Customer Edge equipment) and a PE (Provider Edge equipment) where the CE
    is not part of the PE's IGP domain.</p>"
