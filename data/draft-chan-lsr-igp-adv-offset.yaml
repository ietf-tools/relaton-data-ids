abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the IGP extensions to provide predictable Adjacency-SIDs
    per Flex-Algorithm [FLEXALGO] in segment routing. We propose some methods to allow
    the advertisement of additional TLV in IGP so that the Flex-Algorithm specific
    Adjacency-SIDs could be automatically derived. With the proposed method, the size
    of advertisement on per node per link basis is greatly reduced. Each participating
    router would derive the required labels automatically. Extensions for offset to
    derive Flex-Algorithm Prefix-SID is also included in the document.</p>"
