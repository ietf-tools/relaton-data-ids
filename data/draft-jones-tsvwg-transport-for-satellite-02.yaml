abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP and QUIC are designed to
    function correctly over any network path. This includes networks paths that utilise
    a satellite link or network. While transport protocols function, the characteristics
    of satellite networks can impact performance when using the defaults in standard
    mechanisms, due to the specific characteristics of these paths. [RFC2488] and
    [RFC3135] describe mechanisms that enable TCP to more effectively utilize the
    available capacity of a network path that includes a satellite system. Since publication,
    both application and transport layers and satellite systems have evolved. Indeed,
    the development of encrypted protocols such as QUIC challenges currently deployed
    solutions, for satellite systems the capacity has increased and commercial systems
    are now available that use a range of satellite orbital positions. This document
    follows the terminology proposed in [I-D.irtf-panrg-path-properties] to describe
    the current characterises of common satellite paths. This document also describes
    considerations when implementing and deploying reliable transport protocols that
    are intended to work efficiently over paths that include a satellite system. It
    discusses available network mitigations and offers advice to designers of protocols
    and operators of satellite networks.</p>"
