abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft is written in response to the SPIRITS WG chairs'
    call for contributions to the future RFC on the SPIRITS protocol requirements.
    The goal of this document is to introduce the requirements pertinent to Intelligent
    Network (IN) and the (future) work of PSTN/Internet iNTernetworking (PINT) WG.
    To this end, the SPIRITS architecture has been slightly augmented to demonstrate
    the relation of PINT to SPIRITS as discussed at the Adelaide meeting.</p>"
