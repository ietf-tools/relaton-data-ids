abstract:
- content: "<p>The IQUERY method of performing inverse DNS lookups, specified in RFC
    1035, has not been generally implemented and has usually been operationally disabled
    where it has been implemented. Both reflect a general view in the community that
    the concept was unwise and that the widely-used alternate approach of using pointer
    (PTR) queries and reverse-mapping records is preferable. Consequently, this document
    deprecates the IQUERY operation, declaring it entirely obsolete. This document
    updates RFC 1035. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
