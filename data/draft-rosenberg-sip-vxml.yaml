abstract:
- content: "<p>VoiceXML is an XML based scripting language for describing voice dialogs.
    VoiceXML interpreters run within an interpreter context that, among other tasks,
    provides a call control interface for accessing the interpreter. It is very natural
    to provide a VoIP-based interpreter context that uses SIP and RTP to communicate
    with the outside world. In this document, we provide detailed specifications for
    a SIP/RTP based interpreter context.</p>"
