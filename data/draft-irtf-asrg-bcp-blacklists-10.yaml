abstract:
- content: "<p>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has
    led to the creation of shared DNS-based lists (DNSBLs) of IP addresses or domain
    names intended to help guide email filtering. This memo summarizes guidelines
    of accepted best practice for the management of public DNSBLs by their operators
    as well as for the proper use of such lists by mail server administrators (DNSBL
    users), and it provides useful background for both parties. It is not intended
    to advise on the utility or efficacy of particular DNSBLs or the DNSBL concept
    in general, nor to assist end users with questions about spam. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
