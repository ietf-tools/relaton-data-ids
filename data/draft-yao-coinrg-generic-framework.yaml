abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been a lot of academic research and industrial practice
    in the area of COIN, but most of them are case-by-case design and currently they
    also rely heavily on programmable network devices, which lacks some generality
    and scalability, thus will impede the development of COIN. This document summarizes
    the computing primitives/operations/semantics that can be implemented inside the
    network, through analysis of different COIN use cases, and proposes a generic
    framework of COIN in the controlled environments. Enabling technologies related
    to the framework and the standardization landscape are also analyzed in the document.</p>"
