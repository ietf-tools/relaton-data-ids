abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many situations where organizations want to protect information
    with robust access control, either for implementation of intellectual property
    right protections, enforcement of information contractual confidentiality agreements
    or because of externally imposed legal regulations. The Enhanced Security Services
    (ESS) for S/MIME defines an access control mechanism which is enforced by the
    recipients client after decryption of the message. The ESS mechanism therefore
    is dependent on the correct access policy configuration of every recipients client.
    This mechanism also provides full access to the data to all recipients prior to
    the access control check which is considered to be inadequate for due to the difficulty
    in demonstrating policy compliance. This document lays out the deficiencies of
    the current ESS security label, and presents requirements for new model for doing
    access control to messages where the access check is performed prior to message
    content decryption. This new model also does not require policy configuration
    on the client to simplify deployment and compliance verification. The proposed
    model additionally provides a method where non-X.509 certificate credentials can
    be used for encryption/decryption of S/MIME messages.</p>"
