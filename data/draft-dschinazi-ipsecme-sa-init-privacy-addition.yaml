abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) provides strong
    security and privacy properties to both endpoints once they have authenticated
    each other. However, before an endpoint has validated the peer's AUTH payload,
    it could be divulging information to an untrusted host. An example of such information
    is the Identification payload of the initiator. Another example is the fact that
    a host is running an IKEv2 responder. This document introduces a new "Initialization
    Authentication Code" notify payload that can be included in IKE_SA_INIT messages
    to increase their trustworthiness. This new protection is meant to be used in
    addition to current IKEv2 mechanisms and is not meant to replace the AUTH payload
    in any way.</p>
