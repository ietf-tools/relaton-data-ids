abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies one type of the denial of service attack which
    can be possible in Mobile IP6 and tries to propose a solution for same. Currently
    in MIP6 each Home Agent is required to maintain a home agent list. This home agent
    list is generated by receiving RA messages on the home link and the addresses
    learned are sent to Mobile node when it does Home Agent discovery. On learning
    this list MN tries to register with addresses in this list one by one in order
    of preference. Now if the home network is flooded with spurious RA packets having
    high preference value the home agent list is populated with non reachable addresses
    and no mobile node is able to register from that home network This document proposes
    to first carry out reachability confirmation for each home agent entry before
    adding to Home Agent list</p>"
