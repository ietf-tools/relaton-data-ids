abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF may form multiple equal cost paths between points. This is true
    of any link state protocol. In the absense of any explicit support to take advantage
    of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Tech- niques have been utilized to
    divide traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have
    been referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic
    among the available paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowledge
    of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize the
    allocation of traffic. Optimized Mulitpath is a compatible extension to OSPF,
    utilizing the Opaque LSA to distribute loading information, proposing a means
    to adjust forwarding, and providing an algorithm to make the adjustments gradually
    enough to insure stability yet provide reasonably fast ad- justment when needed.</p>"
