- content: <p>This document describes an extensible mechanism that allows a BGP speaker
    to advertise multiple BGP paths for a destination to its peers, by describing
    a new BGP capability, termed "Multiple-Hop Capability". The mechanisms described
    in this document are applicable to all routers, both those with the ability to
    inject multiple routing entries in their forwarding table and those without.</p>
