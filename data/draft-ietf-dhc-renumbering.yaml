abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method for improving the ability of the Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to assist in renumbering an internet. DHCP
    is already capable of supporting host renumbering by assigning a new address when
    a client attempts to renegotiate an existing lease, but this proposal makes host
    renumbering more graceful by providing for a transition period in which the client
    can use both addresses.</p>"
