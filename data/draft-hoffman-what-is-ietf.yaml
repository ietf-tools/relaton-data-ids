abstract:
- content: <p>This document gives a more concrete definition of "the IETF" as it understood
    today. Many RFCs refer to "the IETF". Many important IETF documents speak of the
    IETF as if it were an already-defined entity. However, no IETF document correctly
    defines what the IETF is. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
