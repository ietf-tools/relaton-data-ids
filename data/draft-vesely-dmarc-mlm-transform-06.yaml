abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
    and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header
    field as a workaround. This document proposes two methods to restore the original
    From: value of transformed messages, to be effected by the receiving Message Delivery
    Agent (rMDA). One method requires receivers to identify a set of trusted MLM operators
    who set the Author: header field. The other method tries to revert MLM transformations
    in order to verify DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signatures that were applied
    by the author domain at submission time.</p>"
