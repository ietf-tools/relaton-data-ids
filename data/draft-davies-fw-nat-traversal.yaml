abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a method that enables real-time session-oriented protocols,
    such as SIP, H.323, Megaco/H.248 and MGCP, to traverse through enterprise and
    residential firewalls and NATs. The method requires no protocol awareness in the
    firewall or NAT device and it is transparent to the endpoint. The method benefits
    from being protocol agnostic - one method may be used for all protocols. Profiles
    for SIP are presented here as examples.</p>"
