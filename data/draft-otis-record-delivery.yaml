abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is to allow record based equipment a common record offload
    layer suitable for other protocols. As all storage protocols anticipate hardware
    acceleration, it becomes incumbent to provide this hardware a generic structure
    that can be applied to many protocols and yet allow an unencumbered feature set.
    The structures defined for SCTP [RFC2960] were developed to provide record based
    solutions and are well suited for this common record offload layer. This document
    will assume either direct use of SCTP, a modified SCTP common header used as a
    TCP option, or this modified SCTP common header placed within the TCP byte stream.
    SCTP conventions will be used to enable enhanced features such as connection recovery
    in lieu of other techniques. The sequential handling of delineated records is
    done in accordance with SCTP.</p>"
