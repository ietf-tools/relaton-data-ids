abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS-SD Sleep Proxy Service uses a message format identical to that
    used by standard DNS Update, with two additional pieces of information: the identity
    of the sleeping server to which the records belong, and the Wake-on-LAN Magic
    Packet bit pattern which should be used to wake the sleeping server. This document
    specifies the EDNS0 option used to carry that additional information.</p>"
