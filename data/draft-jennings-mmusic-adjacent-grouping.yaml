abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications such as multi-screen video conferencing systems or advertisement
    boards often have multiple audio and video streams that are organized to be rendered
    side by side or in a grid. This specification uses the RFC 5888 Grouping Framework
    to define new semantics for grouping the media streams to be rendered side by
    side or in a grid and indicating their relative ordering.</p>"
