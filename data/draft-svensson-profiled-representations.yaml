abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details approaches for enriching HTTP interactions with
    information pertaining to the profiles to which resource representations conform.
    It surveys approaches that were recently introduced to indicate the profile of
    a resource representation, and to make representations that conform to a profile
    discoverable. It introduces a generally applicable approach to negotiate for a
    resource representation that conforms to a profile preferred by a user agent.
    That approach leverages the existing content negotiation mechanism but applies
    it to the profile dimension to which it was previously not applied. The document
    also shows how a server can convey which profiled representations it is able to
    accept from a user agent.</p>"
