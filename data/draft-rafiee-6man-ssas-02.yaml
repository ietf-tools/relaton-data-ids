abstract:
- content: "<p>The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an Organizationally
    Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE Standards Association and an Extension
    Identifier assigned to the hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291)
    [RFC4291]. This means that a node will always have the same Interface ID (IID)
    whenever it connects to a new network. Since the node's IP address does not change,
    the node is vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address this problem there
    are currently two mechanisms being used to randomize the IID that do not use the
    MAC address or other unique values in the IID generation; Cryptographically Generated
    Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the
    former approach is the computational cost involved for the IID generation and
    verification. The problem with the latter approach is that it lacks the necessary
    security and provides the node with only partial protection against privacy related
    attacks. This document proposes the use of a new algorithm for use in the generation
    of the IID while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of attack,
    like IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented with the addition of a signature
    to the messages sent over the network and by direct use of a public key in the
    IP address.</p>"
