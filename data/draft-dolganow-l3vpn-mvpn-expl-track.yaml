abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 6513 and RFC 6514 define encoding and procedures for multicast MPLS/BGP
    IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). As defined in these RFCs, in some cases when
    BGP is used to exchange C-multicast routes, a need may exist to explicitly track
    PEs joining the same C- multicast-tree. The RFCs define encoding and procedures
    for explicit tracking using "PMSI Tunnel attribute" and "Leaf A-D route"; however,
    the procedures are missing details and clarity. RFC 6625 defines encodings and
    procedures for wildcards in multicast MPLS/BGP IP VPNs. The RFC does not cover
    explicit tracking for wildcard multicast streams. This documents updates RFC 6514
    and 6625 with procedures required to achieve explicit PE tracking for (C-S, C-G)
    and wildcard multicast streams.</p>
