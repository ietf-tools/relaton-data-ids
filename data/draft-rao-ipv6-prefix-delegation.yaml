abstract:
- content: "<p>The currently proposed solution for IPv6 Prefix Delegation is based
    on DHCPv6 protocol. We believe that in certain network topologies and configurations
    where the CPE routers may not be capable or configured to use DHCPv6 and hence
    can not utilize the currently proposed DHCPv6 based ipv6 prefix delegation procedure.
    Therefore an alternate ipv6 prefix delegation procedure that does not require
    or depend on the DHCPv6 protocol is needed. This document proposes an ICMPv6 based
    prefix delegation (PD) mechanism which is in conformance with RFC 3769 that describes
    the requirements for IPv6 prefix delegation. This proposal involves using the
    Router Solicitation (RS) message for the prefix request and the Router Advertisement(RA)
    message for the prefix delegation. A new flag called P-flag (bit 0 of the reserved
    field) is defined to indicate that the RS message includes a PD request. RS messages
    with PD request can now include PIO option(s) to carry PD information such as
    prefix preference(s) or PD parameters such as lease etc. It also proposes defining
    a new flag called D-flag (reserved bit 26) of the PIO option to indicate the presence
    of PD specific PIO in RS and RA messages.</p>"
