abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for combining a traditional MLS
    session with a post-quantum (PQ) MLS session to achieve flexible and efficient
    hybrid post-quantum security. Specifically, we describe how to use the exporter
    secret of a PQ MLS session, i.e. an MLS session using a PQ ciphersuite, to seed
    PQ guarantees into an MLS session using a traditional ciphersuite. By supporting
    on-demand traditional-only key updates (a.k.a. PARTIAL updates) or hybrid-PQ key
    updates (a.k.a. FULL updates), we can reduce the bandwidth and computational overhead
    associated with meeting the requirement of frequent key rotations while still
    providing PQ security.</p>"
