abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the current status and work plans for the ENUM
    Forum and its Task Groups as an informational document to detail additional resources
    available and avoid overlap and duplication of efforts in the area of ENUM. The
    primary mission of the ENUM Forum is to develop the implementation framework for
    deploying RFC 2916 in a two-tiered DNS structure rooted under “e164.arpa” for
    E.164 numbers within the United States and a potential common implementation with
    other countries served by the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).</p>"
