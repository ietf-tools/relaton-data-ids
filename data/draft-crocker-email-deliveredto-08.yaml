abstract:
- content: <p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields, created by the email's
    author. For example, the address used by the email transport service is provided
    separately, such as through SMTP's "RCPT TO" command. Before final delivery, handling
    can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using different destination
    addresses that lead to the recipient. Also, a receiving system's delivery process
    can produce local address transformations. It can be helpful for a message to
    have a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to include each
    address used for that recipient, such as for analyzing the path a message has
    taken, for loop detection, or for formulating the author's address in a reply
    message. This document defines a header field for this information. Email handling
    information discloses details about the email infrastructure, as well as about
    a particular recipient; this can raise possible privacy concerns. A header field
    such as this is not automatically assured of widespread use. Therefore this is
    being published as an Experiment, looking for constituency and for operational
    utility. The document is produced through the Independent RFC stream and was not
    subject to the IETF's approval process.</p>
