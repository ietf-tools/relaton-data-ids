abstract:
- content: <p>JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON-
    based format for describing the structure of JSON data. JSON Schema asserts what
    a JSON document must look like, ways to extract information from it, and how to
    interact with it. The "application/ schema-instance+json" media type provides
    additional feature-rich integration with "application/schema+json" beyond what
    can be offered for "application/json" documents.</p>
