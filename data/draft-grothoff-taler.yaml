abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 'taler' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    scheme for triggering interactions with a GNU Taler wallet. This URI scheme allows
    applications to trigger interactions with the GNU Taler wallet, such as withdrawing
    money, making payments, receiving refunds and restoring a wallet from a backup.
    Applications may receive such URIs in many ways (including via NFC, QR codes,
    Web links or messaging applications), or might generate them internally to interact
    with a wallet. By having a Taler wallet handle the respective URIs, applications
    can integrate Taler payments without having to support the Taler protocol directly.
    Furthermore, by passing control to a Taler wallet process, the wallet's database
    with its financial data might be better protected from application failures.</p>"
