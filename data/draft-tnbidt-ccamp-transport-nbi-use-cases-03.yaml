abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network (OTN)
    and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically deployed based
    on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are often managed using proprietary
    interfaces to dedicated Element Management Systems (EMS), Network Management Systems
    (NMS) and increasingly Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers. A well-defined
    open interface to each domain management system or controller is required for
    network operators to facilitate control automation and orchestrate end-to-end
    services across multi-domain networks. These functions may be enabled using standardized
    data models (e.g. YANG), and appropriate protocol (e.g., RESTCONF). This document
    describes the key use cases and requirements for transport network control and
    management. It reviews proposed and existing IETF transport network data models,
    their applicability, and highlights gaps and requirements.</p>"
