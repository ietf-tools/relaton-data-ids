abstract:
- content: <p>Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, RFC 8995) is
    an automated bootstrap protocol for unconfigured devices called "pledges". Existing
    enrollment protocols in BRSKI are all based on certificates, which are not suitable
    for constrained IoT devices. This document defines a certificateless enrollment
    protocol in BRSKI (BRSKI-CLE) for constrained IoT devices. To achieve a lightweight
    protocol, a credential based on public keys is designed to replace the domain
    certificate used in BRSKI. An authentication centre (AC) replaced the certification
    authority (CA) is used to issue the credential to the pledge. A new mutual authentication
    protocol is also designed to authenticate using the credentials.</p>
