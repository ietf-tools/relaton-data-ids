abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 4034 allocates one value in the IANA registry for DNSSEC algorithm
    numbers for private algorithms. That may be too few for experimentation where
    multiple yet-to-be-assigned algorithms are used. This document assigns seven more
    values for this use case. This document is currently maintained at https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-hoffman-more-private-algs.
    Issues and pull requests are welcomed. If the document is later adopted by a working
    group, a new repository will likely be created.</p>"
