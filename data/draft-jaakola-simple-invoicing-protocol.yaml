abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a protocol for transferring invoices automatically
    between companies. The receiver can read invoice data automatically into accounts
    payables and possibly into approval work flow. This eliminates the costly and
    error-prone manual typing of invoice data. Main design goal was simplicity in
    order to make implementation easy. The parties involved identify themselves using
    e-mail addresses, which makes addressing simple and flexible.</p>"
