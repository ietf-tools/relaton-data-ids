abstract:
- content: '<p>The distributed security framework document describes an approach where
    hosts take greater responsibility for protecting against attacks on security vulnerabilities
    targeted at themselves. This memo analyzes the threat model of the distributed
    security approach, in particular pointing out areas which the mechanism cannot
    protect against. XXX: generic comment from JariA: "The main issue that I could
    see is that its still rather simple presentation of the issues, e.g. does not
    necessarily go as deep as some other ongoing work goes." XXX: generic comment
    from EKR: "I found the organization rather confusing. It seems to me like a lot
    of the material in the framework document would make more sense in the threat
    model. Without that context, it''s fairly hard to understand what you''re trying
    to accomplish." (Similar comment from others: addressing this would require significant(?)
    text duplication from the framework doc..)</p>'
