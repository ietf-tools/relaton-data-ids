abstract:
- content: "<p>Some applications use DNS messages, or parts of DNS messages, as data.
    For example, a system that captures DNS queries and responses might want to be
    able to easily search them without having to decode the messages each time. Another
    example is a system that puts together DNS queries and responses from message
    parts. This document describes a general format for DNS message data in JSON.
    Specific profiles of the format in this document can be described in other documents
    for specific applications and usage scenarios.</p>"
