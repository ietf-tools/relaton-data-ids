abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a means of multiplexing RTP streams having
    different media types within a single transport connection and how to represent
    this multiplexing option in SDP. This mechanism is an alternative to the BUNDLE
    and SHIM proposals currently under active consideration in AVTCORE. Instead of
    adding an extra multiplexing header as in SHIM to allow multiple RTP sessions
    within a single transport connection, or using the payload type field to separate
    different media streams within a single RTP session, this document describes how
    to partition the existing SSRC space to create RTP subsessions from a single RTP
    session. A filter can be used to identify each RTP subsession for different QoS
    handling as necessary. RTP subsessions can be treated like RTP sessions with a
    few restrictions. In particular, SSRC mapping may be needed when forwarding RTP
    streams into an RTP subsession to avoid SSRC conflicts, but there are few use
    cases in which this limitation is a concern and RTP subsessions can be disabled
    if necessary.</p>"
