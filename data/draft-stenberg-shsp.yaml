abstract:
- content: "<p>In reasonable home networks there are no cloud services; just a set
    of local nodes sharing state, and possibly invoking operations either automatically
    or on behalf of the home user. This document describes a key-value database that
    can be used to do both; published key=values represent the current state of the
    system, and by setting a key published by some other node to a different value
    a node can indicate the desire for changing of state.</p>"
