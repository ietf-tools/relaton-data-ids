abstract:
- content: <p>This memo updates the definition of the Sieve mail filtering language
    "reject" extension, originally defined in RFC 3028. A "Joe-job" is a spam run
    forged to appear as though it came from an innocent party, who is then generally
    flooded by automated bounces, Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs), and personal
    messages with complaints. The original Sieve "reject" action defined in RFC 3028
    required use of MDNs for rejecting messages, thus contributing to the flood of
    Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs. This memo updates the definition of the "reject"
    action to allow messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction, and defines
    the "ereject" action to require messages to be refused during the SMTP transaction,
    if possible. The "ereject" action is intended to replace the "reject" action wherever
    possible. The "ereject" action is similar to "reject", but will always favor protocol-level
    message rejection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
