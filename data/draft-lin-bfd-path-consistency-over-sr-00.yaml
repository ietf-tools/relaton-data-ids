abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor paths
    between nodes. U-BFD defined in [I-D.ietf-bfd-unaffiliated-echo] can effectively
    reduce the device equipment. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism
    which is suitable for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a
    large scale network. In SR network, BFD can also be used to monitor SR paths.
    When a headend use BFD to monitor the segment list/CPath of SR Policy, the forward
    path of control packet is indicated by segment list, the reverse path of response
    control packet is via the shortest path from the reflector back to the initiator
    (headend) as determined by routing. The forward path and reverse path of control
    packet are likely inconsistent going through different intermediate nodes or links.
    This document describes a method to keep the forward path and reverse path consistent
    when using S-BFD or U-BFD to detect SR Policy</p>"
