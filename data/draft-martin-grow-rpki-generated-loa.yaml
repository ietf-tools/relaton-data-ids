abstract:
- content: "<p>Letters of Agency (LOA) are commonly used to authorise network providers
    to accept and propagate routing information received from others. The Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) can be used to perform a similar function, with
    the advantage that RPKI-signed objects can be validated automatically and in a
    more robust manner than manual processing of documents. However, some network
    operators have established processes that expect and require LOAs to be exchanged,
    despite their limitations. This document proposes a format for constructing a
    LOA in the case where RPKI validation is available, with the goal of enabling
    a transition to a future where LOAs are no longer needed.</p>"
