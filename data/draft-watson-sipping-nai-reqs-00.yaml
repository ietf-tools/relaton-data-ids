abstract:
- content: "<p>There is no requirement for identities identities asserted by a UA
    in a SIP message to be anything other than the userâ€™s desired alias. An authenticated
    identity of a user can be obtained using SIP authentication, however it is unlikely
    that the necessary Public Key Infrastructure to facilitate this for UAs will be
    available soon. A Network Asserted Identity is an identity obtained by a SIP network
    intermediary as a result of an authentication process. This draft describes short
    term requirements for the exchange of Network Asserted Identities within networks
    of securely interconnected trusted nodes and to User Agents securely connected
    to such networks. General requirements for transport of Network Asserted Identities
    on the Internet are out of scope of this draft.</p>"
