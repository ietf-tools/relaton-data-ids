abstract:
- content: <p>Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet
    infrastructure to access data by unique names. ROID ("Resolver for OIDs") is an
    experimental protocol to support simple implementation of ICN. ROID defines a
    simple model for mapping data names -- in the form of URNs of the "oid" scheme
    -- into URLs which can be used to access the data objects. This experimental version
    of ROID provides the resolution information via DNS records that can be served
    by a standard DNS server (named a/k/a Bind). This structure is designed for easy
    deployment of ROID in existing environments in order to support proof-of-concept
    implementations of ICN.</p>
