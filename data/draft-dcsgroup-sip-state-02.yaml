abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) that enables proxies to distribute call state to user agents. The state
    information can be returned to the proxy when the user agent requests a change
    in the characteristics of the active call. By providing the ability to distribute
    state to the user agents where it can be securely stored, proxy servers can remain
    stateless for the duration of the call. This mechanism allows a proxy server to
    provide services that depend on call state, while still being stateless.</p>"
