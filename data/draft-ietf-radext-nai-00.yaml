abstract:
- content: <p>In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a standardized
    method for identifying users. This document defines the syntax for the Network
    Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the client during network
    authentication. "Roaming" may be loosely defined as the ability to use any one
    of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor
    relationship with only one. Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required
    include ISP "confederations" and ISP-provided corporate network access support.
    This document is a revised version of RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues
    with international character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to
    the previous document.</p>
