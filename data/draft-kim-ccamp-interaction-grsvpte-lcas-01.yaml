abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes interaction aspects between a signaling protocol
    and the LCAS. The signaling protocol handled by IETF could be GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS
    CR-LDP requires further study for this draft. The LCAS protocol handled by ITU-T
    is a protocol that is used to change the bandwidth capacity of a virtual concatenated
    signal used by transport networks (i.e. SDH and OTN), which should be initiated
    only in a unidirection by EMS or NMS systems. However, the GMPLS signaling protocol
    have a feature of being capable of controlling bi- directional connections on
    a LSP. In current, there is no interaction between the signaling protocol and
    the LCAS. In this document, when a signaling protocol such as the GMPLS RSVP-TE
    and the LCAS are used together within a single node and a bi-directional connection
    is required on the same route, relevant requirements and encoding methods are
    identified.</p>"
