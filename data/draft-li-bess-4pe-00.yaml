abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains how to interconnect IPv4 islands over a Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv6 cloud. This approach relies on IPv4 Provider
    Edge routers (4PE), which are Dual Stack in order to connect to IPv4 islands and
    to the MPLS core, which is only required to run IPv6 MPLS. The 4PE routers exchange
    the IPv4 reachability information transparently over the core using the Multiprotocol
    Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv6. In doing so, the BGP Next Hop field
    is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 4PE router, a field is added in Network
    Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) to convey the IPv6 address of the 4PE router,
    so that dynamically established IPv6-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    can be used without explicit tunnel configuration.</p>"
