abstract:
- content: "<p>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is widely used to provide clients
    with delegated access to user data. However, the core specification leaves the
    definition of access scopes to individual service providers. This has led to a
    fragmented ecosystem for common groupware services (Mail, Calendaring, Contacts),
    where each provider uses proprietary, non-interoperable scope identifiers. Client
    applications, such as desktop mail clients, are forced to hardcode configurations
    for a small number of large providers, stifling innovation and harming open ecosystems.
    This document proposes a framework that combines a minimal set of standardized
    OAuth 2.0 scopes with a detailed structure for use with OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization
    Requests (RAR). This hybrid approach provides a simple baseline for legacy clients
    while enabling powerful, granular, and privacy-preserving authorization for modern
    clients. It defines RAR type values, actions, datatypes, and custom fields for
    specifying fine-grained permissions for groupware resources.</p>"
