abstract:
- content: "<p>Typically an NAV (network-based anti-virus) system stores the entire
    HTTP response from the server, scan the response for malware and then transmits
    it to the client. This extension attempts to better response time for Web traffic
    by letting the NAV (network-based anti-virus) system save the time required for
    the NAV system for transmission of data from the NAV system to the client. In
    addition, this extension also helps in reporting download progress and avoiding
    client connection timeout.</p>"
