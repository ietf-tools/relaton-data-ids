abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) extensions and associated
    semantics that allow clients and servers to negotiate the use of M2M certificates
    for a TLS/DTLS session, and specifies how to transport M2M certificates via TLS/DTLS.
    It also defines the registry for non-X.509 certificate types. The X.509 public
    key certificate format is overly verbose for Internet- of-Things (IoT) constrained
    environments, where nodes with limited memory and networks with limited bandwidth
    are not uncommon. The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format is a pruned
    down and encoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which reuses much of the X.509
    semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically 40%.</p>"
