abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Incident Report Format is to facilitate the exchange
    of incident information and statistics among involved parties and responsible
    Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) for reactionary analysis of
    current intruder activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead
    to incident prevention. A common and well defined format will help in retrieving,
    archiving and exchanging Incident Reports across organizations, regions and countries.
    This document describes the requirements for an Incident Report format.</p>"
