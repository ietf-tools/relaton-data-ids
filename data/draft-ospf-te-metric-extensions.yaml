abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g.
    latency) are becoming as critical to data path selection as other metrics. This
    document describes extensions to OSPF TE [RFC3630] such that network performance
    information can be distributed and collected in a scalable fashion. The information
    distributed using OSPF TE Express Path can then be used to make path selection
    decisions based on network performance. Note that this document only covers the
    mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed. The mechanisms
    for measuring network performance or acting on that information, once distributed,
    are outside the scope of this document.</p>"
