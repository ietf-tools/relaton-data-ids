abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a Proactive Approach for Detecting Network Attachment (DNA).
    In the approach, the mobile node caches information about adjacent access points
    and access routers using the Candidate Access Router Protocol and uses the cached
    information to check the new subnet after the mobile node establishes a new air
    link. This enables the mobile node to determine immediately after the new link
    setup whether the mobile node needs to proceed further for new IP configuration
    for the link.</p>"
