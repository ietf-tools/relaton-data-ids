abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft addresses the PPP/SONET interface defined in the
    IETF RFC 1619 and its application in public Internet backbone networks. By experimental
    analysis it is found that this SONET interface specification is deficient in providing
    payload transparency. This deficiency leads to deleterious effects in providing
    reliable network operations. A simple SONET payload scrambler enhancement is proposed
    to overcome this deficiency. This work has been brought to the ANSI T1X1.5 as
    an action item for the addition of the RFC 1619 mapping to T1.105 with a scrambler
    to be determined by T1X1. We are submitting the same proposal to IETF now with
    the interest to enhance RFC-1619 accordingly and achieve alignment with ANSI T1
    standards. To facilitate this alignment, we have recommended that T1X1 establish
    a formal liaison with IETF in regard to IP/SONET interface standards and associated
    IP transmission standards development.</p>"
