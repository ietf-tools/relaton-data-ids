abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols as
    a control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the link layer with network
    layer routing benefits. RBridges may use existing link state routing (without
    requiring configuration) to improve RBridge to RBridge aggregate throughput. RBridges
    also Gray Expires May, 2008 [page 1] Internet-Draft Scaling RBridge Deployments
    November 2007 provide support for IP multicast and IP address resolution optimizations.
    They are intended to be applicable to similar L2 network sizes as conventional
    bridges and are intended to be backward compatible with those bridges as both
    ingress/egress and transit. They also support VLANs (although this generally requires
    configuration) and otherwise attempt to retain as much 'plug and play' as is already
    available in existing bridges. There has been a lot of discussion within the TRILL
    working group about the potential for scaling issues when using IS-IS in combination
    with (possibly as many as 4K) VLANs. This document is intended to provide information
    on potential scaling issues and the possible solutions that may be applied in
    deploying RBridges. Gray Expires May, 2008 [page 2] Internet-Draft Scaling RBridge
