abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a framework for analyzing mobility management
    protocols in terms of their key abstracted logical functions. The framework is
    capable of presenting a unified view, reducing the clutter that obscures a casual
    reader from understanding the commonalities between different approaches in mobility
    management. More importantly, a first order application of this framework allows
    us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6
    and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions), and describe their core functionality
    in terms of different configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.
    As a result, we can use the framework to analyze the gaps between the protocols
    needed in a distributed mobility management environment and the functionality
    provided by the current generation of mobility management protocols. Our analysis
    points to the need for a re-configuration of logical functions identified in the
    framework as well as the need for new extensions which can make distributed mobility
    management possible in the future.</p>"
