abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Prefix Delegation (PD) option used to delegate
    IPv6 address space to simple IPv6 sites. The PD option, which lists the global
    prefixes that a site may use to number its network, is attached to IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery Router Advertisement messages that are sent across a point-to-point
    link from a provider's router to a site's border router. This document defines
    the mechanism by which a site router processes the PD option and configures each
    of its attached links allowing hosts within the site to obtain global addresses
    using address autoconfiguration.</p>"
