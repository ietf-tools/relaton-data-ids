abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes location- and mobility-related services as
    they are enabled by SPIRITS. SPIRITS services originate from certain actions occurring
    in the PSTN (wireline and wireless) and involve interactions with Internet hosts.
    The services described in this document pertain to location- and mobility-related
    events detected by the PSTN and reported to an Internet host which requested them
    for subsequent service execution.</p>"
