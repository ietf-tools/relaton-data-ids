- content: "<p>This document describes the use of references in RFCs and IANA registries.
    It also discusses situations where RFCs are currently required as references in
    IANA registries. This document does not define any new policies, but instead describes
    the many practices that have been used, particularly the practices that are considered
    best current practices today. This document is informative, and thus does not
    require changes to, or prohibit exceptions from, the current practices.</p>"
