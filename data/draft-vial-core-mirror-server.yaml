abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at realizing
    the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture in a suitable form for
    the most constrained nodes. Thanks to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
    REST is now applicable to constrained networks. However the most energy-constrained
    devices may enter sleep mode and disconnect their network link during several
    minutes to save energy, hence preventing them from acting as traditional web servers.
    This document describes how a sleeping device can store resource representations
    in an entity called Mirror Server and participate in a constrained RESTful environment.</p>"
