abstract:
- content: "<p>''Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)'' [1,2,3] requires a set of
    procedures for augmenting network layer packets with ''label stacks'', thereby
    turning them into ''labeled packets'' [4]. Routers which support MPLS are known
    as ''Label Switching Routers'', or ''LSRs''. In order to transmit a labeled packet
    on a particular data link, an LSR must support an encoding technique which, given
    a label stack and a network layer packet, produces a labeled packet. This document
    specifies the encoding to be used by an LSR in order to transmit labeled packets
    on LAN data links.</p>"
