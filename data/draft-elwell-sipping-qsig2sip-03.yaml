abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known
    as enterprise networks). SIP is an Internet application- layer control (signalling)
    protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.
    These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol
    for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched calls, in particular
    telephone calls, within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is
    specified in a number of ECMA Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards.
    As the support of telephony within corporate networks evolves from circuit-switched
    technology to Internet technology, the two technologies will co-exist in many
    networks for a period, perhaps several years. Therefore there is a need to be
    able to establish, modify and terminate sessions involving a participant in the
    SIP network and a participant in the QSIG network. Such calls are supported by
    gateways that perform interworking between SIP and QSIG. This document is a product
    of the authors' activities in ECMA (www.ecma.ch) on interoperability of QSIG with
    IP networks.</p>"
