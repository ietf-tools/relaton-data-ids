abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML protocol
    that exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment data into Session
    Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores. Sending XML data structures
    over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and HTTP(s) is a widely used, de-facto
    standard for messaging between elements of provisioning systems. Therefore the
    combination of SOAP and HTTP(s) as a transport for SPPP is a natural fit. The
    obvious benefits include leveraging existing industry expertise, leveraging existing
    standards, and a higher probability that existing provisioning systems can be
    more easily integrated with this protocol. This document describes the specification
    for transporting SPPP XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).</p>"
