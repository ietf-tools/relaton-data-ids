abstract:
- content: "<p>draft-ietf-bess-evpn-redundant-mcast-source specifies Warm Standby
    (WS) and Hot Standby (HS) procedures for handling redundant multicast traffic
    into an EVPN tenant domain. With the Hot Standby procedure, multiple ingress PEs
    may inject traffic and an egress PE will decide from which ingress PE traffic
    will be accepted and forwarded. The decision is based on certain signaling messages
    and/or BFD status of provider tunnels from the ingress PEs, and the traffic is
    associated with ingress PEs based on Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) labels.
    As a result, the procedures in that document only apply to MPLS data plane. This
    document extends the Hot Standby procedures to non-MPLS data planes and EVPN Data
    Center Interconnect scenarios.</p>"
