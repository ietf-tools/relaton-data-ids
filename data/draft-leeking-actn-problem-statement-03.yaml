abstract:
- content: "<p>Previously transport networks were typically static, lacked flexibility,
    and required long planning times when deploying new services. Network Providers
    and Service Providers have embraced technologies that allow separation of data
    plane and control plane, distributed signaling for path setup and protection,
    and centralized path computation for service planning and traffic engineering.
    Although these technologies provide significant benefits, they do not meet the
    growing need for network programmability, automation, resource sharing, and service
    elasticity necessary for meeting operator's requirement for their virtual network
    operation. Virtual network operation refers to the creation of a virtualized environment
    allowing operators to view the abstraction of the underlying multi-admin, multi-vendor,
    multi- technology networks and to operate, control and manage these multiple networks
    as if a single virtualized network. Another dimension of virtual network operation
    is associated with use of the common core transport network resource by multi-tenant
    service networks as a way of providing a virtualized infrastructure to flexibly
    offer new services and applications. The work effort investigating this problem
    space is known as Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN). This document
    provides an ACTN problem description, scope of work, and outlines the core requirements
    to facilitate virtual network operation.</p>"
