abstract:
- content: "<p>In OSPF and ISIS extensions for support of traffic engineering, sub-
    TLVs with values of link bandwidth are advertised. Currently a bandwidth value
    is denoted by a 4-byte IEEE floating number. This draft proposes a simple way
    to use two octets to represent a bandwidth value used in traffic engineering sub-TLVs</p>"
