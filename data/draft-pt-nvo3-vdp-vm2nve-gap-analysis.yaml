abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.kreeger-nvo3-hypervisor-nve-cp-01] discusses requirements for
    Hypervisor-to-NVE Control Plane Protocol Functionality. The IEEE has developed
    a protocol called VSI Discovery Protocol (VDP) specified in [IEEE8021Qbg]. This
    protocol is intended to address the same basic problems at layer two as the Hypervisor-to-NVE
    protocol needs to address at layer three. Simply by adding the ability to carry
    layer three addresses to VDP using the extensibility features built into the protocol,
    VDP may be used as the Hypervisor-to-NVE Control Plane protocol.</p>"
