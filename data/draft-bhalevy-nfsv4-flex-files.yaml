abstract:
- content: "<p>The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between
    the metadata and data for a file. The metadata file access is handled via Network
    File System version 4 (NFSv4) minor version 1 (NFSv4.1) and the data file access
    is specific to the protocol being used between the client and storage device.
    The client is informed by the metadata server as to which protocol to use via
    a Layout Type. The Flexible File Layout Type is defined in this document as an
    extension to NFSv4.1 to allow the use of storage devices which need not be tightly
    coupled to the metadata server.</p>"
