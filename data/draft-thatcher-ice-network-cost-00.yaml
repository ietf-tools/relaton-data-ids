abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment (ICE) that enables ICE agents to exchange information about the
    relative cost of network interfaces and dynamically choose the selected ICE candidate
    pair based on the cost of both the local and remote network interfaces. For example,
    if a cellular network interface has a higher cost than a Wi-Fi network interface,
    the ICE agents can use that information to prefer candidate pairs with Wi-Fi rather
    than cellular when possible, and only use cellular when necessary. This document
    additionally describes a second piece of information, network ID, that goes along
    with the network cost and can be used to know when a network interface has changed,
    even if two network interfaces have the same network cost.</p>"
