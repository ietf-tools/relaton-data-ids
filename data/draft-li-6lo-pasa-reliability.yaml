abstract:
- content: "<p>Path-Aware Semantic Address (PASA) [I-D.li-6lo-path-aware-semantic-addressing]),
    proposes to algorithmically assign addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment so
    to achieve stateless forwarding, hence, allowing to avoid using a routing protocol.
    PASA is more suitable for stable and static wireline connectivity, in order to
    avoid renumbering due to topology changes. Even in such kind of scenarios, reliability
    remains a concern. This memo tackles specifically reliability in PASA deployments,
    analyzing possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.</p>"
