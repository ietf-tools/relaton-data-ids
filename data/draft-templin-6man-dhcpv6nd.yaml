abstract:
- content: <p>On some IPv6 links, hosts/clients may have advanced knowledge that all
    routers on the link would be willing to provide DHCPv6 address/ prefix delegation
    services without the need for an initial RS/RA message exchange followed by one
    or more separate DHCPv6 exchanges. This document specifies a new IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery option termed the "DHCPv6 Option" that supports the managed delegation
    of addresses/prefixes in a single message exchange.</p>
