abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE)
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where a domain is referred to as
    a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management
    or path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems)
    has been identified as a key requirement . This document specifies a procedure
    relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) in order to compute
    such inter-domain shortest constraint paths along a determined sequence of domains,
    using a backward recursive path computation technique while preserving confidentiality
    across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different
    Service Providers.</p>"
