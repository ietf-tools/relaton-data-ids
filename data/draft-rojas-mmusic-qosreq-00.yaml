abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies requirements for an end-to-end negotiation
    of the Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of each media component of a multi-media
    session at the application level, before requesting the transport layer for bearer
    setup. It is believed that in the future, QoS will be one of the major differentiators
    in the context of a new generation of multi-media services based on the IP technology.
    As such, QoS cannot be considered anymore as a matter of bearer handling only,
    but it has also to include the application layer. Moreover, QoS has to be considered
    as part of the media component description, and therefore, to be negotiated or
    re-negotiated during the session life.</p>"
