abstract:
- content: "<p>[VPN] describes a method of providing a VPN service. That method allows
    a variety of different protocols to be used as the routing protocol between the
    Customer Edge (CE) router and the Provider Edge (PE) router. However, it does
    not fully specify the procedures which must be implemented within the Provider's
    network when OSPF is used as the PE/CE routing protocol. This document provides
    that specification.</p>"
