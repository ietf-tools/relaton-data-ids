abstract:
- content: <p>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) system designers and operators
    continuously grapple with the problem of qualifying performance of network services
    realised with software Network Functions (NF) running on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf
    (COTS) servers. One of the main challenges is getting repeatable and portable
    benchmarking results and using them to derive deterministic operating range that
    is production deployment worthy. This document specifies benchmarking methodology
    for NFV services that aims to address this problem space. It defines a way for
    measuring performance of multiple NFV service instances, each composed of multiple
    software NFs, and running them at a varied service "packing" density on a single
    server. The aim is to discover deterministic usage range of NFV system. In addition
    specified methodology can be used to compare and contrast different NFV virtualization
    technologies.</p>
