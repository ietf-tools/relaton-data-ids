abstract:
- content: "<p>This document requests a DSCP from the IANA for a class of real-time
    traffic conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior and admitted using
    a CAC procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission,
    as compared to a class of real-time traffic conforming to the Expedited Forwarding
    Per Hop Behavior but not subject to capacity admission or subject to very coarse
    capacity admission. One of the reasons behind this is the need for classes of
    traffic that are handled under special policies, such as the non-preemptive Emergency
    Telecommunication Service, the US DoD's Assured Service (which is similar to MLPP),
    or e-911. These do not need separate DSCPs or separate PHBs that are separate
    from each other, but they need a traffic class from which they can deterministically
    obtain their service requirements from including SLA matters.</p>"
