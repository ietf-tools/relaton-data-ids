abstract:
- content: "<p>Multimedia data transport over ad hoc networks is a challenging problem.
    The dynamic nature of the underlying routing and the highly varying quality of
    the wireless communication links present additional hurdles for the transport
    of real-time traffic between hosts. However, the mesh topology of ad hoc networks
    implies the existence of multiple paths between any two nodes. It has been shown
    in the literature that path diversity provides an effective means of combating
    transmission errors and topology changes that are typical in ad hoc networks.
    Moreover, data partitioning techniques, such as striping and thinning, have been
    demonstrated to improve the queuing performance of real-time data. Recognizing
    the advantages of these techniques, as well as the increasing need for video services
    in ad hoc networks, we propose a new transport protocol to support multipath transport
    of real-time data. The new protocol, called Multi-flow Real-time Transport Protocol
    (MRTP), provides a convenient vehicle for real-time multimedia applications to
    partition and to transmit data using multiple flows. Even though the basic idea
    of MRTP is presented in the context of ad hoc networks, the benefits demonstrated
    by the use of MRTP is equally applicable to other types of IP network providing
    multi-media streaming services including the Internet.</p>"
