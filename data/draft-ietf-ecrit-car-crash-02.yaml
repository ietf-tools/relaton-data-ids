abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls placed by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash
    or incident. Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic Crash Notification"
    (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the case of
    manual trigger. The "Advanced" qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer
    set of data. This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency
    Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred
    to as "crash data" even though there is not necessarily a crash). An external
    specification for the data format, contents, and structure are referenced in this
    document. Profiling and simplifications of the general emergency call mechanism,
    as described in [RFC6443] and [RFC6881], are possible due to the nature of the
    functionality that is provided in vehicles such as the usage of Global Satellite
    Navigation System (GNSS). This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation
    pan- European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by
    in-vehicle systems within Europe and other regions), as described in [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].
    However, this document specifies a different set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically,
    the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS) rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data
    (MSD).</p>
