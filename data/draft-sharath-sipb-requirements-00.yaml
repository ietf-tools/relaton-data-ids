    standard business telephone based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The
    objective of this document is to provide a minimum set of requirements for implementing
    business features on SIP endpoints. This draft is intended to serve as a requirements
    document for vendors implementing business features on SIP based devices/entities.
    Details of how each capability or feature is best implemented in SIP, is beyond
    the scope of this document and may be tracked through the working group draft
    submissions.</p>"
