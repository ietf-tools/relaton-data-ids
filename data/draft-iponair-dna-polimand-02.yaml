abstract:
- content: "<p>A handover is the process during which a mobile node is handed over
    between access networks. Especially for vertical handovers in overlay networks
    the mobile node changes the access network using multiple interfaces including
    different link layers, e.g., WLAN, GPRS, and UMTS. Handovers occur as a consequence
    of lower layer (i.e., link- layer) handovers that signify a switch of the physical
    connection to a new location. For the duration of a handover, a mobile node is
    unable to send or receive traffic. The length of this disruption is considered
    critical because it affects the performance of the communication. An additional
    factor is the link layer selection. It implies the selection of the most suitable
    link layer from which a mobile node should receive services.</p>"
