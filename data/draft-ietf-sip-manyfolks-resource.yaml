abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a generic framework for preconditions which is
    extensible through IANA registration. This document also discusses how network
    quality of service can be made a precondition to establishment of sessions initiated
    by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These preconditions require that the
    participant reserve network resources before continuing with the session. We do
    not define new quality of service reservation mechanisms; these preconditions
    simply require a participant to use existing resource reservation mechanisms before
    beginning the session</p>"
