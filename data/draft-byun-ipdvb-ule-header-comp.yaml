abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) is widely deployed in DVB-S and
    DVB-S2 networks [DVB-S2]. Replacing MPE with Unidirectional Lightweight Encryption
    (ULE) has been proposed to gain flexibility and reduce overhead. This paper introduces
    a signaling method for sending header-compressed unicast packets over satellite
    networks using ULE, taking advantage of ULE's increased flexibility.</p>"
