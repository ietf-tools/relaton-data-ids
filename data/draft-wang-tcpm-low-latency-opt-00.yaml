abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the TCP Low Latency option, which TCP connections
    can use during the connection establishment handshake to communicate extra parameters
    that can improve performance in low- latency environments. With the first such
    parameter, a TCP data receiver can advertise a hint about the Maximum ACK Delay
    (MAD) it will schedule for its own delayed ACK mechanism. This enables the TCP
    data sender to achieve lower latencies during loss recovery by using the Maximum
    ACK Delay advertised by the remote receiver to help compute retransmission timeouts
    that are potentially much lower than would otherwise be feasible. The Low Latency
    option is extensible, and later versions of this draft will introduce other mechanisms,
    including TCP timestamps with a finer granularity than those supported by RFC
    7323.</p>"
