abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the Internet''s Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP). TCP is an important transport layer protocol in the Internet stack, and
    has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over
    this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC
    793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document
    collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from
    RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as 879, 6093, 6429, 6528, and
    6691. It updates RFC 1122, and should be considered as a replacement for the portions
    of that document dealing with TCP requirements. It updates RFC 5961 due to a small
    clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. (TODO: double-check
    this list for all actual RFCs when finished) RFC EDITOR NOTE: If approved for
    publication as an RFC, this should be marked additionally as "STD: 7" and replace
    RFC 793 in that role.</p>'
