abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3344 [1] describes the current version of Mobile IP version 4 signaling
    and forwarding. The signaling and forwarding is conducted between a Mobile Node
    and a Home Agent, via an optional intermediate Foreign Agent, for a Home Address
    of the Mobile Node. The Home Agent acts as the Mobile IP signaling endpoint, as
    well as the forwarding endpoint for packet tunneling between the Home Agent and
    the MN Care of Address. This document describes an alternative architecture in
    which the Home Agent is the signaling endpoint whilst a new Tunnel Agent acts
    as the forwarding endpoint.</p>"
