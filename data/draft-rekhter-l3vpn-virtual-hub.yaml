abstract:
- content: "<p>With BGP/MPLS VPNs any-to-any connectivity among sites of a given Virtual
    Private Network would require each Provider Edge router that has one or more of
    these sites connected to it to hold all the routes of that Virtual Private Network.
    The approach described in this document allows to reduce the number of Provider
    Edge routers that have to maintain all these routes by requiring only a subset
    of these routers to maintain all these routes. Specification of Requirements</p>"
