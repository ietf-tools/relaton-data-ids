abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives an overview of the architecture of the L-band Digital
    Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which provides a secure, scalable
    and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation. LDACS is a scheduled,
    reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6. It
    is part of a larger shift of flight guidance communication moving to IP-based
    communication. High reliability and availability of IP connectivity over LDACS,
    as well as security, are therefore essential. The intent of this document is to
    introduce LDACS to the IETF community, raise awareness on related activities inside
    and outside of the IETF, and to seek expertise in shaping the shift of aeronautics
    to IP.</p>"
