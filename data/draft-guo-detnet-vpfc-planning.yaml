abstract:
- content: "<p>The cycle-based queuing and forwarding is an effective method to ensure
    that the transmission has a definite upper bound of jitter, as well as latency.
    The prerequisite for this method is to ensure that queuing resources do not conflict.
    In large-scale deterministic networks (LDNs), how to avoid the queuing resources
    conflict of this method is an open problem. This document presents a scheme of
    planning virtue periodic forwarding channel (VPFC) based on virtual periodic forwarding
    path (VPFP) in LDNs. The scheme can solve the queuing resources conflict of cycle-specified
    queuing and forwarding in nonlinear topology domain, thus ensuring the bounded
    latency of DetNet flow in the same periodic forwarding domain.</p>"
