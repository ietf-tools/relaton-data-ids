- content: "<p>IANA maintains the IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry. This registry documents
    which TLVs can appear in different types of IS-IS PDUs, but does not document
    which TLVs can be found in zero Remaining Lifetime LSP (a.k.a., purges). This
    document extends the existing registry to record the set of TLVs that are permissible
    in purges.</p>"
