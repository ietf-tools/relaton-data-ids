abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes an HTTP extension header field that allows
    proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying process, e.g. the
    originating IP number of a request or IP number of the proxy on the incoming side.
    Given a trusted path of proxying components, each subsequent component will have
    access to all IP numbers used in the chain of proxied HTTP requests. This document
    also standardizes ways for a proxy administrator to anonymize the origin of a
    request.</p>"
