abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines optional Diameter attributes that can be used
    to help manage networks that use Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) or Diameter
    traffic filters. These new attributes allow for improved data traffic identification,
    support of ECN, and minimal Diameter filter administration. RFC 5777 defines a
    Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) that accommodates extensions for classification,
    conditions, and actions. It, however, does not support traffic identification
    for packets using Explicit Congestion Notification as defined in RFC 3168 and
    does not provide specific actions when the flow(s) described by the Filter-Rule
    are congested. Further, a Filter-Rule can describe multiple flows but not the
    exact number of flows. Flow count and other associated data (e.g., packets) are
    not captured by accounting applications, leaving administrators without useful
    information regarding the effectiveness or appropriateness of the filter definition.
    The optional attributes defined in this document are forward and backwards compatible
    with RFC 5777.</p>"
