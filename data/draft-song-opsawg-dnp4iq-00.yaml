abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the motivation and requirements for supporting
    interactive network queries and data collection through a mechanism called Dynamic
    Network Probes (DNP). Network applications and OAM have various data requirements
    from the data plane. The unpredictable and interactive nature of the query for
    network data analytics asks for dynamic and on-demand data collection capabilities.
    As user programmable data plane is becoming a reality, it can be enhanced to support
    interactive query through DNPs. DNP supports node, path, and flow-based data preprocessing
    and collection. For example, in-situ OAM (iOAM) with user-defined flow- based
    data collection can be programmed and configured through DNP. DNPs serve as a
    building block of an integrated network data telemetry and analytics platform
    which involves the network data plane as an active component for user-defined
    data collection and preparation.</p>"
