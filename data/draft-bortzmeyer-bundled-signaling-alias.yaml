abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a light-weight and semantics-free way to signal,
    in the DNS itself, that a domain name is actually an alias of another one (and
    therefore that they are member of the same bundle). REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION:
    this document should be discussed in the dnsbundled maiing list &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/
    bundled-domain-names&gt;. The source of the document, as well as a list of open
    issues, is currently kept at Github [1].</p>"
