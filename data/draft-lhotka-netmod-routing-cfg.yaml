abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a specification of a core YANG data model for
    IP routing configuration. It is expected that this module will serve as a basis
    for further development of data models for individual routing protocols and other
    related functions. The present data model defines the building blocks for such
    configurations - routes and routing tables, routing protocol instances, route
    filters and route pipes.</p>"
