abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA),
    a novel congestion control scheme for interactive real-time media applications
    such as video conferencing. In the proposed scheme, the sender regulates its sending
    rate, based on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling, in a unified
    approach. The scheme can benefit from Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings
    from network nodes. It also maintains consistent sender behavior in the absence
    of such markings by reacting to queuing delays and packet losses instead.</p>"
