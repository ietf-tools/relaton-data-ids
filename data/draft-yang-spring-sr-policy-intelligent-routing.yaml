abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR Policy is associated
    with one or more candidate paths, and each candidate path is either dynamic, explicit
    or composite. This document describes an intelligent routing method for SR Policy
    based on network quality in MPLS and IPv6 environments.</p>"
