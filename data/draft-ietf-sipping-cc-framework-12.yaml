abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework and the requirements for call control
    and multi-party usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). To enable discussion
    of multi-party features and applications, we define an abstract call model for
    describing the media relationships required by many of these. The model and actions
    described here are specifically chosen to be independent of the SIP signaling
    and/or mixing approach chosen to actually set up the media relationships. In addition
    to its dialog manipulation aspect, this framework includes requirements for communicating
    related information and events such as conference and session state and session
    history. This framework also describes other goals that embody the spirit of SIP
    applications as used on the Internet such as the definition of primitives (not
    services), invoker and participant oriented primitives, signaling and mixing model
    independence, and others. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
