abstract:
- content: "<p>In the near future, multi-interfaces Mobile Nodes will be used for
    connecting to the Internet by way of a multitude of Radio Access Networks including
    802.11 based WLANs, GPRS, CDMA2000 and 3G based cellular networks. Ensuring the
    non-disrupted flow of real-time applications data, as well as adhering to subscribed
    service profiles while the Mobile Node moves between Access Networks of different
    technologies, is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is assumed that a unified
    and external IP core network is used to support such a multitude of Access Networks.
    This will probably be the case for a mobile network operator intending to benefit
    its subscribers with its own hot-spots broadband internet access. Consequently,
    the need arises to define managed handoff mechanisms between heterogeneous attachment
    networks, while providing service continuity to the Mobile Node. As such, information
    necessary for the Mobile Node to performing a judicious handoff across Wireless
    Access Networks, will have to be gathered from the involved Access Networks, transferred
    across the IP network that interconnects them, to the operators home network.
    This document discusses the desirability of a network controlled handoff process
    for optimizing inter-Access Network Mobile Node mobility. The approach presented
    provides the means for the operator home network to achieve the best possible
    selection of the Mobile Node target Access Network for handoff, on the basis of
    information gathered on the most relevant nodes. It introduces a new function
    located in the operator network and referred to as a Mobility Manager. It also
    introduces the concepts for implementing such a handoff process to make it compatible
    with Mobile IPv6. Other documents will be needed to specify the protocol structures
    that are intended for handling the handoff process hereafter described.</p>"
