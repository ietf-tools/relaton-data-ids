abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the AAA authorization framework described in
    RFC 2904 in that some or all of the authorization task is delegated from the AAA
    server to a local network entity. The extension considers new AAA services such
    as PANA network access service and dynamic host configuration service that have
    different characteristics from legacy AAA services such as PPP service and IEEE
    802.1X network access service.</p>"
