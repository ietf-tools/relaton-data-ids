abstract:
- content: "<p>The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various
    options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS,
    or DNS-over-QUIC). In particular, the document describes how Discovery of Network-designated
    Resolvers (DNR) and Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) can be used in typical
    deployment contexts. This document does not intend to provide deployment recommendations,
    but is meant to exemplify how operators can enable the encrypted DNS discovery
    mechanisms. In addition, the document illustrates the feasibility of hosting encrypted
    DNS forwarders in Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs).</p>"
