abstract:
- content: "<p>This document seeks to establish a standard for the utilization of
    the Class of Service Field and the us of the Flow Label Field within the IPv6
    Header and establish a methodology of switching packets through routers using
    the first 32-bits of the IPv6 header using Flow Label Switching on packets rather
    than full routing of packets. Within the first 32-bits of an IPv6 header exists
    the requisite information to allow for the immediate “switching” on an ingress
    packet of a router, allowing for “Label Switching” of a native IPv6 packet. This
    allows the establishment of VPN circuits in a dynamic manner across transit networks.
    The establishment of “Flows” based upon the 20-bit “Flow Label” value can be done
    dynamically with minimal effort and configuration of the end-point routers of
    the flow. The flows can be managed or open, encrypted or in the clear, and will
    allow for greater scalability, security, and agility in the management and operation
    of networks.</p>"
