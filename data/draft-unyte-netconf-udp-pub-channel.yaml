abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a UDP-based publication channel for streaming
    telemetry use to collect data from devices. A new shim header is proposed to facilitate
    the distributed data collection mechanism which directly pushes data from line
    cards to the collector. Because of the lightweight UDP encapsulation, higher frequency
    and better transit performance can be achieved.</p>"
