abstract:
- content: "<p>RxRPC was originally designed as the remote procedure call layer for
    AFS-3. Today there are a number of anonymous RxRPC applications which require
    identity assertions in order to ensure that the desired peer receives and processes
    a procedure call. This memo defines a replacement for the rxnull security class
    which provides a means for mutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without
    incurring cryptographic overhead. It should be noted that, much like rxnull, this
    security object is not suitable for use in a distributed environment due to its
    inability to provide integrity protection.</p>"
