abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Version 4 routing protocol (RFC4271) is now used in many ways,
    crossing boundaries of administrative and technical responsibility. The protocol
    lacks an operational messaging plane which could be utilised to diagnose, troubleshoot
    and inform upon various conditions across these boundaries, securely, during protocol
    operation, without disruption. This document proposes a new BGP message type,
    the OPERATIONAL message, which can be used to effect such a messaging plane for
    use both between and within Autonomous Systems.</p>"
