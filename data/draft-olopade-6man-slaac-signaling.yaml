abstract:
- content: "<p>After a renumbering event in an IPv6 network utilizing SLAAC, hosts
    might continue to use stale addresses, as they are unaware of the changes. Likewise,
    routers, who may deprecate the use of these prefixes, are unaware of their use
    on the hosts. This scenario could have an adverse effect on communication with
    the host. This document proposes changes to the SLAAC algorithm that will explicitly
    allow routers to learn of these stale prefixes that are still assigned on the
    network.</p>"
