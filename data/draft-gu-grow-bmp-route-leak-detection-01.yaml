abstract:
- content: "<p>According to RFC7908 [RFC7908], Route leaks refer to case that the
    delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected range. For many
    current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are
    focusing on finding ways to detect the happening of route leaks. However, the
    real-time route leak detection if any occurs is important as well. This document
    extends the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to provide a routing security
    scheme suitable for ISPs to detect BGP route leaks within their own networks.</p>"
