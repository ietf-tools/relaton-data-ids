abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extended Objective Function(OF)that balances
    the number of child nodes of the parent nodes to avoid the overloading problem
    and ensure node lifetime maximization in the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power
    and Lossy Networks (RPL). The standard OFs are used to build a Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) where the bottleneck nodes may suffer from unbalanced
    traffic load. As a result, a part of the network may be disconnected as the energy
    of the overloaded preferred parent node will drain much faster than other candidate
    parents. Thus, a new RPL metric has been introduced to balance the traffic load
    over the network. Finally, the potential extra overhead has been mitigated using
    a new utilization technique.</p>"
