abstract:
- content: "<p>It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic
    Engineering (TE) node capabilities during TE LSP path selection, such as for instance
    the capability to act as a branch LSR of a P2MP LSP. This requires advertising
    these capabilities within the IGP. For that purpose, this document specifies OSPF
    and IS-IS traffic engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane
    and data plane traffic engineering node capabilities.</p>"
