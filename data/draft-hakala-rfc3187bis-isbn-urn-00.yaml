abstract:
- content: <p>The International Standard Book Number, ISBN, is a widely used identifier
    for monographic publications. Since 2001, there has been a URN (Uniform Resource
    Names) namespace for ISBNs. The namespace registration was performed in RFC 3187
    and applies to the ISBN as specified in the original ISO Standard 2108-1992. To
    allow for further growth in use, the successor ISO Standard, ISO 2108-2005, has
    defined an expanded format for the ISBN, known as "ISBN-13". This document replaces
    RFC 3187 and defines how both the old and new ISBN standard can be supported within
    the URN framework and the syntax for URNs defined in RFC 2141. An updated namespace
    registration is included, which describes how both the old and the new ISBN format
    can share the same namespace. Discussion This draft version is the outcome of
    work started in 2008 and brought to the IETF as a contribution to a much larger
    effort to revise the basic URN RFCs, in order to bring them in alignment with
    the current URI Standard (STD 63, RFC 3986), ABNF, and IANA guidelines, and to
    establish a modern URN resolution system for bibliographic identifiers. Until
    a more specific mailing list is established, comments are welcome on the urn-nid@ietf.org
    mailing list (or sent to the authors).</p>
