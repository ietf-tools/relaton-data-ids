abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7854, BMP, uses different message types for different purposes.
    Most of these are Type, Length, Value (TLV) structured. One message type, the
    Peer Up message, lacks a set of TLVs defined for its use, instead sharing a namespace
    with the Initiation message. Subsequent experience has shown that this namespace
    sharing was a mistake, as it hampers the extension of the protocol. This document
    updates RFC 7854 by creating an independent namespace for the Peer Up message.
    It also updates RFC 8671 and RFC 9069 by moving the defined codepoints in the
    newly introduced registry. The changes in this document are formal only, compliant
    implementations of RFC 7854, RFC 8671 and RFC 9069 also comply with this specification.</p>"
