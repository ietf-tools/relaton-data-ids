abstract:
- content: "<p>Online users have demonstrated a desire to know instantly whether another
    individual is online, to be notified when another individual arrives online, and
    to send instant messages. These applications currently use independent, non-standard
    and usually non-interoperable protocols. The goal is to define a standard protocol
    so that independently written client and server implementations can participate
    in a global network of ''online'' users. This draft outlines requirements for
    a Presence Information Protocol to support these applications. Distribution of
    this document is unlimited. Please send comments to the RVP discussion list at
    rvp@iastate.edu, which may be joined by sending a message with subject ''subscribe''
