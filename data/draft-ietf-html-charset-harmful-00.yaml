abstract:
- content: "<p>The term character set is often used to describe a ditigal representation
    of text. ASCII is perhaps the most widely deployed representation of text, and
    in the interest of interoperability, information systems on the Internet traditionally
    rely on it exclusively. The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) introduces
    Internet Media Types, including text representations besides ASCII. The Hypertext
    Markup Language (HTML) used in the World-Wide Web is a proposed Internet Media
    Type. But HTML is also an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language
    (SGML).</p>"
