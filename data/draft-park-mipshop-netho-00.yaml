abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, a framework provides network-initiated handover to FMIPv6
    MN (mobile node) in IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN is suggested. Basic concept and mechanism
    of layer-2/layer-3 handover and IAPP are introduced. Suggested framework is integration
    of these three protocols and additional primitives.</p>"
