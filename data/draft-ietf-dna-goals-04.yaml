abstract:
- content: "<p>When a host establishes a new link-layer connection, it may or may
    not have a valid IP configuration for Internet connectivity. The host may check
    for link change (i.e., determine whether a link change has occurred), and then,
    based on the result, it can automatically decide whether its IP configuration
    is still valid. During link identity detection, the host may also collect necessary
    information to initiate a new IP configuration if the IP subnet has changed. In
    this memo, this procedure is called Detecting Network Attachment (DNA). DNA schemes
    should be precise, sufficiently fast, secure, and of limited signaling. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
