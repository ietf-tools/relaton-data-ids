abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) packages
    that enable a Call Agent to authorize and monitor the transition of a connection
    to and from Voiceband Data (VBD) with or without redundancy and FEC (forward error
    correction). Although the focus is on VBD, the General-Purpose Media Descriptor
    Parameter package can be used to authorize other modes of operation, not relevant
    to VBD, for a particular codec. In addition to defining these new packages, this
    document describes the use of the Media Format Parameter package and Fax package
    with VBD, redundancy, and FEC. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
