abstract:
- content: "<p>The Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security Service Application
    Program Interface (IDUP-GSS-API) extends the GSS-API [RFC-1508] for applications
    requiring protection of a generic data unit (such as a file or message) in a way
    that is independent of the protection of any other data unit and independent of
    any concurrent contact with designated 'receivers' of the data unit. Thus, it
    is suitable for applications such as secure electronic mail where data needs to
    be protected without any on-line connection with the intended recipient(s) of
    that data. The protection offered by the IDUP includes data origin authentication
    with data integrity, data confidentiality with data integrity, and support for
    non-repudiation services. Subsequent to being protected, the independent data
    unit can be transferred to the recipient(s) - or to an archive - perhaps to be
    processed ('unprotected') only days or years later. The Independent Data Unit
    Protection Generic Security Service Application Program Interface for Signing
    and Encrypting (IDUP-SE) provides a simplified API for the services of signing
    and encrypting.</p>"
