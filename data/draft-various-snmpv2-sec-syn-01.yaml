abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a submission to the SNMPv2 Working Group of the IETF.
    The Administrative Model for SNMPv2 document defines a framework and an administrative
    model which realizes effective management in a variety of configurations and environments.
    In the administrative model, there are provisions for multiple authentication
    and privacy services (identified by the security protocol identifier, sPI) to
    achieve various objectives. Each manager (including a dual-role entity acting
    in a manager role) and each agent (including a dual-role entity acting in an agent
    role) implements one or more of these types of service. Although many such types
    of authentication and privacy services might be defined, it is the purpose of
    this document, User-Based Symmetric Security Protocols for SNMPv2, to define three
    such services; one service supporting neither authentication nor privacy (usecNoAuth(4)),
    one service supporting authentication but not privacy (usecAuth(5)), and another
    supporting both authentication and privacy (usecPriv(6)). This updated version
    of the document is the output of the SNMPv2* meeting held in Dallas</p>"
