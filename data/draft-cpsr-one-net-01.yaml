abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a suggested set of basic principles that the
    authors believe should underlie all future work in the area of Internet governance.
    The purpose of this document is to work towards as broad a consensus as possible,
    in the diverse Internet community, about principles that should inform the way
    the Internet is administered for the benefit of all humanity. The principles have
    been drafted under the auspices of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
    with several iterations internal to that organization. However, they are still
    very much seen as a work in progress. Comments are solicited from all interested
    parties. Future versions will be refined based on these comments and published
    as future Internet-Drafts, with a goal of publication of a finalized version of
    the declaration as an Internet RFC in summer, 1998. All comments on this document
    are welcome; please send them to onenet-comments@cpsr.org. Open discussion of
    this document is encouraged on the onenet-discuss list, which is archived at http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/onenet-
    discuss.</p>"
