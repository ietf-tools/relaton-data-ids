abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect
    the Quality of Service of inelastic flows. It does this by marking packets when
    traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical
    link rate. This baseline encoding specified how two encoding states could be encoded
    into the IP header. This document specified an extension to the baseline encoding
    that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IP header as well as enabling
    limited support for end-to-end ECN. Status (to be removed by RFC Editor) This
    memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually be published
    as an experimental RFC. The PCN Working Group will be asked to adopt this memo
    as a Working Group document describing one of several possible experimental PCN
    encoding schemes. The intention is that the title of this document will change
    to avoid confusion with the three state marking scheme. Changes from previous
    drafts From 00 to 01: o Checked terminology for consistency with [I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding]
    o Minor editorial changes.</p>"
