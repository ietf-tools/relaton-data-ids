abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of new IP connectivity typically results in intermittent
    reachability for numerous reasons that are outside the scope of this document.
    In order to aid in the debugging of these persistent problems, this document proposes
    the creation of a new Routing Policy Specification Language attribute that allows
    a network to advertise an IP address that is reachable and can be used as a target
    for diagnostic tests (e.g., pings). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
