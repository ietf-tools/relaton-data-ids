abstract:
- content: "<p>URI references with fragment identifiers uniquely identify parts of
    a document. Such identifiers have been specified as SGML/XML IDs e.g. in HTML
    [6]. The XPointer [2] specification is intended to serve as a fragment identifier
    syntax for XML documents. IDs conform to the XPointer 'raw name' form. Specifications
    constraining the behavior of user agents such as SMIL [8], XHTML [15], and SVG
    [10] have all supported this simple fragment naming convention though some extend
    it.</p>"
