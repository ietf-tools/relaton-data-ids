abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses handover management scheme for WLAN handover
    across different IP subnets. To achieve seamless handover, the following three
    requirements should be satisfied. (I) prompt and reliable detection of degradation
    in wireless link quality, (II) elimination of handover processing delay on layer
    2 and 3, (III) selection of a better WLAN. We then describe our proposed handover
    management scheme satisfying these requirements, and explain an architecture design
    and implementation for our proposed scheme.</p>"
