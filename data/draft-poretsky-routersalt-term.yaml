abstract:
- content: "<p>This terminology document provides the terms to be used for benchmarking
    router software under accelerated stress conditions. A framework is defined to
    configure routing protocols, security policies, traffic forwarding, and management.
    Conditions to produce instability and accelerate operational conditions are also
    defined. Benchmarks for evaluating a router subjected to the accelerated life
    test are introduced. The DUT configuration and accelerated stress conditions emulate
    those of Internet Core routers.</p>"
