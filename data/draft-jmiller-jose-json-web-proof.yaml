abstract:
- content: "<p>The JOSE set of standards established JSON-based container formats
    for Keys (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7517/), Signatures (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7515/),
    and Encryption (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7516/). They also established
    IANA registries (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml) to enable the
    algorithms and representations used for them to be extended. Since those were
    created, newer cryptographic algorithms that support selective disclosure and
    unlinkability have matured and started seeing early market adoption. This document
    defines a new container format similar in purpose and design to JSON Web Signature
    (JWS) called a _JSON Web Proof (JWP)_. Unlike JWS, which integrity-protects only
    a single payload, JWP can integrity-protect multiple payloads in one message.
    It also specifies a new presentation form that supports selective disclosure of
    individual payloads, enables additional proof computation, and adds a protected
    header to prevent replay and support binding mechanisms.</p>"
