abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a shared secret token format for transport
    and provisioning of shared secrets (One Time Password (OTP) keys or symmetric
    cryptographic keys) to different types of strong authentication devices. The standard
    token format enables enterprises to deploy best-of-breed solutions combining components
    from different vendors into the same infrastructure. This work is a joint effort
    by the members of OATH (Initiative for Open AuTHentication) to specify a format
    that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors believe
    that a common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two- factor
    authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability between commercial
    and open-source implementations.</p>"
