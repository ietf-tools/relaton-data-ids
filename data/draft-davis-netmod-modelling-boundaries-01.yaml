abstract:
- content: "<p>Current modelling techniques appear to have boundaries that make representation
    of some concepts in modern problems, such as intent and capability, challenging.
    The concepts all have in common the need to represent uncertainty and vagueness.
    The challenge results from the rigidity of boundary representation, including
    the absoluteness of instance value and the process of classification itself, provided
    by current techniques. When describing solutions, a softer approach seems necessary
    where the emphasis is on the focus on a particular thing from a particular perspective.
    Intelligent control (use of AI/ML etc.) could take advantage of partial compatibilities
    etc. if a softer representation was achieved. The solution representation appears
    to require * Expression of range, preference and focus as a fundamental part of</p>"
