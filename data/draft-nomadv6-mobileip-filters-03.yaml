abstract:
- content: "<p>Filters for Mobile IPv6 Bindings (NOMADv6) introduces a set of extensions
    for MIPv6 protocol that allows for intelligent use of multiple points of attachment
    simultaneously, on a mobile node. It specifies a set of rules (filters) communicated
    to binding agents using binding updates. In turn, binding agents use this information
    to determine whether and where to route flows associated with the mobile node.
    In this manner, it is possible for a mobile node to distribute flows or packets
    of a flow among its available points of attachment or to request that such flow
    is dropped before traversing the Internet fabric, with or without notification
    to their source. These extensions mirror a similar extension defined for Mobile
    IPv4 (NOMADv4) but has been extended to cater to the behavior of IPv6.</p>"
