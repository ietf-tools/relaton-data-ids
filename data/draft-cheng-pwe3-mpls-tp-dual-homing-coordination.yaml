abstract:
- content: "<p>In some scenarios, the MPLS Trasport Profile (MPLS-TP) Pseudowires
    (PWs) are provisioned through either static configuration or management plane,
    where a dynamic control plane is not available. A fast protection mechanism for
    MPLS-TP PWs is needed to protect against the failure of Attachment Circuit (AC),
    the failure of Provider Edge (PE) and also the failure in the Packet Switched
    Network (PSN). The framework and scenarios for dual-homing pseudowire (PW) local
    protection are described in [draft-cheng-pwe3- mpls-tp-dual-homing-protection].
    This document proposes a dual- homing coordination mechanism for MPLS-TP PWs,
    which is used for state exchange and coordination between the dual-homing PEs
    for dual- homing PW local protection.</p>"
