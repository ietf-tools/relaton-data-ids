abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a symmetric encryption protocol that supplements
    the protocols described in the User-based Security Model (USM), which is a Security
    Subsystem for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol for use in the
    SNMP Architecture. The symmetric encryption protocol described in this document
    is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher algorithm used in Cipher
    FeedBack Mode (CFB), with a key size of 128 bits. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
