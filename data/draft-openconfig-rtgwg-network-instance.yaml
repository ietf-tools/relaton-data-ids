abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing
    forwarding instances on a network device - focused primarily on deployments in
    service provider networks. The model is vendor- neutral and based on operational
    requirements expressed by operators. A 'network instance' is defined to be a discrete
    forwarding table on a network element, which contains Layer 3 and/or Layer 2 forwarding
    entries. Each network instance may instantiate its own sets of protocols which
    control installation of forwarding entries into one or more tables (which may
    be Layer 2 FIBs, or Layer 3 RIBs).</p>"
