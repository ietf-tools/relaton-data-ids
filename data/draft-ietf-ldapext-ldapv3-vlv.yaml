abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Virtual List View extension for the Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Search operation. This extension is designed
    to allow the 'virtual list box' feature, common in existing commercial e-mail
    address book applications, to be supported efficiently by LDAP servers. LDAP servers'
    inability to support this client feature is a significant impediment to LDAP replacing
    proprietary protocols in commercial e-mail systems. The extension allows a client
    to specify that the server return, for a given LDAP search with associated sort
    keys, a contiguous subset of the search result set. This subset is specified in
    terms of offsets into the ordered list, or in terms of a greater than or equal
    comparison value.</p>"
