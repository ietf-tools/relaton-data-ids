abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a simple mechanism that allows a MN to establish
    a security association with a CN to enable it to send Binding Updates in a secure
    manner as required by MIPv6. The proposed mechanism makes use of the AAA infrastructure
    and is only intended for securing network signalling data (e.g. BU's from MN)
    but not traffic. It should be noted that the use of this mechanism need not be
    limited to MIPv6 BUs and may be utilised to allow any two nodes to setupa security
    asociation using the AAA infrastructure.</p>"
