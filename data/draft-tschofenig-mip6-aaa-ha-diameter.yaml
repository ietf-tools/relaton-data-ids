abstract:
- content: "<p>Both Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solutions require use of a AAA interface.
    In the split scenario, this interface is between the Home Agent and the AAA infrastructure
    of the Mobile Service Provider (MSP) and the Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA).
    The first interface should meet a list of requirements. This document provides
    an overview of the capabilities and design of the Diameter protocol that could
    meet the specified goals. In the integrated scenario, in addition to this interface,
    the impact of the MIPv6 bootstrapping on the AAA interface for network access
    authentication must be considered. Basically, this interface is also used to carry
    Home Agent information. This document defines the necessary AVP and how Diameter
    can be used in the integrated scenario.</p>"
