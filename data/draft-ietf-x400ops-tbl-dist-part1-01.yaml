abstract:
- content: "<p>Mapping between X.400 and Internet mail and X.400 routing are normally
    done using a table-based approach. In practise tables are normal (ASCII) files.
    In order to function properly tables must be coordinated carefully. One major
    problem is the lack of automated procedures. This memo - together with it's companion
    document - proposes one possible solution. This memo discusses the transactions
    between two nodes, while the companion document discusses the over-all structure
    aspects. The same solution can be used to transport binary files. This way it
    is possible to mirror an entire archive with an e-mail only connectivity.</p>"
