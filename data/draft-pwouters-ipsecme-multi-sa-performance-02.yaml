abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines three Notify Message Type Payloads for the Internet
    Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) indicating support for the negotiation
    of multiple identical Child SAs to optimize performance. The CPU_QUEUES notification
    indicates support for multiple queues or CPUs. The CPU_QUEUE_INFO notification
    is used to confirm and optionally convey information about the specific queue.
    The TS_MAX_QUEUE notify conveys that the peer is unwilling to create more additional
    Child SAs for this particular Traffic Selector set. Using multiple identical Child
    SAs has the benefit that each stream has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring
    that CPUs don't have to synchronize their crypto state or disable their packet
    replay protection.</p>"
