abstract:
- content: "<p>The current specification for the SIP MESSAGE request method indicates
    that SIP instant messages according to a model similar to that of a text pager,
    in that each message stands alone. There is no concept of a chat session or a
    text conference where there is a stream of messages that are grouped into a session.
    This memo proposes a method of describing MESSAGE sessions by treating the message
    session just like any other media session described in an SDP body in an INVITE
    request.</p>"
