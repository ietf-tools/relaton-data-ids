abstract:
- content: "<p>Every node must configure its network interface with a unique address
    in order to communicate with other nodes. Having a centralized DHCP server that
    provides addresses to nodes, we can easily and automatically obtain addresses.
    However, in a mobile ad hoc network, difficulties exist in supporting address
    autoconfiguration due to the lack of the centralized servers. We therefore propose
    a distributed address autoconfiguration approach for a mobile ad hoc network using
    address reservation and optimistic Duplicated Address Detection. The reserved
    address helps to reduce the allocation latency, and the optimistic DAD guarantees
    the uniqueness of addresses with smaller communication overhead.</p>"
