abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper, opening with the historical that documents the source of
    the Binary Enumeration Error, utilizes the proof of 'Fermat's Last Theorem' (Normative
    References - [1], [2] and [3]), the Mathematics of Quantification, and the Logic
    of Set Theory, to prove that the Binary System represents a 'Closed and Finite'
    Alternate Mathematical Field. That is, using the Elementary Laws of Algebra, with
    the Basic Principles from Analytic Geometry, provides the final clarification
    simplifying the proof for the correction of the Counting Errors and the Logical
    Foundation for the New Binary System. And more importantly, this also establishes
    the basic foundational principles for 3 State Ternary Logic. In other words, using
    an askew, or mathematically incorrect Binary System, defined as the misinterpretation
    of ZERO, sustains the Counting Error (an Accumulating Propagation) levying a substantial
    loss of IP Addresses in the IPv4 IP Specification, affecting as well the Address
    Pool Total for the IPv6 Specification. Hence, from the foregoing foundation an
    unquestionable proof concludes; the Elementary Mathematical 'Resolution of the
    Counting Error in the Binary System’ &amp; the 'Fall of Differential Calculus'
    - [4. IANA Considerations].</p>"
