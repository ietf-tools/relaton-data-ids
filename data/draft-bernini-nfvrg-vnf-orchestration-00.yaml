abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims at evolving the way network
    operators design, deploy and provision their networks by leveraging standard IT
    virtualization technologies to move and consolidate a wide range of network functions
    and services onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage.
    Primary area of impact for operators is the network edge, being stimulated by
    the recent updates on NFV and SDN. In fact, operators are looking at their future
    datacenters and Points of Presence (PoPs) as increasingly dynamic infrastructures
    to deploy Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and on-demand chained services
    with high elasticity. This document presents an orchestration framework for automated
    deployment of highly available VNF chains. Resiliency of VNFs and chained services
    is a key requirement for operators to improve, ease, automate and speed up services
    lifecycle management. The proposed VNFs orchestration framework is also positioned
    with respect to current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) architectures
    and solutions.</p>"
