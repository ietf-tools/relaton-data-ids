abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior
    whose traffic may be 'starved' (although starvation is not strictly required)
    in a properly functioning network. This is in contrast to the Internet's 'best-effort'
    or 'normal Internet traffic' model. The name, 'bulk handling' is loosely based
    on the United States' Postal Service term for very low priority mail, sent at
    a reduced rate. This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining
    the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic.</p>"
