abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies OSPF extensions to carry information about
    physical impairments. This information set is required for the feasibility assessment
    of the lightpath to be established across an optical switched network controlled
    by GMPLS. The document intent is both disseminating experimental results carried
    out within Ericsson Research and provide an initial input for further OSPF extensions
    in CCAMP IETF group.</p>"
