abstract:
- content: "<p>A tremendous growth in different uses of the Internet has let to a
    growing need to protect data sent over public networks, including data sent via
    http. Use of end-to-end TLS for the majority of traffic looks at first a most
    feasible response. However, the web architecture has become more sophisticated
    and as it has now gone beyond the simple client-server model, the end-to-end used
    of TLS is increasingly showing its downside. The end-to-end use of TLS excludes
    the use of beneficial intermediaries such as use of caches or proxies that provide
    instrumental services. Then need for greater privacy seems to collide with the
    equally growing desire for better end-to-end performance and user experience.
    As an example, the use of HTTP/TLS often appears to maximise the benefit for the
    combination of both. This document describes the above dichotomy and lays out
    a number of objectives of what can ideally be achieved, namely catering for sufficient
    security and privacy whilst providing users with the opportunity to make use of
    intermediaries' services where considered beneficial. This document introduces
    a number of potential solutions towards use of suitable protocol mechanisms and
    data formats. End- to-end protocols which are aware of intermediaries should enable
    users and/or content providers to exercise fine-grained control over what intermediaries
    should be able to do and what exposure to data or metadata they shall be permitted
    to get. The document then highlights anticipated benefits to key stakeholders
    such as users, content providers and intermediaries. As elements such as object
    security can play a useful role, this document encourages the analysis of related
    work to discern their applicability, limitations, and coverage of use cases. Such
    an effort may us espouse innovation to frame an overall architecture and motivate
    more detailed work on protocols and mechanisms in the future.</p>"
