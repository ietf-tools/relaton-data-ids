abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Jumbo Payload option for IPv6, which is
    used to send IPv6 packets with payloads longer than 65,535 octets. This option
    is relevant only for IPv6 nodes that may be attached to links with a link MTU
    greater than 65,575 octets, and need not be implemented or understood by IPv6
    nodes that do not support attachment to links with such large MTUs.</p>"
