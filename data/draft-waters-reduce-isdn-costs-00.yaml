abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses TCP/IP traffic on ISDN links and makes recommendations
    to Network Application and Router developers with a view to reducing the cost
    of using ISDN. This topic is partly related to current activity in the PPP Working
    Group on controls for Protocol Spoofing, but mainly targets the developers of
    Network software such as Resource Sharing protocols, for example Network Service
    and Directory Sharing.</p>"
