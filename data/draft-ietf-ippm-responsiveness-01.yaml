abstract:
- content: <p>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag, latency,
    or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in
    today's networks. Even after a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,
    it remains a common problem for the end users. Everyone "knows" that it is "normal"
    for a video conference to have problems when somebody else at home is watching
    a 4K movie or uploading photos from their phone. However, there is no technical
    reason for this to be the case. In fact, various queue management solutions (fq_codel,
    cake, PIE) have solved the problem. Our networks remain unresponsive, not from
    a lack of technical solutions, but rather a lack of awareness of the problem and
    its solutions. We believe that creating a tool whose measurement matches people's
    everyday experience will create the necessary awareness, and result in a demand
    for products that solve the problem. This document specifies the "RPM Test" for
    measuring responsiveness. It uses common protocols and mechanisms to measure user
    experience specifically when the network is under working conditions. The measurement
    is expressed as "Round-trips Per Minute" (RPM) and should be included with throughput
    (up and down) and idle latency as critical indicators of network quality.</p>
