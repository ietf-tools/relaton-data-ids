abstract:
- content: "<p>This contribution describes an IP Telephony Routing Protocol (ITRP)
    for intra-ITAD communications. ITRP is a SINGLE protocol that is used between
    gateways and servers as well as among servers. It uses discovery, registration,
    update, keep-alive, confirmation, and error-notification messages. The connectionless
    (e.g., UDP) transport is used and, if needed, multicasting can be used instead
    of flooding. The connection-oriented (e.g., TCP) transport can also be utilized.
    ITRP's operation is independent of any signaling protocol and, can serve as a
    mechanism to provide the reachability information about alias addresses including
    telephone numbers. The proposed message formats in ITRP are similar to TRIP.</p>"
