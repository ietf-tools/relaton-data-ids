abstract:
- content: "<p>IS-IS is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC (Massively
    Scalable Data Center) networks. For a given IS-IS router within the CLOS topology,
    it would receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSP from multiple IS-IS neighbors.
    In addition, two IS-IS neighbors may send each other the same LSP simultaneously.
    The unneccessary link-state information flooding wastes the precious process resource
    of IS-IS routers greatly due to the fact that there are too many IS-IS neighbors
    for each IS-IS router within the CLOS topology. This document proposes some extensions
    to IS-IS so as to reduce the IS-IS flooding within MSDC networks greatly. The
    reduction of the IS-IS flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability
    of MSDC networks.</p>"
