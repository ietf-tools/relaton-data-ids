abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing version 2 of the Open Shortest Path First Routing
    Protocol. Version 2 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv4 address family.
    Version 3 of the OSPF protocol is specific to the IPv6 address family. This memo
    obsoletes RFC 1850; however, it is designed to be backwards compatible. The functional
    differences between this memo and RFC 1850 are explained in Appendix B. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
