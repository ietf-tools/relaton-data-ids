abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a schema for the Domain Name System (DNS). This
    schema makes it possible to integrate DNS servers with an LDAP-based directory
    service, allowing an organization to maintain a single store of DNS information.
    Integration of DNS into LDAP directories is desirable since it reduces administrative
    overhead and eliminates the need to maintain multiple server centric configuration
    databases for DNS and other services. It is anticipated that this schema will
    be useful for providing a standardized format for the representation of attributes
    needed by DNS implementations within LDAP-based directory services.</p>"
