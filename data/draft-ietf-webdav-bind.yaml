abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating
    multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes
    at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure
    the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created. This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
