abstract:
- content: <p>The high amount of small packets present in nowaday's networks results
    in a low efficiency, when the size of the headers and the payload are in the same
    order of magnitude. In some situations, multiplexing a number of small packets
    into a bigger one is desirable in order to improve the efficiency. For example,
    a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they
    share a common network path. Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small
    to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the number of packets per
    second to be managed by intermediate routers. This document describes Simplemux,
    a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different protocols
    into a single packet. Small headers (separators) are added at the beginning of
    each multiplexed packet, including some flags, the length and a "Protocol" field.
    This allows the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different protocols
    (multiplexed packets) on a packet of another protocol (tunneling protocol). In
    order to reduce the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers is kept very
    low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing small packets).</p>
