abstract:
- content: <p>International law defines a number of emblems, such as the blue helmets
    of United Nations peacekeeping forces, the blue and white shield of UNESCO, and
    the Red Cross of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as indicative of
    special protections under the Geneva Conventions. Similar protections attach to
    journalists who wear "Press" protective emblems on the battlefield, under Article
    79 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and Resolution 2222 of the United Nations
    Security Council. The emblems of national governments and inter-governmental organizations
    protect diplomatic pouches, couriers, and envoys under the Vienna Convention on
    Diplomatic Relations. Other marks enjoy protections against mis-use under the
    Paris Convention, the Madrid Protocol, and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
    Property Rights. This document provides an initial summary of problems placing
    emblems into digital use cases and documents identified requirements from a number
    of stakeholders with active or potential interests in digital emblems. TODO align
    abstract and document with the WG charter.</p>
