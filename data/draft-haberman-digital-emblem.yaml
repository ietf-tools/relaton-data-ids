abstract:
- content: <p>International law defines a number of emblems, such as the blue helmets
    of United Nations peacekeeping forces, the blue and white shield of UNESCO, and
    the Red Cross of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as indicative of
    special protections under the Geneva Conventions. Similar protections attach to
    journalists who wear "Press" protective emblems on the battlefield, under Article
    79 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions and Resolution 2222 of the United Nations
    Security Council. The emblems of national governments and inter-governmental organizations
    protect diplomatic pouches, couriers, and envoys under the Vienna Convention on
    Diplomatic Relations. Other marks enjoy protections against mis-use under the
    Paris Convention, the Madrid Protocol, and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
    Property Rights. Such physical emblems have a number of weaknesses (e.g., no real-time
    evaluation of their authenticity) and do not translate to the digital realm. This
    document describes a digital emblem which addresses the shortcomings of the physical
    emblems and makes possible the indication of protections of digital assets under
    international law.</p>
