abstract:
- content: "<p>Unlike the existing active and passive OAM techniques, the emerging
    on-path flow telemetry techniques provide unmatched visibility into user traffic,
    showing great application potential not only for today's network OAM but also
    for future's automatic network operation. Summarizing the current industry practices
    that addresses the deployment challenges and application requirements, we provide
    a closed-loop framework, named In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT), for
    efficiently applying a family of underlying on-path flow telemetry techniques
    in various network environments. The framework enumerates several key architectural
    components and describes how these components are assembled together to achieve
    a complete and closed-loop working solution for on-path flow telemetry. Following
    such a framework allows better scalability, fosters application innovations, and
    promotes both vertical and horizontal interoperability.</p>"
