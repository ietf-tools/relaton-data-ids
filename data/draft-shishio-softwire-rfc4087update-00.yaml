abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use
    with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,it
    describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and
    IPv6 networks. IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] provides provisioning capability for IPv4
    and IPv6 tunnel by SNMP. But it is not eqnough to support modern tunnel protocol
    such as 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map]. The document describes
    extention of IP TUNNEL MIB[RFC4087] to support 6rd[RFC5969] and MAP[draft-ietf-softwire-map].</p>"
