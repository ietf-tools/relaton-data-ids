abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures the issues that may arise in the deployment
    of IPv6 networks when they support Mobile IPv6 and firewalls. The issues are not
    only applicable to firewalls protecting enterprise networks, but are also applicable
    in 3G mobile networks such as General Packet Radio Service / Universal Mobile
    Telecommunications System (GPRS/UMTS) and CDMA2000 networks. The goal of this
    document is to highlight the issues with firewalls and Mobile IPv6 and act as
    an enabler for further discussion. Issues identified here can be solved by developing
    appropriate solutions. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
