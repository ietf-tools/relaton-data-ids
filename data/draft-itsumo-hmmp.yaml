abstract:
- content: "<p>Host mobility management protocol (HMMP) is a protocol for supporting
    real-time and non-real-time multimedia applications on mobile terminals of 3G-IP
    networks. HMMP utilizes as well as extends session initiation protocol (SIP) to
    provide means of domain hand-off (i.e., roaming), and subnet hand-off (i.e., macro
    mobility) so that users can access the network from any location using their own
    mobile terminal. An advantage of HMMP is that it can spoof constant endpoints
    for mobile TCP connections and supports mobile TCP applications in a SIP environment
    without any changes to the TCP.</p>"
