abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the scenario in which DHCPv4 interaction is
    performed over IP-IP tunnel, and proposes methods to keep DHCP working under such
    situation. The main issue is encapsulation of DHCP packets on server side, and
    there are both in-protocol and out- of-protocol solutions for this issue. The
    in-protocol solution is to have DHCP carrying the encapsulation address information,
    and the out-of-protocol solution is to have the DHCP server keeping track of the
    address mapping by inspecting DHCP packets.</p>"
