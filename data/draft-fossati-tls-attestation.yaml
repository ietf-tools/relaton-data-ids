abstract:
- content: "<p>Attestation is the process by which an entity produces evidence about
    itself that another party can use to evaluate the trustworthiness of that entity.
    In use cases that require the use of remote attestation, such as confidential
    computing or device onboarding, an attester has to convey evidence or attestation
    results to a relying party. This information exchange may happen at different
    layers in the protocol stack. This specification provides a generic way of passing
    evidence and attestation results in the TLS handshake. Functionality-wise this
    is accomplished with the help of key attestation.</p>"
