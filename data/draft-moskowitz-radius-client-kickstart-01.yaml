abstract:
- content: "<p>RADIUS servers [2] require foreknowledge of the IP address of the RADIUS
    clients, as the shared secret is bound to the address. This has been a manageable
    situation when the RADIUS Clients were just NASs (Network Access Servers). With
    the advent of IEEE 802.1x [3], there is a significant increase in RADIUS clients
    in organizations not prepared to have the RADIUS Clients use fixed IP addresses
    and manage the shared secret. To address the concerns of the IEEE 802.1 and 802.11
    Task Groups a level of indirection is added; a Master secret bound to the name
    of the RADIUS client. This Master secret is created by the Shared Secret Provisioning
    Protocol [4]. For RADIUS Client Kickstart, SSPP is run over SNMP [5]. The Master
    Secret is used in an initial RADIUS exchange to create a session secret that is
    used as the normal RADIUS client shared secret. SSPP can be used to change the
    Master Secret whenever required.</p>"
