- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management for prioritized
    Quality of Service functionality within a LAN, between a CableHome residential
    gateway device and CableHome compliant LAN host devices. This memo specifies a
    MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set
    of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.</p>"
