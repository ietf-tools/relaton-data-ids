abstract:
- content: "<p>For the evaluation of network designs it is desirable to express their
    complexity in objective, measurable metrics. Previous work has shown that a large
    number of distinct, partly dependent scales play a role in overall complexity.
    This document proposes the use of multi- scale entropy metrics to describe the
    complexity of a network. We observe that the complexity of a network which undergoes
    no changes over a longer time period is constant. Conversely, when a network undergoes
    changes entropy is increasing; this is independent on whether the changes make
    the network more or less complex. In other words, also a simplification effort
    increases complexity temporarily.</p>"
