abstract:
- content: "<p>Manufacturer Usage Descriptions, or MUDs, allow a manufacturer to cheaply
    and simply describe to the network the accesses required by an IoT device without
    adding any extra cost or software to the devices themselves. By doing so, the
    network infrastructure devices can apply access policies automatically which increase
    the overall security of the entire network, not just for the IoT devices themselves.
    This document describes the lifecycle of Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs)
    by describing detailed MUD scenarios from the perspective of device manufacturers.</p>"
