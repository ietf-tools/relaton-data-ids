abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the requirements for a tunnel-based Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) Method. This tunnel method will use Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    to establish a secure tunnel. The tunnel will provide support for password authentication,
    EAP authentication, and the transport of additional data for other purposes. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
