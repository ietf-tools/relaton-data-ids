abstract:
- content: "<p>The discussion on instant messaging and a presence protocol is very
    much biased by the features, limitations, and mistakes of existing presence products.
    This document discusses those mistakes and many commonly heard misunderstandings.
    The document proposes a more advanced view (not a protocol) to presence systems,
    merging IM and PP. The discussion can be followed on the IMPP mailing list (impp@iastate.edu).</p>"
