abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low-
    power and lossy networks. The nodes generate a Cryptographically Generated Address
    using an Elliptic Curve Cryptography public key, register the Cryptographically
    Generated Address with a default router and periodically refresh the registration.
    Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described for secure
    neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks. Cryptographically generated
    address and digital signature are calculated using elliptic curve cryptography
    public key of the node.</p>"
