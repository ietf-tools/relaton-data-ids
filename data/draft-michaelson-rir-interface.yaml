- content: "<p>The CASM BoF at IETF98 discussed the need for Coordinated Address Space
    Management, in a 'downward' facing manner: the application of automatic configuration
    to information systems under the control of an entity. This document explores
    the requirements for 'upward' facing systems interfaces to permit the address
    space related information to be fetched from assigning bodies, and maintained
    inside their systems as required.</p>"
