abstract:
- content: "<p>This document summarizes the existing approaches for name resolution
    in various ICN architectures, and categorizes them into two groups: (1) standalone
    name resolution; (2) name based routing. It compares the two types of approaches
    from the aspects of update message overhead, resolution capability, node failure
    impact, and maintained database. And hybrid approaches also exist with a subnet
    of routers carrying out name based routing. Despite the coexistence of different
    name resolution approaches, the Name Resolution Service (NRS) is most essential
    service that shall be provided by the ICN infrastructure. The document gives the
    definition of NRS in ICN and proposes some requirements of NRS, i.e. resolution
    guarantee, delay sensitivity, minimum inter-domain traffic, failure resilience,
    accuracy, security and accessibility, scalability, and time transiency, support
    for manifest, interoperability, resolution result selection, heterogeneity, unspecified
