abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge for the
    infrastructure. The targeted services and the full deployment of virtualization
    in all segments of the network will be possible and necessary to provide some
    traffic-specific services near the next generation base stations where the radio
    is processed. Thus, service function chains that currently reside in the infrastructure
    of the Network operator (like, e.g. the Expeded Packet Gateway(EPG)) will be extended
    to the radio access network (RAN). In this draft we provide a non-exhaustive but
    representative list of service functions in 4G and 5G networks, and explore different
    scenarios for service-aware orchestration. We base on the problem statement [RFC7498]
    and architecture framework [RFC7665] of the SFC working group, as well on the
    existing mobile networks use cases [I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility] and the requirement
    gathering process of the ITU-R IMT 2020 [1] and different initiatives in Europe
    [2], Korea [3] and China [4] to anticipate network elements that will be needed
    in 5G networks. We then explore service-aware orchestration scenarios identifying
    where different network functions can be deployed in a fully virtualised future
    network, where both the core and the edge provide advanced virtualisation capabilities.</p>"
