abstract:
- content: "<p>Service providers are starting to deploy computing capabilities across
    the network for hosting applications such as distributed AI workloads, AR/VR,
    vehicle networks, and IoT, among others. In this network-compute environment,
    knowing information about the availability and state of the underlying communication
    and compute resources is necessary to determine both the proper deployment location
    of the applications and the most suitable servers on which to run them. Further,
    this information is used by numerous use cases with different interpretations.
    This document proposes an initial approach towards a common exposure scheme for
    metrics reflecting compute and communication capabilities.</p>"
