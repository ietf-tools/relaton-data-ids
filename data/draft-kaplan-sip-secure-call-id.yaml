abstract:
- content: "<p>Many SIP devices generate Call-ID values which contain their system
    IP Address, due to examples and normative text in RFC 3261. This Kaplan Expires
    September 1, 2009 [page 1] SIP Secure Call-ID March 2009 has led to some middleboxes,
    such as SBC's, to change the Call-ID for security reasons. This draft updates
    RFC 3261 to require SIP User Agents to generate benign Call-IDs, in such a manner
    that they can be detected as secure and not need to be changed.</p>"
