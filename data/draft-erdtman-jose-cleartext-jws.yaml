abstract:
- content: "<p>Cleartext JSON Web Signature (JWS) is a means of signing JSON objects
    directly without representing the JSON to be signed in a non-JSON representation,
    such as base64url-encoded JSON. The signature and information about the signature
    is added to the JSON object when it is signed. The signature calculation for signing
    the JSON object uses the JSON canonicalization defined by [I-D.rundgren-json-canonicalization-scheme].
    Cleartext JWS builds on the JWS, JWA, and JWK specifications, reusing data structures
    and semantics from these specifications, where applicable.</p>"
