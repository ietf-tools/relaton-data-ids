abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3270 defines how to support the Diffserv architecture in MPLS networks,
    including how to encode Diffserv Code Points (DSCPs) in an MPLS header. DSCPs
    may be encoded in the EXP field, while other uses of that field are not precluded.
    RFC 3270 makes no statement about how Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) marking
    might be encoded in the MPLS header. This document defines how an operator might
    define some of the EXP codepoints for explicit congestion notification, without
    precluding other uses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
