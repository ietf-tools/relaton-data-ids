abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines OSPF-xTE, an experimental traffic engineering
    (TE) extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF. OSPF-xTE defines new TE
    Link State Advertisements (LSAs) to disseminate TE metrics within an autonomous
    System (AS), which may consist of multiple areas. When an AS consists of TE and
    non-TE nodes, OSPF-xTE ensures that non-TE nodes in the AS are unaffected by the
    TE LSAs. OSPF-xTE generates a stand-alone TE Link State Database (TE-LSDB), distinct
    from the native OSPF LSDB, for computation of TE circuit paths. OSPF-xTE is versatile
    and extendible to non-packet networks such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)
    / Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) and optical networks. This memo defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
