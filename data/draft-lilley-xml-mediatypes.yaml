abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification standardizes three media types -- application/xml,
    application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd -- for use in
    exchanging network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) while defining text/xml and text/ xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases
    for the respective application/ types. This specification also standardizes a
    convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five
    types when those media types represent XML MIME entities. XML MIME entities are
    currently exchanged via the HyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web,
    are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol for remote web authoring, and are
    expected to have utility in many domains. Major differences from [RFC3023] are
    alignment of charset handling for text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity
    with application/ xml, the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers
    and base URIs, respectively, mention of the XPointer Registry, and updating of
    many references.</p>"
