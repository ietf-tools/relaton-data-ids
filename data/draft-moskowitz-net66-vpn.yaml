abstract:
- content: "<p>This document looks at a number of issues surrounding the need for
    network address translation (NAT) when IPsec is used to create virtual private
    networks (VPN). This document only looks at simple VPNs. That is VPNs consisting
    of a single IPsec tunnel as compared to VPNs consisting of \\021chained\\022 and/or
    \\021nested\\022 IPsec tunnels and/or transports. It proposes a method to vastly
    reduce the extent that NAT is needed in a VPN.</p>"
