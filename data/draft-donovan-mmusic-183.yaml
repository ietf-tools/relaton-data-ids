abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed extension of the Session Initia-
    tion Protocol. This extension would add the 183 Session Progress response message.
    The introduction of the 183 informational response message would allow a called
    user agent to indicate to the calling user agent whether or not the calling user
    agent should apply local alerting for the session. The existing 180 Ringing message
    would indicate that the calling user agent has the option of providing local alerting
    (and generally should). The 183 Session Progress message would indi- cate that
    the calling user agent should not provide local alerting and should establish
    a media session to be used by the called user agent to indicate the status of
    the session setup request as part of the indicated media stream.</p>"
