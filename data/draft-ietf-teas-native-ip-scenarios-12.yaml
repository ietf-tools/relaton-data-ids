abstract:
- content: "<p>Requirements for providing the End-to-End (E2E) performance assurance
    are emerging within the service provider networks. While there are various technology
    solutions, there is no single solution that can fulfill these requirements for
    a native IP network. In particular, there is a need for a universal E2E solution
    that can cover both intra- and inter-domain scenarios. One feasible E2E traffic-engineering
    solution is the addition of central control in a native IP network. This document
    describes various complex scenarios and simulation results when applying the Path
    Computation Element (PCE) in a native IP network. This solution, referred to as
    Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates the advantage of using
    distributed protocols and the power of a centralized control technology, providing
    traffic engineering for native IP networks in a manner that applies equally to
    intra- and inter-domain scenarios.</p>"
