abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extension of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing the insertion of interesting Circuit Interfaces
    into the ifTable. This is important for circuits that must be used within other
    MIB modules which require an ifEntry. It allows for integrated monitoring of circuits
    as well as routing to circuits using unaltered, pre-existing MIB modules. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
