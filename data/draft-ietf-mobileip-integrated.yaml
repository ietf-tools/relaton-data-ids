abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Mobility provides basic IP mobility for IP nodes. However, it does
    not provide any support for the large fraction of systems which require Vines,
    IPX, AppleTalk, CLNP, or other network layers for certain applications. While
    it would be preferable to have all applications run over IP, the reality is that
    there are many applications that simply will not make use of IP.</p>"
