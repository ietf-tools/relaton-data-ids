abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP is introducing the concept of slicing as a primary way of service
    delivery. Slicing at 3GPP implies the differentiation of services in terms of
    performance expectations as well as the connection of different network entities
    also potentially differentiated per slice. With that aim, 3GPP is defining a number
    of logical constructs with the intent of being served with specific characteristics,
    determined by different QoS profiles. This document describes the connectivity
    of 3GPP slices through IETF Network Slice services taking into account that specific
    service level objectives, and identifies gaps existing nowadays on both 3GPP and
    IETF specifications for an straightforward mapping of parameters between both
    environments.</p>"
