abstract:
- content: "<p>Capacity demands, Traffic Engineering (TE) and determinism are some
    of key requirements for various cellular, edge and industrial deployments. These
    deployments span from many underlying data pane technologies including native
    IPv4, native IPv6 along with MPLS and Segment Routing (SR). This document provides
    a framework for Preferred Path Routing (PPR). PPR is a method of providing path
    based dynamic routing for a number of packet types including IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS.
    This seamlessly works with a controller plane which holds both complete network
    view of operator policies, while distributed control plane providing self- healing
    benefits in a near-real time fashion. PPR builds on existing encapsulations at
    the edge nodes to add path identity to the packet. This reduces the per packet
    overhead required for path steering and therefore has a smaller impact on both
    packet MTU, data plane processing and overall goodput for small payload packets,
    while extending path steering benefits to any existing data plane. A number of
    extensions that allow expansion of use beyond simple point-to-point-paths are
    also described in this memo.</p>"
