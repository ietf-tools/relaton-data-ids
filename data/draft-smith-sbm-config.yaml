abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP and SBM
    implementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC 2206
    and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control of the base signaling
    protocols themselves, as well as a basic set of parameters for control of policy
    decisions by a Local Policy Module. These are not intended to be exhaustive lists
    but they have been identified as useful for practical implementations.</p>"
