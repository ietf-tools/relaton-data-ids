abstract:
- content: "<p>The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and defines
    the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices. 6top defines
    a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH schedule. To realize the full
    functionality of sensor networks and allow their adoption and use in real applications
    we need additional mechanisms. Specifically, we need to define how to interact
    with 6top, control and modify schedules, monitor parameters etc. Higher layers
    monitoring and management entities are then able to use these capabilities to
    create feedback loops. Although, there have been many custom implementations of
    such feedback loops between the routing, transport and MAC layers in sensor network
    deployments, there has been a lack of standards based approaches. The goal of
    the memo is to define a generic data model between monitoring and management entities
    and the 6top layer and define a mapping to the 6top commands. The document also
    presents a particular implementation of the model based on CoAP and CBOR.</p>"
