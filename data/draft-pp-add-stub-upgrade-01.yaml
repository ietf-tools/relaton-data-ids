abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods for a DNS stub resolver to upgrade
    its communications with a known recursive resolver to include encrytion using
    DoT or DoH. This protocol is designed for the scenario where the stub resolver
    already has the IP address of the recursive resolver. Other protocols under develpment
    address scenarios where the stub resolver wants to discover recursive resolvers
    that use DoT or DoH. This document does not cover such discovery.</p>"
