abstract:
- content: "<p>The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks defines a generic
    Distance Vector protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, many of which exhibit
    strongly asymmetrical characteristics. This draft proposes an extension for that
    optimizes RPL operations whereby upwards and downwards direction-optimized RPL
    instances are associated.</p>"
