abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of existing clients and servers currently support the 'poppassd'
    protocol for changing passwords. This protocol is extremely insecure, as it transmits
    the user name, current and new passwords in clear text. It also has more round-trips
    than needed, and lacks an extension mechanism. In addition, it is not possible
    to specify for which service(s) the password is to be changed. The protocol also
    traditionally usurps port 106, which is actually assigned for a different purpose.</p>"
