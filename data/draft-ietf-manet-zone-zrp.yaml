abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) framework,
    a hybrid routing framework suitable for a wide variety of mobile ad-hoc networks,
    especially those with large network spans and diverse mobility patterns. Each
    node proactively maintains routes within a local region (referred to as the routing
    zone). Knowledge of the routing zone topology is leveraged by the ZRP to improve
    the efficiency of a globally reactive route query/reply mechanism. The proactive
    maintenance of routing zones also helps improve the quality of discovered routes,
    by making them more robust to changes in network topology. The ZRP can be configured
    for a particular network by proper selection of a single parameter, the routing
    zone radius.</p>"
