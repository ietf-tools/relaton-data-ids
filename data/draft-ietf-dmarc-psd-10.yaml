abstract:
- content: "<p>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
    is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating organization can express domain-level
    policies and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, that
    a mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling. The design of
    DMARC presumes that domain names represent either nodes in the tree below which
    registrations occur, or nodes where registrations have occurred; it does not permit
    a domain name to have both of these properties simultaneously. Since its deployment
    in 2015, use of DMARC has shown a clear need for the ability to express policy
    for these domains as well. Domains at which registrations can occur are referred
    to as Public Suffix Domains (PSDs). This document describes an extension to DMARC
    to enable DMARC functionality for PSDs. This document also seeks to address implementations
    that consider a domain on a public Suffix list to be ineligible for DMARC enforcement.</p>"
