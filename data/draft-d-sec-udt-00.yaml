abstract:
- content: "<p>UDT does not have its specific security mechanism. It depends on the
    application to provide authentication and lower layer to provide security mechanisms[GG07].
    However, UDT implementations should check each arrived packets are from the expected
    source, since UDP is connectionless. This document proposes evaluation of security
    requirements for UDT, or UDP based Data Transfer considered as an alternative
    data transfer protocol for the situation when TCP does not work well.The objective
    is to achieve a wide class of security methods used on existing mature protocols
    such as UDP and TCP.</p>"
