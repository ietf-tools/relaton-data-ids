abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the specification of the PINT Profile 1.0, which
    defines a protocol for invoking certain telephone services from an IP network.
    These services include placing basic calls, sending and receiving faxes, and receiving
    content over the telephone. The protocol is specified as a set of enhancements
    and additions to the SIP 2.0 and SDP 2.0 protocols. This document is intended
    for the PSTN-Internet Interworking (PINT) working group of the Internet Engineering
    Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
    mailing list at pint@lists.research.bell-labs.com and/or the authors.</p>"
