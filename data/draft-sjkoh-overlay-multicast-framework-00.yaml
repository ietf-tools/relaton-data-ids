abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP) used
    for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known as Application Layer
    Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data delivery scheme for multicast applications,
    in which one or more intermediate relay agents are employed for relaying application
    data from a sender to many receivers along a pre-configured or automatically configured
    tree hierarchy. For standardization of Overlay Multicast, it needs to separate
    the data plane (for packet relaying) and the control plane (for tree configuration
    and session monitoring). We describe a control protocol for Overlay Multicast,
    named Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP). In OMCP, a special-purpose entity,
    called Session Manager, is used to manage and control the tree configuration and
    session monitoring. OMCP is designed to ensure that the multicast applications
    and services can be provided over current Internet environments in which IP multicast
    has not completely been deployed.</p>"
