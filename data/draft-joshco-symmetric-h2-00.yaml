    HTTP, which makes a simplifying assumption that the client-side HTTP server is
    only accessible and addressible by the server that accepted the HTTP/2 connection.
    Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Source
    for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/joshco/sh2.</p>"
