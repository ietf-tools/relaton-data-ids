abstract:
- content: "<p>The Softwire Mesh Framework provides a solution for intra-Autonomous
    System (AS) softwire, but not inter-AS softwire. The ability to provide inter-AS
    softwire extends the benefits of softwire to a larger scale. Indeed, the above
    Framework discusses the possibility of inter-AS softwire, but does not provide
    a solution. This document defines a specific BGP Extended Community attribute
    called the Tunnel Endpoint Extended Community, which allows for inter-AS softwire.</p>"
