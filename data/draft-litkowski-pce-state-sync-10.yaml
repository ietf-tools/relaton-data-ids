abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computation in
    response to a Path Computation Client (PCC) request. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. A Path Computation Client (PCC) can
    synchronize an LSP state information to a Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).
    The stateful PCE extension allows a redundancy scenario where a PCC can have redundant
    PCEP sessions towards multiple PCEs. In such a case, a PCC gives control of a
    LSP to only a single PCE, and only one PCE is responsible for path computation
    for this delegated LSP. There are some use cases, where an inter-PCE stateful
    communication can bring additional resiliency in the design, for instance when
    some PCC-PCE session fails. The inter-PCE stateful communication may also provide
    a faster update of the LSP states when such an event occurs. Finally, when, in
    a redundant PCE scenario, there is a need to compute a set of paths that are part
    of a group (so there is a dependency between the paths), there may be some cases
    where the computation of all paths in the group is not handled by the same PCE:
    this situation is called a split-brain. This split-brain scenario may lead to
    computation loops between PCEs or suboptimal path computation. This document describes
    the procedures to allow a stateful communication between PCEs for various use-cases
    and also the procedures to prevent computations loops.</p>"
