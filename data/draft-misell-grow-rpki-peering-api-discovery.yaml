abstract:
- content: "<p>The Peering API currently under discussion in the GROW Working Group
    does not provide a mechanism for discovering the API endpoints that an ASN uses
    to accept peering requests. This document defines a new RPKI Signed Object to
    publicise this endpoint and allow discovery. Discussion This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be
    found at https://github.molgen.mpg.de/q/rpki-peering-api-discovery.</p>"
