abstract:
- content: "<p>This method introduces a specification in the Mobile IPv6 MONAMI6 work
    that allow nodes to bind a particular flow based on the service port to a care-of
    address. This method is different and more flexible than a current solution in
    the Internet community in that multiple ranges of ports and individual specific
    ports not in any defined range may be specified within a single flow identification
    message. This is an idea that may be adopted or incorporated into currently proposed
    MONAMI6 flow redirection proposals.</p>"
