abstract:
- content: <p>The metadata of an RFC can include a tag called "Updates" which can
    be used to link a new RFC to an existing RFC. On publication of such an RFC, the
    existing RFC will include an additional metadata tag called "Updated by" which
    provides a link to the new RFC. However, this tag pair is not well-defined and
    therefore it is currently used for multiple different purposes, which leads to
    confusion about the actual meaning of this tag and inconsistency in its use. This
    document recommends the discontinuation of the use of the updates/updated by tag
    pair, and instead proposes three new tag pairs that have well-defined meanings
    and use cases.</p>
