abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends RFC 4291 for IPv6 over modern Non-Broadcast /
    Non-Transitive networks that decouples the IP concepts of Interface, Link and
    Subnet from the physical concepts of interface, link and broadcast domain, to
    apply on networks where relying on broadcast is undesirable. A study of the issues
    with ND-Classic over wireless media is presented, and a framework to solve those
    issues within the new architecture is proposed.</p>"
