    status of a digital credential. These assertions are periodically provided to
    holders, who can present these to verifier along with the corresponding digital
    credentials. The approach outlined in this document makes the verifier able to
    check the non-revocation of a digital credential without requiring to query any
    third-party entities.</p>"
