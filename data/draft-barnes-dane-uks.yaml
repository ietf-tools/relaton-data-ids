abstract:
- content: "<p>Unknown key-share attacks are a class of attacks that allow an attacker
    to deceive one peer of a secure communication as to the identity of the remote
    peer. When used with traditional, PKI-based authentication, TLS-based applications
    are generally safe from unknown key-share attacks. DNS-based Authentication of
    Named Entities (DANE), however, proposes that applications perform a different
    set of checks as part of authenticating a TLS connection. As a result, DANE as
    currently specified is likely to lead to unknown key-share attacks when clients
    support DANE for authentication. We describe these risks and some simple mitigations.</p>"
