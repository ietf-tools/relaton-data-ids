abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider Backbone
    Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection
    of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a connectionless
    technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control
    plane for loop avoidance and load balancing. As a result, the coverage of the
    solution is limited by STP scale in the core of large service provider networks.
    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution for extending
    Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS
    backbone without running (M)STP across the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been
    deployed on a large scale in service provider networks. This draft discusses extensions
    to the VPLS model required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining
    the Service Provider fit of the initial model.</p>"
