abstract:
- content: "<p>In the TLS/DTLS Content provider Edge Server Split use case, a TLS
    Client uses TLS/DTLS to authenticates the Content Provider while establishing
    a TLS/DTLS session with the Edge Server. Such authentication scheme is designated
    as Split Authentication in this document. In most cases, the Edge Server does
    not even belong to the Content Provider, but instead to a third party like, for
    example, a Content Delivery Network. As a result, the Content Provider and the
    Edge Server must be able to interact and/or share some information. Interactions
    and shared information constitutes a split authentication model varies with the
    authentication method involved in the TLS session. For each TLS/DTLS authentication
    method, the document provides the associated split authentication model that makes
    possible a split authentication. The split authentication model is associated
    to security requirements and an analysis to show it does not introduce any weakness
    compared to the standard TLS authentication model.</p>"
