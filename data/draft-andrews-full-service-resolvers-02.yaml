abstract:
- content: "<p>Practice has shown that there are a number of zones all full service
    resolvers should, unless configured otherwise, automatically serve. RFC4193 already
    specifies that this should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA. This document extends the practice
    to cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for RFC1918 address space and other well known
    zones with similar usage constraints.</p>"
