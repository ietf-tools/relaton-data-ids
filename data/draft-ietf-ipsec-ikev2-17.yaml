abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes version 2 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
    protocol. IKE is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication
    and establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs). This version of
    the IKE specification combines the contents of what were previously separate documents,
    including Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP, RFC
    2408), IKE (RFC 2409), the Internet Domain of Interpretation (DOI, RFC 2407),
    Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal, Legacy authentication, and remote
    address acquisition. Version 2 of IKE does not interoperate with version 1, but
    it has enough of the header format in common that both versions can unambiguously
    run over the same UDP port. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
