- content: "<p>The use of reputation systems is has become a common tool in many applications
    that seek to apply collected intelligence about traffic sources. Often this is
    done because it is common or even expected operator practice. It is therefore
    important to be aware of a number of considerations for both operators and consumers
    of the data. This document includes a collection of the best advice available
    regarding providers and consumers of reputation data, based on experience to date.

    are generally applicable.</p>"
