abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Killer Reservation Problem encountered
    when merging RSVP reservation requests. These requests get merged as they travel
    up the multicast distribution tree, losing information about individual requests.
    A request, which would have succeeded on its own, may suffer denial of service
    when the 'merged request' fails admission control. This is the problem for which
    we present different solutions.</p>"
