abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Anonymous Credit Tokens (ACT), a privacy- preserving
    authentication protocol that enables numerical credit systems without tracking
    individual clients. Based on keyed- verification anonymous credentials and privately
    verifiable BBS-style signatures, the protocol allows issuers to grant tokens containing
    credits that clients can later spend anonymously with that issuer. The protocol's
    key features include: (1) unlinkable transactions - the issuer cannot correlate
    credit issuance with spending, or link multiple spends by the same client, (2)
    partial spending - clients can spend a portion of their credits and receive anonymous
    change, and (3) double-spend prevention through cryptographic nullifiers that
    preserve privacy while ensuring each token is used only once. Anonymous Credit
    Tokens are designed for modern web services requiring rate limiting, usage-based
    billing, or resource allocation while respecting user privacy. Example applications
    include rate limiting and API credits. This document is a product of the Crypto
    Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>"
