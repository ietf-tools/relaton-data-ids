abstract:
- content: <p>There are some situations in which multiplexing a number of small packets
    into a bigger one is desirable. For example, a number of small packets can be
    sent together between a pair of machines if they share a common network path.
    Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing
    the network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate
    routers. This document describes Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a number
    of packets belonging to different protocols into a single packet. It includes
    the "Protocol" field on each multiplexing header, thus allowing the inclusion
    of a number of packets belonging to different protocols on a packet of another
    protocol. The size of the multiplexing headers is kept very low (it may be a single
    byte when multiplexing small packets) in order to reduce the overhead.</p>
