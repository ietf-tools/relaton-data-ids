- content: "<p>The definition of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is specified
    abstractly, and does not detail a particular implementation. The abstract definition
    of IPP is contained within the 'IPP Model' document, a separate document available
    at the Printer Working Group IPP web page HTTP://www.pwg.org/. This document attempts
    to map IPP Model operations and semantics to HTTP 1.1 equivalent operations.</p>"
