abstract:
- content: "<p>SIDR working group is working on an extended architecture for interdomain
    routing security framework. One of the functions that this architecture should
    provide is origin authentication of prefixes for BGP, i.e. a BGP speaker must
    be able to determine whether an AS (autonomous system) is authorized to originate
    certain prefixes. This draft documents some ideas from the perspective of internal
    control in order to alleviate this problem.</p>"
