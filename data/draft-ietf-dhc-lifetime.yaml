- content: "<p>This document describes a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
    (DHCPv6) option for specifying an upper bound for how long a client should wait
    before refreshing information retrieved from DHCPv6. It is used with stateless
    DHCPv6 as there are no addresses or other entities with lifetimes that can tell
    the client when to contact the DHCPv6 server to refresh its configuration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
