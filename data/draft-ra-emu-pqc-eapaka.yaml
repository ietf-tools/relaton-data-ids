abstract:
- content: "<p>Forward Secrecy for the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for
    Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA' FS) is specified in [I-D.ietf-emu-aka-pfs],
    providing updates to [RFC9048] with an optional extension that offers ephemeral
    key exchange using the traditional Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE)
    key agreement algorithm for achieving perfect forward secrecy (PFS). However,
    it is susceptible to future threats from Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers,
    which could potentially compromise a traditional ephemeral public key. If the
    adversary has also obtained knowledge of the long-term key and ephemeral public
    key, it could compromise session keys generated as part of the authentication
    run in EAP-AKA'. This draft aims to enhance the security of EAP-AKA' FS making
    it quantum-safe using Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (PQ- KEMs).</p>"
