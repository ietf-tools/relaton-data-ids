abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings,
    and over the past few years several approaches to a better WHOIS have been discussed
    and proposed. Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different
    WHOIS services. For users this implies that several WHOIS queries to different
    registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a given resource. This
    document describes a proof-of-concept redirection service for RESTful WHOIS queries
    as implemented by LACNIC. This service allows users to query a single WHOIS service
    and be redirected to the authoritative registry. The main goal of this document
    is to encourage discussion on the topics of Joint WHOIS services and query redirection
    in a RESTful WHOIS world. The solution implemented by LACNIC proposed here applies
    to numbering resources (IPv4, IPv6 and autonomous system numbers).</p>"
