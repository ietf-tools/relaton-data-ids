abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Random Binary Forward Error Correcting
    (FEC) Scheme for the Erasure Coding Extension [ErasureCoding] to the DTN Bundle
    Protocol [RFC5050]. The Random Binary FEC scheme is a Fully-Specified FEC scheme
    adhering to the specification guidelines of the FEC Building Block [RFC5052].
    The DTN Bundle protocol is used as the Content Delivery Protocol. This FEC scheme
    is one of many possible FEC schemes that may be used by the Erasure Coding Extension.
    The Random Binary FEC scheme has several properties that makes it efficient in
    the case where Data Objects are divided into hundreds to thousands of source-symbols
    and where the resources available of decoding are substantially greater than the
    resources available for encoding.</p>"
