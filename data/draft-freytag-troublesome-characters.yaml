abstract:
- content: "<p>Unicode's design goal is to be the universal character set for all
    applications. The goal entails the inclusion of very large numbers of characters.
    It is also focused on written language in general; special provisions have always
    been needed for identifiers. The sheer size of the repertoire increases the possibility
    of accidental or intentional use of characters that can cause confusion among
    users, particularly where linguistic context is ambiguous, unavailable, or impossible
    to determine. A registry of code points that can be sometimes especially problematic
    may be useful to guide system administrators in setting parameters for allowable
    code points or combinations in an identifier system, and to aid applications in
    creating security aids for users.</p>"
