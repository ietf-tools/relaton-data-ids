abstract:
- content: <p>Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent
    using spoofed addresses -- "spoofed" in this case means that the address is used
    without the permission of the domain owner. This document describes a family of
    tests by which SMTP servers can determine whether an e-mail address in a received
    message was used with the permission of the owner of the domain contained in that
    e-mail address. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
