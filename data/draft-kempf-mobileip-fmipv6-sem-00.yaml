abstract:
- content: "<p>The FMIPv6 draft proposes a number of changes in the local link and
    routing information exchange architecture for wireless networks that are not quite
    aligned with standard IETF protocols, including the base MIPv6 protocol itself.
    This draft proposes modifications of FMIPv6 to tighten the semantics of anticipated
    care-of address configuration around the prehandover signaling as a logical extension
    of Router Discovery, and around the HI/HAck exchange as a logical extension of
    routing information propagation. It also proposes some extensions to Router Discovery
    for reactive handover to piggyback signaling for quickly establishing a tunnel
    to the Previous Access Router on top of standard RFC 2461 Router Discovery signaling.</p>"
