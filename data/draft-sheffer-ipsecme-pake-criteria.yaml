abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPsecME working group has been chartered with specifying a new
    password-based authentication method for IKEv2. This document presents a few solution
    alternatives, and lists potential criteria for choosing among them. It is not
    the author's intention to publish this document as an RFC. Moreover, it is more
    subjective than most IETF documents.</p>"
