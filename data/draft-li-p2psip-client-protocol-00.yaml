abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the motivation, design guidelines and high level
    descriptions of peer-to-peer session initiation protocol (P2PSIP) client protocol,
    which is spoken between P2PSIP peers and P2PSIP clients. In this document, the
    necessity of P2PSIP Client is identified firstly. Then, two fundamental guidelines
    for our design are explained in details. Following these guidelines, the design
    of proposed protocol and new extensions to existing SIP (session initiation protocol)
    are described. Such a SIP-based protocol not only makes itself backward-compatible
    with the vast existing SIP devices, but also provides extra functions to satisfy
    some particular requirements raised by P2PSIP.</p>"
