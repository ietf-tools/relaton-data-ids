abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes detailed models for analysis of proposed protocols
    for Quality of Service (QoS) delivery with IPv4 (including multicast). The models
    have been developed using the OPNET simulation package. They are intended to allow
    investigation of performance using proposed protocols and should have wide applicability
    in the Internet QoS community. We are making these models publicly available with
    the intention that they can be used to provide expanded studies of Qos delivery
    for both unicast and multicast, using IntServ, DiffServ, and MPLS. This Internet-Draft
    is intended to form the basis for an Informational RFC that extends the previous
    RFC2490.</p>"
