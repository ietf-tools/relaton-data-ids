abstract:
- content: "<p>For the purpose of this document, subnetworks are defined as virtual
    topologies that span connected network regions bounded by encapsulating border
    nodes. These virtual topologies may span multiple IP and/or sub-IP layer forwarding
    hops, and can introduce failure modes due to packet duplication and/or links with
    diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs). This document specifies a Subnetwork
    Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that accommodates such virtual topologies
    over diverse underlying link technologies. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
