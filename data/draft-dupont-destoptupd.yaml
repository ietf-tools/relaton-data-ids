abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 specification [1] defines a header chain with two kinds of
    headers, non-terminal and terminal. Two non-terminal headers can carry options
    and one is very specialized for hop-by-hop processing so the destination option
    header is used for many purposes, including some not considered in [1] like mobility
    [2].</p>"
