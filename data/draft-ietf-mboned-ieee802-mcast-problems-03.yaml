abstract:
- content: <p>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast
    in 802.11 [dot11], [mc-props], [mc-prob-stmt], and other local-area wireless environments.
    IETF multicast experts have been meeting together to discuss these issues and
    provide IEEE updates. The mboned working group is chartered to receive regular
    reports on the current state of the deployment of multicast technology, create
    "practice and experience" documents that capture the experience of those who have
    deployed and are deploying various multicast technologies, and provide feedback
    to other relevant working groups. This document offers guidance on known limitations
    and problems with wireless multicast. Also described are various multicast enhancement
    features that have been specified at IETF and IEEE 802 for wireless media, as
    well as some operational chioces that can be taken to improve the performace of
    the network. Finally, some recommendations are provided about the usage and combination
    of these features and operational choices.</p>
