abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the
    Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process referred to as
    handover. Several proposals [5] and [6] were made in order to improve the handover
    delay to support real-time traffic, such as Voice over IP. These proposals keep
    a fundamental characteristic of Mobile IP, namely the handover process is triggered
    by the Mobile Terminal. This document expands this concept to cover situations
    where the handover has to be performed by network management issues, such as spectrum
    allocation. The document describes a control architecture based on the policy
    management.</p>"
