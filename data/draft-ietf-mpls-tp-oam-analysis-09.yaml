abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the Operations, Administration,
    and Maintenance (OAM) toolset for MPLS-based transport networks. The toolset consists
    of a comprehensive set of fault management and performance monitoring capabilities
    (operating in the data plane) that are appropriate for transport networks as required
    in RFC 5860 and support the network and services at different nested levels. This
    overview includes a brief recap of the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) OAM requirements
    and functions and the generic mechanisms created in the MPLS data plane that allow
    the OAM packets to run in-band and share their fate with data packets. The protocol
    definitions for each of the MPLS-TP OAM tools are defined in separate documents
    (RFCs or Working Group documents), which are referenced by this document. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
