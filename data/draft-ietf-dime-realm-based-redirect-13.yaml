abstract:
- content: <p>The Diameter protocol includes a capability for message redirection,
    controlled by an application-independent "redirect agent". In some circumstances,
    an operator may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without specifying
    individual hosts. This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by
    which a Diameter server or proxy (node) can perform such a redirection when the
    Straightforward-Naming Authority Pointer (S-NAPTR) is not used for dynamic peer
    discovery. A node performing this new function is referred to as a "Realm-based
    Redirect Server". This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC 6733 with respect
    to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time Attribute-Value
    Pairs (AVPs).</p>
