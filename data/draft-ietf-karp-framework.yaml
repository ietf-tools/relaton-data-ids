abstract:
- content: <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of "Unwanted
    Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop is documented in RFC 4948 [RFC4948].
    Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for "[t]ightening the security of the core routing
    infrastructure." Four main steps were identified for improving the security of
    the routing infrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routing protocols'
    packets on the wire." One mechanism for securing routing protocol packets on the
    wire is the use of per-packet cryptographic message authentication, providing
    both peer authentication and message integrity. Many different routing protocols
    exist and they employ a range of different transport subsystems. Therefore there
    must necessarily be various methods defined for applying cryptographic authentication
    to these varying protocols. Many routing protocols already have some method for
    accomplishing cryptographic message authentication. However, in many cases the
    existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and/or employ cryptographic
    algorithms that have been deprecated. This document is one of a series concerned
    with defining a roadmap of protocol specification work for the use of modern cryptogrpahic
    mechanisms and algorithms for message authentication in routing protocols. In
    particular, it defines the framework for a key management protocol that may be
    used to create and manage session keys for message authentication and integrity.
    The overall roadmap reflects the input of both the security area and routing area
    in order to form a jointly agreed upon and prioritized work list for the effort.</p>
