abstract:
- content: <p>The security provided by authenticated TLS connection between clients
    and servers should protect both parties from "Man-in- the-Middle" (MITM) attacks.
    Clients should be authenticating that their server connection is to the server
    they requested. Servers that act as client agents need to authenticate that the
    connection is directly to their client secure against eavesdropping or account/password
    hacking. An extension to the Domain Name System (DNS), The DNS-Based Authentication
    of Named Entities (DANE) (RFC 6698), allows TLS servers to publish their public
    certificates for use by TLS clients to authenticate the server connection.</p>
