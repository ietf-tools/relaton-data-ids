abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architecture framework and functional requirements
    for Service in the PSTN/IN Requesting Internet Service (SPIRITS). The framework
    describes relationships between functional entities for interactions between the
    PSTN and SPIRITS Server and provides requirements for the SPIRITS protocol. This
    document is submitted to the IETF SPIRITS working group for discussion and comment.
    Discussion on this topic should be sent to the SPIRITS mailing list (spirits@lists.research.bell-labs.com).</p>"
