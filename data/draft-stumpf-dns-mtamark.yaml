abstract:
- content: <p>In contrast to other more extensive approaches to deal with unsolicited
    email, commonly called "spam", this memo discusses a very simple authentication
    scheme. It uses marking of hosts in reverse DNS (IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones)
    to allow the receiving mail transfer agents to decide whether the connecting (sending)
    host is a designated mail transfer agent (MTA) or not. Despite being a weaker
    scheme than most of the other proposals currently discussed, it can reduce the
    amount of spam and viruses/ worms significantly and has the advantage that it
    can be implemented based on existing and well-established Internet technology
    like DNS without any changes to that technology. This document is part of the
    LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research Group (ASRG) of the IRTF.</p>
