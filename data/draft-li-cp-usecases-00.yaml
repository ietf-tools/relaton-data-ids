abstract:
- content: "<p>It is commonly assumed that a system controller or network management
    system has complete knowledge of the data plane, especially in a software-defined
    network (SDN). That is, the controller knows performance metrics such as the flow
    table size of each switch, the rate of rule updates between a switch control plane
    and its data plane, and the maximum latency to install a rule in the flow table
    of a switch. However, in reality, this is not the case. Measurement studies show
    that the flow table size depends on the structure of the rules installed. The
    flow table size is much smaller if there are many wild card rules. The setup latency
    also depends on the already installed rules. If there are many wild card rules
    installed, the latency can be much higher. Currently, data centers pre-setup the
    rules long before the actual associated traffic starts to flow through the network.
    This puts constraints on the use cases. In this document, we first show that many
    use cases demand a more predictable control plane. The use cases are applied to
    networks that require control-plane performance information for dynamic configuration,
    as well as SDN networks. We then discuss potential mechanisms to enable fine-grained
    control of control-plane performance.</p>"
