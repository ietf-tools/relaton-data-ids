abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), described in [1], pro-
    vides a standard mechanism for support of additional authentication methods within
    PPP. Through the use of EAP, support for a number of authentication schemes may
    be added, including smart cards, Kerberos, Public Key, One Time Passwords, and
    others. In order to provide for support of EAP within RADIUS, two new attributes,
    EAP-Message and Sig- nature, were introduced as RADIUS extensions in [4]. This
    document describes how these new attributes may be used for providing EAP sup-
    port within RADIUS.</p>"
