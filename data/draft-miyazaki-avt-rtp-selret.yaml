abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new RTP payload format and a new RTCP packet
    format to enable multiple selective retransmissions of generic media data. This
    payload format is especially applicable in a RTP-RX profile as described in [9].
    While RTP is widely used for media streaming applications over the Internet, using
    it over unreliable links needs some further modifications to achieve a good quality
    of the media stream at the receiver. The aforementioned RTP-RX profile describes
    a generic retransmission mechanism to make RTP more reliable. This payload format
    description increases the reliability and decreases the bandwidth requirements
    of such a generic profile by introducing the concept of multiple selective retransmissions.</p>"
