abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. This document
    describes a Network Control Protocol which will allow the two ends of a connection
    to agree to carry out protocol spoofing when an idle link is temporarily disconnected
    in order to save on connection charges. This work was originally motivated by
    the desire to exploit the fast call setup capability of ISDN, but is equally applicable
    in any situation in which a PPP connection is made over a link which can be temporarily
    suspended for whatever reason.</p>"
