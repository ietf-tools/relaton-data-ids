abstract:
- content: "<p>Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must
    share a common format and transport mechanism. The Incident Object Description
    Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for document exchange. This
    draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all IODEF documents and extensions to facilitate
    an interoperable and secure communication of documents. The SOAP wrapper allows
    for flexibility in the selection of a transport protocol. The transport protocols
    will be provided through existing standards and SOAP binding, such as SOAP over
    HTTP(S) and SOAP over BEEP.</p>"
