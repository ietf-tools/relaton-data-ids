abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines an approach to mitigate the negative impact
    on networks resulting from maintenance activities. It includes guidance for both
    IP networks and Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). The approach is to ensure BGP-4
    sessions that will be affected by maintenance are forcefully torn down before
    the actual maintenance activities commence.</p>"
