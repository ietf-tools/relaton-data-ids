abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) all-active multi-
    homing procedures in Network Virtualization Over Layer-3 (NVO3) networks provide
    the required Split Horizon filtering, Designated Forwarder Election and Aliasing
    functions that the network needs in order to handle the traffic to and from the
    multi-homed CE in an efficient way. In particular, the Aliasing function addresses
    the load balancing of unicast packets from remote Network Virtualization Edge
    (NVE) devices to the NVEs that are multi-homed to the same CE, irrespective of
    the learning of the CE's MAC/IP information on the NVEs. This document describes
    an optional optimization of the EVPN multi-homing Aliasing function - EVPN Anycast
    Multi-homing - that is specific to the use of EVPN with NVO3 tunnels (i.e., IP
    tunnels) and, in typical Data Center designs, may provide some benefits that are
    discussed in the document.</p>"
