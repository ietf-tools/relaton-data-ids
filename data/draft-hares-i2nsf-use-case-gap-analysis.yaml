abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a summary of the I2NSF use cases plus a summary
    of the stat of the art in industries and IETF work which is relevant to the Interface
    to Network Security Function (I2NSF). The I2NSF focus is to define data models
    and interfaces in order to control and monitor the physical and virtual aspects
    of network security functions. The use cases are organized in two basic scenarios.
    In the access network scenario, mobile and residential users access NSF capabilities
    using their network service provider infrastructure. In the data center scenario
    customers manage NSFs hosted in the data center infrastructure.</p>"
