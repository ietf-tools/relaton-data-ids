abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the DISCOVER opcode, an experimental extension
    to the Domain Name System (DNS) to use multicast queries for resource discovery.
    This opcode was tested in experiments run during 1995 and 1996 for the TBDS project.
    This was the first known use of multicast transport for DNS. A client multicasts
    a DNS query using the DISCOVER opcode and processes the multiple responses that
    may result.</p>"
