abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to facilitate remote administration and auditing of LDAP server
    operation, it is desirable to provide the server's operational logs themselves
    as a searchable LDAP directory. These logs may also be used as a persistent change
    log to support various replication mechanisms. This document defines a schema
    that may be used to represent all of the requests that have been processed by
    an LDAP server. It may be used by various applications for auditing, flight recorder,
    replication, and other purposes.</p>"
