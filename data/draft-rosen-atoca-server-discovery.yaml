abstract:
- content: "<p>The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML document format for exchanging
    emergency alerts and public warnings. Different organizations issue alerts for
    specific geographic regions. The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol
    provides a way to discover servers that distribute these alerts for a geographical
    region. This document defines the Service Uniform Resource Names (URN)s for warnings
    in the same way as they have been defined with RFC 5031 for citizen-to-authority
    emergency services. Additionally, this document suggests to use LoST for the discovery
    of servers distributing alerts.</p>"
