abstract:
- content: "<p>Individuals and organizations have expressed a wish to have the ability
    to send encrypted and/or digitally signed email end-to-end. One key obstacle to
    end-to-end email security is the difficulty in discovering, obtaining, and validating
    email credentials across administrative domains. This document addresses foreseeable
    adoption obstacles for encrypted and digitally signed email in enterprises, and
    outlines requirements. Some of the requirements below are not DANE specific, and
    all may not be solvable with a DANE solution, but are included for completeness
    and as an attempt to give a holistic view of enterprise email security requirements.</p>"
