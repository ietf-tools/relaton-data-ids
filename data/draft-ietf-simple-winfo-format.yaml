abstract:
- content: "<p>Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to)
    information about a resource. There is fairly complex state associated with these
    subscriptions. The union of the state for all subscriptions to a particular resource
    is called the watcher information for that resource. This state is dynamic, changing
    as subscribers come and go. As a result, it is possible, and indeed useful, to
    subscribe to the watcher information for a particular resource. In order to enable
    this, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers on a resource. This
    specification describes an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document format for
    such state. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
