abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPEG Committee (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG11) is a working group in ISO
    that recently produced the MPEG-4 [1] standard. MPEG defines tools to compress
    content such as audio-visual information into elementary streams. In [6] a generic
    RTP payload format is defined for transport of any non-multiplexed MPEG-4 elementary
    stream. To achieve the generic MPEG-4 functionality, [6] addresses detailed issues
    related to the MPEG-4 SL layer. However, many initial applications will not use
    the SL Layer. To facilitate usage of [6] by such applications, this document describes
    how to use [6] when no SL layer is used.</p>"
