abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP) for
    network traffic authorization on the Internet, the Permission-Based Sending (PBS)
    NSLP. This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and other forms
    of unauthorized traffic. PBS NSLP is based on a hybrid approach: a proactive approach
    of explicitly granting permissions and a reactive approach of monitoring and countering
    attacks. Signaling installs and maintains the permission state of routers for
    a data flow. A monitoring mechanism provides a second line of defense against
    attacks. PBS NSLP uses two security mechanisms: message security for protecting
    the integrity of the message on end-to-end traffic and channel security for protecting
    the integrity and confidentiality between adjacent nodes. To authenticate data
    packets, the PBS NSLP requests a sender to use an existing security protocol,
    the IPsec Authentication Header (AH).</p>"
