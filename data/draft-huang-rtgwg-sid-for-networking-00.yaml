abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for establishing
    networking connections?anywhere and anytime, alongside the availability of highly
    distributive?any-cloud services. Such a demand motivates the need to efficiently
    interconnect heterogeneous entities, e.g., different domains of network and cloud
    owned by different providers, with the goal of reducing cost, e.g., overheads
    and end-to-end latency, while ensuring the overall performance satisfies the requirements
    of the applications. Considering that different network domains and cloud providers
    may adopt different types of technologies, the key of interconnection and efficient
    coordination is to employ a unified interface that can be understood by heterogeneous
    parties which could derive the consistent requirements of the same service and
    treat the service traffic appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies.
    Therefore, service ID is one promising candidate for the unified interface since
    it could be designed to be lightweight, secure, and enables fast and efficient
    packet treatment. Leveraging service ID, addressing and networking among heterogeneous
    network domains and cloud providers can be accomplished by establishing the mapping
    between the unified service ID and the specific technologies used by a network
    domain or a cloud provider. This document provides typical use cases of unified
    service ID for addressing and routing (SIAN), validating that interconnecting
    different network domains or cloud providers can be achieved at lower cost without
    sacrificing the performance of application compared with existing methods of which
    problems as well as gaps have also been illustrated. The requirements for SIAN
    are also derived for each of the scenarios. Finally, a framework solution is demonstrated.</p>"
