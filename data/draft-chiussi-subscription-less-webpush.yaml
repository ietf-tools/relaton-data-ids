abstract:
- content: "<p>Subscription is a integral part of the current Web Push service. However,
    the current explicit subscription requirement makes it difficult to use web push
    in a number of use cases where there may be a need to reach User Agents that are
    not subscribed to the Web Push service. In addition, the current Web Push subscription
    model does not provide a mechanism to achieve coordination and control among subscriptions
    associated to different applications. This document describes a framework for
    making subscription more flexible and solve these issues.</p>"
