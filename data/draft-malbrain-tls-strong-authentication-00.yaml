abstract:
- content: <p>The security provided by authenticated TLS connection between clients
    and servers should protect both parties from "Man-in- the-Middle" (MITM) attacks.
    Clients should be authenticating that the server they are connected to is the
    server they requested, and servers that act as client agents need to authenticate
    that the connection is directly to their client. An extension to the Domain Name
    System (DNS), The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) (RFC 6698),
    allows TLS servers to publish their public certificates for use by TLS clients
    to authenticate the server connection.</p>
