abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing advice
    that must be followed in order to maintain security. Specifically, this document
    describes the math behind the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must
    wait before signing exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs. It contains much
    math and complicated equations, but the summary is that the key rollover / revocation
    time is much longer than intuition would suggest. If you are not both publishing
    a DNSSEC DNSKEY, and using RFC5011 to advertise this DNSKEY as a new Secure Entry
    Point key for use as a trust anchor, you probably don't need to read this document.
    This document also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher
    must wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming that all active RFC5011
    resolvers should have seen the revocation- marked key and removed it from their
    list of trust anchors.</p>"
