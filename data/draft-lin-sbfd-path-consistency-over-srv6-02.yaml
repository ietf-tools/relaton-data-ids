abstract:
- content: "<p>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor paths
    between nodes. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism which is suitable
    for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a large scale network.
    In SRv6, when a headend use S-BFD to monitor the segment list/CPath of SRv6 Policy,
    the forward path of control packet is indicated by segment list, the reverse path
    of response control packet is via the shortest path from the reflector back to
    the initiator (headend) as determined by routing. The forward path and reverse
    path of control packet are likely inconsistent going through different intermediate
    nodes or links. This document describes a method to keep the forward path and
    reverse path of S-BFD consistent when detecting SRv6 Policy.</p>"
