    views of existing bodies of information. The World Wide Web (W3) initiative links

    throughout the globe. HTML provides one simple format for providing linked information,
    and all W3 compatible programs are required to be capable of handling HTML. W3
    uses an Internet protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer
