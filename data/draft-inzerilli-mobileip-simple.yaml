abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document is proposed a protocol for intra-domain mobility management.
    This is intended to offer a transparent point-to-point transport service for IP
    datagrams that need to be delivered to mobile nodes. SIMPLE (Scalable Intra-domain
    Mobility Protocol using Local Encapsulation) makes it possible for a mobile node
    to change its point of attachment to a LAN, a group of LANs or even a MAN without
    changing its IP address, this link being the home or a foreign one.</p>"
