abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the years, it has been repeatedly observed that the STD nnnn and
    BCP nnnn designation for IETF Standards has not worked well, either as a stable
    reference for external specifications or as a combined reference for multiple
    documents that are linked together into a single specification. This document
    proposes two changes that have been discussed on and off for some time, but never
    written up or considered as specific proposals. The first of these would assign
    a STD (or BCP) number to a specification when it enters the first level of the
    Standards Track (or is first designated as a BCP). The second would turn STDs
    and BCPs into actual documents that describe what they identify and their publication
    and change history.</p>"
