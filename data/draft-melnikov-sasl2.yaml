abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework
    for providing authentication and data security services in connection-oriented
    protocols via replaceable mechanisms. It provides a structured interface between
    protocols and mechanisms. The resulting framework allows new protocols to reuse
    existing mechanisms and allows old protocols to make use of new mechanisms. The
    framework also provides a protocol for securing subsequent protocol exchanges
    within a data security layer. This document describes how a SASL mechanism is
    structured, describes how protocols include support for SASL, and defines the
    protocol for carrying a data security layer over a connection. This document also
    defines how servers can request fulfillment of extra authentication related tasks,
    such as two factor authentication and/or password change.</p>"
