abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum discusses the use of the Internet Print Protocol [IPP]
    as a facsimile service. IPP has most of the functional attributes necessary to
    be a successful real time facsimile service on the Internet with little or no
    modification to the core IPP V 1.0 protocols [IPP-MOD] [IPP-PRO]. IPP compliance
    with the legal and general custom and practice surrounding General Switched Telephone
    Network [FAX] will require some modification to the behavior of IPP clients and
    the common usage of time/date stamping on local IPP device transactions and logs.</p>"
