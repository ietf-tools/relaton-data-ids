abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes and explains prerequisites for NEMO Basic to support
    Multi-homing. We study those prerequisites with respect to each case of a taxonomy
    proposed to the NEMO WG and we analyze how the NEMO basic support solution fits
    with them. The analysis of each case listed in this taxonomy is broken into three
    parts, prerequisites, comments, and solution behaviors.</p>"
