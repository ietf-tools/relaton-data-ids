abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a Java extension API for SIP servers. It allows
    SIP server functionality to be extended by associating incoming requests and responses
    with SIP servlets - Java programs which control the processing of SIP messages.
    The API is similar in spirit to the servlet API used with Web servers. Basing
    a SIP server extension mechanism on the notion of Java servlets has a number of
    advantages, e.g. the ability to remain stateful, low overhead, a typed API, a
    number of built-in security mechanisms, as well as convenient access to a wide
    range of APIs, e.g. directory services, databases, and the Java Media Framework.</p>"
