abstract:
- content: "<p>Several Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
    applications work in a multi-tiered architecture, where the server takes advantage
    of delegated user credentials to act on behalf of the user and contact additional
    servers. In effect, the server acts as an agent on behalf of the user. Examples
    include web applications that need to access e-mail or file servers, including
    CIFS (Common Internet File System) file servers. However, delegating the user
    credentials to a party who is not sufficiently trusted is problematic from a security
    standpoint. Kerberos provides a flag called OK-AS-DELEGATE that allows the administrator
    of a Kerberos realm to communicate that a particular service is trusted for delegation.
    This specification adds support for this flag and similar facilities in other
    authentication mechanisms to GSS-API (RFC 2743). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
