abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper was necessitated by an overwhelming desire. An attempt to
    end the disparity in the dissemination of information which is absent of the logical
    and thoroughness in rendering an explanation of the IP Addressing Scheme. To render
    a more pointed fact, I needed to pass a CISCO Certification Examination. However,
    this can never be accomplished, if the information that is needed and used in
    the preparation thereof, lacks continuity and propagates errors pertaining to
    foundational information. That is,as a direct result of this undertaking, I corrected
    the underlining errors, derived a possible alternative approach to the IPv4 Addressing
    Scheme, and expanded its Class system ( that is no longer in use ). In other words,
    I was indeed successful in the elimination of the problems associated with IP
    Address Flooding inherent in IPv4 and the complexities of IPv6. In short, small
    business and single family dwellings can now have the option of having their own
    private IP Addressing Scheme, without the disparity resulting from the steep learning
    curve presented in IPv6. While the Internet Community at large, will not suffer
    a shortage of the availability IP Addresses for assigned distribution. Especially
    since, while the number available IP Addresses do not exceed the amount reported
    to be provided, if IPv6 is implemented. It does indeed, provide enough IP Addresses
    to cover their continued issuance for at least another 100 years or so. Which
    is dependent upon the adoption of an adequate scheme for its allocation and distribution.</p>"
