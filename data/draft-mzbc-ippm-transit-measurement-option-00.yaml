abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an IPv6 option that contains a compact set
    of fields which can be used for transit delay measurement and congestion detection.
    This option can be incorporated into data packets and updated by transit nodes
    along the path, enabling lightweight measurement and monitoring using constant-length
    data that does not depend on the number of hops in the network.</p>"
