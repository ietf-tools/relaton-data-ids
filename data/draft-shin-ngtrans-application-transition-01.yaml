abstract:
- content: "<p>The document specifies application aspects of IPv6 transition. As IPv6
    is deployed, there are some problems that the application developers and the administrators
    face. This draft clarifies the problems occurred in transition periods between
    IPv4 applications and IPv6 applications. It also propose guidelines to implement
    and choose the suitable application under the various transition environments.
    This document does not try to define any new protocol. The proposals contained
    in this document are based on the work of the Ngtrans working group.</p>"
