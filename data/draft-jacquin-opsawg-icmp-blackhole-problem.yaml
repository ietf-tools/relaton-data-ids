abstract:
- content: "<p>ICMP is a key protocol to exchange control and error messages over
    the Internet. Unfortunately it is frequent that some routers along a given path
    do not correctly process this protocol. This document provides a taxonomy of the
    problem in order to help an end user who suspects ICMP-related problems to better
    understand the situation, and possibly identify the faulty router(s).</p>"
