abstract:
- content: "<p>Current L2VPN implementations that use LDP for label binding require
    another protocol to dynamically detect which PEs belong to a given VPN. We herein
    propose a simple extension to LDP consisting of a message with which a PE announces
    its desire to join an existing VPN. The technique is equally applicable to HVPLS,
    multisegment VPLS and VPWS, and may be especially attractive for access networks
    employing MPLS.</p>"
