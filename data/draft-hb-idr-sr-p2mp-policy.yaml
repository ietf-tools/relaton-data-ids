abstract:
- content: "<p>SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for P2MP
    service delivery. A P2MP policy consists of candidate paths that connects the
    Root of the Tree to a set of Leaves. The P2MP policy is composed of replication
    segments. A replication segment is a forwarding instruction for a candidate path
    which is downloaded to the Root, transit nodes and the leaves. This document specifies
    a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order to advertise P2MP policy from a controller
    to a set of nodes. This document introduces three new route types within this
    NLRI, one for P2MP policy and its candidate paths that need to be programmed on
    the Root node, one for the replication segment incoming SID which uniquely will
    identify the cross connect and another for each outgoing interface that the packets
    get replicated to. The last two route types are forwarding instructions that needs
    to be programmed on the Root, and optionally on Transit and Leaf nodes. It should
    be noted that this document does not specify how the Root and the Leaves are discovered
    on the controller, it only describes how the P2MP Policy and Replication Segments
    are programmed from the controller to the nodes.</p>"
