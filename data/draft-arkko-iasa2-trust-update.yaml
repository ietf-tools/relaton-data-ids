- content: "<p>This memo updates the selection of trustees for the IETF Trust. Previously,
    Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) members also acted as trustees. This
    memo specifies that the trustees shall be selected separately. This memo updates
    RFCs 4071 and 4371 with regards to the selection of trustees. All other aspects
    of the IETF Trust remain as they are today.</p>"
