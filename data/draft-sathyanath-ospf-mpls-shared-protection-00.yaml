abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the OSPF[1]/OSPF-TE[2] protocol
    to support Sharing/Restoration information, using opaque LSAs. The extension presented
    here enables the source router to obtain a backup route to a destination such
    that minimal amount of protection bandwidth reservation is needed. In other words,
    we provide a method by which one may easily increase sharing of backup links significantly,
    without having to go through each and every possible backup route.</p>"
