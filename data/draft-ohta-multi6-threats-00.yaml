abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists security threats related to IPv6 multihoming solutions,
    transport layer protocols of which are expected to handle multiple addresses of
    a host and an identity of the host is recognized not necessarily by a single address.
    The intent is to look at how IPv6 multihoming solutions might make the Internet
    less secure than the current Internet, without studying any proposed solution
    but instead looking at threats that are inherent in the problem itself.</p>"
