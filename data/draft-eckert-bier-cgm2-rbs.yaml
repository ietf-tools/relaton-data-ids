abstract:
- content: <p>This memo introduces the architecture of a multicast architecture derived
    from BIER-TE, which this memo calls Carrier Grade Minimalist Multicast (CGM2).
    It reduces limitations and complexities of BIER-TE by replacing the representation
    of the in-packet-header delivery tree of packets through a "flat" BitString of
    adjacencies with a hierarchical structure of BFR-local BitStrings called the Recursive
    BitString Structure (RBS) Address. Benefits of CGM2 with RBS addresses include
    smaller/fewer BIFT in BFR, less complexity for the network architect and in the
    CGM2 controller (compared to a BIER-TE controller) and fewer packet copies to
    reach a larger set of BFER. The additional cost of forwarding with RBS addresses
    is a slightly more complex processing of the RBS address in BFR compared to a
    flat BitString and the novel per-hop rewrite of the RBS address as opposed to
    bit-reset rewrite in BIER/BIER-TE. CGM2 can support the traditional deployment
    model of BIER/BIER-TE with the BIER/BIER-TE domain terminating at service provider
    PE routers as BFIR/BFER, but it is also the intention of this document to expand
    CGM2 domains all the way into hosts, and therefore eliminating the need for an
    IP Multicast flow overlay, further reducing the complexity of Multicast services
    using CGM2. Note that this is not fully detailed in this version of the document.
    This document does not specify an encapsulation for CGM2/RBS addresses. It could
    use existing encapsulations such as [RFC8296], but also other encapsulations such
    as IPv6 extension headers.</p>
