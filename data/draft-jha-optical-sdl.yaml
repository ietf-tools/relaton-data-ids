abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Data Link (SDL) framing specification (rfc2823) defines a [length,
    length CRC] based construct with a tail-end payload CRC for delineating frames
    over digital links. Many protocols, however, already have built-in CRC mechanisms,
    and a tail-end CRC is not always needed. This draft proposes a modification to
    allow SDL receivers to delineate all types of payload without having to analyze
    payload protocol header to determine presence of CRC.</p>"
