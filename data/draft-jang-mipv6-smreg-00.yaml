abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a scheme that allows a mobile node to register
    a primary care-of address(CoA) as well as one or more non-primary CoAs by sending
    a single binding update message to the home agent and/or correspondent node. This
    is achieved by using two new mobility options defined in this draft. Mobile nodes
    that perform duplicate address detection procedure, such as Advance DAD and Optimistic
    DAD can benefit from this scheme. Proposed scheme does not require to exchange
    CoTI and CoT messages, usually required for the registration of each of the non-primary
    CoA(s). It also does not require to maintain binding management key for each of
    the non-primary CoA(s). Thus the proposed scheme reduces the signaling and processing
    overhead in Mobile IPv6 networks.</p>"
