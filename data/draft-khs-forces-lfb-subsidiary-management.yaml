abstract:
- content: "<p>Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the Forwarding
    and Control Element Separation (ForCES) architecture to manage resources other
    than packet forwarding. In that spirit, the Forwarding Element Manager (FEM) is
    modelled by creating a Logical Functional Block (LFB) to represent its functionality.
    We refer to this LFB as the FE Configuration (FEC) LFB. A Control Element (CE)
    that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE) resources can also manage its configuration
    via the FEC LFB. This document introduces the FEC LFB, an LFB that specifies the
    configuration parameters of an FE.</p>"
