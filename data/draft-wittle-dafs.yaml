abstract:
- content: "<p>The Direct Access File System (DAFS) is a file access and management
    protocol designed for local file-sharing or clustered environments. It addresses
    two primary goals: o Provide low-latency, high-throughput, and low-overhead data
    movement that takes advantage of modern memory-to-memory networking technology.
    o Define a set of file management and file access operations for local file-sharing
    requirements.</p>"
