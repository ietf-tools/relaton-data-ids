abstract:
- content: "<p>Various approaches have been proposed to support multicast in PMIPv6
    domains. However, the problem of partial deployment of multicast in the PMIPv6
    domain has not been considered. In particular, the proposed approaches typically
    assume that all the MAGs of the PMIPv6 domain are multicast-capable. The present
    work aims at carrying out the case where some of the PMIPv6 domain's MAGs are
    not necessarily multicast-capable.</p>"
