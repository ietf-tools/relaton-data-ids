abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys the IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered
    a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The main topics of
    vehicular networking are vehicle-to- vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure- to-vehicle (I2V) networking. This document deals with
    some critical aspects in vehicular networking, such as IP address autoconfiguration,
    vehicular network architecture, routing, and mobility management. This document
    summarizes and analyzes the previous research activities that use IPv4 or IPv6
    for vehicular networking.</p>"
