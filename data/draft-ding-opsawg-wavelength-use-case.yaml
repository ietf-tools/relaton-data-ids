abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes use cases that demonstrate the applicability
    of network data to evaluate the performance of wavelength division service. The
    objective of this draft is not to cover the wavelength division service in detail.
    Rather, the intention is to illustrate the requirements of network data used to
    evaluate the performance of wavelength division service. General characteristics
    of network data and two typical use cases are presented in this document to demonstrate
    the different application scenarios of network data in wavelength division service.</p>"
