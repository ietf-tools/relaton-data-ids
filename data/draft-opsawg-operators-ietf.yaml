abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Society has launched a new project to address the perceived
    gap between Operators and the IETF. The objective of this project is ultimately
    to facilitate communications between the operator community and the IETF to help
    ensure that operational realities inform the development of key standards. The
    first phase of this project was a survey of the operator community that was conducted
    over the first half of 2014. This I-D aims to synthesize the initial survey results,
    along with information we collected directly from operators during the survey
    window. The primary purpose of doing this is to start a conversation which we
    hope will lead to increases in the level of operational input and feedback to
    the IETF standards making process.</p>"
