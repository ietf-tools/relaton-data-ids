abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a data structure that can be appended to selected
    ICMP messages. The ICMP extension defined herein can be used to gain visibility
    on environmental sustainability information on the Internet by providing per-hop
    (i.e., per topological network node) power metrics and other current or future
    sustainability metrics. This will contribute to achieving an objective mentioned
    in the IAB E-Impact workshop. The techniques presented are useful not only in
    a transactional setting (e.g., a user-issued traceroute or a ping request), but
    also in a scheduled automated setting where they may be run periodically in a
    mesh across an administrative domain to map out environmental sustainability metrics.</p>"
