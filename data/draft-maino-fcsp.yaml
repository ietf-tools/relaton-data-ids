abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of IKEv2 to negotiate security protocols
    and transforms for Fibre Channel as part of the Fibre Channel Security Association
    Management Protocol. This usage requires that IKEv2 be extended with Fibre-Channel-specific
    security protocols, transforms, and name types. This document specifies these
    IKEv2 extensions and allocates identifiers for them. Using new IKEv2 identifiers
    for Fibre Channel security protocols avoids any possible confusion between IKEv2
    negotiation for IP networks and IKEv2 negotiation for Fibre Channel. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
