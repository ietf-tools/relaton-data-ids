abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the applicability of GMPLS signaling to IP over
    Optical (IPO) networks. The underlying premise behind GMPLS signaling for IPO
    networks is discussed and pertinent limitations are highlighted. Throughout this
    discussion, GMPLS-RSVP (RSVP-TE with GMPLS extensions) will be used to exemplify
    the class of protocols under consideration. This memo also describes the subsets
    of GMPLS signaling message exchanges that are needed to support connection management
    between optical switches, and between IP/MPLS routers and optical switches in
    IP over Optical networks.</p>"
