abstract:
- content: "<p>L2TP protocol is a virtual extension of PPP across IP network infrastructure.
    L2TP makes possible for an access concentrator(LAC) to be near remote clients,
    while allowing PPP termination server (LNS) to be located in enterprise premises.
    L2TP allows an enterprise to retain control of RADIUS data base, which is used
    to control Authentication, Authorization and Accountability (AAA) of dial-in users.
    The objective of this document is to extend security characteristics of IPsec
    to remote access users, as they dial-in through the Internet. This is accomplished
    without creating new protocols and using the existing practices of Remote Access
    and IPsec. Specifically, the document proposes three new RADIUS parameters for
    use by the LNS node, acting as Secure Remote Access Server (SRAS) to mandate network
    level security between remote clients and the enterprise. The document also discusses
    limitations of the approach.</p>"
