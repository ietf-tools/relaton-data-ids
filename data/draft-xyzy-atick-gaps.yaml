abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a gap and solution analysis for end-to-end privacy
    enabled mapping systems. Each of the identifier locator separation system has
    its own approach to mapping identifiers to the locators. We analyse all these
    approaches and identify the gaps in each of them and do a solution space analysis
    in an attempt to identify a mapping system that can be end to end privacy enabled.</p>"
