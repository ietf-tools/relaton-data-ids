abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) that is generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved parity
    codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP. These parity codes are systematic
    codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols
    and sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that carries the source
    symbols. The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes offer a good protection
    against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a cost of decent complexity.
    The RTP payload formats that are defined in this document address the scalability
    issues experienced with the earlier specifications including RFC 2733, RFC 5109
    and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several improvements. Due to these changes, the new
    payload formats are not backward compatible with the earlier specifications.</p>"
