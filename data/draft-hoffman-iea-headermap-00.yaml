abstract:
- content: "<p>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these
    users throughout the world have names that are not normally represented by the
    users with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would therefore like to
    use their real names in their mailbox names. This protocol describes how mail
    clients can be enhanced to display mailbox names in non-ASCII characters through
    the use of a new RFC 2822 header field called 'Address-map'.</p>"
