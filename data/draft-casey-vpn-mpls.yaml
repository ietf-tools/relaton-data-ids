abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes a method of using MPLS to realize a provider
    IP VPN capability. The approach described here exploits the Label Switch Path
    (LSP) mesh implicitly established between all edge routers in an MPLS domain [4].
    It uses 2 levels of LSP tunneling. The outer or base level is the hop by hop LSP
    tunnels that interconnect all VPN Border (Label Switch) Routers (VBR\\022s). The
    'bottom of label stack', nested level provides logically single hop tunnels between
    VBR\\022s. For each IP VPN, single hop nested tunnels are established between
    all VBR's serving that particular VPN. The draft outlines the components involved
    in the MPLS IP VPN architecture and outlines how they interact. The proposed realization
    is caste in terms of the VPN areas introduced in [1] and is geared to take advantage
    of a virtual router (VR) capability in the VBR's. This results in a powerful and
    flexible method of providing an IP VPN service that meets the requirements outlined
    in [3]. Also described are two extensions: offering MPLS VPN service to the customer
    (rather than IP service) and using Label Switching to traverse VPN areas[1].</p>"
