abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) [2], referred to as EAP-GPRS, which allows GPRS clients to perform
    signaling procedures with a core GPRS network through devices that enforce EAP-based
    access control. For example, a GPRS client can use EAP-GPRS to attach to a GPRS
    network through an access point that enforces IEEE 802.1X [3] access control.
    In this case, the GPRS attach signaling is performed in the context of the underlying
    802.1X procedure and the GPRS messages are encapsulated into EAP-GPRS packets.
    If the GPRS client is permitted to attach to the GPRS network, then the 802.1X
    procedure ends successfully and the client is authorized access to the access
    point. In general, EAP-GPRS allows any type of signaling to take place during
    the EAP authentication as an embedded signaling procedure. However, in this documents
    we particularly focus on GPRS specific signaling.</p>"
