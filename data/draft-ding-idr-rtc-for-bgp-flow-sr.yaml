abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an extension to the application scenarios
    of Route Target Constraints (RTC). By using the global administrator field of
    the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community to represent a network node and exchanging
    BGP Route-Target routes, a BGP speaker could generate an egress policy for filtering
    one or a group of network nodes, which could implement precise control and distribution
    of services such as BGP Flow Spec and BGP Segment Routing Policies.</p>"
