abstract:
- content: <p>The IPsec protocol suite is widely used for business-critical network
    traffic. In order to make IPsec deployments highly available, more scalable, and
    failure-resistant, they are often implemented as IPsec High Availability (HA)
    clusters. However, there are many issues in IPsec HA clustering, and in particular
    in Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) clustering. An earlier document,
    "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement", enumerates the issues encountered in the IKEv2/IPsec
    HA cluster environment. This document resolves these issues with the least possible
    change to the protocol. This document defines an extension to the IKEv2 protocol
    to solve the main issues of "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in the commonly
    deployed hot standby cluster, and provides implementation advice for other issues.
    The main issues solved are the synchronization of IKEv2 Message ID counters, and
    of IPsec replay counters. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
