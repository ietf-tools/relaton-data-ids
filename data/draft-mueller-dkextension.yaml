abstract:
- content: <p>Naive Distance Vector-based routing protocols like the Routing Information
    Protocol [RFC_1058] suffer from a phenomena called the "count to infinity problem"
    in the event of a network topology change. This Internet Draft extends a naive
    Distance Vector routing implementation with a simple flag that allows the network
    to recover quickly and reliably, with no chance of routing loops to occur. Discussion
    Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Source for this
    draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.com/Sebastianmueller22/network-protocol.</p>
