abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines how RTP sessions are synchronised, and discusses
    how rapidly such synchronisation can occur. We show that most RTP sessions can
    be synchronised immediately, but that the use of video switching multipoint conference
    units (MCUs) or large source-specific multicast (SSM) groups can greatly increase
    the synchronisation delay. This increase in delay can be unacceptable to some
    applications that use layered and/or multi-description codecs. This memo introduces
    three mechanisms to reduce the synchronisation delay for such sessions. First,
    it updates the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) timing rules to reduce the initial
    synchronisation delay for SSM sessions. Second, a new feedback packet is defined
    for use with the extended RTP profile for RTCP-based feedback (RTP/AVPF), allowing
    video switching MCUs to rapidly request resynchronisation. Finally, new RTP header
    extensions are defined to allow rapid synchronisation of late joiners, and guarantee
    correct timestamp-based decoding order recovery for layered codecs in the presence
    of clock skew. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
