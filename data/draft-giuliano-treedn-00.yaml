abstract:
- content: "<p>As Internet audience sizes for high-interest live events reach unprecedented
    levels and bitrates climb to support 4K/8K/AR, live streaming can place a unique
    type of stress upon network resources. TreeDN is a tree-based CDN architecture
    designed to address the distinctive scaling challenges of live streaming to mass
    audiences. TreeDN enables operators to offer Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at
    a fraction the cost of traditional, unicast-based CDNs- in some cases, at no additional
    cost to the infrastructure. In addition to efficiently utilizing network resources
    to deliver existing multi- destination traffic, this architecture also enables
    new types of content and use cases that previously weren't possible or economically
    viable using traditional CDN approaches. Finally, TreeDN is a decentralized architecture
    and a democratizing technology for content distribution.</p>"
