abstract:
- content: "<p>Information Services are services whereby information is provided in
    response to user requests, and may include involvement of a human or automated
    agent. A popular existing Information Service is Directory Assistance (DA). Moving
    ahead, Information Services providers envision exciting multimedia services that
    support simultaneous voice and data interactions with full operator backup at
    any time during the call. Information Services providers are planning to migrate
    to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced services, while continuing
    to support traditional DA services. Operator Services are traditional PSTN services
    which often involve providing human or automated assistance to a caller, and often
    require the specialized capabilities traditionally provided by an operator services
    switch. Market and/or regulatory factors in some jurisdictions dictate that some
    subset of Operator Services continue to be provided going forward. This document
    aims to identify how Operator and Information Services can be implemented using
    existing or currently proposed SIP mechanisms, to identity existing protocol gaps,
    and to provide a set of Best Current Practices to facilitate interoperability.
    For Operator Services, the intention is to describe how current operator services
    can continue to be provided to PSTN based subscribers via a SIP based operator
    services architecture. It also looks at how current operator services might be
    provided to SIP based subscribers via such an architecture, but does not consider
    the larger question of the need for or usefulness or suitability of each of these
    services for SIP based subscribers. This document addresses the needs of current
    Operator and Information Services providers; as such, the intended audience includes
    vendors of equipment and services to such providers.</p>"
