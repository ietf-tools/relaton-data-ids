abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the Constrained Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
    Infrastructure (Constrained BRSKI) protocol, which provides a solution for secure
    zero-touch bootstrapping of resource-constrained (IoT) devices into the network
    of a domain owner. This protocol is designed for constrained networks, which may
    have limited data throughput or may experience frequent packet loss. Constrained
    BRSKI is a variant of the BRSKI protocol, which uses an artifact signed by the
    device manufacturer called the "voucher" which enables a new device and the owner's
    network to mutually authenticate. While the BRSKI voucher is typically encoded
    in JSON, Constrained BRSKI defines a compact CBOR-encoded voucher. The BRSKI voucher
    is extended with new data types that allow for smaller voucher sizes. The Enrollment
    over Secure Transport (EST) protocol, used in BRSKI, is replaced with EST-over-CoAPS;
    and HTTPS used in BRSKI is replaced with CoAPS.</p>
