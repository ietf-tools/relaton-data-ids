abstract:
- content: "<p>Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party Web Service
    that supports a transactional second factor confirmation mechanism that provides
    a superset of the capabilities of traditional second factor authentication schemes.
    The three parties in the protocol are Enquirer who posts a confirmation request,
    a Responder who may or may not respond to the request and the Broker which provides
    a repository to which requests and responses are posted. This document is also
    available online at http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-confirm.html.</p>"
