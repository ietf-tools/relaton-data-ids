abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING)
    architecture describes how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through
    an IPv6 or MPLS network using the source routing paradigm. A Segment Routed Path
    can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree
    (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE). Path identification
    is needed for several use cases such as performance measurement in Segment Routing
    (SR) network. This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
    Communication Protocol (PCEP) to support requesting, replying, reporting and updating
    the Path Segment ID (Path SID) between PCEP speakers.</p>"
