abstract:
- content: "<p>In a typical IP television (IPTV) system, the receiver acquires information
    about available program content, the subscriber selects a program to watch, and
    the receiver signals to the network to begin receiving the program in the form
    of multicast content. The program content information is typically XML-encoded,
    can be transmitted in multiple segments, possibly over multiple channels, but
    includes media stream descriptions for the individual program descriptions that
    may also be XML-encoded or may use the Session Description Protocol (SDP, RFC
    4566). The media stream descriptions provide multicast group and unicast source
    addresses that are used in the subsequent signalling to the network. During the
    transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where the IP version supported
    by the receiver differs from that supported by the source. This memo examines
    and evaluates alternative strategies for allowing the receiver to acquire addresses
    in such scenarios in the version it supports.</p>"
