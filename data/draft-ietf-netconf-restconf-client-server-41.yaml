abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents two YANG modules, one module to configure a
    RESTCONF client and the other module to configure a RESTCONF server. Both modules
    support the TLS transport protocol with both standard RESTCONF and RESTCONF Call
    Home connections. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft contains
    placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values at the time
    of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that are needed.
    No other RFC Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document. Artwork
    in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in progress. Please apply
    the following replacements (note: not all may be present): * AAAA --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto- types * BBBB --&gt; the assigned RFC
    value for draft-ietf-netconf-trust- anchors * CCCC --&gt; the assigned RFC value
    for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore * DDDD --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-
    server * EEEE --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-
    server * FFFF --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-
    server * GGGG --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-http- client-server
    * HHHH --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-netconf- client-server
    * IIII --&gt; the assigned RFC value for this draft * JJJJ --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-udp-client- server Artwork in this document contains
    placeholder values for the date of publication of this draft. Please apply the
    following replacement: * 2025-04-02 --&gt; the publication date of this draft
    The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains the text "one or more
    YANG modules" and, later, "modules". This text is sourced from a file in a context
    where it is unknown how many modules a draft defines. The text is not wrong as
    is, but it may be improved by stating more directly how many modules are defined.
    The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains a self- reference to
    this draft, along with a corresponding reference in the Appendix. Please replace
    the self-reference in this section with "This RFC" (or similar) and remove the
    self-reference in the "Normative/Informative References" section, whichever it
    is in. Tree-diagrams in this draft may use the ''\'' line-folding mode defined
    in RFC 8792. However, nicer-to-the-eye is when the ''\\'' line-folding mode is
    used. The AD suggested suggested putting a request here for the RFC Editor to
    help convert "ugly" ''\'' folded examples to use the ''\\'' folding mode. "Help
    convert" may be interpreted as, identify what looks ugly and ask the authors to
    make the adjustment. The following Appendix section is to be removed prior to
    publication: * Appendix A. Change Log</p>'
