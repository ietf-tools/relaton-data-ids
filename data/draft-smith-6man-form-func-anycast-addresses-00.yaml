abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 anycast addresses are chosen from within the existing IPv6 unicast
    address space, with the addresses nominated as anycast addresses through configuration.
    An alternative scheme is to have a special class of addresses for use as anycast
    addresses. This memo proposes a distinct general anycast addressing class and
    a more specific scheme for functional anycast addresses.</p>"
