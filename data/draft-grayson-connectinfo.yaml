abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a syntax for the Connect-Info attribute used
    with the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol, enabling
    clients to provide servers information pertaining to the operation of an IEEE
    802.11 wireless network. The document has been developed by the Wireless Broadband
    Alliance's Access Network Metrics project team. This project was formed to addresses
    the adoption of RADIUS used to support Wi-Fi authentication in environments that
    are increasingly complex; with multiple possible overlapping networks, operating
    using different Wi-Fi technology generations, utilizing varied spectrum allocations,
    and where the AAA provider wants to ensure their users are getting a great Wi-Fi
    experience. In such environments, the Wi-Fi industry can benefit from a consistent
    framework that provides visibility of Wi-Fi network metrics, increasing confidence
    in Wi-Fi to support carrier use-cases, and consequently driving adoption. The
    use of a well defined syntax for the Connect-Info attribute that simultaneously
    supports existing Wi-Fi implementations while also addressing new requirements
    may have wider applicability by the broader Wi-Fi community. This document is
    an independent submission. It is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus.</p>"
