- content: "<p>One of the obstacles in implementing any version of Multicast is creating
    a method of advertising what is being 'broadcast' on any particular 'channel'.
    This document defines a method for using the existing Domain Name Service (DNS)[RFC1034,
    RFC1035] infrastructure to assist in advertising Source-Specific Multicast [SSM]
    'channels' (S,G pairs).</p>"
