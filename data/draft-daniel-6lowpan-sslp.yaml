abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Service Location Protocol (SSLP) provides a framework for
    the discovery and selection of the services working on 6LoWPAN. The protocol has
    a simple structure that is easy to be implemented on 6LoWPAN devices that are
    characterized by short range, low bit rate and low power. The protocol also offers
    a mechanism for interoperability with the IP networks under SLP. It enables communication
    between 6LoWPAN and other IP networks.</p>"
