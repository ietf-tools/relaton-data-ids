abstract:
- content: "<p>Network tuning is usually performed after the network design is completed,
    but should also be done at intervals during the life cycle of the network. There
    are four basic areas that directly affect the efficiency of the network and its
    associated throughput: Frame and packet size optimization Segmentation avoidance
    or limitation Minimization of device delay Window sizing to avoid degradation
    This draft has been written to document for the internet community a basic overview
    of network tuning and its benefits.</p>"
