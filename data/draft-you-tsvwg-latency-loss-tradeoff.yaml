abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a PHB (Per-Hop Behavior) group called Latency
    Loss Tradeoff (LLT). The LLT group is intended to provide delivery of IP packets
    in two classes of services: a low-loss service (Lo service) and a low-latency
    service (La service). The LLT group enables an application to request treatment
    for either low-loss or low-latency at a congested network link.</p>"
