abstract:
- content: "<p>Summarization is often used in multi-domain networks to improve network
    efficiency and scalability. With summarization in place, there is a need to signal
    loss of reachability to an individual prefix covered by the summary. This enables
    fast convergence by steering traffic away from the node which owns the prefix
    and is no longer reachable. This mechanism, referred to as Unreachable Prefix
    Announcement (UPA), has been specified for IGPs. This document specifies an and
    equivalent BGP mechanism for multi-AS networks where BGP is used to carry summary
    routes.</p>"
