abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of an interface
    named Application Intelligent Policy Interface (AIPI) that translates the real
    application requirements (e.g., network should ensure how many users of the OTT
    provider watch high definition video simultaneously.) into network level requirements,
    e.g., configurations or service deployments requirements and network QoS requirements,
    are useful and necessary for modern networks.</p>"
