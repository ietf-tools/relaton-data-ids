abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a conservative loss recovery algorithm for TCP
    that is based on the use of the selective acknowledgment (SACK) TCP option. The
    algorithm presented in this document conforms to the spirit of the current congestion
    control specification (RFC 2581), but allows TCP senders to recover more effectively
    when multiple segments are lost from a single flight of data. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
