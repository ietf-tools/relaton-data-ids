abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a Local Mobility Agent selection algorithm
    in the Localized Mobility Management of Mobile IPv6. This proposed selection algorithm
    locates a Local Mobility Agent to register a visiting mobile node in a foreign
    domain where multiple Local Mobility Agents are deployed. The domain architecture,
    Local Mobility Agent selection and registration procedures are specified. This
    algorithm selects Local Mobility Agent on a per mobile node basis and reduces
    registration delay. It also helps to distribute the registration load to all the
    Local Mobility Agents, avoiding overcrowding at a particular one.</p>"
