abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines some interoperability issues observed with the
    use of ARP over GMPLS controlled Ethernet router-to- router (PSC) interfaces transiting
    from a non-Ethernet core, e.g., FSC or LSC core. The document also recommends
    some procedures to address these issues. The aim of this document is to facilitate
    and ensure better interworking of GMPLS- capable Label Switching Routers (LSRs),
    based on experience gained in interoperability testing.</p>"
