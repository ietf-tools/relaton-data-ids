abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses strategies for using streaming media applications
    with unreliable congestion-controlled transport protocols such as the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) or the RTP Profile for TCP Friendly Rate Control.
    Of particular interest is how media streams, which have their own transmit rate
    requirements, can be adapted to the varying and sometimes conflicting transmit
    rate requirements of congestion control protocols such as TCP-Friendly Rate Control
    (TFRC).</p>"
