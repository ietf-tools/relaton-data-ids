abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers control of photonic plugs in devices with packet
    functions from an architecture perspective. Three specific control solution deployment
    strategies are examined: * network technology partitioned domain controllers,
    with an orchestrator (higher level controller) to coordinate the domain controllers
    * single controller dealing with all network technologies * single control fabric
    in which components, from various vendors, each focused on a specific control
    function, interact as peers to provide holistic control of the network For all
    of the examined control solution deployment strategies, the control functions
    specializing in photonics determine the photonic network setup on-going and these
    control functions directly control the photonics of the network including the
    photonic plugs in devices with packet functions. There is a clear separation of
    concerns between packet function control and photonic function control such that
    the control can be partitioned so that control functions specializing in control
    of the packet network can control corresponding functions in the device with packet
    functions with no interference from the photonic control functions and vice versa.
