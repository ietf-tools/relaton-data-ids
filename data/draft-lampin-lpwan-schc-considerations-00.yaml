abstract:
- content: "<p>Taking the opportunity of a fresh implementation of SCHC by a newcomer
    to SCHC to reflect on the design principles and the implications on the implication
    of SCHC. Topics addressed: * The parser, as described in SCHC specification. *
    A discussion on parsing and interpretation. * Practical implications of the specification
    of the parser of SCHC. * the challenge and opportunity of a generic parser implementation
    able to handle any protocol stack and rules design to enable it.</p>"
