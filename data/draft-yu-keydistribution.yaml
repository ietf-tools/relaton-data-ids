abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several key distribution systems based on the physical layer
    of the LTE Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system, utilizing the random
    and high-agreement secret key generation schemes from noisy wideband channels.
    To characterize these systems, this document proposes a reference model and several
    test methods of main technical parameters of such systems, including average key
    generation rate as well as the consistency and the randomness of generated key
    bits.</p>"
