abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for computing energy consumption paths
    in Segment Routing (SR) networks, aiming to optimize network traffic routing for
    energy efficiency, including procedures for energy consumption data collection,
    path calculation, and issuance, as well as considerations for data plane implementation
    in both MPLS SR and SRv6 networks.</p>"
