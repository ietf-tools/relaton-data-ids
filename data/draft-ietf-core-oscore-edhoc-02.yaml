abstract:
- content: "<p>The lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol EDHOC can be run
    over CoAP and used by two peers to establish an OSCORE Security Context. This
    document further profiles this use of the EDHOC protocol, by specifying a number
    of additional and optional mechanisms. These especially include an optimization
    approach for combining the execution of EDHOC with the first subsequent OSCORE
    transaction. This combination reduces the number of round trips required to set
    up an OSCORE Security Context and to complete an OSCORE transaction using that
    Security Context.</p>"
