abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and signaling
    (e.g., MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network. Route computation has
    been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost,
    or import and export routing policies. Requirements have emerged to more dynamically
    manage and program routing systems due to the advent of highly dynamic data-center
    networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering and
    service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via traffic
    control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision-making from the router
    itself. These requirements should allow controlling routing information and traffic
    paths and extracting network topology information, traffic statistics, and other
    network analytics from routing systems. This document proposes meeting this need
    via an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS).</p>"
