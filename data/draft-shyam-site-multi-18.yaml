abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub networks
    in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer network may have as
    many global unicast addresses as many service providers it will be connected with.
    Users can establish multiple connections through different service providers simultaneously.
    A customer network can maintain private address space to communicate within its
    users and can share its load while maintaining VPN services. Customer networks
    can provide IP mobility services as well.</p>"
