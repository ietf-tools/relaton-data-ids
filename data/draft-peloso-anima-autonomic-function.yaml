abstract:
- content: "<p>While autonomic functions are often pre-installed and integrated with
    the network elements they manage, this is not a mandatory condition. Allowing
    autonomic functions to be dynamically installed and to control resources remotely
    enables more versatile deployment approaches and enlarges the application scope
    to virtually any legacy equipment. The analysis of autonomic functions deployment
    schemes through the installation, instantiation and operation phases allows constructing
    a unified life-cycle and identifying new required functionality. Thus, the introduction
    of autonomic technologies will be facilitated, the adoption much more rapid and
    broad. Operators will benefit from multi-vendor, inter-operable autonomic functions
    with homogeneous operations and superior quality, and will have more freedom in
    their deployment scenarios.</p>"
