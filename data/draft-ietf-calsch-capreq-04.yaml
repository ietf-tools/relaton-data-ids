abstract:
- content: "<p>The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) is an Internet protocol for accessing
    an [ICAL] based calendar store (CS) from a calendar user agent (CUA). The purpose
    of this document is to set forth a list of requirements that CAP MUST address
    in order to meet the needs of the calendaring and scheduling community. This document
    is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring
    and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group. More information about the IETF CALSCH
    working group activities can be found on the IMC web site at http://www.imc.org,
    the IETF web site at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html. Refer
    to the references within this document for further information on how to access
    these various documents. Distribution of this document is unlimited. Comments
    and suggestions for improvement should be sent to the authors. Copyright (C) The
