abstract:
- content: "<p>System performance is often limited by an integrated device interconnect.
    Process differences between logic and memory keep large-scale memory interconnects
    critical as Moore's Law surpasses the rate of packaging reductions. Two areas
    are related to memory interconnect performance when handling network messaging:
    - Logic and memory state context switching - Reassembly of partial messages with
    bifurcation of payload</p>"
