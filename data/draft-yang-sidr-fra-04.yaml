abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes Fast Route Attestation (FRA), a mechanism for securing
    AS paths and preventing prefix hijacking by signing and verifying critical AS
    path segments (i.e., adjacent AS triples along AS path). When full-deployed, FRA
    can achieve similar level of security as BGPSec, but with much higher efficiency.
    When partial- deployed, FRA offers more security benefits than BGPSec.</p>"
