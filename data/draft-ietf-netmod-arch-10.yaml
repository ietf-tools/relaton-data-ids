abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) gives access to native
    capabilities of the devices within a network, defining methods for manipulating
    configuration databases, retrieving operational data, and invoking specific operations.
    YANG provides the means to define the content carried via NETCONF, both data and
    operations. Using both technologies, standard modules can be defined to give interoperability
    and commonality to devices, while still allowing devices to express their unique
    capabilities. This document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build network
    management applications that meet the needs of network operators. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
