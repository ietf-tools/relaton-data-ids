abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern networks require fast, adaptive Traffic Engineering (TE) to
    support demanding applications like AI training and real-time services. Existing
    mechanisms for load balancing, protection, and flow control often lack responsiveness
    and scalability. This document analyzes key gaps in current TE solutions and proposes
    fast notification as a low-latency, event-driven enhancement. Fast notification
    enables real-time network awareness and quicker reactions to dynamic conditions,
    improving overall network efficiency and reliability.</p>"
