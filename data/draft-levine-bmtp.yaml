abstract:
- content: "<p>Bulk Mail Transfer Protocol (BMTP) provides a channel for the delivery
    of ''bulk mail'' electronic mail. BMTP is a service parallel to but sepa- rate
    from SMTP. The specification of BMTP is intended to be similar enough to SMTP
    that existing SMTP clients and servers can easily be adapted for BMTP. Extensions
    provide for categorizing messages by class, and for authorizing the client to
    the server, to aid in the implementation of cost-sharing systems.</p>"
