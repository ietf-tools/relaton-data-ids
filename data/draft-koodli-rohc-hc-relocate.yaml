abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks with limited bandwidths, such as wireless cellular networks,
    compression of IP and transport headers may be employed to obtain better utilization
    of the available spectrum capacity. When header compression is used along with
    handoffs in such networks, the header compression context needs to be relocated
    from one IP access point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamless
    operation. In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve this compression
    context relocation using IPv6 and Mobile IPv6.</p>"
