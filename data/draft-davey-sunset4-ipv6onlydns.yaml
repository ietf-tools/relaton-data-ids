    the IP layer and the identifier layer of Internet. This memo describe the behavior
    and inherent limitation of DNS in IPv4 and dual-stack environment. To ease the
    problem as well as bringing some incentive to turn off IPv4 as soon as possible,

    DNS protocol and operation practice in the IPv6 only network.</p>"
