abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Calendar Access Protocol (ICAP) allows a client to access,
    manipulate and store Calendar information on a server. ICAP employs the iCalendar
    format [ICAL] for interchange of calendaring information. ICAP includes operations
    for creating Calendar stores on a server, opening them and retrieving information
    about them. When a Calendar Store has been opened, it can be bounded by start
    and end times so that the client can act on a smaller subset of Calendar information
    for more efficient operation. ICAP allows users to store new Calendar Objects
    into their own Calendar store and Calendar stores owned by other users with a
    single operation. ICAP supports searching iCalendar objects within a Calendar
    Store. Searches can be based on any iCalendar property and filtered by iCalendar
    Component type.</p>"
