abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes Virtual Internet Protocol version 2 (VIPv2), a
    protocol for mobility support in IPv4. The basic concept of VIP is separation
    of identifiers and addresses. TCP/UDP uses the identifier. The identifier is mapped
    to an address, and then the packet is routed in accordance with the address. End
    nodes as well as intermediate routers can have authentic mapping information for
    routing optimization and fault tolerance.</p>"
