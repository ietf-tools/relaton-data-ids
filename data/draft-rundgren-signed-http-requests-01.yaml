abstract:
- content: <p>The SHREQ specification describes how the JSON Web Signature (JWS) specification
    combined with the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS), can be utilized to support
    HTTP based applications needing digitally signed requests. SHREQ is specifically
    tailored for Web applications using JSON as data interchange format. There is
    also a SHREQ scheme for HTTP requests that do not have a body ("payload") like
    GET. SHREQ was designed to be agnostic with respect to REST concepts versus traditional
    GET/POST schemes.</p>
