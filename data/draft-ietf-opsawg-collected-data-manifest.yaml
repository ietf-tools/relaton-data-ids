abstract:
- content: "<p>Network elements use Model-driven Telemetry, and in particular YANG-
    Push, to continuously stream information, including both counters and state information.
    This document documents the metadata that ensure that the collected data can be
    interpreted correctly. This document specifies the Data Manifest, composed of
    two YANG data models (the Platform Manifest and the Data Collection Manifest.)
    The Data Manifest must be streamed and stored along with the data, up to the collection
    and analytics system in order to keep the collected data fully exploitable by
    the data scientists.</p>"
