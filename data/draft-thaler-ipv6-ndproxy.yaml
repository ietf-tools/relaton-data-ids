abstract:
- content: "<p>Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several operational
    advantages. A single subnet prefix is sufficient to support multiple physical
    links. There is no need to allocate subnet numbers to the different networks,
    simplifying management. Bridging some types of media requires network-layer support,
    however. This document describes these cases and specifies the IP-layer support
    that enables bridging under these circumstances.</p>"
