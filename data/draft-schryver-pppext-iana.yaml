abstract:
- content: <p>The charter of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Extensions working
    group (pppext) includes the responsibility to "actively advance PPP's most useful
    extensions to full standard, while defending against further enhancements of questionable
    value." In support of that charter, the allocation of PPP protocol and other assigned
    numbers will no longer be "first come first served." This document specifies an
    Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>
