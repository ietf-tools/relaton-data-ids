abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a protocol (the Remote Update Protocol, RUP) for cooperation
    between Web Servers and Web Robots in order to increase the reliability of Web
    indexing, and decrease the load both on the server and the robot side. If the
    servers conform to the RUP protocol, the task of the Robot will appear to be distributed
    between the servers that it consults - for that reason we choose to call this
    note ``Distributed Robots``.</p>"
