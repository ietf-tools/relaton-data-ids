abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a TCP/IP extension that is
    widely implemented but hardly used due to the perceived unusablilty of ECN on
    many paths through the Internet caused by ECN-ignorant routers and middleboxes.
    This document specifies an ECN probing and fall-back mechanism in case ECN has
    be successfully negotiated between two connection endpoints, but might not be
    usable on the path.</p>"
