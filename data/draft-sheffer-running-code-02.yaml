abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations by including an Implementation Status
    section. This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration
    to documents that have the benefit of running code and potentially reward the
    documented protocols by treating the documents with implementations preferentially.
    The process in this document is offered as an experiment. Authors of Internet-Drafts
    are encouraged to consider using the process for their documents, and working
    groups are invited to think about applying the process to all of their protocol
    specifications. The authors of this document intend to collate experiences with
    this experiment and to report them to the community.</p>"
