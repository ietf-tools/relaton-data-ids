abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents use-cases underlining why WebRTC needs AMR-WB,
    AMR and G.722 as additional relevant voice codecs to satisfactorily ensure interoperability
    with existing systems. It also presents a way forward that takes into consideration
    the concerns expressed against the addition of codecs besides Opus and G.711.
    It is especially recognized that unjustified additional costs on browsers must
    be avoided. Therefore, the proposed solution intends to fully rely on the codecs
    already supported on the devices implementing the browsers and for which license
    and implementation costs have been already paid. It is expected that this way
    forward will significantly limit the costs and technical impacts on browsers while
    greatly improving interoperability with legacy systems and overall quality. It
    intents to be considered as a good compromise beneficial to all parties and to
    the whole industry: the user quality experience will be optimized as a whole at
    limited additional costs without incurring high costs for both networks to support
    transcoding and browsers to support additional codecs.</p>"
