abstract:
- content: "<p>A Host Identity Protocol (HIP) proxy is a host that holds the keying
    material, and participates in HIP-based communications, on behalf of one or more
    hosts. HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the current Internet
    architecture to the HIP architecture. A core objective of a HIP proxy is to facilitate
    the communication between legacy (or Non- HIP) hosts and HIP hosts while not modifying
    the host protocol stacks. In this document, the legacy hosts served by proxies
    are referred to as Legacy Hosts (LHs). Currently, various design solutions of
    HIP proxies have been proposed. These solutions may be applicable in different
    working circumstances. In this document, these solutions are investigated in detail
    to compare their effectiveness in different scenarios.</p>"
