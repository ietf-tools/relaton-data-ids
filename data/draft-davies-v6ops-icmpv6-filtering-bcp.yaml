abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks supporting IPv6 the Internet Control Message Protocol version
    6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number of functions, and a correspondingly
    large number of message types and options. A number of security risks are associated
    with uncontrolled forwarding of ICMPv6 messages, and it is desirable to configure
    site firewalls to intercept inappropriate usages of ICMPv6 which might allow an
    attacker outside a site to probe or compromise the site network. On the other
    hand, compared with IPv4 and the corresponding protocol ICMP, ICMPv6 is essential
    to the functioning of IPv6 rather than a useful auxiliary. Hence too aggressive
    filtering of ICMPv6 messages can be detrimental to the establishment of IPv6 communications.
    This means that effective filtering of ICMPv6 requires a more complex configuration
    than was needed for ICMP. This document provides some recommendations for ICMPv6
    firewall filter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6 messages that
    are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but drop messages which
    are potential security risks.</p>"
