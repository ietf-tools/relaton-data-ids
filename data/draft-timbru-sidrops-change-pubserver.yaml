abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft outlines how Krill, an RPKI CA and Publication Server, implements
    the process that allows a CA to change the Publication Server it uses, migrating
    its content from the old server, to the new server's repository. The current implementation
    is modelled after the RPKI CA Key Rollover process defined in RFC 6489, except
    that in this case a new location is used for the new key. It incudes some discussion
    about possible improvements to the process. The goal of this draft is to serve
    as a starting point for a broader discussion on how RPKI Repository Migration
    should be done. If adopted as a working group item, the status could be changed
    to standard or bcp, and the intent would of course be to update the content to
    reflect working group consensus rather than what happens to have been implemented
    in Krill at this time.</p>"
