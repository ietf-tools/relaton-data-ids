abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi- Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to
    the control of wavelength switched optical networks (WSON). In particular we provide
    control plane models for key wavelength switched optical network subsystems and
    processes. The subsystems include wavelength division multiplexed links, tunable
    laser transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) and wavelength
    converters. Lightpath provisioning, in general, requires the routing and wavelength
    assignment (RWA) process. This process is reviewed and the information requirements,
    both static and dynamic for this process are presented, along with alternative
    implementation scenarios that could be realized via GMPLS/PCE and/or extended
    GMPLS/PCE protocols. This memo does NOT address optical impairments in any depth
    and focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are common
    across different WSON environments. It is expected that a variety of different
    techniques will be applied to optical impairments depending on the type of WSON,
    such as access, metro or long haul.</p>"
