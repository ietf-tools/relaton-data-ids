abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new multicast routing protocol for use over
    ad hoc networks. The protocol is called AMRIS, short for Ad hoc Multicast Routing
    protocol utilizing Increasing id-numberS. The conceptual idea behind AMRIS is
    to assign every node in a multicast session with an id-number. A delivery tree
    rooted at a particular node called Sid joins up the nodes participating in the
    multicast session. The relationship between the id-numbers(and the node that owns
    it) and Sid is that the id-numbers increase in numerical value as they radiate
    from the root of the delivery tree. The significance of the Sid is that it has
    the smallest id-number within that multicast session. Utilizing the id-numbers,
    nodes are able to adapt rapidly to changes in link connectivity. Recovery messages
    due to link breakages are confined to the region where it occurred.</p>"
