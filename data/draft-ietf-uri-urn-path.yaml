abstract:
- content: "<p>A new 'path' URN scheme is proposed that defines a uniformly hierarchical
    name space. This URN scheme supports dynamic relocation and replication of resources.
    Existing DNS technology is used to resolve a path into sets of equivalent URLs,
    and then one URL is resolved into the named resource.</p>"
