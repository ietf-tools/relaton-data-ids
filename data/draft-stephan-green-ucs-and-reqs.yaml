abstract:
- content: "<p>This document delineates the requirements for standards specifications
    in Energy Efficiency Management, extending the foundational work of RFC6988 and
    incorporating recent insights from operator requirements and the GREEN BoF discussions.
    Eleven years after the publication of RFC6988, this document reassesses and updates
    the requirements to align with contemporary needs. The primary objectives of this
    draft, which are listed in the goals and scope with the creation of the GREEN
    WG charter, is focusing on two main targets: (1) collecting and updating requirements
    for the management of energy-efficient networks, and (2) defining use cases for
    managing energy-efficient networks. This draft merges the drafts [rfc6988bis-green]
    and [green-bof-reqs]. Discussion Venues Source of this draft and an issue tracker
    can be found at https://github.com/emile22/draft-stephan-green-terms-ucs-and-reqs</p>"
