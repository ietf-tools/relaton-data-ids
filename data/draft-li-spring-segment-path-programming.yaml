abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing for unicast traffic has been proposed to cope with
    the usecases in traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service chain, etc. The
    document generalizes more use cases based on segment and proposes the concept
    of Segment Path Programming. In the field of Segment Path Programming: 1. The
    Segment used in the programmed segment path is not only used in the forwarding
    plane, but also used in the control plane. 2. The programmed segment path is not
    only used in the transport layer, but also used in the service layer. Accordingly
    this document proposes use cases, architecture and protocol extension requirements
    for the Segment Path Programming (SPP).</p>"
