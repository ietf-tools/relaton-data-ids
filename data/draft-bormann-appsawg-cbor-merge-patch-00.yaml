abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the CBOR merge patch format and processing
    rules, as an analog to the JSON merge patch format defined in RFC 7396. The merge
    patch format is primarily intended for use with the HTTP PATCH method and potential
    related CoAP methods as a means of describing a set of modifications to a target
    resource's content. This specification also defines how a JSON merge patch document
    is applied to a CBOR data item and vice versa.</p>"
