abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental serverless solution to build
    Virtual Private LAN Segments (VPLS) for TCP/IP over a multicast enabled IP backbone.
    IP traffic is encapsulated in IPsec [RFC2401] tunnel mode. IP broadcast and multicast
    traffic is sent, after encapsulation in IPSec tunnel mode, to the VPN assigned
    IP multicast address. IP unicast traffic, after encapsulation, is sent directly
    to the dynamically learned IP tunnel endpoint address. Multicast Enabled ARP (ME-ARP)
    as defined in this document is used to dynamically build the mapping between IP
    addresses and remote tunnel endpoints. The tunnel endpoint information is hidden
    in the hardware address given to IP devices in the ARP reply. Therefore IP devices
    participating in a VPLS keep track of the remote locations of other VPLS members
    through their own ARP table without 'knowledge'.</p>"
