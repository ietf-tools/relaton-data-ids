abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to MPLS LSP Ping's tracing function
    as specified in IETF RFC4379 to support link bundle constructs. In particular,
    we extend the Echo Request packet format to include a new Link Bundle TLV that
    can contain both the virtual link bundle interface ID, as well as a description
    of the ECMP algorithm used by said interface. The existing downstream mapping
    processing algorithm for midpoints is modified to specify that when link bundles
    are encountered, that the component links should be revealed as would non-component
    links in the existing algorithm.</p>"
