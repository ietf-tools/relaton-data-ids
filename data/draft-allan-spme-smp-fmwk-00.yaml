abstract:
- content: "<p>Shared mesh protection allows a set of diversely routed paths with
    diverse endpoints to collectively oversubcribe protection resources. Under normal
    conditions no single failure will result in the capacity of the associated protection
    resources to be exhausted. When multiple failures occur such that more than one
    path in the set of paths utilizing shared protection resources is affected, the
    necessity arises of pre-empting traffic on the basis of business priority rather
    than application priority. This memo describes the use of SPMEs and TC marking
    as a means of indicating business priority for shared mesh protection.</p>"
