abstract:
- content: "<p>Data exchange between the control plane and the forwarding plane becomes
    the bottleneck of modern routers in terms of scalability and convergence. This
    paper describes a method which reduces the volume of information transferred from
    the control plane to the forwarding plane. The reduction has no impact on routing
    table precision, but it brings up the convergence speed significantly.</p>"
