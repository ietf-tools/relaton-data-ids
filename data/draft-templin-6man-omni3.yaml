abstract:
- content: "<p>Air/land/sea/space mobile nodes (e.g., aircraft of various configurations,
    terrestrial vehicles, seagoing vessels, space systems, enterprise wireless devices,
    pedestrians with cell phones, etc.) communicate with networked correspondents
    over wireless and/or wired-line data links and configure mobile routers to connect
    end user networks. This document presents a multilink virtual interface specification
    that enables mobile nodes to coordinate with a network- based mobility service,
    fixed node correspondents and/or other mobile node peers. The virtual interface
    provides an adaptation layer service suited for both mobile and more static environments
    such as enterprise and home networks. Both Provider-Aggregated (PA) and Provider-Independent
    (PI) addressing services are supported. This document specifies the transmission
    of IP packets over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interfaces.</p>"
