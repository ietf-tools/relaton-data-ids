abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) can have several modes of operation
    over ATM. The MPLS Framework document [1] indicates that MPLS MUST allow 'ships
    in the night' (SIN) operation with existing L2 switching protocols (e.g., ATM
    Forum Signaling). This document identifies the technical requirements that have
    to be resolved in order to allow for a successful SIN operation between MPLS and
    ATM Forum protocol stack. Solutions to the various challenges are proposed.</p>"
