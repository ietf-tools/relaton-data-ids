abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the DNS security extensions (commonly called
    "DNSSEC") that are specified RFCs 4033, 4034, 4035, and a handful of others. One
    purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in one place so that the reader can understand
    the many aspects of DNSSEC. This document does not update any of those RFCs. A
    second purpose is to state that using DNSSEC for origin authentication of DNS
    data is the best current practice. A third purpose is to provide a single reference
    for other documents that want to refer to DNSSEC. This document is currently maintained
    at https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-hoffman-dnssec. Issues and pull requests
    are welcomed.</p>
