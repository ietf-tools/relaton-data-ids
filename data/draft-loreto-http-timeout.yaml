abstract:
- content: "<p>A Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    This end-to-end header informs an origin server and any intermediaries of the
    maximum time that a client will await a response to its request. A server can
    use this header to ensure that a timely response is generated. This also identifies
    requests as being potentially long-lived, and allows for better resource allocation
    for these requests. A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hop
    header informs the entity at the other end of a connection of the maximum time
    that an idle connection is kept open. This header improves reliability by providing
    better information about the idle connection management policy of HTTP hosts.
    Comments and feedback for this draft should be directed to the authors and the
