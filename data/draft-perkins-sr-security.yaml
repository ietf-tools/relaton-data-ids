abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies various threats to networks employing segment
    routing over an IPv6 transport. Segment Routing inherits potential security vulnerabilities
    from source routing in general, and from label-switching approaches such as MPLS.
    The document discusses how common security vulnerabilities may be present in SRv6
    networks, depending on the security policies that are imposed.</p>"
