abstract:
- content: "<p>Public 4over6 is a stateful transition mechanism which assigns public
    IPv4 address to CPE/host and uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel. It doesn't involve CGN
    as in DS-lite and reduces the mapping scale on the Concentrator to per-subscriber
    level. This document describers deployment models for Public 4over6, and the deployment
    considerations of the Public 4over6 architecture.</p>"
