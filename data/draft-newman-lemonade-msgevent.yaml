abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the missing features in the existing Internet mail and messaging
    standards is a facility for server-to-server and server-to- client event notifications
    related to message store events. As the scope of Internet mail expands to support
    more diverse media (such as voice mail), devices (such as cell phones) and to
    provide rich interactions with other services (such as web portals and legal compliance
    systems), the need for an interoperable notification system increases. This document
    attempts to enumerate the types of events which interest real-world consumers
    of such a system.</p>"
