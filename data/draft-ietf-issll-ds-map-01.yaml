abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mappings of IETF Integrated Services onto IETF
    differentiated services networks. These mappings allow appropriately engineered
    and configured differentiated service network clouds to play the role of 'network
    elements' in the Integrated Services framework, and thus to be used as components
    of an overall end-to-end Integrated Services QoS solution.</p>"
