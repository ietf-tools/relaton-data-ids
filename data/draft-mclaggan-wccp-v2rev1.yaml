abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes version 2 of the Web Cache Communication Protocol
    (WCCP). The WCCP V2 protocol specifies interactions between one or more routers
    and one or more web-caches. The interaction may take place within an IPv4 or IPv6
    network. The purpose of the interaction is to establish and maintain the transparent
    redirection of selected types of traffic flowing through a group of routers (or
    similar devices). The selected traffic is redirected to a group of web-caches
    (or other traffic optimisation devices) with the aim of optimising resource usage
    and lowering response times. The protocol does not specify any interaction between
    the web-caches within a group or between a web-cache and a web-server.</p>"
