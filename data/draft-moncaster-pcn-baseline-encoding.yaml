abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to support admission
    control and flow termination in order to protect the Quality of Service of inelastic
    flows. It does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is approaching
    or has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate. This document specifies
    how such marks are to be encoded into the IP header. The baseline encoding described
    here provides for only two PCN encoding states. Other documents describe extended
    encoding schemes that allow for three encoding states. Status This memo is posted
    as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually progress to standards track.</p>"
