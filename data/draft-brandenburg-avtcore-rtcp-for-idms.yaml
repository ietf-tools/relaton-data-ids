abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives information on an RTCP Packet Type and RTCP XR
    Block Type including associated SDP parameters for inter-destination media synchronization
    (IDMS). The RTCP XR Block Type, registered with IANA based on an ETSI specification,
    is used to collect media play- out information from participants in a group playing-out
    (watching, listening, etc.) a specific RTP media stream. The RTCP packet type
    specified by this document is used to distribute a summary of the collected information
    so that the participants can synchronize play- out. Typical applications for IDMS
    are social TV, shared service control (i.e. applications where two or more geographically
    separated users are watching a media stream together), distance learning, network
    quiz shows, multi-playing online games, etc.</p>"
