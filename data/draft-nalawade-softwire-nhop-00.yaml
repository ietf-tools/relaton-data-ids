abstract:
- content: "<p>The current [MP-BGP] extensions carry routing information by associating
    the same network layer protocol with both the NLRI and the next hop. However,
    in certain scenarios, it is desirable or required to advertise next hop information
    associated with a different network layer protocol to the one associated with
    the NLRI. Similarly, when data traffic for a network layer protocol's NLRIs needs
    to be forwarded over an underlying tunnel, it is required to indicate the tunnel
    endpoint to be used for forwarding with the BGP update for a given NLRI. This
    document specifies a new BGP attribute, called the SW_NEXT_HOP attribute, which
    can optionally be used in a BGP Update message to advertise next hop information
    associated with a different network layer protocol than that of the NLRIs or convey
    information about the tunnel endpoint.</p>"
