abstract:
- content: "<p>In packet transport networks, there are requirements where reverse
    unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its
    forward unidirectional LSP. This document describes how RSVP Extended ASSOCIATION
    Object can be used to bind two co-routed point-to-point unidirectional LSPs into
    an associated co-routed bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning case. The
    RSVP REVERSE_LSP Object is used to enable an endpoint to trigger creation of the
    reverse LSP along the same path as the forward LSP. Fast-reroute procedures to
    ensure that the traffic flows on the co-routed path after a failure event are
    also described.</p>"
