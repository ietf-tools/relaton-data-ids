abstract:
- content: "<p>There is no defined mechanism today by which SIP proxies can insert
    path related information in a SIP message that is being routed across a network.
    As an example, a network administrator may want to trace the path as a SIP message
    traverses across her network to detect failure points. As another example, a user
    may want to discover capabilities of servers in the path of a call. Although there
    is an informal mention of using the OPTIONS method to achieve the latter example
    [1], there is no defined way to achieve the same today.</p>"
