abstract:
- content: '<p>This document discusses the requirements of an application layer protocol
    for Discovery Services. Discovery Services at its core offers to authenticated
    and authorized users the means to discover resources of information for a particular
    identifier. The information resource can be any data source which provides an
    interface on a network that allows for retrieval of the data. An information resource
    could publish its network address (reference to the resource) to a Discovery Service
    coupled with an identifier. Then an authenticated and authorized user could query
    the Discovery Service with the same identifier to receive reference information
    to the resources. Interfacing with the resources for actually retrieving the data
    is out of scope of Discovery Services; the role of Discovery Services is to enable
    a client to find the network addresses and types (e.g. URLs) of information resources
    for a particular identifier of interest. This protocol is applicable to numerous
    scenarios such as track and trace in trade supply chains, where a number of independent
    resources may hold information about a particular object and may have an interest
    in selective sharing of that information, in order to improve the efficiency of
    the supply chain network. However, other applications can be envisaged, as a ''bottom-up''
    or ''grassroots'' way for generators of information content to: 1) declare that
    they have information or commentary on a particular topic or subject (which might
    be a physical object, geographic location or even an abstract concept) 2) specify
    a network address through which that content can be retrieved, 3) specify restrictions
    about the community of clients that are entitled to receive knowledge about the
    existence of their content or see the link. This approach can be contrasted with
    the top-down approach of existing web search engines that rely on crawling/spidering
    of content that must be already posted in the public domain before it can be indexed
    - and where the link information is generally made publicly available in a manner
    that does not discriminate between clients on an individual basis. This document
    outlines a set of design concerns that an application layer protocol needs to
    address in order to be widely adopted and deployable on public networks This document
    obsoletes "Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service Problem Statement draft-rezafard-esds-problem-statement-02".
