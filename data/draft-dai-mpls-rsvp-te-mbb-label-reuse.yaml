abstract:
- content: <p>The concept of "make-before-break (MBB)" while rerouting MPLS RSVP-TE
    tunnels is discussed in [RFC3209]. In the procedure that is outlined, the behaviour
    of downstream label assignment for the new LSP (new tunnel instance) is not well
    defined. As a general practice, a different label is assigned by each downstream
    router and advertised to the upstream router in the RESV message for the new LSP;
    this results in a separate end-to-end data-plane path for the new LSP (with the
    exception of PHP LSPs or UHP LSP with explicit label on the last hop). The consequence
    of this practice is that the label entry gets added/deleted in the LFIB at every
    non-ingress router along the LSP path during MBB. Also, the ingress router would
    need to update all the applications using this LSP when switching to the new tunnel
    instance, as the new tunnel instance uses different outgoing label. This in turn
    may also cause other elements of the network which are dependant on the LSP to
    do the update. Such network churn can be avoided or reduced if the same label
    can be re-used (kept intact) wherever it is affecting neither the routing functionalities
    nor the data path verification of each instance. This document proposes a set
    of procedures to facilitate label reuse when there is a total or partial path
    overlap between the two tunnel instances during MBB.</p>
