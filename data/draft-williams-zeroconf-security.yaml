abstract:
- content: "<p>Devices using zeroconf networking protocols can communicate using IP
    without requiring user configuration or infrastructure services like DHCP and
    DNS. The options available to secure zeroconf networks are canvassed. A comparison
    is made between bootstrapping IPSec and securing sample protocols from each area
    listed in the zeroconf working group charter. This shows IPSec to be the most
    promising approach for securing zeroconf protocols.</p>"
