abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol for conveying binary MIME content
    in near-real time, peer-to-peer or through one or more relays, with the opportunity
    for store and forward. SIMS (SIMPLE Instant Messaging Sessions) can be used as
    a standalone protocol, or in conjunction with a rendezvous or session setup protocol
    such as SIP. While SIMS was originally envisioned as an alternative to the Media
    Session Relay Protocol (MSRP), one section of this document describes how these
    ideas could be applied as MSRP extensions for features such as chunking, relay
    connection multiplexing, and prevention of head-of-line blocking.</p>"
