abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes Fast Secure BGP (FS-BGP), an efficient mechanism
    for securing AS paths and preventing prefix hijacking by signing critical AS path
    segments (i.e., adjacent AS triples). FS-BGP can achieve similar level of security
    as S-BGP, but with much higher efficiency.</p>"
