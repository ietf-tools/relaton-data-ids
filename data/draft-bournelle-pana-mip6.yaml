abstract:
- content: "<p>A Mobile IPv6 node needs a home address, a home agent address and a
    security association with its home agent. One of the current challenge is to dynamically
    provide these information to the Mobile Node. This problem is known as the Mobile
    IPv6 Bootstrapping problem. A solution for this is to rely on the AAA infrastructure
    to provide the Home Agent Information to the Network Access server (NAS). Then
    the Mobile Node uses DHCPv6 to get this information. This document provides a
    way for the Mobile Node to get the Home Agent information by using the PANA protocol
    instead of DHCPv6. Before the authentication phase, the PANA Authentication Agent
    (PAA) indicates to the PANA Client (PaC) that it can provide him with the Home
    Agent Information. According to the PANA client's response, after the authentication
    and authorization phase with the AAA infrastructure, the PAA will send this information
    to the PaC.</p>"
