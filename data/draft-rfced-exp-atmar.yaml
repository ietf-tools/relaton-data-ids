abstract:
- content: "<p>Telnet is a protocol that may be operated in either a peer-to-peer,
    fully symmetric mode, or asymmetrically, in a host-terminal mode. Although the
    original intention for the NVT mode of operation was both asymmetric and half-duplex,
    where neither the host nor the terminal echoed characters back to one another,
    the most common mode of usage has come to be one of asymmetric full-duplex communications,
    where all terminal characters are first transmitted to the host computer and then
    echoed back to the terminal before being displayed.</p>"
