abstract:
- content: "<p>Compute First Networking (CFN) leverages both computing and networking
    status to help determine the optimal edge among multiple edge sites with different
    geographic locations to serve a specific edge computing request. Requests for
    the same service can be determined and dispatched to different edges based on
    service requirements, network and computing resource conditions and other factors
    to achieve better load balancing and system efficiency. The request needs to be
    dispatched to the selected edge in real time and the subsequent packets from the
    same flow should be served by the same edge for flow affinity. This document describes
    a framework of CFN to achieve the desired features.</p>"
