abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a way for implementing a IGMP/MLD proxy- reporting
    switch in which reports received from downstream hosts and queries received from
    upstream routers are used to build the Subscription Aggregation table. Subscription
    Aggregation table can be used for forwarding multicast data traffic, sending state
    change and current state reports to upstream router ports.</p>"
