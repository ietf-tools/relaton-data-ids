abstract:
- content: "<p>In many applications where different nodes cooperate on some work,
    there is a need to guarantee that the work happens atomically. That is, each node
    must reach the same conclusion as to whether the work is to be completed, even
    in the face of failures. This document proposes a simple, easily-implemented protocol
    for achieving this end. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
