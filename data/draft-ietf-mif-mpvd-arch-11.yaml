abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture
    Design team. It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced
    by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously. The framework
    defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set
    of network configuration information. PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information
    from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources. PvDs are used to
    enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent
    connections.</p>"
