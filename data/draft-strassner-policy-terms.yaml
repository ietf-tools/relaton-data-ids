abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which support
    the classification of packets for the purposes of treating certain classes or
    flows of packets in a particular way compared to other packets. The successful
    wide-scale deployment of these protocols depends on the ability to administer
    and distribute consistent policy information to the multiple devices in the network
    which perform the classification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result,
    there is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy administration
    and distribution that will enable interoperability among multiple devices and
    device types that must work together to achieve a consistent implementation of
    policy. Unfortunately, terms like 'policy' and 'service' are not currently defined
    in sufficient detail as to enable the definition, specification, and implementation
    of policy servers and how policy is recognized and enforced at the device level.
    At present, both 'policy' and 'service' (as well as other related terms) are overloaded
    with multiple (often conflicting) meanings. This makes communication about policy
    in general and specifically policy-based networking cumbersome and difficult.
    This document defines a set of terms that the Internet community can use to exchange
    ideas on how policy creation, administration, management, and distribution could
    work among policy servers and multiple device types.</p>"
