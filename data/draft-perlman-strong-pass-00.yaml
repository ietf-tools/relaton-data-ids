abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new password-based protocol that can be used
    as the basis of mutual authentication, or downloading of a private key. The only
    thing the client needs to know is the user's password. The protocol is constructed
    such that an eavesdropper cannot do off-line password-guessing attacks. Someone
    stealing the server's database cannot directly impersonate the user, although
    they can do an off-line password-guessing attack on the contents. The protocol
    presented in this paper is similar in functionality, higher in performance at
    the server, but lower in performance at the client, to the extended EKE and SPEKE,
    and SRP schemes. Additional properties of this scheme are salt, no password-equivalent
    stored at the server, and prevention of servers on which the user has the same
    password from impersonating each other to the user. This document gives an overview
    of the approach, but not wire-formats, which are premature at this stage. The
    purpose of this document is to advertise this new scheme to various groups that
    might be interested (CAT, for a GSS-API mechanism, LDAP, for download of a private
    key).</p>"
