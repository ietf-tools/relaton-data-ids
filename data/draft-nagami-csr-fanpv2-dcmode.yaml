abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the specification of FANPv2 (Flow Attribute Notification
    Protocol version 2) distributed control mode (DC-mode). The FANPv2 is a protocol
    used by Cell Switch Routers (CSRs) to communicate mapping information between
    a specific packet flow and a virtual connection that conveys the packet flow.
    In the DC-mode, the control message exchange for a packet flow between each pair
    of neighboring CSRs is initiated independently from the message exchange for the
    same flow between any other pair of CSRs. The DC-mode is applicable to the control
    of both unicast and multicast cut-through paths.</p>"
