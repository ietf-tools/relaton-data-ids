abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new RTP payload type for the insertion of Forward
    Error Correction (FEC) in RTP. This solution is based on Reed-Solomon codes that
    protect the transmission both from packet losses and bit errors which may affect
    the communication over wireless links. These codes are systematic, thus being
    completely transparent to FEC unaware RTP clients. The new payload defined in
    this draft and the insertion of RS codes are particularly suited for H.264 video
    streaming.</p>"
