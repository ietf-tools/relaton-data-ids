abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism by which a Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) server acting as a traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) can register
    with a SIP Service Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for SIP User Agents (UAs).
    In order to function properly, this mechanism requires that each of the Addresses
    of Record (AORs) registered in bulk map to a unique set of contacts. This requirement
    is satisfied by AORs representing phone numbers regardless of the domain, since
    phone numbers are fully qualified and globally unique. This document therefore
    focuses on this use case. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
