abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method to be used by VPN (Virtual Private
    Network) Service Providers to provide multi-homed CEs with fast protection of
    egress PEs. Egress PEs in a redundant group always share the same label in distribution
    of VPN routes of a VRF. A virtual Next Hop (vNH) in the IGP/MPLS backbone is created
    as the common end of LSP tunnels which would otherwise terminate at each egress
    PE. Primary and backup LSP tunnels ended at the vNH are set up by MPLS on the
    basis of existing Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) Fast ReRoute (FRR) mechanisms.
    If the primary egress PE fails, the backup egress PE can recognize the "shared"
    VPN route label carried by the data packets. Therefore, the failure affected data
    packets can be smoothly rerouted to the backup PE for delivery without changing
    their VPN route label.</p>
