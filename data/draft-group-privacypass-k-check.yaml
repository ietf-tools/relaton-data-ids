- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol called K-Check for implementing
    HTTP resource consistency checks. The primary use case for K-Check is for deployments
    of protocols such as Privacy Pass and Oblivious HTTP in which privacy goals require
    that clients have a consistent view of some protocol-specific resource (typically,
    a public key).</p>"
