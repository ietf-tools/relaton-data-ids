abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines two new Multi Topology Routing Identifiers (MT IDs),
    based on [I-D.ietf-ospf-mt-ospfv3] and two new Instance Identifiers (MI IDs),
    based on [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt], respectively, in OSPFv3. With these identifiers,
    an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology is maintained for both IPv6 unicast and multicast
    traffic. The purpose of running separate instances or topologies for IPv4- Embedded
    IPv6 traffic is to distinguish from the native IPv6 routing topology, and the
    topology that is used for routing IPv4-Embedded IPv6 datagrams only. Separate
    instances/topologies are also meant to prevent any overload of the native IPv6
    routing tables by IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes.</p>"
