abstract:
- content: <p>In cognitive sensor networks, the cooperative spectrum sensing can effectively
    improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. However, it is also facing with the
    security issues caused by attacks of potential malicious users. Lots of algorithms
    are proposed in existing literatures to cope with the potential attacks. However,
    the traditional strategies are mainly suitable for relative simple and ideal attack
    such as the all "1" or all "0" attack. Therefore, we define a more universal anti
    Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) framework in the document, which can
    better cope with the probabilistic attacks and random attacks which are closer
    to the reality.</p>
