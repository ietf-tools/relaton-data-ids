abstract:
- content: <p>Repair path mechanism is an important element in IP/LDP fast reroute.
    In this document we propose a way to calculate local repair paths using alternative
    shortest paths. The solution can provide complete coverage for all destinations
    within an IGP area that can possibly be protected. In this document we also suggested
    an "Explicit Path with Loose Segment" model that can be used to characterize,
    classify, and analyse repair paths. We proved some of the common properties of
    loose segments, and showed that the model can be used to characterize all existing
    fast reroute solutions.</p>
