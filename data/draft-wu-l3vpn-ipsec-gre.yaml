abstract:
- content: "<p>Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network (PPVPN)[RFC4110] uses
    some forms of IP tunneling schemes to tunnel VPN traffic. Possible candidates
    are GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec and MPLS. The candidate tunneling scheme should provide
    multiplexing capability, as well as dynamic tunnel setup and maintenance capability.
    Additionally, security is required if the VPN traffic is traversing public Internet
    or across Service Provider domains. Each above candidate by itself is not sufficient
    to meet all these requirements. This document describes a method of using IPsec
    signaling (i.e, IKE) to setup a GRE tunnel. This IPsec GRE tunnel may be used
    as the candidate tunneling scheme in PPVPN network or remote access compulsory
    VPN. This document also defines a way how the Key field in GRE header is used
    in IPsec GRE tunnel setup.</p>"
