abstract:
- content: "<p>In situ measurement is performed by incorporating performance related
    information into in-flight data packets. This document specifies a new IOAM Option-Type
    that has a fixed length and can be updated by transit nodes along the path. It
    enables lightweight monitoring while maintaining a constant length that is not
    changed in-flight and is not affected by the number of hops in the network.</p>"
