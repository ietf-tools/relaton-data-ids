abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Access Identifier can be added to a Mobile IP registration
    request to identify the user and to allow the assignment of a dynamic home address.
    However, users may want to open several simultaneous sessions using the same NAI
    from the same or different devices and to obtain a unique IP address for each
    session. The Mobile IP Session Identifier Extension defined in this draft can
    be used to distinguish registration requests belonging to these various sessions.
    This draft also clarifies how a dynamic address is to be managed when and if the
    user returns to the home network that assigned the address.</p>"
