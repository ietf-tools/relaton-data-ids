abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 4858 talks about "Document Shepherding from Working Group Last Call
    to Publication". There's a significant part of a document's life that happens
    before working group last call, starting at the time that a working group begins
    discussing a version of the idea that's been posted as an individual draft. This
    document extends RFC 4858, discussing the potential for extending shepherding
    and what tasks might be involved throughout a working group document's lifecycle,
    from start to finish.</p>
