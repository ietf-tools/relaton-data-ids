abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines various limits that may be applied to receiving,
    sending, and otherwise processing packets that contain IPv6 extension headers.
    The need for such limits is pragmatic to facilitate interoperability amongst hosts
    and routers in the presence of extension headers and thereby increasing the feasibility
    of deployment of extension headers.</p>"
