abstract:
- content: "<p>This framework defines a method of providing Explicit Congestion Control
    to real-time inelastic traffic like voice and video through the use of session
    admission control and preemption mechanisms. This approach uses the Pre-Congestion
    Notification Marking (PCN) [1] mechanism. PCN marking is deployed in routers to
    measure and convey two levels of onset of congestion with the SIP controlled endpoints
    responding to the marking. This approach is different from what is defined in
    An edge-to-edge Deployment Model for Pre-Congestion Notification [3], as here
    the admission and preemption control function resides in the application (either
    in the endpoint or the application server that controls the endpoint. This framework
    is focused on using Session Initiated Protocol (SIP) as the application signaling
    protocol but other application signaling protocols could be extended for this
    purpose.</p>"
