abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol (BFD) is used to detect
    loss of connectivity between two forwarding elements, typically with low latency.
    BFD is leveraged by routing protocols, including the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),
    to use that detection of loss of connectivity to bring down the protocol connections
    faster than the native protocol timers. This document defines a Subcode for the
    BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message for when a BGP connection is being closed due to
    a BFD session going down.</p>"
