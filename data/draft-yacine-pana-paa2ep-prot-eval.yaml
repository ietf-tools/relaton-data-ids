abstract:
- content: "<p>The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) does not necessarily act as an
    Enforcement Point (EP) to prevent unauthorized access or usage of the network.
    When a PANA Client (PaC) successfully authenticates itself to the PAA, EP(s) (e.g.,
    access routers) will need to be suitably notified. The PANA working group will
    identify a (preferably existing) protocol solution that allows the PAA to deliver
    the authorization information to one or more EPs when the PAA is separated from
    EPs. The present document aims at discussing the various protocol solutions available
    and identifying one, which better fits the whole PANA picture.</p>"
