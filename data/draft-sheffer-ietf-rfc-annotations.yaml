abstract:
- content: "<p>RFCs were initially intended as, literally, requests for comments.
    Since then, they have turned into standards documents, with a peculiar process
    to report errors and a highly onerous process to actually have the RFC modified/republished.
    Non-IETF participants are typically unaware of any way to provide feedback to
    published RFCs, other than direct email to the listed authors. This is very different
    from the way many web specifications are developed today and arguably leads to
    the value of published RFCs diminishing over time. This document proposes an experiment
    to remedy this situation through the deployment of web annotations.</p>"
