abstract:
- content: "<p>Customers buying enterprise message systems often ask: Can I track
    the messages? Message tracking is the ability to find out the path that a particular
    message has taken through a messaging system and the current routing status of
    that message. This document provides a model of message tracking that can be used
    for understanding the Internet-wide message infrastructure and to further enhance
    those capabilities to include message tracking, as well as requirements for proposed
    message tracking solutions. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
