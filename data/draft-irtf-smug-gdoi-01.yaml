abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an ISAKMP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for
    secure group communications. The 'GDOI,' or 'Group ISAKMP,' borrows definitions
    from GSAKMP [HH], incorporates the Phase 1 SA of the Internet DOI [RFC2407, RFC2409],
    and proposes new payloads and exchanges according to the ISAKMP standard [RFC2408,
    p.14]. Group ISAKMP manages group security associations, which are used by security
    protocols running at the IP [RFC2406] or application layers [AMESP]. These security
    associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys,
    or data shared by group members. Comments on this document should be addressed
    to smug@cs.umass.edu.</p>"
