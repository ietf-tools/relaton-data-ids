abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI)
    signaling procedures used in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. PNNI is
    a hierarchical link-state routing protocol that enables topology discovery, dynamic
    routing, and call establishment across ATM networks. This document outlines the
    signaling model, hierarchical routing structures, call setup procedures, and interoperability
    considerations for both modern and legacy ATM network implementations.</p>"
