abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents Mobile IPv6 [1] operation in IPv4 networks by using
    existing automatic tunneling method. A mobile IPv6 node uses Mobile IPv6 to maintain
    connectivity while moving between IPv6 subnets. Not all access networks will transition
    to IPv6 at once. Therefore, seamless Mobile IPv6 connectivity is not guarantied
    since a mobile IPv6 node may roam into an IPv4 only network. We describe a scheme,
    named GLOB6, to allow mobile IPv6 nodes to traverse IPv4 subnets by using automatic
    tunneling. ISATAP [2] is an example automatic tunneling mechanism described in
    this document to enable Mobile IPv6 connectivity over IPv4 networks. The draft
    concludes with a brief description of how the scheme can be applied to certain
    3G networks as well as WLAN deployments as part of an overall strategy for the
    realization of global mobility - a main feature of IPv6.</p>"
