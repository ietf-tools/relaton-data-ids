abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    2, TCP-like Congestion Control, in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
    [DCCP]. DCCP implements a congestion-controlled, unreliable flow of datagrams
    suitable for use by applications such as streaming media. The TCP-like Congestion
    Control CCID is used by senders who are able to adapt to the abrupt changes in
    the congestion window typical of the AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease)
    congestion control in TCP. TCP-like Congestion Control is particularly useful
    for senders who would like to take advantage of the available bandwidth in an
    environment with rapidly changing conditions</p>"
