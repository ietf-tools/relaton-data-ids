abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes API considerations to provide applications
    with SCONE-PRO metadata, notifying them of network-supplied information about
    acceptable network flow rates. Since this information is signalled from the network
    within the stack below the application, it needs to be made accessible to applications
    in order for them to pick proper video rates, or to otherwise confine the application
    behavior within network-defined limits.</p>"
