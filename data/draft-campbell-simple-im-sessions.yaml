abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIP MESSAGE method is used to send instant messages, where each
    message is independent of any other message. This is often called pager-mode messaging,
    due to the fact that this model is similar to that of most two-way pager devices.
    Another model is called session-mode. In session-mode, the instant messages are
    part of a media session that provides ordering, a security context, and other
    functions. This media session is established using a SIP INVITE, just as an audio
    or video session would be established. This document describes a The Message Session
    Relay Protocol (MSRP), a mechanism for transmitting session-mode messages with
    minimal relay support. Additionally, this document describes using the SDP offer/
    answer model to initiate such sessions.</p>"
