abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is designed to operate
    along with Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in unicast, single-source multicast
    and any-source multicast environments. With the availability of overlay multicast
    and Application Layer Multicast (ALM), the suitability of RTCP in such environments
    needs to be analyzed. The applicability of the existing RTCP reporting architectures
    in overlay multicast and ALM environments are investigated and the new features
    that may be required are discussed in this document.</p>"
