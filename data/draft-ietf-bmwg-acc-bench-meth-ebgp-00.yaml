abstract:
- content: "<p>Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with
    multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and being managed.
    To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is necessary that the router
    be tested in these simultaneous operational conditions, which is known as Stress
    Testing. This document provides the Methodology for performing Stress Benchmarking
    of networking devices when subjected to instability with eBGP-4. Descriptions
    of Test Topology, Benchmarks and Reporting Format are provided in addition to
    procedures for conducting various test cases. This methodology is based upon the
    accelerated stress methodology guidelines [6] and is to be used with the companion
    terminology document [4].</p>"
