abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is an implementation report about the peer-to-peer SIP system
    developed in the European IST Ambient Networks research project. This system replaces
    the traditional SIP proxy-registrar function with a distributed lookup mechanism,
    adds overlay functionality to the SIP signalling and to RTP traffic, takes care
    about media/packet relay lookup and insertion into the SIP/RTP paths, plus automatic
    adaptation of the voice transmission according to changing network conditions.
    Standard, unmodified SIP user agents are used for communication. The presented
    system is work in progress and this memo is an attempt to gather IETF community
    feedback about the described approach.</p>"
