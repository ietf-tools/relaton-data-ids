abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP
    provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting
    real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast
    network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee
    quality-of- service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by
    a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner
    scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification
    functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport
    and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and
    mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it
    obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes
    to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change
    is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send
    RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate
    when many participants join a session simultaneously. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
