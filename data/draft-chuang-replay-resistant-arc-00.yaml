abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM (RFC6376 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376)) is an IETF standard
    for the cryptographic protocol to authenticate email at the domain level and protect
    the integrity of messages during transit. Section 8.6 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6376.html#section-8.6)
    defines a vulnerability called DKIM Replay as a spam message sent through a SMTP
    MTA DKIM signer, that then is sent to many more recipients, leveraging the reputation
    of the signer. We propose two Replay Resistant cryptographic domain based protocols
    that leverage ARC (RFC8617 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8617.html)). The
    first technique discloses all SMTP recipients as signed RFC822 headers by the
    sender which allows a receiver to verify this. The second technique defines a
    SMTP extension that allows both the sender and receiver to participate in signing
    the message signature. It includes a path building technique that accurately defines
    the SMTP forwarding path of the message. Both techniques permit a receiver to
    detect DKIM and ARC replay.</p>"
