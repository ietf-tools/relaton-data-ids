abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP- BGP)now plays
    an important role in the transition of their Provider (P) core network as well
    as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators must be able to
    continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge networks are IPv6-Only.
    This document details an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-CE Edge IPv6-Only peering
    design that leverages the MP-BGP capability exchange by using IPv6 peering as
    pure transport, allowing both IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)
    and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be carried over the same
    (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session. The design change provides the same
    Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate IPv4 and IPv6 BGP
    sessions as we have today. With this design change from a control plane perspective
    a single IPv6 is required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates and from a data
    plane forwarindg perspective an IPv6 address need only be configured on the PE
    and CE interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding. This document provides
    a much needed solution for Internet Exchange Point (IXP) that are facing IPv4
    address depletion at large peering points. With this design, IXP can now deploy
    PE-CE IPv6-Only eBGP Edge peering design to eliminate IPv4 provisioning at the
    Edge. This core and edge IPv6-Only peering design paradigm change can apply to
    any eBGP peering, public internet or private, which can be either Core networks,
    Data Center networks, Access networks or can be any eBGP peering scenario. This
    document provides vendor specific test cases for the IPv6-Only peering design
    as well as test results for the five major vendors stakeholders in the routing
    and switching indusrty, Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei. With the test
    results provided for the IPv6-Only Edge peering design, the goal is that all other
    vendors around the world that have not been tested will begin to adopt and implement
    this new Best Current Practice for eBGP IPv6-Only Edge peering. As this issue
    with IXP IPv4 address depletion is a critical issue around the world, it is imperative
    for an immediate solution that can be implemented quickly. This Best Current Practice
    IPv6-only eBGP peering design specification will help proliferate IPv6-Only deployments
    at the eBGP Edge network peering points to starting immediately at a minimum with
    operators around the world using Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei. As
    other vendors start to implement this Best Current Practice, the IXP IPv4 address
    depletion gap will eventually be eliminated.</p>"
