abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the SPNEGO Extended Negotiation (NEGOEX) Security
    Mechanism. NEGOEX enhances the capabilities of SPNEGO by providing a security
    mechanism which can be negotiated by the SPNEGO protocol as defined in RFC4178.
    The NEGOEX protocol itself is a security mechanism negotiated by SPNEGO. When
    the NEGOEX security mechanism is selected by SPNEGO, NEGOEX provides a method
    allowing selection of a common authentication protocol based on factors beyond
    just the fact that both client and server support a given security mechanism.
    NEGOEX OPTIONALLY adds a pair of meta-data messages for each negotiated security
    mechanism. The meta-data exchange allows security mechanisms to exchange auxiliary
    information such as trust configurations, thus NEGOEX provides more flexibility
    than just exchanging security mechanism OIDs in SPNEGO. NEGOEX preserves the optimistic
    token semantics of SPNEGO and applies that recursively. Consequently a context
    establishment mechanism token can be included in the initial NEGOEX message, and
    NEGOEX does not require an extra round-trip when the initiator's optimistic token
    is accepted by the target. Similar to SPNEGO, NEGOEX defines a few new GSS-API
    extensions that a security mechanism MUST support in order to be negotiated by
    NEGOEX. This document defines these GSS-API extensions. Unlike SPNEGO however,
    NEGOEX defines its own way for signing the protocol messages in order to protect
    the protocol negotiation. The NEGOEX message signing or verification can occur
    before the security context for the negotiated real security mechanism is fully
    established.</p>"
