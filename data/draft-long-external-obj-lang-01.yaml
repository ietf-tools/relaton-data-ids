    Language) and an associated method which, together, provide a means of representing
    situations or types of situations. It can thus be used to represent objects, events,
    or systems of objects and events or types of objects, events or systems. Objects
    represented can be computer data objects ('stack', 'word processor', 'user interface',
    etc.) or 'real' objects such as computers, networks, users, and so on.</p>"
