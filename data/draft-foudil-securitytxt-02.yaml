abstract:
- content: "<p>When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security
    researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels
    to properly disclose them. As a result, security issues may be left unreported.
    security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security
    researchers to securely disclose security vulnerabilities.</p>"
