abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the timing for implementing a worldwide IPv6-Ready
    DNS and DNSSEC infrastructure, in order to facilitate the global IPv6-only deployment.
    A key issue for this, is the need for a global support of DNSSEC and DNS64, which
    in some scenarios do not work well together. This document states that any DNSSEC
    signed resources records should include a native IPv6 resource record as the most
    complete and expedient path to solve any deployment conflict with DNS64 and DNSSEC</p>"
