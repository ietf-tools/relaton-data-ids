abstract:
- content: "<p>Non Shortest Paths (NSPs) used in routing protocols e.g. by the link
    state routing protocols (IS-IS, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3) within IGP topologies. NSPs
    help to reduce the data plane path overhead, mitigate from MTU issues as well
    as performance related issues in certain data planes and allows granular traffic
    accounting in the network. NSPs are created locally by operator or can be provisioned
    through PCE or Yang from outside. This document describes a mechanism by which
    NSP information currently active in the network using the BGP routing protocol
    by defining extensions to BGP Link- state address-family.</p>"
