abstract:
- content: <p>The wide deployment of Voice over IP (VoIP), Real-time Text and Video
    over IP services has introduced new challenges in managing and maintaining voice/real-time
    Text/video quality, reliability, and overall performance. In particular, media
    delivery is an area that needs attention. One method of meeting these challenges
    is monitoring the media delivery performance by looping media back to the transmitter.
    This is typically referred to as "active monitoring" of services. Media loopback
    is especially popular in ensuring the quality of transport to the edge of a given
    VoIP, Real-time Text or Video over IP service. Today in networks that deliver
    real-time media, short of running 'ping' and 'traceroute' to the edge, service
    providers are left without the necessary tools to actively monitor, manage, and
    diagnose quality issues with their service. The extension defined herein adds
    new SDP media attributes which enables establishment of media sessions where the
    media is looped back to the transmitter. Such media sessions will serve as monitoring
    and troubleshooting tools by providing the means for measurement of more advanced
    VoIP, Real-time Text and Video over IP performance metrics.</p>
