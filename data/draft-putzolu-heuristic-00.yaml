abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISSLOW subgroup of the ISSL working group has defined a set of
    mechanisms for providing integrated services over low bandwidth links [1]. These
    mechanisms rely on an announcement protocol (typically RSVP [2]) to determine
    which streams require other than best-effort service and to determine what level
    and type of service to provide for such streams. It is anticipated that at least
    some of the mechanisms defined by the ISSLOW subgroup, specifically Compressed
    RTP [3] (CRTP) [4] and Multi-Channel Multi-Link PPP (MCML) [5], will be available
    well before RSVP has been widely deployed. Given the proliferation of applications
    streaming audio and video using the mechanisms defined in the AVT working group
    (e.g., RTP), a means of utilizing these mechanisms in the absence of an announcement
    protocol would be beneficial. Such means have been proposed in [6], but they require
    changes to applications so as to be able to indicate the need for special treatment.
    This document describes a set of heuristics for use with the mechanisms defined
    in the ISSLOW subgroup that provide an enhanced degree of service for audio/video
    streaming applications without requiring that changes be made to applications.
    The approach taken is to provide a default set of heuristics that implementations
    of MCML and CRTP can use to provide enhanced service over PPP links for audio
    and video streams without requiring any application or infrastructure changes.</p>"
