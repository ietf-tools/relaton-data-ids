abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, we propose a unified Route Optimization (RO) scheme that
    can solve several types of RO problem by using Path Control Header (PCH) Piggybacking.
    In our scheme, Home Agent (HA) does piggyback the PCH on the packet which is reversely
    forwarded from Mobile Router (MR). That enables any PCH-aware routing facility
    on the route to make a RO tunnel with MR using the Care-of address of MR contained
    in the PCH. By applying to some already known NEMO RO problems, we show that our
    scheme can incrementally optimize the routes via default HA-MR tunnel through
    the simple PCH interpretation.</p>"
