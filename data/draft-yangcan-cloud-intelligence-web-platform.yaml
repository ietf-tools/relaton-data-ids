abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft mainly focuses on the scalable architecture and publishing
    protocol standard of REST-based SAAS cloud model Web software in non- programming
    mode, stipulates the data structure pattern and data exchange protocol for the
    construction and release of REST-based scalable Web cloud service software systems.
    Using the standardized framework and protocol, users can easily and quickly design
    their own software systems in the cloud, transfer and release data, which may
    make conventional software development so ease to improve the efficiency of complex
    database construction and server management. Without having to write codes under
    the standard framework, users can get consistent style background to create service,
    rapidly develop web application systems with the function of standard data management
    and data maintenance, and directly publish the software system to the end users
    of the Internet for access and use. And provide RESTful APIs to facilitate external
    access to required service resources. The framework can thus greatly shorten the
    software development life cycle, and save a great deal of development cost and
    maintenance overhead.</p>"
