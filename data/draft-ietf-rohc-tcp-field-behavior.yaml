abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes TCP/IP field behavior in the context of header
    compression. Header compression is possible because most header fields do not
    vary randomly from packet to packet. Many of the fields exhibit static behavior
    or change in a more or less predictable way. When a header compression scheme
    is designed, it is of fundamental importance to understand the behavior of the
    fields in detail. An example of this analysis can be seen in RFC 3095. This memo
    performs a similar role for the compression of TCP/IP headers. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
