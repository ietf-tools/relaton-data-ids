abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a general notary service and the protocols
    to be used when communicating with it. The Notary Authority is a Trusted Third
    Party (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable non-repudiation
    services (see [ISONR]). We also give an example of how to use the notary to extend
    the lifetime of a signature beyond key expiry or revocation.</p>"
