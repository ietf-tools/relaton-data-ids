abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a multi-tenant (or multi-department) data
    centre operator can isolate tenants from network performance degradation due to
    each other's usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN-style
    network where anyone can use any amount of any resource. Zero per-tenant configuration
    and no implementation change is required on network equipment. Instead the solution
    is implemented with a simple change to the hypervisor (or container) beneath the
    tenant's virtual machines on every physical server connected to the network. These
    collectively enforce a very simple distributed contract - a single network allowance
    that each tenant can allocate among their virtual machines, even if distributed
    around the network. The solution uses layer-3 switches that support explicit congestion
    notification (ECN). It is best if the sending operating system supports congestion
    exposure (ConEx). Nonetheless, the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete
    solution while operating systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx
    and ECN.</p>"
