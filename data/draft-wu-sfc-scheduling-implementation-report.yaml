abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the application examples of mapping and deployment
    algorithms to address the problems of large resource overhead and end-to-end latency
    in Service Function Chain(SFC) that cannot meet the requirements of latency-sensitive
    applications in terms of both latency optimization and resource optimization.In
    terms of delay-optimized mapping and deployment of SFC, the application example
    of granularity-variable SFC mapping algorithm based on microservice architecture
    reduces the number of instantiated microservice units and the number of end-to-end
    routing hops by merging redundant microservice units within the service function
    chain and reusing microservice units between the service function chains.In terms
    of resource-optimized mapping and deployment of SFC, the application example of
    SFC mapping algorithm based on improved gray wolf optimization algorithm optimizes
    the mapping of SFC through two strategies of reverse learning initialization and
    nonlinear convergence factor, and improves the efficiency of the mapping scheme.</p>"
