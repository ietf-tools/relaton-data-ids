abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies requirements for inter-carrier OAM supporting
    end-to-end OAM functionality and mechanisms development in a multi- operator environment.
    It reviews the already proposed OAM requirements addressed in IETF [RFC5706, RFC5860],
    ITU-T [Y.1730],MEF [MEFOAM] and IEEE [IEEE1, IEEE2] which were mainly proposed
    on a per transport technology basis, but aims to differentiate and focus on the
    requirements and additional requirements resulting from inter- operator considerations
    only.</p>"
