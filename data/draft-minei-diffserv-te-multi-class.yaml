- content: "<p>This document specifies the extensions necessary to set up multi- class
    diffserv-aware traffic engineered label switched paths (LSPs). A multi-class diffserv-te
    LSP carries traffic from multiple traffic classes and is set up along a path that
    satisfies the bandwidth constraints defined for each of the classes it carries.</p>"
