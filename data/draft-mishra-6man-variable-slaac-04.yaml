abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes the use of arbitrary length prefixes in PIO for
    SLAAC. A prefix of length 63 in PIO, for example, would be permitted to form an
    address whose interface identifier length is 65, which allows several benefits.
    A prefix of length 65 would be allowed too, but it SHOULD NOT be used on a large
    scale, like at a large ISP; this is to avoid a race to the bottom. The implementation
    uses a parameter in the Host; this option is off by default. In that case, the
    Host respects the 64bit boundary. When the parameter is set to on the Host accepts
    prefixes of lengths different than 64 and forms 128bit addresses. In the past,
    various IPv6 addressing models have been proposed based on a subnet hierarchy
    embedding a 64-bit prefix. The last remnant of IPv6 classful addressing is a inflexible
    interface identifier boundary at /64. This document proposes flexibility to the
    fixed position of that boundary for interface addressing.</p>"
