abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP-MD5 option is most commonly used to secure BGP sessions between
    routers. However, changing the long-term key is difficult, since the change needs
    to be synchronized between different organizations. We describe single-ended strategies
    that will permit (mostly) unsynchronized key changes. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
