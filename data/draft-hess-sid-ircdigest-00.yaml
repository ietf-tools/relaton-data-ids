abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method with-which Digest Authentication can
    be performed between two clients over the IRC protocol and specifies a way in
    which digest authentication may be used by an IRC server to validate the authorization
    of a client attempting to connect or gain operator privileges on the server without
    the revealing the 'password' being used in the process to a third party packet-sniffing
    the connection for the very purpose of discovering it.</p>"
