abstract:
- content: <p>Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent, location-independent,
    resource identifiers. To structure and organize their usage, the URN syntax specifies
    a hierarchy that divides the set of possible URNs into "URN Namespaces" that can
    be individually defined and managed. URN Namespaces in particular serve to map
    existing identifier systems into the URN system and thereby make available generic,
    network-based resolution services for the identified documents, artifacts, and
    other objects (and their metadata). To actually leverage such synergetic advantage,
    URN Namespaces need to be specified in a comparable manner, and their Namespace
    Identifiers (NIDs) need to be registered with IANA, so that naming conflicts are
    avoided and implementers of services can follow a structured approach in support
    of various namespaces, guided by the registry to the related documents and the
    particularities of specific namespaces, as described in these namespace registration
    documents. This document serves as a guideline for authors of URN Namespace definition
    and registration documents. It describes the essential content of such documents
    and how they shall be structured to allow readers familar with the scheme to quickly
    assess the properties of a specific URN Namespace. Further, this RFC describes
    the process to be followed to get a URN Namespace registered with IANA. This document
    is a companion document to the revised URN Syntax specification, RFC 2141bis;
    it supersedes and replaces RFC 3406.</p>
