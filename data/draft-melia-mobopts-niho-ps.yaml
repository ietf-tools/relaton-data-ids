abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a first document describing the rational about network support
    for decision making and execution of handovers. Starting from existing technologies
    and considering new trends from mobile operators, we draw potential deployment
    scenarios and derive a set of associated functionalities. These functionalities
    and associated assumptions are listed in the document. Application areas for network
    initiated handovers are then illustrated specifying a set of goals and non-goals
    to be addressed in a future version.</p>"
