abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that allows
    for faster detection of SA desynchronization using a saved token. When an IPsec
    tunnel between two IKEv2 peers is disconnected due to a restart of one peer, it
    can take as much as several minutes for the other peer to discover that the reboot
    has occurred, thus delaying recovery. In this text we propose an extension to
    the protocol, that allows for recovery immediately following the restart.</p>"
