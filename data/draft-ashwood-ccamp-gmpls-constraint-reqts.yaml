abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes requirements for connecting a pure photonic sub-domain
    to a GMPLS-based Label Switch Router. One of the main requirements is to avoid
    advertising all the physical properties of the underlying optical hardware while
    still peering with standard GMPLS. This draft discusses the requirements for abstracting
    the optical topology and the implications of various abstract models. This draft
    discusses possible extensions to [OSPF-TE] [GMPLS- Routing] and [ISIS-TE] for
    use by GMPLS networks that require additional constraints to be considered in
    the computation of viable paths.</p>"
