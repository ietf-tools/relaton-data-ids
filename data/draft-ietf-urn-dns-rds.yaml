abstract:
- content: "<p>The architectural principles laid out in RFC2276[9] defines the concept
    of a 'resolver discovery service'. This document describes an immediately-deployable
    RDS. It is implemented by a new DNS Resource Record, NAPTR (Naming Authority PoinTeR)[10],
    that provides a method for encoding incrementally discovered rules within DNS.
    By using these incrementally discovered rules to re-map parts of a URI, we can
    change the host that is contacted to resolve a URI. This will allow a more graceful
    handling of URLs over long time periods, and forms the foundation for a new proposal
    for Uniform Resource Names.</p>"
