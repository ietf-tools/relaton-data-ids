abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Agent Communication Protocol (SACP) is an application protocol
    designed to facilitate communication of data and facts between software agents
    over the Internet. While designed with agents in mind, it is also suited to applications
    where the agent metaphor can be applied, such as autonomous processes, or to systems
    which might be accessed by agents, such as databases or directories. Applications
    which need to transmit or receive machine-readable data, or structured information
    that is stored hierarchically, are ideally suited to SACP.</p>"
