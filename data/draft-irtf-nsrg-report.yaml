abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last few years, the use of IP addresses for Internet connectivity
    has changed dramatically. The Name Space Research Group (NSRG) was chartered by
    the IRTF to review these changes, and make recommendations on whether or not remediation
    within the protocol stack is necessary. This document reports the outcome of some
    of the discussions within the research group. One of the questiones addressed
    by the NSRG is: Does the TCP/IP protocol suite need an additional level of naming
    above layer 3 but below the application layer? There was no consensus on the answer.
    This document reviews the motivation for an additional naming mechanism, reviews
    related work, proposes a straw man 'stack name' and discusses the structure and
    use of those names.</p>"
