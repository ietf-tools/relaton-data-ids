abstract:
- content: <p>RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades without defining
    them as managed entities. During this time, RADIUS implementations have named
    the data types and have used them in attribute definitions. This document updates
    the specifications to better follow established practice. We do this by naming
    the data types defined in RFC 6158, which have been used since at least the publication
    of RFC 2865. We provide an IANA registry for the data types and update the "RADIUS
    Attribute Types" registry to include a Data Type field for each attribute. Finally,
    we recommend that authors of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference
    to existing practice. This document updates RFCs 2865, 3162, 4072, 6158, 6572,
    and 7268.</p>
