abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login
    and other secure network services over an insecure network. This document describes
    a general purpose authentication method for the SSH protocol, suitable for interactive
    authentications where the authentication data should be entered via a keyboard
    (or equivalent alphanumeric input device). The major goal of this method is to
    allow the SSH client to support a whole class of authentication mechanism(s) without
    knowing the specifics of the actual authentication mechanism(s). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
