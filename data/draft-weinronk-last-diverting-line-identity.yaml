abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). In cases where applications/services (for example verification / billing)
    are provided by a network that is not the originating network the Network Asserted
    Identity is needed to provide these services. This extension provides the ability
    for a 'diversion service' to provide a Network Asserted Identity of the last diverting
    user to these applications/services. This extension defines a new general header,
    Last Diverting Line Identity which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the
    diverting party to these applications/services.</p>"
