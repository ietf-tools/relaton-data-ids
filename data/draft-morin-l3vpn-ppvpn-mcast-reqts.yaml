abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of functional requirements for network
    solutions that allow the support of IP multicast within IP provider provided virtual
    private networks (PP VPNs). It specifies requirements both from the end user and
    service provider standpoints. It is intended that potential solutions, that specify
    the support of IP multicast within VPNs, use these requirements as a guideline.
    It is not the intent of this document to propose technical solutions, nor to detail
    solution specific issues.</p>"
