abstract:
- content: "<p>A multiple interfaced mobile node (MN) may be connected to Proxy Mobile
    Internet Protocol version 6 (PMIPv6) domain via a stable access connection (e.g.
    cellular) and an unstable access connection (e.g. IEEE 802.11). To eliminate packet
    loss and handoff delay due to disconnection of the unstable access, a dormant
    binding method is proposed access such that a binding is maintained in dormant
    mode in the network until the mobile node is disconnected from the unstable access.
    Once activated, the binding allows the network to route data packets intended
    for the unstable access via the stable access connection.</p>"
