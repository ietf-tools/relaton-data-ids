abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability
    Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute traffic
    flow specifications. This allows the routing system to propagate information regarding
    more specific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination
    prefix (IPv4, IPv6), MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses, and NV03 encapsulation of
    IP addresses. The information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol
    algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes such as inter-provider
    peering agreements. This document provides the definition of a BGP NLRI which
    carries traffic flow specification filters, and Extended Community values which
    encode the actions a routing system can take if a packet matches the traffic flow
    filters. The specification requires that the BGP Flow Specification traffic filters
    follows a string ordering, and that the BGP Flow Specification Extended Communities
    actions are processed in a defined order. This BGP Flow Specification is denoted
    as BGP Flow Specification version 1. There are three applications of that encoding
    format: 1) automation of inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such
    as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service attacks;
    2) enable traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service, and 3) aid
    centralized control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context. Some of deployments of
    these three applications can be handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI
    traffic flow filters, and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community
    Flow Specification actions. Other deployments (especially SDN/NFV) need to be
    able to allow the user to order the flow specification. Another BGP Flow Specification
    (version 2) is being defined for user- ordered filters, and user-ordered actions
    encoded in Wide Communities.</p>"
