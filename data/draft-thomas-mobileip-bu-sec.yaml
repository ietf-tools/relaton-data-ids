abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a mechanism for mobile IPv6 nodes to use standard
    [IPSEC] mechanisms (both [AH] and [ESP]) to authenticate and authorize mobile
    IP route optmization messages which provide strong crypotographic authentication
    as well as protection from man in the middle attacks. This protection can be used
    both between home agents, and correspondent nodes.</p>"
