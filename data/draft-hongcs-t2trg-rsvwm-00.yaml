abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless network virtualization is one of the auspicious approach to
    address the increasing demand of mobile data services. It enables logically decoupling
    the traditional cellular network into infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile
    virtual network operators (MVNOs). It also offers a virtualized wireless network
    (VWN), efficient resource utilization, and isolation between network slices (i.e.,
    MVNOs). In this paper, we consider wireless network slicing for a single InP who
    owns radio resources and multiple MVNOs who need radio resources to provide specific
    services to their mobile users. One of the challenges in wireless network slicing
    is how to efficiently allocate the limited radio resources available at the InP
    to the MVNOs. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient allocation of
    the InP radio resources to the MVNOs which aims to maximize the total network
    capacity of the InP. To this end, we decompose our considered problem into two
    phases. The first phase is an efficient allocation of the InP radio resources
    (bandwidth) to the MVNOs, and the second phase is an optimal allocation of MVNOs
    resources gained from the InP to their mobile users. We then propose a Generalized
    Kelly Mechanism framework and the Karush-Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) conditions to solve
    the first and the second phase of our resource allocation problem, respectively.</p>"
