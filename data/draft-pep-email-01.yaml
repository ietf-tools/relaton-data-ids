abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols for email are based
    upon already existing email and encryption formats (as PGP/MIME) and designed
    to allow for easily implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption.
    The protocols range from key distribution, secret key synchronization between
    own devices, to mechanisms of metadata and content protection. The metadata and
    content protection is achieved by moving the whole message (not only the body
    part) into the PGP/MIME encrypted part. The proposed pEp Email Formats not only
    achieve simple forms of metadata protection (like subject encryption), but also
    allow for sending email messages through a mixnet. Such enhanced forms of metadata
    protection are explicitly discussed within the scope of this document. The purpose
    of pEp for email is to simplify and automate operations in order to make usage
    of email encryption a viability for a wider range of Internet users, with the
    goal of achieving widespread implementation of data confidentiality and privacy
    practices in the real world. The proposed operations and formats are targeted
    towards to Opportunistic Security scenarios and are already implemented in several
    applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
