abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) defined by RFC 3261. The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible
    framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating
    that certain events have occurred. Note that the event notification mechanisms
    defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all
    classes of event subscription and notification. This document represents a backwards-compatible
    improvement on the original mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account
    several years of implementation experience. Accordingly, this document obsoletes
    RFC 3265. This document also updates RFC 4660 slightly to accommodate some small
    changes to the mechanism that were discussed in that document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
