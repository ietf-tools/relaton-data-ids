abstract:
- content: "<p>The emerging requirements for differentiated service control in MPLS
    based traffic engineered networks [DSTE-REQ] can be met by existing specifications.
    Current implementations could be adapted with a relaxed perception of semantics
    on the syntax outlined in current specifications [OSPF-TE][ISIS-TE][RSVP-TE].
    This would provide for a solution that fulfills the scenarios and functionality
    requirements called for in DSTE-REQ.</p>"
