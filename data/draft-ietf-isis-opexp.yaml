abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of two reports on the Integrated ISIS protocol.
    The other report documents an analysis of the protocol. These two reports are
    required by the IAB/IESG in order for an Internet routing protocol to advance
    to Draft Standard Status. Integrated ISIS is an Interior Gateway Protocol and
    is designed to carry both IP and ISO CLNP routing information. Integrated ISIS
    is currently designated as a Proposed Standard. The protocol was first published
    in RFC 1195. Internet Draft [2] was published subsequently to RFC 1195 and documents
    the current version of the protocol. This report documents experience with Integrated
    ISIS. This includes reports on interoperability testing, field experience and
    the current state of Integrated ISIS implementations. It also presents a summary
    of the Integrated ISIS Management Information Base (MIB), and a summary of the
    Integrated ISIS authentication mechanism. Please send comments to isis@merit.edu.</p>"
