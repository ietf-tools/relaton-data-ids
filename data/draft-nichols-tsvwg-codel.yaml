abstract:
- content: '<p>The "persistently full buffer" problem has been discussed in the IETF
    community since the early 80''s [RFC896]. The IRTF''s End-to-End Working Group
    called for the deployment of active queue management (AQM) to solve the problem
    in 1998 [RFC2309]. Despite the awareness, the problem gotten worse as by Moore''s
    Law growth in memory density fueled an exponential increase in buffer pool size.
    Efforts to deploy AQM have been frustrated by difficult configuration and negative
    impact on network utilization. The full buffer problem, recently christened "bufferbloat"[TSVBB2011,
    BB2011] has become increasingly important throughout the Internet but particularly
    at the consumer edge. To address bufferbloat, this document describes a general
    framework for controlling excessived delay in networks called Controlled Delay
    (CoDel) designed to work in modern networking environments as a part of the solution
    to bufferbloat [CODEL2012]. CoDel consists of an estimator, a setpoint, and a
    control loop and can be deployed in the Internet without configuration. CoDel
    comprises some major technical innovations and has been made available as open
    source so that the framework can be applied by the community to a range of problems.
    It has been implemented in Linux (and available in the Linux distribution) and
    deployed in some networks at the consumer edge. In addition, the framework has
    been successfully applied in other ways. Note: Code Components extracted from
    this document must include the license as included with the code in Section 5.</p>'
