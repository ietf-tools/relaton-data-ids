abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is described in [RFC3748].
    EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to- Point Protocol
    (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP. IEEE802.1X-2004 clarifies some aspect
    of the EAP over Layer 2 PDUs. IEEE802.1X-2010 introduces MACsec Key Agreement
    Protocol (MKA) which uses EAPOL. In IEEE 802.1X-2010 the existing EAPOL (EAP over
    LANs) PDU formats have not been modified, but additional EAPOL PDUs have been
    added to support MKA. MKA is used for discovering peers and their mutual authentication,
    to agree the secrete keys (SAKs) used by MACsec for symmetric shared key cryptography.
    This document describes procedures to transport EAP and ultimately MKA PDUs over
    a IP network to distribute SAKs for symmetric key cryptography.</p>"
