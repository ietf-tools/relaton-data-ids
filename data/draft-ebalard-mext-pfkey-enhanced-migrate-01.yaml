abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6
    and IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can interwork. An extension of the
    PF_KEY framework is proposed which allows smooth and solid operation of IPsec/IKE
    in a Mobile IPv6 environment. This document is heavily based on a previous draft
    [MIGRATE] written by Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis Dupont. It
    simply reuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the expired document, removes a
    companion extension (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementation feedback (complexity,
    limitations, ...) and fills the gap by very simple changes to MIGRATE mechanism.
    This results in a more simple and consistent mechanism, which also proved to be
    easier to implement. This document is expected to serve as a continuation of [MIGRATE]
    work. For that reason, the name of the extension has been kept. PF_KEY MIGRATE
    message serves as a carrier for updated information for both the in-kernel IPsec
    structures (Security Policy Database / Security Association Database) and those
    maintained by the key managers. This includes in-kernel Security Policy / Security
    Association endpoints, key manager maintained equivalents, and addresses used
    by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated). The extension is helpful for assuring
    smooth interworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping of
    mobile nodes and their movements.</p>"
