abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we consider the content caching design without requiring
    historical content access information or content popularity profiles in a hierarchical
    cellular network architecture. Our design aims to dynamically select caching locations
    for different contents where caching locations can be content servers, cloud units
    (CUs), and base stations (BSs). Our design objective is to support as high content
    request rates as possible while maintaining the finite service time.</p>"
