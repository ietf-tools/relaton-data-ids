abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes different scenarios for the introduction of
    IPv6 in an IPv4 ISP network. The goal is the addition of a native IPv6 service
    to the already existing IPv4 service without interruption of the IPv4 service.
    During the IPv6 introduction the network can go through 4 different stages including
    the initial IPv4 only stage. To move between the stages there will be some form
    of transition that can be defined in different transition scenarios.</p>"
