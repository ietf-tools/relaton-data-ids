abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an optional mechanism within Intermediate System
    to Intermediate Systems (IS-ISs) used today by many ISPs for IGP routing within
    their clouds. This document describes how to run, within a single IS-IS domain,
    a set of independent IP topologies that we call Multi-Topologies (MTs). This MT
    extension can be used for a variety of purposes, such as an in-band management
    network "on top" of the original IGP topology, maintaining separate IGP routing
    domains for isolated multicast or IPv6 islands within the backbone, or forcing
    a subset of an address space to follow a different topology. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
