abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents are widely used as containers
    for the exchange and storage of arbitrary data in today's systems. Updates to
    this data requires transporting of the entire XML instance document between hosts,
    unless there's a mechanism that allows transmitting only the changes of XML documents.
    This memo describes a framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath) selectors
    with the aid of which a set of patches can be applied to an existing XML document.</p>"
