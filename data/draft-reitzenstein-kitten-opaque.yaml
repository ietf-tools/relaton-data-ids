abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication and
    Security Layer (SASL, RFC4422) authentication mechanisms based on the OPAQUE asymmetric
    password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE) algorithm. They offer two distinct
    advantages over the SCRAM family of mechanisms. The underlying OPAQUE algorithm
    provides the ability for clients to register without the servers getting access
    to the clear text password of an user, preventing password exfiltration at registration.
    Secondly a successful authentication produces a long- term secret key only known
    to the client that can be used to access encrypted server-side data without needing
    to share keys between clients via a side-band mechanism. When used in combination
    with TLS or an equivalent security layer these mechanisms allow for secure channel
    binding.</p>"
