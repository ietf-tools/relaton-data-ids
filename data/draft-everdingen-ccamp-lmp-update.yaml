abstract:
- content: "<p>Optical networks are being developed to include photonic switches,
    optical crossconnects, SONET/SDH crossconnects and routers. These networks consist
    of data links and a logically separated control network. Furthermore, multiple
    data links may be combined to form a single traffic engineering (TE) link for
    routing purposes. This draft proposes an update of the Link Management Protocol
    LMP. LMP runs between neighboring nodes (regarding data links) and is used to
    manage TE links. Specifically, LMP can be used to discover and verify the physical
    connectivity of the data links, correlate the data link property information,
    suppress downstream alarms, and localize link failures for protection/restoration
    purposes in GMPLS switched networks.</p>"
