abstract:
- content: "<p>The NTV format is an extension of the JSON format integrating a semantic
    dimension through the notion of type. This format remains compatible with the
    current JSON format but it is relevant to examine its compatibility and its impacts
    with data schemas. This document provides some answers to this question and presents
    some of the possible developments based mainly on the example of JSON Schema and
    additionally on the example of OpenAPI.</p>"
