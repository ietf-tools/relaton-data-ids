abstract:
- content: "<p>As a complement to the YANG Network Topology Data Model for Energy
    Efficiency Management, which is used for monitoring the dynamic energy consumption
    of network devices, this document defines YANG Network Inventory Data Model for
    Energy Efficiency Management that can be used for maintaining capability related
    energy efficiency attributes. The model provides both network view and device
    view of energy efficiency related inventory information.</p>"
