abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group
    is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communication
    using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers. For the support
    of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the
    concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP, where each data channel might
    be used to transport other protocols, called sub-protocols. This document specifies
    how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be instantiated as a WebRTC
    data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP offer/exchange to negotiate out-of-band
    the sub-protocol specific parameters. Two network configurations are documented:
    a WebRTC end- to-end configuration (connecting two MSRP over data channel endpoints),
    and a gateway configuration (connecting an MSRP over data channel endpoint with
    an MSRP over TCP endpoint).</p>"
