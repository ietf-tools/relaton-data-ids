abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines three X.509 v3 Certificate Extensions. The first
    binds a list of IP Address blocks to the public key of the subject of a certificate.
    The second binds a list of Autonomous System Numbers to the public key of the
    subject of a certificate. The third binds a BGP Router Identifier and an Autonomous
    System Number to the public key of the subject of a certificate. Third parties,
    e.g., BGP routers, may use these certificates to verify that the holder of the
    private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate has been properly
    authorized to use resources specified in the certificate extension.</p>"
