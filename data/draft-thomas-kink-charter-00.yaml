abstract:
- content: "<p>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards track protocol
    to facilitate centralized key exchange in an application independent fashion.
    Participating systems will use the Kerberos architecture as defined in RFC 1510
    for key management and the KINK protocol between applications. The goal of the
    working group is to produce a low latency, computationally efficient, easily managed,
    and cryptographically sound protocol that is flexible enough to be able to be
    extended for many applications. The focus of the initial working group will be
    keying IPsec security associations as defined in RFC 2401. The working group may
    consider means to key other protocols in the future, but the initial goal of the
    KINK working group is specifically targeted at producing a low latency and computationally
    efficient keying mechanism for IPsec. The working group will not be involved with,
    nor should it require changes to either IPsec (RFC 2401), or Kerberos (RFC 1510).</p>"
