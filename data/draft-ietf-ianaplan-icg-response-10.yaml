abstract:
- content: "<p>The U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration
    (NTIA) solicited a request from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
    Numbers (ICANN) to propose how the NTIA should end its oversight of the Internet
    Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. After broad consultations, ICANN
    in turn created the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group. That group
    solicited proposals for the three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and protocol
    parameters. This document contains the IETF response to that solicitation for
    protocol parameters. It was included in an aggregate response to the NTIA alongside
    those for names and numbering resources that are being developed by their respective
    operational communities. A reference to that response may be found in the introduction,
    and additional correspondence is included in the Appendix.</p>"
