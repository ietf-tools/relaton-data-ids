abstract:
- content: <p>The base BGP specifications prevent a BGP speaker from advertising any
    route that is not the best route for a BGP destination. This document specifies
    a modification of this rule. Routes are divided into two categories, "external"
    and "internal". A specification is provided for choosing a "best external route"
    (for a particular value of the Network Layer Reachability Information). A BGP
    speaker is then allowed to advertise its "best external route" to its internal
    BGP peers, even if that is not the best route for the destination. The document
    explains why advertising the best external route can improve convergence time
    without causing routing loops. Additional benefits include reduction of inter-domain
    churn and avoidance of permanent route oscillation. The document also generalizes
    the notions of "internal" and "external" so that they can be applied to Route
    Reflector Clusters and Autonomous System Confederations.</p>
