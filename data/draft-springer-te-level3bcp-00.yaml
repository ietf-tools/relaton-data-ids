abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses Traffic Engineering with Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching in the Level3 network. A brief overview of traffic engineering is given
    followed by constraints affecting Level3's design. The approach Level3 will use,
    which is LDP edge and an RSVP-TE core, is presented. Several architectures were
    considered when deciding upon a design. These methods are discussed as well as
    the reasons they were ultimately refuted.</p>"
