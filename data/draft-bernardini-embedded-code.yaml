abstract:
- content: <p>Some RFC need to include some code or some kind of data like test vectors.
    Extracting the code or the data from the RFC "by hand" is possible, but tiresome
    and prone to errors, especially if the portion to be extracted is long or comprises
    many files. This document describes a format that can be used to embed code or
    data in an RFC, so that it can be extract by a software, while preserving the
    readibility of the embedded text.</p>
