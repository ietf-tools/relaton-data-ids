abstract:
- content: "<p>The initial version of QUIC provides support for path migration. We
    propose a simple mechanism to support not just migration, but also simultaneous
    usage of multiple paths. In its simplest form, this mechanisms simply requires
    that multipath senders keep track of which packet is sent on what path, and use
    that information to manage congestion control and loss recovery. With that, clients
    can send data on any validated path, and server on any validated path on which
    the client recently sent non-probing packets. A more sophisticated mechanism can
    be negotiated to explicitly manage paths and packet scheduling.</p>"
