abstract:
- content: "<p>The Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol provides an efficient,
    flexible, and future-proof header compression concept. It is designed to operate
    efficiently and robustly over various link technologies with different characteristics.
    The ROHC framework, along with a set of compression profiles, was initially defined
    in RFC 3095. To improve and simplify the ROHC specifications, this document explicitly
    defines the ROHC framework and the profile for uncompressed separately. More specifically,
    the definition of the framework does not modify or update the definition of the
    framework specified by RFC 3095. This specification obsoletes RFC 4995. It fixes
    one interoperability issue that was erroneously introduced in RFC 4995, and adds
    some minor clarifications.</p>"
