abstract:
- content: "<p>In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
    for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information. Specifically,
    passport-based IOAM allows telemetry data generated by each node along the path
    to be pushed into data packets when they traverse the network, while postcard-based
    IOAM allows IOAM data generated by each node to be directly exported without being
    pushed into in-flight data packets. This document extends IOAM Direct Export (DEX)
    Option-Type to integrate the Alternate-Marking Method into IOAM.</p>"
