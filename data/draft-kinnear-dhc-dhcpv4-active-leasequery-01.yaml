abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request information
    about DHCPv4 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for individual bindings.
    In some situations individual binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.
    In addition, continuous update of an external client with Leasequery data is sometimes
    desired. This document expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery protocol, and allows for
    active transfer of real-time DHCPv4 address binding information data via TCP.</p>"
