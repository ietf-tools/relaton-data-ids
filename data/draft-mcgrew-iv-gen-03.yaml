abstract:
- content: "<p>Many cryptographic algorithms use deterministic IVs, including CTR,
    GCM, CCM, GMAC. This type of IV is also called a (deterministic) nonce. Deterministic
    IVs must be distinct, for each fixed key, to guarantee the security of the algorithm.
    This note describes best practices for the generation of such IVs, and summarizes
    how they are generated and used in different protocols. Some problem areas are
    highlighted, and test considerations are outlined. This note will be useful to
    implementers of algorithms using deterministic IVs, and to protocol or system
    designers using them.</p>"
