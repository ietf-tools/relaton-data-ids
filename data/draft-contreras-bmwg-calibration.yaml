abstract:
- content: "<p>Network devices are incorporating capabilities for time stamping certain
    packets so that such time stamps can reference the time at which a packet passes
    through a given device (at ingress or egress). Those stamps or marks are relevant
    to calculating the measured delay and can be used for traffic engineering purposes.
    This draft proposes a methodology for Calibrating the measurements from different
    network element implementations in a common measurement scenario.</p>"
