abstract:
- content: "<p>The framework of high throughput with small latent IP packet delivery
    architecture using ATM technology in large scaled heterogeneous internets keeping
    the current communication paradigm is studied. This memo discusses on how to carry
    TCP/IP over ATM, or in general, how to carry connectionless and/or connection
    oriented network layer protocol over connection oriented QoS-ed datalink layer.
    Low latency property of ATM is fully extracted both for connectionless and connection
    oriented communication over TCP/IP without changing the current architecture of
    TCP/IP network. Regarding connection oriented IP packet forwarding, source host,
    having the mapping functionality between flow-ID (e.g. in the SIPP16 header) and
    VCI/VPI value, forwards connection oriented IP packets cell-by-cell. Connectionless
    IP packets can be also transferred cell-by-cell through the dedicated (concatenated)
    ATM-VCCs which bypass IP processing at the intermediate routers, when the cache
    for re-directed ATM-VCCs is hit. Otherwise, they will be forwarded to the adjacent
    router (hop-by-hop IP forwarding). Also, the active connectionless IP packet flow
    can use a dedicated ATM-VCC as a IP forwarding cache.</p>"
