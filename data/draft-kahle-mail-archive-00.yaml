abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a mail header field 'Restrict:' with a defined
    value of 'no-external-archive' that gives information to a receiving mail transport
    agent or mail user agent that this message should not be archived by individuals
    or organizations not associated with the list owner. With the increasing number
    of search engines that gather information and offer wide access, some writers
    and would like to restrict how their words are distributed. Mailing lists may
    begin (or have already begun) to be systematically archived for searching and
    historical reference. This draft is designed for mailing lists, but it can also
    be applied to messages in Usenet newsgroups as well. The legal issues around this
    are deep and difficult, and this draft does not address these legal issues. However,
    it would be useful to respectful mail receivers if there was a standard method
    for mail creators (authors or list owners) to express their desires about whether
    or not their mail can be archived.</p>"
