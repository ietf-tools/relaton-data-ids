abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for
    the Diameter Network address and port translation Control Application. This Diameter
    application allows per-endpoint control of Network Address Translators and Network
    Address and Port Translators, which are added to networks to cope with IPv4 address
    space depletion. This Diameter application allows external devices to configure
    and manage a Network Address Translator device -- expanding the existing Diameter-based
    Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) and policy control capabilities
    with a Network Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator control
    component. These external devices can be network elements in the data plane such
    as a Network Access Server, or can be more centralized control plane devices such
    as AAA-servers. This Diameter application establishes a context to commonly identify
    and manage endpoints on a gateway or server and a Network Address Translator and
    Network Address and Port Translator device. This includes, for example, the control
    of the total number of Network Address Translator bindings allowed or the allocation
    of a specific Network Address Translator binding for a particular endpoint. In
    addition, it allows Network Address Translator devices to provide information
    relevant to accounting purposes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
