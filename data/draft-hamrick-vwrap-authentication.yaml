- content: "<p>Authentication in the Virtual World Region Agent Protocol establishes
    an application layer association between a client application and a remote service
    responsible for managing the end user's identity. The objective of authentication
    is to verify the user of a client application possesses appropriate credentials
    before granting capabilities sufficient to assert control over the user's agent
    and digital assets.</p>"
