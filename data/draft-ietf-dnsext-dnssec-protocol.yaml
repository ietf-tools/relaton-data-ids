abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is part of a family of documents that describe the DNS
    Security Extensions (DNSSEC). The DNS Security Extensions are a collection of
    new resource records and protocol modifications that add data origin authentication
    and data integrity to the DNS. This document describes the DNSSEC protocol modifications.
    This document defines the concept of a signed zone, along with the requirements
    for serving and resolving by using DNSSEC. These techniques allow a security-aware
    resolver to authenticate both DNS resource records and authoritative DNS error
    indications. This document obsoletes RFC 2535 and incorporates changes from all
    updates to RFC 2535. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
