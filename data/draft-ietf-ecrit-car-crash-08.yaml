abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls placed by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash
    or incident. Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic Crash Notification"
    (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the case of
    manual trigger. The "Advanced" qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer
    set of data. This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency
    Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred
    to as "crash data" even though there is not necessarily a crash). An external
    specification for the data format, contents, and structure are referenced in this
    document. This document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation pan- European
    eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by in-vehicle systems
    within Europe and other regions). However, this document specifies a different
    set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS)
    rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD). This document is an extension
    of the eCall document, with the primary differences being that this document makes
    the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and extends the eCall metadata/control
    object to permit greater functionality. This document also describes legacy (circuit-
    switched) ACN systems and their migration to next-generation emergency calling,
    to provide background information and context.</p>
