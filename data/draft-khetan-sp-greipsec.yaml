- content: "<p>When IPSec tunneling is used for VPN connections, transporting routing
    protocols across the encrypted tunnels becomes challenging. This document outlines
    the use of GRE encapsulation in conjunction with IPSec transport mode to support
    transport of dynamic routing protocols across an IPSec encrypted tunnel. Some
    usage scenarios are also addressed in this document.</p>"
