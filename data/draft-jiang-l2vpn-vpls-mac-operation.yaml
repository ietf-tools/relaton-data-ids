abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) using Label Distribution Protocol
    (LDP) signaling is described in RFC 4762. That document describes a mechanism
    called MAC Address Withdrawal to remove or unlearn MAC addresses which have been
    dynamically learned in a VPLS instance. Further work in progress defines an extension
    to MAC Address Withdrawal procedure which can greatly restrict the scope of MAC
    flushing. This document provides a flushing-free mechanism which removes the need
    for MAC address flushing in a VPLS instance. This mechanism is called MAC Address
    Switching.</p>"
