abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of requirements for active Operation, Administration and Maintenance
    (OAM) of Service Function Chains (SFCs) in networks is presented. Based on these
    requirements an encapsulation of active OAM message in SFC and a mechanism to
    detect and localize defects described. Also, this document updates RFC 8300 in
    the definition of O (OAM) bit in the Network Service Header (NSH) and defines
    how the active OAM message identified in SFC NSH.</p>"
