abstract:
- content: "<p>Detecting and isolating network faults in IP networks has traditionally
    been done using tools like ping and traceroute (see [RFC7276]) or more complex
    systems built on similar concepts of active probing and path tracing. While using
    active synthetic probes is proven to be helpful in detecting data-plane faults,
    isolating fault location is a much harder problem, especially in diverse networks
    with multiple active forwarding planes (e.g. IP and MPLS). Moreover, existing
    end-to-end tools do not generally support functionality beyond dealing with packet
    loss - for example, they are hardly useful for detecting and reporting transient
    (i.e. milli- or even micro-second) network congestion. Modern network forwarding
    hardware can allow for more sophisticated data-plane functionality that provides
    substantial improvement to the isolation and identification capabilities of network
    elements. For example, it has become possible to encode a snapshot of a network
    element's state within the packet payload as it transits the device. One example
    of such state would be queue depth on the egress port taken by that specific packet.
    When combined with a unique device identifier embedded in the same packet, this
    could allow for precise time and topological identification of the the congested
    location within the network. This document proposes a format for requesting and
    embedding telemetry information in active probes, i.e. packet designated for actively
    testing the network while not carrying application traffic. These active probes
    could be conveyed over multiple protocols (ICMP, UDP, TCP, etc.) and the document
    does not prescribe any particular transport. In addition, this document provides
    recommendations on handling the active probes by devices that do not support the
    required data-plane functionality.</p>"
