abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize
    the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. An End-of-RIB marker is
    specified and can be used to convey routing convergence information. A new BGP
    capability, termed "Graceful Restart Capability", is defined that would allow
    a BGP speaker to express its ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart.
    Finally, procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information
    across a TCP session termination/re-establishment. The mechanisms described in
    this document are applicable to all routers, both those with the ability to preserve
    forwarding state during BGP restart and those without (although the latter need
    to implement only a subset of the mechanisms described in this document). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
