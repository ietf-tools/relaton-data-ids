abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes operations of data plane and controller plane
    for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) to forward packets to meet minimum and maximum
    end-to-end latency requirements, while utilizing Push-In First-Out (PIFO) queue.
    According to the solution described in this document, forwarding nodes do not
    need to maintain flow states or to be time-synchronized with each other.</p>"
