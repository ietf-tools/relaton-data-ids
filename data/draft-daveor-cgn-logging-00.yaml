abstract:
- content: <p>The use of large-scale IP address sharing technologies (commonly known
    as "carrier-grade NAT") presents a challenge for law enforcement agencies due
    to the fact that incoming source port information is not routinely logged by Internet-facing
    servers. The absence of this information means that it is becoming increasingly
    difficult for law enforcement agencies to identify suspects in criminal activity
    online. This document considers the reasons why source port information is not
    routinely logged by Internet-facing servers and proposes some immediate-term actions
    that can be taken to help improve the situation. A deployment maturity model has
    been developed and a study of the support for logging incoming source port information
    in common server software is also presented.</p>
