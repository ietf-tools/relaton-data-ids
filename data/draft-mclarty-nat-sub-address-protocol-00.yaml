abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the NAT Sub-Address Protocol (NATSAP), a Layer
    5 encapsulation protocol designed to facilitate seamless bidirectional communication
    with devices behind Carrier-Grade NAT (CG NAT). NATSAP introduces dynamic sub-addresses
    assigned by the NAT router, which external clients can use alongside the public
    IP to route traffic back to internal devices without requiring traditional port
    forwarding. This document also defines the Dynamic Sub-Address Assignment Protocol
    (DSAAP), to facilitate the acquiring of a NATSAP Sub-Address. The protocol offers
    backward compatibility with existing IPv4 infrastructure, efficient DNS-based
    service discovery, and simple, stateless mapping. By encapsulating application-layer
    traffic, NATSAP enables direct communication with devices behind NATs using a
    standardized socket notation and DNS records.</p>"
