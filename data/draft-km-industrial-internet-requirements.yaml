abstract:
- content: "<p>Industry Control Networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols
    for different purposes. Even though they operate in a controlled environment,
    one end of industrial control applications run over internet technologies (IT)
    and another over operational technology (OT) protocols. This memo discusses the
    challenges and requirements relating to converegence of OT and IT networks. One
    particular problem in convergence is figuring out reachability between the these
    networks.</p>"
