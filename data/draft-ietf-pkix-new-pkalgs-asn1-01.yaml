- content: "<p>As all members of the PKIX Working Group know, draft-ietf-pkix-ipki-
    pkalgs-05.txt is with the RFC Editor. However, an error in the ASN.1 modules was
    discovered. The authors are working with the RFC Editor to ensure that the corrected
    ASN.1 modules are included in the final text, and we are publishing this Internet-Draft
    to distribute the corrected ASN.1 module as quickly as possible. This Internet-Draft
    contains only the updated ASN.1 module.</p>"
