abstract:
- content: <p>Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) defined
    in [RFC 5440] states that "All PCEP messages MUST be sent using the registered
    TCP port for the source and destination TCP port." This has however lead to a
    lot of restrictions for the implementation. With these considerations in mind
    this document updates the TCP behavior.</p>
