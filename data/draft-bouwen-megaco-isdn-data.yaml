abstract:
- content: "<p>In ISDN interfaces the D-channel is used to transport the Q.931 signalling
    messages. In addition, the D-channel can transport packet data for user-to-user
    communication. The Megaco protocol specification has to be extended to support
    data in an ISDN D- channel. More specifically, ephemeral terminations on top of
    physical ISDN terminations have to be allowed, and support for the ISDN addressing
    scheme has to be added to refer to the data streams in the D-channel. This draft
    defines the required additional functionality, that could be part of the second
    version of the Megaco protocol.</p>"
