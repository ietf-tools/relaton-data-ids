abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a generic connection admission control (GCAC)
    reference model and algorithm for IP-/MPLS-based networks. Service provider (SP)
    IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to
    reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect
    calls already in progress. Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will
    suffer degraded quality. The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented
    in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers. MPLS GCAC interoperates
    between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains. The MPLS
    GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such
    as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element
    (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF. The MPLS GCAC algorithm
    does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations,
    such as detailed path selection mechanisms. MPLS GCAC functions are implemented
    in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for
    specified QoS constraints. The objective is that the source is able to compute
    a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path
    will in fact admit the request. In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems
    (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods
    that partially meet this objective. MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or
    flow that must meet an objective QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified
    quantity of traffic. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
