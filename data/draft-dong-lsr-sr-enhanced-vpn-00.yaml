abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation and have more stringent
    performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.
    An enhanced VPN may form the underpin of 5G transport network slicing, and will
    also be of use in its own right. This document describes how Multi- Topology Routing
    (MTR) as described in RFC 5120 and RFC 4915, can be extended to signal the resources
    allocated in the underlay network to construct the virtual networks for enhanced
    VPN services, together with the Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs) used to identify
    and access the network resources allocated for the virtual networks in the data
    plane.</p>"
