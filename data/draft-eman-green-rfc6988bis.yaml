abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for
    Energy Management, taking RFC6988 as a starting point. Eleven years after the
    RFC 6988 publication, this document re-evaluates the requirements. The requirements
    defined in this document are concerned with discovery f unctions, monitoring functions
    as well as control functions. Discovery functions include identifying energy-
    managed network, devices and their components, discovery of inventory of power
    components capabilities, optimization control capabilities, nominal condition
    use. M onitoring functions include monitoring their Power States, Power Attributes,
    energy consumption, network performance, energy efficiency metrics. Control functions
    include such functions as controlling energy saving and optimization functions
    and Power State of energy-managed devices and their components. This document
    does not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant implementations
    but rather lists features that must be supported by standards for Energy efficiency
    Management. Discussion Venues Source of this draft and an issue tracker can be
