abstract:
- content: "<p>With operating systems appearing in more and more devices, as well
    as computers appearing in more and more aspects of everyday life, communication
    between networked devices is increasingly important. The communication mechanism
    between these devices must be able to not only support the office LAN environment,
    but must also scale to larger WANS and the internet. This draft describes a method
    by which a host may automatically give itself a link-local IPv4 address, so that
    it will be able to use IP applications in the absence of an IP address management
    mechanism, such as DHCP. This mechanism is in use today by a few operating systems,
    and additional information on those implementations is also provided.</p>"
