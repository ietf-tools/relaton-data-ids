abstract:
- content: "<p>Backbone Routers running IPv6 Neighbor Discovery can manage multiple
    wireless links to form a large MultiLink Subnet, but it is more efficient if IPv6
    Neighbor Discovery packets are not broadcast over the wireless links. This specification
    specifies proxy operations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery on behalf of devices located
    on broadcast-inefficient wireless networks. Backbone Routers placed along the
    wireless edge of the backbone handle IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, and route packets
    on behalf of registered nodes. Wireless nodes register, or are registered by proxy,
    to a Backbone Router to establish proxy services in a fashion similar to layer-2
    association.</p>"
