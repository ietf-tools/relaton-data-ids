abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP is an authentication protocol which supports multiple authentication
    mechanisms. EAP typically runs directly over the link layer without requiring
    IP and therefore includes its own support for in-order delivery and re-transmission.
    While EAP was originally developed for use with PPP, it is also now in use with
    IEEE 802. This document defines the One Time Password (OTP) and Generic Token
    Card EAP methods, both of which provide one-way authentication, but not key generation.
    As a result, the OTP and Generic Token Card methods, when used by themselves,
    are only appropriate for use on networks where physical security can be assumed.
    These methods SHOULD NOT be used on wireless networks, or over the Internet, unless
    the EAP conversation is protected. This can be accomplished using technologies
    such as IPsec or TLS.</p>"
