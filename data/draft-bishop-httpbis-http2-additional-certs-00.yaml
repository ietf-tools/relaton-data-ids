abstract:
- content: "<p>Many HTTP servers host content from several origins. HTTP/2 [RFC7540]
    permits clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a server provided that
    certain conditions are satisfied. One of these conditions is the inclusion of
    the secondary origin in the certificate provided during the TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]
    handshake. In many cases, origins will wish to maintain separate certificates
    for different origins but still desire the benefits of a shared HTTP connection.
    This draft describes how frames which were defined to transfer client certificates
    might be used to provide additional server certificates as well.</p>"
