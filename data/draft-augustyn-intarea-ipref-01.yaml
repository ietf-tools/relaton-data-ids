abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IP addressing with references (referred to
    as IPREF) and how it can be used with IPv4 and IPv6. It uses special addresses
    called IPREF addresses which use references to IP addresses instead of actual
    addresses. IPREF provides highly scalable means of traversing private address
    spaces end-to-end. It can traverse private address spaces both within the same
    protocol domain and across protocol domains. For example, it allows NAT traversal
    for IPv4, or for IPv6 with NAT6 or filters. It also allows direct communication
    between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including over NAT, NAT6, or filters. IPREF addresses
    are publishable via Domain Name System (DNS). Any host on any private network
    may publish its services via DNS. These services are reachable from any network,
    whether IPv4 or IPv6, provided IPREF is supported on both ends.</p>"
