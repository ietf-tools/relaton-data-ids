abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized
    mobility management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management
    and de-registration into account in a first protocol release. This document proposes
    an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 to suit MNs, which have multiple network interfaces
    implemented and hand over from one network interface to another network interface
    while remaining anchored at the same Local Mobility Anchor. This extension avoids
    that the LMA will prematurely forward data packets for the mobile node to the
    mobile node's new interface before the address configuration of this interface
    has completed. With the proposed extension, packet buffering at the new MAG is
    not necessary and packet losses during an inter-technology handover can be avoided.</p>"
