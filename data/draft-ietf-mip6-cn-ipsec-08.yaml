- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 uses IPsec to protect signaling between the Mobile Node
    and the Home Agent. This document defines how IPsec can be used between the Mobile
    Node and Correspondent Nodes for Home Address Option validation and protection
    of mobility signaling for Route Optimization. The configuration details for IPsec
    and IKE are also provided.</p>"
