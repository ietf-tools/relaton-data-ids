abstract:
- content: "<p>In many M2M applications, direct discovery of resources is not practical
    due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where multicast traffic
    is inefficient. These problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource
    Directory (RD), which hosts descriptions of resources held on other servers, allowing
    lookups to be performed for those resources. This document specifies the web interfaces
    that a Resource Directory supports in order for web servers to discover the RD
    and to register, maintain, lookup and remove resources descriptions. Furthermore,
    new link attributes useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.</p>"
