abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines an application profile of the Authentication
    and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework, to enable secure
    group communication in the Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) architecture for the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) [draft- ietf-core-coap-pubsub], where Publishers and
    Subscribers communicate through a Broker. This profile relies on protocol-specific
    transport profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, server authentication,
    and proof-of-possession for a key owned by the Client and bound to an OAuth 2.0
    access token. This document specifies the provisioning and enforcement of authorization
    information for Clients to act as Publishers and/or Subscribers, as well as the
    provisioning of keying material and security parameters that Clients use for protecting
    their communications end-to-end through the Broker. Note to RFC Editor: Please
    replace "[draft-ietf-core-coap-pubsub]" with the RFC number of that document and
    delete this paragraph.</p>'
