abstract:
- content: "<p>A messaging infrastructure providing full end-to end security is presented.
    Unlike existing approaches such as S/MIME and OpenPGP, Mesh/Recrypt uses proxy
    re-encryption to preserve full end-to-end security with individual user and device
    keys in situations such as the user having multiple decryption devices and messages
    being set to mailing lists. This document shows the use of Mesh/Recrypt to address
    the principle use cases Mesh/Recrypt is designed to address. These include asynchronous
    messaging such as mail and controlled documents and synchronous messaging applications
    such as chat, voice and video.</p>"
