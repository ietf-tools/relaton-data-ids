abstract:
- content: '<p>This document redefines the use of the IPv6 Flow Label field to allow
    specification of the lowest MTU on a path that the packet travels, thus in most
    cases avoiding the need for performing Path MTU Discovery and the round-trip penalty
    that that occurs for processing the ICMPv6 PTB and retransmitting the packets
    involved. This specification allows graceful decrease of MTU so that large and
    non-standard MTU sizes can safely be used on the Internet. [[A1: Obsoleting the
    IPv6 Flow Label and replacing it completely with this field might be a better
    option than keeping it defined as an IPv6 Flow Label field and allowing existing
    flows to exist. --JM]] [[A2: A better name than "IPv6 MTU Label" is requested
    as it is not really a "Label". --JM]]</p>'
