abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7854] and [RFC8671] define Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-In, Post-Policy Adj-RIB-In,
    Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-Out and Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out Route- Monitoring messages.
    A route unmodified by the inbound policy is included both in Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-In
    as well as Post-Policy Adj- RIB-In Route-Monitoring messages when both the Pre-Policy
    and Post- Policy Route-Monitoring modes are enabled. Similarly, a route unmodified
    by the outbound policy is included in Pre-Policy Adj-RIB- Out as well as Post-Policy
    Adj-RIB-Out Route-Monitoring messages. To avoid duplicate inclusion of routes
    unmodified by policy either in Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out this document defines
    two methods.</p>"
