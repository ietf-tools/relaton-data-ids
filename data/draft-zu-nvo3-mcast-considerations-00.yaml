abstract:
- content: "<p>The framework of supporting applications specific multicast traffic
    in a network using Network Virtualization using Overlays over Layer 3 (NVO3) has
    been discussed. The various mechanisms and considerations that can be used for
    delivering those application specific multicast traffic in networks that use NVO3
    have been considered. This draft discusses some additional considerations on how
    to support applications specific multicast traffic in NVO3.</p>"
