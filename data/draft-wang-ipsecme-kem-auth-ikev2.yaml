abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a new authentication mechanism, called KEM based
    authentication, for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296].
    This is motivated by the fact that ML-KEM is much more efficient that ML-DSA,
    which are the post-quantum algoirhtms for mitigating the pontential security threats
    again quantum computers. The KEM based authenticationth for the IKV2 is achieved
    via introduing a new value of the IKEv2 Authentication Method registry mantained
    by IANA. For using the new authentication method, two peers MUST send the SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS
    Notify, defined by [RFC9593]，to negotiate the supported KEM algorithms. After
    that, the correponding KEM certificates and cipthertext are exchanged via the
    INTERMEDIATE Exchange. Finally，the IKE messages are authenticated via the shared
    secret encapsulated between the two peers. This documents also specifies the instantiation
    with ML-KEM for this new general authenticaiton method for the IKEv2. [EDNOTE:
    Code points for KEM-based authentication may need to be assigned in the IKEv2
    Authenticaion Method registry, maintained by IANA]</p>"
