abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Cloud computing era, lots of protocols are proposed to meet
    the various requirements requested by the quickly emerging Cloud applications.
    However, protocols used to be independently developed by closed communities. Each
    protocol proposes its own specifications and encoding method. Some common functions
    are repeatedly developed by different protocols. The way that the protocols used
    to be developed significantly prolongs the process that protocols are brought
    to the real market. In order to address these problems, this document proposes
    GEARS (Generic and Extensible Architecture for pRotocolS) which provides an open
    platform to facilitate protocol innovations. A new protocol would be developed
    as an application running on this platform while those common functions provided
    by this platform can be reused. Customized features of this application can be
    easily built as add- ons with the friendly and extensible data modeling language.</p>"
