abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIMPLE work group has defined a SIP events package for distribution
    of presence information. It has also proposed a MESSAGE extension for the transport
    of instant messages. This document describes how those mechanisms map to the abstract
    CPIM service, in order to interoperate with other CPIM compliant presence and
    instant messaging services.</p>"
