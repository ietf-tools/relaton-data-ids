abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec is a mature technology with several interoperable implementations.
    Indeed, the use of IPsec tunnels is increasingly gaining popularity in several
    deployment scenarios, not the least in what used to be solely areas of traditional
    telecommunication protocols. Wider deployment calls for mechanisms and methods
    that enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and two-way
    network performance. Unfortunately, however, standard IP performance measurement
    security mechanisms cannot be readily used with IPsec. This document makes the
    case for employing IPsec to protect O/TWAMP and proposes a method which combines
    IKEv2 and O/TWAMP as defined in RFC 4656 and RFC 5357, respectively. This specification
    aims, on the one hand, to ensure that O/TWAMP can be secured, while on the other
    hand, it extends the applicability of O/TWAMP to networks that have already deployed
    IPsec.</p>"
