abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol provides mechanisms to describe attributes
    of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session, but does not provide any
    mechanism to describe individual media sources within a media stream. This document
    defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, identified by their Synchronization
    Source Identifiers (SSRCs), in SDP, associate attributes with these sources, and
    express relationships among sources. It also defines several source-level attributes
    which can be used to describe properties of media sources.</p>"
