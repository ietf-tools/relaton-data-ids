abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing aims to provide assurance of specific network performance
    objectives for network services which require both connectivity and specific performance
    commitment. Such network services are considered as network slice services. This
    document provides a benchmarking methodology for network slicing, focusing on
    evaluating the key functionalities of network slicing mechanisms and the performance
    of network slice services. The network slicing functionalities includes the data
    plane, control plane and management plane mechanisms for realizing network slice
    service, and the performance of network slice service includes the service level
    agreement (SLA) commitments (bandwidth, delay, and jitter), path constraints and
    resource guarantee. The tests aim to demonstrate how network slicing can support
    competing services in a shared network, ensuring that critical network services
    in one network slice remain unaffected by congestion or unexpected behavior of
    other traffic in the same network.</p>"
