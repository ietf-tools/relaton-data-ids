abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL active-active service provides end stations with flow level load
    balance and resilience against link failures at the edge of TRILL campuses. This
    draft specifies a method in which member RBridges in an active- active edge RBridge
    group use their own nicknames as ingress RBridge nicknames to encapsulate frames
    from attached end systems. Thus, remote edge RBridges are required to keep multiple
    locations of one MAC address in one Data Label. Design goals of this specification
    are discussed in the document.</p>"
