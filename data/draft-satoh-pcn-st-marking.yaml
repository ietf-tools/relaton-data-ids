abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives early warning of congestion
    by metering and marking packets in order to protect the quality of service of
    inelastic flows. PCN traffic load is divide into three pre-congestion states by
    two rates that [I-D.ietf.pcn.architecture] defines per link: PCN-admissible- and
    PCN-supportable-rates. PCN admission control and flow termination mechanisms operate
    in accordance with these three states. [I-D.ietf.pcn.baseline.encoding] defines
    two PCN encoding states. This document proposes an algorithm for marking and metering
    by using PCN baseline encoding for both flow admission and flow termination. The
    ratio of marked packets determines the three link states: no packets marked, some
    packets marked, and all packets marked. To achieve this marking behaviour, we
    use two token buckets. One is not used for marking but for a marking switch; the
    other is used for marking. The token bucket for marking has two thresholds. One
    is TBthreshold.threshold, already defined in [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour],
    and the other is a new threshold, which is set to be the number of bits of a metered-packet
    smaller than the token bucket size. Therefore, the new threshold is larger than
    TBthreshold.threshold. If the amount of tokens is less than TBthreshold.threshold,
    all the packets are marked as defined in [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour]. If
    the amount of tokens is less than the new threshold and greater than TBthreshold.threshold,
    one- Nth packets are marked. We evaluated the performance of admission control
    and flow termination using a simulation. For admission control, the results show
    that the performance of the algorithm was almost the same as, but slightly inferior
    to, that of CL [draft-briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb-03]. For flow termination, the performance
    of the algorithm was almost the same as CL when the load was 1.2 times the supportable
    rate, but it was superior to CL when the load was high (two times the supportable
    rate). Furthermore, in the algorithm, over termination percentages of all the
    bottleneck links are almost the same in the case of multi-bottleneck. In CL, the
    over termination percentages of all the bottleneck links are different and those
    at upstream bottleneck links are higher than those at downstream bottleneck links
    because of accumulation of marked packets.</p>"
