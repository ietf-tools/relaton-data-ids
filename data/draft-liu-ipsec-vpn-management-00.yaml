abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a common interface format for describing the
    configuration of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the context of IPSec and equipment
    from different vendors. The configuration format would be both importable and
    exportable by various vendors of VPN equipment and software that is IPSec compliant,
    facilitating an uniform and perhaps automated method of interoperability (creating
    a VPN) between VPN products from different vendors. This document will only discuss
    the proposed configuration format. The mechanism by which the file is propagated
    is beyond the scope of this document and will not be discussed. A security association
    is not mandatory between two management stations from different vendors wishing
    to employ this method of VPN configuration, as this configuration format can easily
    be packaged in a file and propagated out of band.</p>"
