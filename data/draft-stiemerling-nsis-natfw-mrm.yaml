abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes the use cases and solution for a new NTLP message
    routing method (MRM) that is used by the NATFW NSLP protocol to locate Network
    Address Translators (NAT) on the upstream data path. This message routing method
    is used by NSIS NATFW nodes behind a NAT to allocate a public reachable IP address
    and/or port number. The current way to do so has been named as "signaling the
    wrong way" and should be replaced by the proposed message routing method. The
    scope of this memo is limited to the usage of locating upstream Network Address
    Translator.</p>
