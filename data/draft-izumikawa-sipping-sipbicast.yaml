abstract:
- content: "<p>A vertical session handoff occurs in heterogeneous networks when a
    session media is moved between access networks within the same device. During
    session handoff, bi-casting media streams to both access networks of the session's
    device may be desirable to insure a seamless session handoff. This document describes
    the general methods and specifies the signaling and media flows for providing
    this service using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1].</p>"
