abstract:
- content: '<p>A number of MANET routing protocols employ the ability to temporarily
    buffer undeliverable IP datagrams until a route to a destination becomes available.
    This is indeed the case for reactive protocols, which largely are based on the
    ability to store an undeliverable IP datagram while a route discovery operation
    is carried out. Current specifications of proactive routing-protocols do, however,
    also indiate that they may benefit from such a mechanism: while a local link breakage
    may imply that a selected route to a given destination breaks, buffering an undeliverable
    IP datagram may allow a local topology discovery mechanism to select an alternative
    route. This document describes a generic mechanism for buffering IP datagrams
    in MANETs. The mechanism is based on the idea that while a local link may make
    a route to a destination fail, it does not imply that an alternative route to
    that destination is not available. Hence, IP datagrams for transmission along
    that route are buffered to allow the routing protocol time to construct an alternative
    route. The IP datagram is discarded only if the routing protocol hasnâ"À"Ùt been
    able to provide an alternative route within a determined small delay. We note,
    that this specification does not mandate a required behavior for MANET routing
    protocols. Rather, since the mechanisms currently employed in the four existing
    MANET routing protocol specification are similar in what they try to accomplish,
    it is the goal of this specification to generalize and expand on these mechanisms,
    thereby provide a framework for (i) discussing and refining the mechanism in isolation
    and (ii) providing a common element, which may be usefull for multiple MANET routing
    protocols.</p>'
