abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives the outline of one possible way to structure the
    work that is presently carried out by the IESG. It is provided to the community
    in order to solicit commentary and inspire more ideas. The IESG has discussed
    this proposal, and much of the material is the result of those discussions, but
    the IESG has not reached consensus on this or any other proposal at the time of
    publication. Comments are welcome, and can be directed to the editor, the IESG,
    or to the solutions mailing list &lt;solutions@alvestrand.no&gt;</p>"
