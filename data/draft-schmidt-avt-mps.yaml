abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes extensions for the RTP payload format defined in
    RFC3640 for the transport of MPEG Surround multi-channel audio. Additional MIME
    Type parameters are defined to signal backwards compatible transmission inside
    an MPEG-4 audio elementary stream. In addition a layered transmission scheme without
    using the MPEG-4 systems framework is presented to transport an MPEG Surround
    elementary stream via RTP in parallel with an RTP stream containing the downmixed
    audio data.</p>"
