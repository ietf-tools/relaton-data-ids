abstract:
- content: "<p>Handover Information Services may be used to assist handovers between
    one network to another network or within a network, based on stored network knowledge.
    Information Services can be used to provide essential network related information
    e.g. topology and channel information which may allow a moving host to select
    an appropriate link-layer connection to make, amongst available networks, whether
    using the same technology or heterogeneous technologies. This document is an effort
    to describe use cases and transport requirements for handover information services,
    when they are transported over IP networks.</p>"
