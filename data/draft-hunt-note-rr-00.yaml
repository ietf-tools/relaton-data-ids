abstract:
- content: <p>While the DNS zone master file format has always allowed comments, there
    is no existing mechanism to preserve comments once the zone has been loaded into
    memory or converted to a binary representation. This note proposes a new "NOTE"
    RR type, which is stored alongside zone data and may be included in zone transfers,
    but is not returned in response to DNS queries.</p>
