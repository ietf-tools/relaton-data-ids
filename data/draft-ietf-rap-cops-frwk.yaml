    Points (AE_PEP), the Core Policy Enforcement Points (C_PEP). With Message Processing
    Subsystem, Security Subsystem, Framework Data Model Subsystem, and Application
    Specific Data Model Subsystem in each PDP and PEP. This document further provides
    a high level description of each unit and describes the relationship among each
    unit. This document also describes how the subsystems within each unit interact
