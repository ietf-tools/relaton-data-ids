abstract:
- content: "<p>With the foreseen scarcity of public IPv4 addresses and the hesitation
    and technical difficulties to deploy IPv6, the transition scenarios which assumed
    that migration to IPv6 happens before the run-out of IPv4 addresses, need to be
    revisited. This document defines a method to allocate the same IPv4 address to
    multiple hosts, thus prolonging the availability of public IPv4 addresses for
    as long as it takes for IPv6 to take over the demand for IPv4. The document also
    describes the deployment scenarios where this method is applicable.</p>"
