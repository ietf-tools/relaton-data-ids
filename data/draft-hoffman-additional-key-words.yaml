abstract:
- content: <p>Some document authors want to express requirement levels using the traditional
    definitions of "MUST" and "SHOULD" from RFC 2119, but also want to express that
    there is an expectation that later versions of the document may change those requirements.
    For example, they may want to express "this SHOULD be implemented now, but we
    expect that this will become a MUST requirement in a future update to this standard".
    This document defines three new keywords, "MUST-", "SHOULD+", and "SHOULD-" to
    facilitate such definitions.</p>
