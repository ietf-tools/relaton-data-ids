abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an idea for a header "option" for the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP). The extension is used by dual-stack nodes to force the
    use of the IPv6 protocol instead of the IPv4 protocol when exchanging data over
    TCP. Especially if one of the two nodes is a NAT64 or NAT46 router it makes sense
    not to use IPv4 but IPv6 if both nodes are dual-stack nodes. This document also
    suggests to declare the usage of such a method mandatory for all nodes that use
    IPv4 addresses that will be assigned by RIRs in the future. Doing so will make
    it impossible to (mis-) use IPv4 addresses assigned by RIRs to ISPs for IPv4-only
    nodes that do not support IPv6.</p>
