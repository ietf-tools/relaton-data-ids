abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7432] describes mechanism to elect designated forwarder (DF) at
    the granularity of (ESI, EVI) which is per VLAN (or per group of VLANs in case
    of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service). However, the current level of granularity
    of per-VLAN is not adequate for some applications.[I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election-framework]
    improves base line DF election by introducing HRW DF election. [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy]
    introduces applicability of EVPN to Multicast flows, routes to sync them and a
    default DF election. This document is an extension to HRW base draft [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election-framework]
    and further enhances HRW algorithm for the Multicast flows to do DF election at
    the granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow).</p>"
