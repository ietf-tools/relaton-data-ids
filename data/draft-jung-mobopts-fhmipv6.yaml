abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a scheme to support Fast Handover over HMIPv6
    networks. The MIPv6 mobility could be more enhanced by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6,
    in which MIPv6 is benefited from all the advantages of the respective schemes.
    This document describes how to use FMIPv6 for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6). The F-HMIPv6
    is designed to be friendly with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6,
    the tunnel for fast handover is established between MAP and NAR, rather than between
    PAR and NAR. For this purpose, the MN exchanges the FMIPv6 messages with MAP,
    not PAR. The F-HMIPv6 utilizes the FMIPv6 messages for handover support without
    further defining any new messages. For the F-HMIPv6, it is proposed to define
    a new flag 'F' in the HMIPv6 MAP option.</p>"
