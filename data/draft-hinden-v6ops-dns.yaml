abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach to how Domain Name Protocol (DNS)
    should be carried over IPv6. There have been some operational issues identified
    in carrying DNS packets over IPv6 and this draft proposes solutions to address
    them. A summary of what is proposed is to limit IPv6 DNS responses over UDP to
    be 1280 octets and use TCP or QUIC for anything larger.</p>"
