abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of
    candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server
    protocol. Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one
    or more ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance. This document specifies
    a procedure for third-party ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO
    client is not co-located with the actual resource consumer, but instead embedded
    in a third party such as a peer-to-peer tracker. This algorithm takes a resource
    consumer's IP address as argument, performs several DNS lookups (for PTR, SOA,
    and U-NAPTR resource records), and produces URIs of ALTO servers that are able
    to give reasonable ALTO guidance to a resource consumer willing to communicate
    using this IP address. Starting with draft-kist-alto-3pdisc-02 the algorithm has
    significantly changed compared to previous versions of this document, including
    draft-kiesel-alto-3pdisc-* and draft-ietf-alto-server-discovery-*. The new algorithm
    does not try "DNS tree climbing" and it does not neccessarily rely on PTR records,
    i.e., it can also produce results if no PTR records are populated in the DNS,
    for example when IPv6 privacy exensions are in use.</p>
