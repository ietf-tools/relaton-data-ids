abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) are unicode strings used
    to identify resources on the Internet. Applications that use IRIs often define
    a means of comparing two IRIs to determine when two IRIs are equivalent for the
    purpose of that application. Some applications also define a method for 'canonicalizing'
    or 'normalizing' an IRI -- translating one IRI into another which is equivalent
    under the comparison method used. This document gives guidelines and best practices
    for defining and using IRI comparison, equivalence, normalization and canonicalization
    methods.</p>"
