abstract:
- content: "<p>When BGP route collectors such as RIPE RIS and Route Views are used
    by operators and researchers, currently one can not tell if the collection of
    paths announced to a collector represents the ISP's customer cone, includes internal
    routes, includes paths learned from peerings or transits. This greatly reduces
    the utility of the collected data. This document specifies the use of BGP communities
    to differentiate the kinds of views being presented to the collectors.</p>"
