abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is to specify the requirements to compress headers of
    IP/SCTP package and how ROHC mechanism compresses SCTP. Streaming Control Transport
    Protocol is new generation IP transport protocol which has been published in RFC2960
    and updated by RFC4960. SCTP can maintain association among multiple peers, thus
    supports multiple homing and multiple streaming, while inherits most functions
    of TCP. SCTP as transport protocol has been used to carry signaling or possible
    user plane data in turbulence network which needs to save spectrum resource by
    compressing IP headers.</p>"
