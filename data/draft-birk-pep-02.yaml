abstract:
- content: <p>Building on already available security formats and message transports
    (like PGP/MIME for email), and with the intention to stay interoperable to systems
    widespreadly deployed, pretty Easy privacy (pEp) describes protocols to automatize
    operations (key management, key discovery, private key handling including peer-to-peer
    synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices) that have
    been seen to be barriers to deployment of end-to-end secure interpersonal messaging.
    pEp also relies on "Trustwords" (as a word mapping of of fingerprints) to verify
    communication peers and proposes a trust rating system to denote secure types
    of communications and signal the privacy level available on a per-user and per-message
    level. In this document, the general design choices and principles of pEp are
    outlined.</p>
