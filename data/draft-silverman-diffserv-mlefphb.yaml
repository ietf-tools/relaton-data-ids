abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks require certain packet flows to be transported with greater
    priority than others. This draft defines a new PHB (Per Hop Behavior), the Multi-Level
    Expedited Forwarding (MLEF) PHB. RFC 3246 [3] defines the Expedited Forwarding
    PHB for applications requiring low latency, but with a single DSCP and treatment.
    This draft extends that concept and defines a PHB with multiple treatments for
    packet flows for applications requiring low latency and multiple priority levels.</p>"
