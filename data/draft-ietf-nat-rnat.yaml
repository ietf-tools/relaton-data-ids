abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability for
    mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is accessible
    by its home address, regardless of its current location in the Internet. When
    away from home, a mobile node acquires a care-of address indicating its current
    location. It registers the care-of address with a registration server (RS). The
    RS sets up a twice network address translation table on a RAT device. The RAT
    device transparently routes datagrams destined for the mobile node's home address
    to the care-of address using twice network address translation. The protocol requirements
    for the mobile node is minimal. End-users can have mobility support easily as
    registration is done using widely available applications.</p>"
