abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes, based on the experience of MIS (Mobile Internet
    Services, Inc.) for commercial mobile IP service over IEEE 802.11b based wireless
    LAN environment, how smooth handover between access points is implemented. The
    major obstacle for the smooth handover is time required to scan frequency bands
    and latency of mobile registration is not so much a problem, both of which is
    solved with terminals having two transceivers.</p>"
