abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses variations in the TCP 'slow-start restart' (SSR)
    algorithm, and the unintended failure of some variations to properly restart in
    some environments. SSR is intended to avoid line-rate bursts after idle periods,
    where TCP accumulates permission to send in the form of ACKs, but does not consume
    that permission immediately. SSR's original 'restart after send is idle' is commonly
    implemented as 'restart after receive is idle'. The latter unintentionally fails
    to restart for bidirectional connections where the sender's burst is triggered
    by a reverse-path data packet, such as in persistent HTTP. Both the former and
    latter are shown to permit bursts in other circumstances. Three solutions are
    discussed, and their implementations evaluated. This document is a product of
    the LSAM project at ISI. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the
    authors.</p>"
