abstract:
- content: '<p>This document provides requirements for a service that allows client
    applications to subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore. Based on criteria negotiated
    as part of a subscription, updates will be pushed to targeted recipients. Such
    a capability eliminates the need for periodic polling of YANG datastores by applications
    and fills a functional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e. Netconf and Restconf).
    Such a service can be summarized as a "pub/sub" service for YANG datastore updates.
    Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed.
    These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects
    underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees.</p>'
