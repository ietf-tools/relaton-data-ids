abstract:
- content: "<p>Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is a protocol
    defined in multiple RFCs for enabling communication between a Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs) and Path Computation Clients (PCCs). Although PCEP defines various
    LSP identifiers, attributes, and constraints, there are operational attributes
    available on the PCC that can enhance path computation and improve the debugging
    experience, which are not currently supported in PCEP. This document proposes
    extensions to PCEP to include: * Support for explicit or dynamic path types. *
    Mechanisms to mark LSPs as eligible for use as transit LSPs. * A fallback to Binding
    label/Segment Identifier (SID) allocation by</p>"
