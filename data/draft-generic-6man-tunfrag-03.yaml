abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and
    return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform link-specific fragmentation (also
    known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6. This latter category of links
    is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific fragmentation
    and reassembly to the point that it would be highly desirable to push the workload
    back to the IPv6 communication endpoints. A common case that exhibits these link
    characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels. Additionally, IPv6 nodes could
    better adapt to path MTUs of various sizes by using either a small amount of host-based
    fragmentation and/or path probing as necessary.This document therefore proposes
    an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.</p>
