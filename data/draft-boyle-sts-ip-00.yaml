abstract:
- content: "<p>A proposal is made to carry Synchronous Transport Signal (STS-N) services
    over packetized networks, in particular over IP networks. This has the potential
    to dramatically lower the price, ease the provisioning and grooming, and improve
    managability of delivering these types of circuits. Two proposals are put forth
    for discussion on how STS services could be transported over an IP network. The
    first proposal, referred to as SPE1/IP, is to break OC-N signals down into their
    STS-1 blocks, identify the SPE components and packetize these for transmission
    across a packet network. The second proposal, referred to as STSc/IP breaks down
    the STS signal into the underlying concatenated services and transports configurable
    length segments of the signal to the far end of the data network. With either
    of these approaches, different STS-N services on a given port can be connected
    to different ports across the network and the network will groom them onto the
    most optimal path available.</p>"
