abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP currently relies on the exchange of keys in clear during
    the initial handshake to authenticate the establishment of additional subflows.
    This document proposes a variant of the Multipath TCP handshake that allows Multipath
    TCP to reuse keys negotiated by the Application layer protocol above it such as
    SSL/TLS to authenticate the establishment of additional subflows.</p>"
