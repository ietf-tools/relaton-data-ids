abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft proposes protocols specifically for use with embedded
    devices for networking. These protocols offer similar services at the socket layer
    as UDP or TCP, but do so with much less overhead and lower implementation complexity.
    These protocols together are part of the nanoIP protocol suite.</p>"
