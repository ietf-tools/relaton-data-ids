abstract:
- content: "<p>When watching the same IPTV channel, different TV sets may not render
    the same picture and the associated audio at the same moment. The variation in
    end-to-end delay that resulted in such asynchronous playback between users is
    referred to as inter-user playback delay. Unicast based rapid acquisition of multicast
    RTP sessions (RAMS) as specified in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] is
    an important technique in achieving fast channel switching in IPTV as well as
    other multicast applications. In addition, RAMS also significantly relaxes the
    requirement of relatively short random access point period in encoding of video
    streams in multicast applications, thus allowing significantly improved compression
    efficiency. However, on the other hand, the use of RAMS increases inter-user playback
    delay, which makes users receiving the same multicast session playback the same
    content asynchronously. This document specifies a mechanism to help reduce inter-user
    playback delay caused by the use of RAMS.</p>"
