abstract:
- content: "<p>Seamless offering of Quality of Service (QoS) to a Mobile Node during
    handovers is considered crucial for enabling a variety of application services
    in the Mobile Internet. In this document, we define the QoS contexts and show
    how they could be transferred to enable seamless QoS operation during handovers.
    We introduce the notion of QoS Profile Types and the associated QoS Profiles,
    which together constitute QoS contexts, that facilitate QoS inter-operability
    among the pariticipating access routers. We also illustrate how these contexts
    can be used with fast handover signaling.</p>"
