abstract:
- content: "<p>The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is a protocol defined for distributing
    labels for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and its procedures are defined
    in [RFC5036]. LDP has been one of the most deployed MPLS signaling protocols.
    [RFC5036] defines LDP version 1 and this document introduces LDP version 2 to
    full-fill various operational needs when LDP is deployed for IPV6 networks. LDP
    version 1 procedures can support IPV6 Label Switch Path (LSP) setup and this document
    enhances those procedures in Version 2.</p>"
