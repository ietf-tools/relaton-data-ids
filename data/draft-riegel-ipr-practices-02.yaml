abstract:
- content: "<p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), in particular patents are important
    for standards development organizations (SDOs). A patent grants a monopoly to
    the owner to control the usage of the covered technology. If such a technology
    is becoming part of a standard the patent owner can arbitrarily restrict the usage
    of the standard. Therefore all SDOs are concerned about patents in their standards.
    This memo focuses on practices the IETF may apply to cope with patent rights in
    its standards. The proposal is based on the idea of open standards and is fully
    aligned to the current IPR rules of the IETF. The intention is to retain the mind
    of the IETF while enabling the consideration of IPR covered proposals in a defined
    way.</p>"
