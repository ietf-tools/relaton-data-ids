abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifying authentication
    of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against the corresponding SIP and XMPP services.
    The text is not attempt to define a complex credential sharing protocol but rather
    to determine and eventually encourage use of a simple mechanism that would allow
    service providers to host a SIP+XMPP solution appearing as a single service to
    their users. In other words, the goal here is to agree on a set of recommendations
    that would encourage client developers to implement simple UIs that would only
    require users to provide an ID and a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP
    account for the first time (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP and
    XMPP).</p>"
