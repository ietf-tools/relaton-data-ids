abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a third generation wireless architecture that
    is consistent with the requirements set by the International Telecommunications
    Union (ITU) for International Mobile Telecommunications 2000 (IMT-2000)systems.
    IMT-2000 systems will provide wireless voice, high speed data, and multimedia
    services. This draft has been developed by the Telecommunications Industry Association
    (TIA) Standards Subcommittee TR45.6. As a guiding principle this draft has leveraged
    the use of RFCs and Internet drafts wherever possible, including Mobile IP and
    AAA. A network reference model is provided, along with a set of more detailed
    requirements. Finally a list of supporting RFCs and Internet Drafts is presented.</p>"
