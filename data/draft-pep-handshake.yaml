abstract:
- content: "<p>In interpersonal messaging, end-to-end encryption means for public
    key distribution and verification of its authenticity are needed; the latter to
    prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This document proposes a new method
    to easily verify a public key is authentic by a Handshake process that allows
    users to easily authenticate their communication channel. The new method is targeted
    to Opportunistic Security scenarios and is already implemented in several applications
    of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
