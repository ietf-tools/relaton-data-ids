abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Realtime Internet Peering for Telephony
    (RIPT) protocol. RIPT is used to provide peering of voice and video communications
    between entities. These include a traditional voice trunking provider (such as
    a telco), and a trunking consumer (such as an enterprise PBX or contact center),
    or between a video conferencing endpoint deployed in an enterprise, and a video
    conferencing SaaS service. RIPT is an alternative to SIP, SDP and RTP for these
    use cases, and is designed as a web application using HTTP/3. Using HTTP/3 allows
    implementors to build their applications on top of cloud platforms, such as AWS,
    Azure and Google Cloud, all of which are heavily focused on HTTP based services.
    RIPT also addresses many of the challenges of traditional SIP-based peering. It
    supports modern techniques for load balancing, autoscaling, call-preserving failover,
    graceful call migrations, security by default, STIR-based caller ID, provisioning,
    and capabilities - all of which have been challenges with traditional SIP peering
    and voice trunking. Since it runs over HTTP/3, it works through NATs and firewalls
    with the same ease as HTTP does.</p>"
