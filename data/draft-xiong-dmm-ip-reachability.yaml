abstract:
- content: "<p>In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile node
    (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address to communicate
    with different hosts. When a new correspondent node (CN) initials an IP session
    with MN, the CN needs to find and select one of the MN's IP addresses to provide
    best performance (e.g. with low delay) for the IP session. This draft analyses
    the existing mechanisms for IP reachability in a distributed mobility management
    environment, and identifies the key procedures or enhancements to support the
    routing-optimized IP reachability in a distributed mobility management environment.</p>"
