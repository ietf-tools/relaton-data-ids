abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet forwarding on Internet typically takes no place with inspection
    of the source address. Thus malicious attacks or abnormal behavior have been launched
    with the spoofed source addresses. This document describes an inter-domain source
    address validation with RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure) and IPsec (IP
    Security), including the motivation, tech framework, main interactive process,
    and optional extensions.</p>"
