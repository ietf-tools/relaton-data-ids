abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an EPP extension that permits usage of Internationalized
    Email Addresses in the EPP protocol and specifies the terms when it can be used
    by EPP clients and servers. The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being
    developed before appearing the standards for Internationalized Email Addresses
    (EAI), does not support such email addresses. TO BE REMOVED on turning to RFC:
    The document is edited in the dedicated github repo (https://github.com/beldmit/eppeai).
