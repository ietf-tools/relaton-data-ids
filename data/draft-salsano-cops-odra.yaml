abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new client type (COPS-ODRA) for the COPS
    protocol to support dynamic DiffServ admission control. The Policy Decision Point
    (PDP) acts as a 'Bandwidth Broker' for the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) which
    is requesting resources. The use of the defined mechanism is suited for (but it
    is not limited to) the Integrated Services operation over Diffserv networks. This
    document represents the updated version of draft-salsano-issll- cops-odra-00.txt
    and is issued only for reference. Another new client type called COPS-DRA (Diffserv
    Resource Allocation) includes all the functionality of COPS-ODRA adding the support
    of combined Outsourcing and Provisioning model.</p>"
