abstract:
- content: "<p>An Internet Directory is a necessity. The lack of an Internet Directory
    is posing serious problems. There are several Directory Protocols ready for deployment
    in the Internet. But, among other factors, content generation for the directory
    has been a major stumbling block. A simple and straight-forward method of generating
    contents for a directory of organizations and their network services using information
    from the Domain Name System (DNS) and the WHOIS servers is described in this memo.</p>"
