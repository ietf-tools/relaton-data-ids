abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft analyzes the complexities involved in setting up the certification
    infrastructure for multi-tenant, multi-domain SDN adopted network environment.
    There are certain architectural options available to address these complexities,
    and the same have been consolidated and analyzed in the draft. However, there
    are certain implementation level challenges that create difficulties to operationalize
    these options. And these challenges have been recognized in the draft and further
    translated into requirements for setting up an operational framework suitable
    for managing certificate chains for SDN integrated environment. Finally, a next
    level of assessment has been carried out to consolidate contemporary work happening
    in different Work Groups and their likely coverage over identified operational
    framework requirements.</p>"
