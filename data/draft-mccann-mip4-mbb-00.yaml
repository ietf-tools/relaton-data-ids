abstract:
- content: "<p>A make-before-break handoff is one where resources on a target system
    are allocated prior to releasing the resources on a source system. Make-before-break
    can be an effective means to provide a more seamless handoff with fewer dropped
    packets. The existing Mobile IPv4 specification supports simultaneous bindings,
    which can facilitate a make-before-break handoff. However, the binding state at
    the home agent is only one example of a resource that can be allocated; others
    include the link connection to the Foreign Agent (or access router) and the provision
    of security associations between the mobile node and the mobility agents. It may
    be desirable to set up these resources on the target system without necessarily
    creating a binding entry on the Home Agent. This document provides some additional
    conventions on the use of simultaneous bindings in a make- before-break handoff
    that can be used to optimize the allocation of resources in these scenarios.</p>"
