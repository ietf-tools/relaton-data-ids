abstract:
- content: "<p>Directory lookups in the AFS-3 distributed file system are supported
    by defining a canonical encoding for a directory object, and transmitting all--or
    part--of that object from a file server to its clients so that clients may resolve
    paths into AFS file IDs (FIDs). This memo describes the AFS-3 directory object
    wire encoding. Internet Draft Comments Comments regarding this draft are solicited.
    Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org)
    as a recipient of any comments.</p>"
