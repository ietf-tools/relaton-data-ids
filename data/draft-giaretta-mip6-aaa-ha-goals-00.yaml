abstract:
- content: "<p>In commercial deployments Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered by a
    Mobility Services Provider (MSP). In this case all protocol operations may need
    to be explicitely authorized and traced. A convenient approach to do that is to
    define an interface between the Home Agent (HA) and the AAA infrastructure of
    the MSP, which stores user's credentials and service profiles. The availability
    of this interface can be useful also to enable dynamic Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping
    on both the mobile node and the designated HA. This document describes various
    scenarios where an interface between the HA and the AAA infrastructure of the
    MSP is required. Furthermore, a list of design goals for this interface is provided.</p>"
