abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to
    specify a complaint feedback loop (FBL) address as a message header field. Also,
    it defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation
    for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide
    Mailbox Providers with an address for a complaint feedback loop. Currently, providing
    and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message
    Originators and Mailbox Providers. The mechanism specified in this document is
    being published as an experiment, to gauge interest of, and gather feedback from
    implementers and deployers. This document is produced through the Independent
    RFC stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process.</p>"
