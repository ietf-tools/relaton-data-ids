abstract:
- content: "<p>The scale and scope of the worldwide web has been in part driven by
    the availability of HTML as a common serialization, data model, and interaction
    model for structured resources on the web. By contrast, the general use of appropriate
    hypermedia techniques for machine interfaces has been limited by the lack of a
    common markup format for serialization and exchange of structured machine resources
    and sensor/actuator data which includes or embeds standardized hypermedia controls.
    The IRTF Thing to Thing Research Group [T2TRG] has a charter to investigate the
    use of REST design style [REST]for machine interactions. The W3C Web of Things
    Interest Group [W3C-WoT] are investigating abstract hypermedia controls and interaction
    models for machines. Machine optimized content formats exist for web links [RFC5988]
    [RFC6690] and for data items [I-D.ietf-core-senml]. Structured data which contains
    both links and items is known as the collection pattern. This draft describes
    media types for representation of machine resources structured as collections.
    A simple, reusable data model is described with a representation format, using
    a well known set of keywords to expose hypermedia controls, which inform clients
    how to perform state transfer operations on resources. The underlying assumptions
    regarding transfer layer processing are specified in this document. The HSML media
    type described in this document is compatible with SenML and CoRE Link-format
    by reusing the keyword identifiers and element structures from these content formats.
    Representations of HSML document content may be obtained in CoRE Link-Format and
    SenML content formats.</p>"
