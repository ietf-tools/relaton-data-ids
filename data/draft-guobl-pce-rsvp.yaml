abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in multi-domain Multi- Protocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. In this context, the ability to
    compute Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in MPLS and GMPLS networks
    across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement. This document
    specifies the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) procedures and potential
    extensions for the use of Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE)
    signaling in PCE based MPLS-TE packet networks and GMPLS packet and non-packet
    networks to support a flexible establishment and maintenance of Label Switched
    Paths that cross domain boundaries or cross layers.</p>"
