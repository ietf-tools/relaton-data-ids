abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 184 (Rated) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    response code. This response code enables calling parties to learn an intermediary
    rated their call attempt. Depending on rating (e.g. Likely Scam), the call may
    be rejected or go unanswered. Through a 1xx code, the caller?s network may become
    aware future attempts to contact the same User Agent Server will likely go unanswered.
    The initial use case driving the need for a 184 response code is when the intermediary
    is an analytics engine. In this case, the rating is constructed via machine or
    other process. This contrasts with 607 (Unwanted) &amp; 608 (Rejected) SIP response
    codes in which a human at target User Agent Server, or terminating network analytics,indicate
    the call may not completed. This document also defines use of a Call-Info header
    field in 184 responses to enable negatively rated callers to contact entities
    that rated their calls in error. This provides a remediation mechanism for legal
    callers who find their calls going unanswered (not necessarily blocked).</p>"
