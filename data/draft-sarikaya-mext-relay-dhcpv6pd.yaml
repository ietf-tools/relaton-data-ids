- content: "<p>This document defines DHCP Relay Agent based prefix delegation support
    for a mobile network. Mobile Router uses DHCPv6 prefix delegation to dynamically
    request its Mobile Network Prefixes from DHCP Server. DHCP Relay Agent located
    in MR enables MR to run the prefix delegation application with the same DHCP Server
    even after MR moves to a different local network.</p>"
