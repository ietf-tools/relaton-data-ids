abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is based on a profile of the MPLS
    and Pseudowire (PW) procedures as specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE),
    PW, and Multi-Segment Pseudowire (MS-PW) architectures developed by the Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF). The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has specified a Transport Network architecture.
    This document provides a thesaurus for the interpretation of MPLS-TP terminology
    within the context of the ITU-T Transport Network Recommendations. It is important
    to note that MPLS-TP is applicable in a wider set of contexts than just Transport
    Networks. The definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive
    or complete interpretations of MPLS-TP concepts. This document simply allows the
    MPLS-TP terms to be applied within the Transport Network context.</p>"
