abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet Draft discusses a proposed extension to the set of Interface
    Identifier construction methods for 802 networks. The purpose of this is to allow
    autoconf RA announcments of prefix length other than 64 bits. It is intended to
    be fully backward compatible for /64 announcements. Instead of having one Interface
    Identifier construction method for all purposes, this adds an alternate method
    which is only used for autoconf, and only if the prefix length is not /64. No
    other IPv6 methods or protocols require modification. However, without modification,
    use of prefixes other than /64 likely won't support many IPv6 enhanced functions.
    The ultimate goal it providing enough bits between the top level allocation by
    Regional Internet Registristry (RIR) and the smallest autoconfiguration allocation,
    to allow both external aggregation by ISPs into one prefix, as well as internal
    hierarchical aggregation to support a variety of ISP topologies and practices.
    Current policies are driven from below by the current 64 bit Interface Identifier.
    Only by relaxing this to 48 bits for such technologies as 802 (Ethernet), does
    the number of bits available reach a level deemed "sufficient".Author's Note This
    Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being
    placed on the Standards Track for 6man. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in [5].</p>
