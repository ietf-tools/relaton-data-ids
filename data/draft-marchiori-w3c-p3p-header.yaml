abstract:
- content: "<p>The Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0[4] (P3P1.0) specification
    describes how to associate a privacy policy with each URI request. Such associations
    are contained in a so-called policy reference file. This draft describes a new
    HTTP response header which indicates the location of such policy reference file.
    This header is intended to be a part of the P3P1.0 framework and should be treated
    in the full context of the P3P1.0 specification[4].</p>"
