abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can be defined as a new approach
    for network programmability. Network programmability in this context refers to
    the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically
    via open interfaces as opposed to relying on closed-box solutions and their associated
    proprietary interfaces. SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks
    through the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and,
    by doing so, separates it from the control plane. This separation allows faster
    innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown. However, there
    is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer structure
    in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface with each other. This document
    aims to answer these questions and provide a concise reference document for SDNRG,
    in particular, and the SDN community, in general, based on relevant peer-reviewed
    literature and documents in the RFC series.</p>"
