abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion
    issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of the original
    IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for Easy IPv4), outlines the
    IPv4 public address pool expansion and the Internet system architecture enhancement
    considerations. EzIP may expand an IPv4 address by a factor of 256M without affecting
    the existing IPv4 based Internet, or the current private networks. It is in full
    conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only both direct and private
    network connectivity, but also their interoperability. EzIP deployments may coexist
    with existing Internet traffic and IoTs (Internet of Things) operations without
    perturbing their setups, while offering end-users the freedom to indepdently choose
    which service. EzIP may be implemented as a software or firmware enhancement to
    Internet edge routers or private network routing gateways, wherever needed, or
    simply installed as an inline adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling
    a seamless introduction. The 256M case detailed here establishes a complete spherical
    layer of routers for interfacing between the Internet fabic (core plus edge routers)
    and the end user premises. Incorporating caching proxy technology in the gateway,
    a fairly large geographical region may enjoy address expansion based on as little
    as one ordinary IPv4 public address utilizing IP packets with degenerated EzIP
    header. If IPv4 public pool allocations were reorganized, the assignable pool
    could be multiplied 512M fold or even more. Enabling hierarchical address architecture
    which facilitates both hierarchical and mesh routing, EzIP can provide nearly
    the same order of magnitude of address pool resources as IPv6 while streamlining
    the administrative aspects of it. The basic EzIP will immediately resolve local
    IPv4 address shortage, while being transparent to the rest of the Internet. Under
    the Dual-Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities will relieve the
    IPv4 address shortage issue, while affording IPv6 more time to reach maturity
    for providing the availability levels required for delivering a long-term general
    service.</p>"
