- content: "<p>The client networks could be of different address family with the core
    network during IPv6 transition period. The client networks may need to run IP
    multicast applications across the transit core while it's not well supported currently.
    This memo provides a AFBR-based softwire mesh multicast framework for IPv6 transition.</p>"
