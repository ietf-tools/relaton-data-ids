abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes a new IPsec option called Encapsulating Security
    Variable Payload (ESVP) that allows a variable but contiguous portion of the payload
    received from upper protocol layers to be encrypted/authenticated between the
    two end-points of a security association. The remaining portion of the payload
    is left in the clear. The upper layer payload contains the upper layer protocol
    headers and data. The decision about which portions of the payload should be available
    as cleartext is taken only by the end-points of the security association. By leaving
    a certain portion of the payload as cleartext, ESVP provides the option of encrypting
    and decrypting an IPsec ESVP datagram at other protocol layers to allow limited
    and secure access to the cleartext data at these protocol layers. These layers
    could be terminated inside the network for providing network-based value added
    services and performance optimizations. These network-based value added services
    and performance optimizations include policy implementation and QoS based on packet
    classification, TCP performance enhancement in the case of wireless networks and
    firewall services.</p>"
