abstract:
- content: "<p>Controlled-Load Service provides data flows with an enhanced quality
    of service, in the form of low packet delay and a low probability of packet loss
    even under congestion. A network element providing Controlled-Load Service can
    use an admission control algorithm to limit the number of data flows receiving
    the service. In this document we describe an admission control algorithm for Controlled-
    Load Service. This algorithm is not intended for IETF standardization. Rather,
    it is presented for informational purposes only. We also present a reference implementation
    framework for the measurement-based admission control algorithm. Our implementation
    separates the measurement from the actual admission control decision to provide
    the flexibility of using different algorithms in bandwidth estimation and admission
    control.</p>"
