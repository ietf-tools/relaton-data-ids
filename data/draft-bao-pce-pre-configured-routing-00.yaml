abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-configured routing is a routing scheme that except primary route
    operator configures one or multiple routes which will be used as recovery route
    when the primary route fails for a service previously. This document improves
    this traditional routing shceme, and PCE (Paht Computation Element) is applied
    for pre-configured routing. Furthermore, this document also presents a detailed
    set of PCC-PCE (Path Computation Client) communication protocol requirements and
    defines PCEP (Path Computation Element Communication Protocol) extensions for
    PCEP.</p>"
