abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the Session Initital Protocol (SIP) includes a suite of security
    services that has been expanded by numerous specifications over the years, there
    is no single place that explains how to use SIP to establish confidential media
    sessions. Additionally, existing mechanisms have some feature gaps that need to
    be identified and resolved in order for them to address the pervasive monitoring
    threat model. This specification describes practices for negotiating confidential
    media with SIP, including both comprehensive security solutions which bind the
    media to SIP-layer identities as well as opportunistic security solutions.</p>"
