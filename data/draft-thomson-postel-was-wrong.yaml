abstract:
- content: <p>Jon Postel's famous statement of "Be liberal in what you accept, and
    conservative in what you send" is a principle that has long guided the design
    and implementation of Internet protocols. The posture this statement advocates
    promotes interoperability, but can produce negative effects in the protocol ecosystem
    in the long term. Those effects can be avoided by maintaining protocols.</p>
