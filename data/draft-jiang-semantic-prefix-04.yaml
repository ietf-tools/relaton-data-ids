abstract:
- content: "<p>Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises require detailed information
    about the payload of traffic, so that packets can be treated differently and efficiently.
    Packet-level differentiation can also enable flow-level and user-level differentiation.
    With its large address space, IPv6 allows semantics to be embedded into addresses
    by assigning additional significance to specific bits within the prefix. Using
    these semantics, routers and other intermediary devices can easily apply relevant
    policies as required. This document describes a framework for such an approach.
    It also analyses the technical advantages and limitations associated with such
    an approach. This informational document only discusses the usage of semantics
    within a single network, or group of interconnected networks which share a common
    addressing policy, referred to as a Semantic Prefix Domain. The document is NOT
    intended to suggest the standardization of any common global semantics.</p>"
