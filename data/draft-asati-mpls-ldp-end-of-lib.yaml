abstract:
- content: "<p>There are situations following LDP session establishment where it would
    be useful for an LDP speaker to know when its peer has advertised all of its labels.
    These include session establishment when LDP-IGP sync is in use and session re-establishment
    following loss of an LDP session when LDP graceful restart is in use. The LDP
    specification provides no mechanism for an LDP speaker to notify a peer when it
    has completed its initial label advertisements to that peer. This document specifies
    means for an LDP speaker to signal completion of its initial label advertisements
    following session establishment.</p>"
