abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the MIME
    specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC 2049] can convey information
    not intended for display by the Mail User Agent (UA), but for processing (as opposed
    to display) by an external program. It specifies a new type of 'Content-Disposition'
    (defined by [RFC 2183]), which is valid for any MIME entity ('message' or 'body
    part). When 'body part' is referred to in this memo, it is referring to any MIME
    entity, except in section 2.4. This memo is the definition of this type, as specified
    by Section 9 of [RFC 2183]. This document is intended as an extension to MIME.
    As such, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the MIME specifications, [RFC
    822], and [RFC 2183]. The information presented herein supplements but does not
    replace that found in those documents.</p>"
