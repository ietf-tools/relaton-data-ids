abstract:
- content: "<p>Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary
    is surprisingly difficult. This paper points out many pitfalls in using traditional
    pseudo-random number generation techniques for choosing such quantities. It recommends
    the use of truly random hardware techniques and shows that the existing hardware
    on many systems can be used for this purpose. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any
    kind.</p>"
