abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a topology-based distributed mobility management
    (DMM) mechansim in PMIPv6-based network. In this mechanism, a different sub-network
    prefix is assigned to a different access router (AR) in PMIPv6-domain. The sub-network
    prefix and corresponding AR address information is stored in the topology server.
    With this mechanism, there is no need to query mobile node (MN)'s localized mobility
    anchor (LMA) address information whenever MN moves from one network to another.</p>"
