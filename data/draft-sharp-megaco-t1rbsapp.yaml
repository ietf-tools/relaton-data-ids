abstract:
- content: "<p>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (megaco) can be used to carry T1
    Robbed Bit Signaling (RBS) between the Media Gateway (MG) and the Media Gateway
    Controller (MGC). This document describes the applicability of megaco to carrying
    T1 Robbed Bit Signaling. T1 Robbed Bit Signaling is a type of Channel Associated
    Signaling used mainly in the United States of America (USA) and Canada. A description
    and specification for T1 RBS can be found in EIA/TIA- 464-B. This draft does not
    define any new packages, but identifies the need for new packages to support Robbed
    Bit Signaling. It is anticipated that packages for FX service will be very similar
    to packages defined for analog lines.</p>"
