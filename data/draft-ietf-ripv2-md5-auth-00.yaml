abstract:
- content: "<p>Growth in the Internet has made us aware of the need for improved authentication
    of routing information. RIP-II provides for unauthenticated service (as in classical
    RIP), or password authentication. Both are vulnerable to passive attacks currently
    widespread in the Internet. Well-understood security issues exist in routing protocols
    [4]. Clear text passwords, currently specified for use with RIP-II, are no longer
    considered sufficient [5].</p>"
