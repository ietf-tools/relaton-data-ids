abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies semantics for a Middlebox Communication (MIDCOM)
    protocol to be used by MIDCOM agents for interacting with middleboxes such as
    firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs). The semantics discussion does
    not include any specification of a concrete syntax or a transport protocol. However,
    a concrete protocol is expected to implement the specified semantics or, more
    likely, a superset of it. The MIDCOM protocol semantics is derived from the MIDCOM
    requirements, from the MIDCOM framework, and from working group decisions. This
    document obsoletes RFC 3989. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
