abstract:
- content: "<p>iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol designed to run on top of TCP. The
    iSCSI session abstraction is equivalent to the SCSI I_T nexus, and the iSCSI session
    provides an ordered command delivery from the SCSI initiator to the SCSI target.
    This document goes into the design considerations that led to the iSCSI session
    model as it is defined today, relates the SCSI command ordering features defined
    in T10 specifications to the iSCSI concepts, and finally provides guidance to
    system designers on how true command ordering solutions can be built based on
    iSCSI.</p>"
