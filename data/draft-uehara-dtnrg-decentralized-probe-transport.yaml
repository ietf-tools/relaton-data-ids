abstract:
- content: "<p>(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle to viechle
    probe mechanism currently being prototyped. The main purpose of disclosing this
    -00 document is to introduce the application idea and start discussion within
    the DTNRG. Because of this, the current mechanism described in this docment does
    not conform to the protocols defined in the DTNRG at this moment. The mechanism
    should be updated based on the discussion in this group.) This document describes
    the transport protocol specification used for the decentralized probe system for
    vehicles. The probe system exchanges probe messages between vehicles using a wireless
    communication methods with low bandwidth and lossy properties. The communication
    environment dynamically changes as vehicle moves. The protocol try to utilize
    the limited bandwidth as much as possible and increase reachability rate by using
    sender-side error correction mechanism.</p>"
