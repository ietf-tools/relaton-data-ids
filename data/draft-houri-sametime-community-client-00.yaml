abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the protocol used by a client in a Sametime
    (TM) community. The protocol enables users connecting to a Sametime community
    to be aware each other and to send Instant Messages (IMs) to other users in the
    community. While this protocol does not meet many of the requirements of the IMPP
    working group, it is provided as background information on existing Instant Messaging
    and Presence implementations. This protocol is provided 'as is' without warranty
    of any kind. In particular, commercial use of this protocol requires licensing.
    The protocol described in this document should enable implementing a client program
    that can interoperate with Sametime communities, given the user has registered
    with the community.</p>"
