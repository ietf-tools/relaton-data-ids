abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the architecture for Service Assurance for
    Intent-based Networking (SAIN). This architecture aims at assuring that service
    instances are correctly running. As services rely on multiple sub-services by
    the underlying network devices, getting the assurance of a healthy service is
    only possible with a holistic view of network devices. This architecture not only
    helps to correlate the service degradation with the network root cause but also
    the impacted services impacted when a network component fails or degrades.</p>"
