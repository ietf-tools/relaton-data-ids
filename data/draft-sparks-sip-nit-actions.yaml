abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes modifications to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) to address problems that have been identified with the SIP non-INVITE transaction.
    These modifications reduce the probability of messages losing the race condition
    inherent in the non-INVITE transaction and reduce useless network traffic. They
    also improve the robustness of SIP networks when elements stop responding. These
    changes update behavior defined in RFC 3261. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
