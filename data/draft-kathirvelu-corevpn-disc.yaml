abstract:
- content: "<p>An IPVPN consists of many routers, some physically discrete and some
    virtual, housed in a Provider Edge router. The problem that presents itself is
    that these virtual routers need to find each other over a virtual topology and
    they need to send broadcast datagrams as mandated in routing protocols [such as
    the neighbor discovery datagram and routing updates in OSPF, the routing updates
    in RIPV2 etc] and user data over this virtual topology. This memo presents an
    approach for solving these problems</p>"
