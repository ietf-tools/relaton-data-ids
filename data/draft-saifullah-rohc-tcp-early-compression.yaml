abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Early Compression Enabler for ROHC-TCP to increase
    compression gain. The enabler provides a generic platform to implement an early
    compression mechanism. An early compression mechanism is an out-of-band mechanism
    that populates the ROHC-TCP decompression context with some of the header fields
    before the ROHC- TCP initialization step. ROHC-TCP does not need to carry those
    fields, thus early compression provides compression from the very first TCP packet
    and increases the compression gain. It is especially useful for short-lived TCP
    connections. The document describes the working of Early Compression Enabler as
    part of ROHC-TCP. It also specifies protocol changes for the ROHC-TCP protocol.
    It does not specify any particular early compression mechanism.</p>"
