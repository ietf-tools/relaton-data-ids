abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP)
    and all of its related components. BRDP enables multi-homing for small to medium
    sites, including Homenets, using Provider Aggregatable IPv6 addresses. It describes
    a mechanism for automated IP address configuration and renumbering, a mechanism
    for optimized source address selection and a new paradigm for packet forwarding,
    for support of multi-homed sites. BRDP prevents ingress filtering problems with
    multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing for multi-path transport protocols.
    This work also prevents routing scalability problems in the provider network and
    Internet Default Free Zone because small to medium multi-homed size sites would
    not need to request Provider Independent address blocks.</p>"
