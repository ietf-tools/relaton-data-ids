abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Virtual Private Networks (IP-VPNs) allow Service Providers to offer
    customers connectivity between sites across an IP Backbone. These VPNs can be
    supported using BGP/MPLS and the connections can be created by using MPLS Traffic
    Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The paths of these LSPs must be computed
    to provide the connectivity between customer sites. Path selection may be dependent
    on a variety of factors including traffic engineering constraints and bandwidth
    requirements. It is highly desirable for VPN customers to be able to dynamically
    establish their MPLS TE LSPs for interconnectivity between BGP/MPLS IP-VPN sites.
    The Path Computation Element (PCE) can determine the optimal paths of TE LSPs
    within an MPLS network. This document defines how to extend the PCEP to support
    the dynamic creation of MPLS TE LSPs between BGP/MPLS IP-VPN sites.</p>"
