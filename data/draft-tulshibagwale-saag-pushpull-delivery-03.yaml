abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines how multiple Security Event Tokens (SETs)
    can be delivered and received to and by an intended recipeint using HTTP POST
    over TLS or WebSocket binding. This specification enabled following two use cases
    - * In situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs) to a network
    peer is also a receiver of SETs from the same peer, it is helpful to have an efficient
    way of sending and receiving SETs in one HTTP transaction. In many cases, such
    as when using the OpenID Shared Signals Framework (SSF), the situation where each
    entity is both a transmitter and receiver is getting increasingly common. * In
    situations where a transmitter of Security Event Tokens (SETs) wants to transmit
    multiple SETs to the reciever in a single HTTP call. Using current mechanisms
    such as "Push-Based Delivery of Security Event Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP" or "Poll-Based
    Delivery of Security Event Tokens (SETs) Using HTTP" both require two or more
    HTTP connections to exchange SETs between peers. This is inefficient due to the
    latency of setting up each communication. This specification enables mutiple events
    to be transmitted in bi-directional transmission and reception of multiple SETs
    in one HTTP connection, and enables them to do so over a single HTTP or WebSocket
    binding. About This Document This note is to be removed before publishing as an
