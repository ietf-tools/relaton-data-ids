abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering
    (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer
    networks. PCE can be stateless or stateful. With the LSP state information acquired
    from the network, a stateful PCE exhibits superiority in facilitating a wide variety
    of applications, especially in GMPLS networks, such as impairment-aware routing
    and wavelength assignment in wavelength-switched optical networks (WSON), time-based
    scheduling applications. This memo provides extensions required for PCE communication
    protocol (i.e. PCEP) so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in
    GMPLS networks. To be more specific, the PCEP extensions specified in this memo
    include not only new objects but also modification of existing objects in PCEP
    messages, with regard to stateful PCE usage in GMPLS networks.</p>"
