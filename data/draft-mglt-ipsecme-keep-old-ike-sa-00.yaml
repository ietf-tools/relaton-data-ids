abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers a VPN Client setting a VPN with a security
    gateway where at least one of the peer has multiple interfaces. With the current
    IKEv2, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are determined by those used by IKEv2
    channel. As a result using multiple interface requires to set an IKEv2 channel
    on each interface, and then on each paths if both the VPN Client and the security
    gateway have multiple interfaces. Setting multiple IKEv2 channel involves multiple
    authentications which MAY each require multiple round trips and delay the VPN
    establishment. In addition multiple authentications unnecessarily load the VPN
    client and the authentication infrastructure. This document presents the KEEP_OLD_IKE_SA
    extension, where an additional IKEv2 channel from an already authenticated IKEv2
    channel. The newly created IKEv2 channel is set without the IKEv2 authentication
    exchange. The newly created IKEv2 channel can then be assigned to another interface
    using MOBIKE.</p>"
