abstract:
- content: "<p>For the new network configuration concept discussed at XMLCONF, we
    mention the importance of building new network architecture. We can not develop
    and discuss the concept using XML because it is only tools but the concept is
    confusable. The consensus of architecture is required to clarify the items and
    technologies that should be discussed and standardized at IETF.</p>"
