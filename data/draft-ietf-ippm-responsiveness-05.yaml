abstract:
- content: <p>For many years, a lack of responsiveness, variously called lag, latency,
    or bufferbloat, has been recognized as an unfortunate, but common, symptom in
    today's networks. Even after a decade of work on standardizing technical solutions,
    it remains a common problem for the end users. Everyone "knows" that it is "normal"
    for a video conference to have problems when somebody else at home is watching
    a 4K movie or uploading photos from their phone. However, there is no technical
    reason for this to be the case. In fact, various queue management solutions have
    solved the problem. Our network connections continue to suffer from an unacceptable
    amount of latency, not for a lack of technical solutions, but rather a lack of
    awareness of the problem and deployment of its solutions. We believe that creating
    a tool that measures the problem and matches people's everyday experience will
    create the necessary awareness, and result in a demand for solutions. This document
    specifies the "Responsiveness Test" for measuring responsiveness. It uses common
    protocols and mechanisms to measure user experience specifically when the network
    is under working conditions. The measurement is expressed as "Round-trips Per
    Minute" (RPM) and should be included with goodput (up and down) and idle latency
    as critical indicators of network quality.</p>
