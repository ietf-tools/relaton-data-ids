abstract:
- content: "<p>Specifically, WiFi has emerged as an important access technology for
    Multiple Service Operator (MSO) and mobile service provider. For mobile service
    provider, WiFi is preferred as a trusted access technology for service. It has
    became important to provide simple transition method expected for service via
    WiFi access. For example, tunnelling on the customer side aims at conveying WiFi
    service between a hotspot and the Service Gateway. GRE tunnel is an increasingly
    popular encapsulation choice because of simple encapsulation and easy implementation,
    especially in aforementioned environments. However, manual configuration is not
    suitable if there are large numbers of the end-points of GRE tunnels. This document
    proposes a dynamic-configured stateless GRE tunnel, which does not modify encapsulation
    format of GRE, but adds signaling for tunnel parameters discovery, such as address,
    GRE key etc.</p>"
