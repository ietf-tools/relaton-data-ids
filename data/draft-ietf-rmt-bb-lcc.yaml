abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes LCC, a scalable layered congestion control
    building block for multicast. LCC is a combination of approaches that allow multiple
    receivers to concurrently receive packets from a single sender at varying rates
    depending on individual bandwidth connections and network conditions. Two basic
    goals of the approach are to allow each receiver to obtain the full benefit of
    the available bandwidth to the sender and to be fair to other flows in the network.</p>"
