abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a method for two parties in a communication
    interaction to exchange Evidence and Attestation Results using exported authenticators,
    as defined in RFC 9261. This approach falls into the category of post-handshake
    attestation by exchanging payloads in the application layer protocol while binding
    the remote attestation to the underlying communication channel. This document
    supports both the passport and background check models from the RATS architecture.</p>"
