abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile node (MN) can connect to the network by using multiple interfaces
    simultaneously or sequentially. The quality of each connection can be changed
    due to many reasons such as the movement of the MN and the interference from the
    network. To guarantee the quality of service, some flows can be moved from a bad
    connection to another better one. In this draft we discuss about how to extend
    the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support such kind of flow mobility.</p>"
