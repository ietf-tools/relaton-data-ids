abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP has been recently getting popularity with some interesting
    transformation in order to be more suitable for use by existing and emerging wireless
    technology, such as IEEE 802.16e Broadband Wireless Access(BWA) One of the fundamental
    features to make Mobile IP available in commercial world is secure access with
    it. In this draft, we propose a novel scheme to locally authenticate and authorize
    inter-domain roaming users for efficient way in IEEE 802.16e BWA based on authentication,
    authorization and accout-ing(AAA) infrastructure. We present the detailed operations
    to establish local security association(SA) for authentication and performance
    evaluation by con-sidering the traffic and mobility properties of a roaming user
    as well as the dis-tance between the mobile node(MN) and its home AAA server.
    Proposed scheme outperforms exiting method with respect to authentication cost
    and ser-vice latency.</p>"
