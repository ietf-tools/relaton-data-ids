abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures use cases and associated requirements for an
    IPv6 Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router. Specifically, the current version
    of this document focuses on the provisioning of an IPv6 CPE router and the provisioning
    of IPv6 Home Devices attached to it. It also addresses IPv6 traffic forwarding
    and IPv6 CPE Router security. This document also identifies areas for future consideration.
    These areas include prefix sub-delegation, IPv6 multicast, transition and tunneling
    mechanisms, provisioning consistency between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, and DNS support.
    This document does not address IPv4 use cases or requirements, as they are widely
    understood; however, it is expected that IPv6 CPE Routers will also support IPv4.</p>"
