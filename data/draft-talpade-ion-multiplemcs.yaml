abstract:
- content: "<p>The basic Multicast Server architecture for layer 3 multicast over
    ATM has been described in draft-ietf-ion-marsmcs-01.txt. It includes a mechanism
    for fault tolerance using multiple MCSs. However no support for sharing senders/receivers
    of a group across multiple MCSs has been provided. This document aims to satisfy
    this need by involving an enhanced version of the MARS in the load sharing and
    fault tolerance mechanism. This approach is an improvement over the previous one
    as it subverts the need for any inter-MCS synchronization mechanisms.</p>"
