abstract:
- content: "<p>This note presents mechanisms for address selection in hosts within
    a multihomed site. The goal of the presented mechanisms is to allow hosts within
    the multihomed site to establish new communications after an outage. The presented
    mechanisms are not by themselves a complete multihoming solution but rather a
    component of such solution.</p>"
