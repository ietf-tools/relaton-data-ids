abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an architecture for digital credential verification
    and validation using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), distributed ledgers, trust
    registries, and the DNS. This architecture provides a verifier with a simple process
    by which to cryptographically verify the credential they are being presented with,
    verify and resolve the issuer of that credential to a domain, and verify that
    issuer's membership in a trust registry.</p>"
