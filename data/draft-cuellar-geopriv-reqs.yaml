abstract:
- content: "<p>Location-based services, navigation applications, emergency services,
    management of equipment in the field, and other location-dependent services need
    geographic location information about a target (user, resource or other entity).
    There is a need to securely gather and transfer location information for location
    services, protecting the privacy of the individuals involved. This document describes
    the requirements for the geopriv Location Object (used to transfer location data
    and perhaps some other information) and for further IETF protocols that use this
    Location Object as an embedded protocol. We focus on authorization, integrity
    and privacy requirements.</p>"
