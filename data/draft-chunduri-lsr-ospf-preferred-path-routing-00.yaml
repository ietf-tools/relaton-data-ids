abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR) mechanism to
    simplify the path description of data plane traffic in Segment Routing (SR) deployments
    with OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols. PPR aims to mitigate the MTU and data plane
    processing issues that may result from SR packet overheads; and also supports
    traffic measurement, accounting statistics and further attribute extensions along
    the paths. Preferred Path Routing is achieved through the addition of descriptions
    to OSPF advertised prefixes, and mapping those to a PPR data-plane identifier.</p>"
