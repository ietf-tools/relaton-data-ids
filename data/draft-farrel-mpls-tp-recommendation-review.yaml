abstract:
- content: "<p>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and the ITU-T is documented
    in RFC 5317 as the report of the Joint Working Team on MPLS-TP. As part of this
    development process, the International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication
    Standardisation Sector (ITU-T) will develop a number of Recommendations. Those
    Recomendations will allow MPLS-TP to be integrated with current transport equipment
    and networks, including, in agreement with the IETF, the definition of any ITU-T-specific
    functionality within the MPLS-TP architecture via the Change Process for Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Protocols and Procedures.
    This document sets out the IETF's expectations of how the IETF, through individual
    participation and through consensus decisions, will contribute to in the development,
    review, and approval of those Recommendations. This document does not modify any
    existing ITU-T or IETF procedures, but shows how those procedures can be used
    to facilitate cooperation for the MPLS-TP project.</p>"
