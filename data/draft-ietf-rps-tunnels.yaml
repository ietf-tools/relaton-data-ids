abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the language and set of semantics describing
    tunnels in the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL). It defines a new
    tunnel class, inet-tunnel, and a set of extensions to the inet-rtr class. An instance
    of the inet-tunnel class specifies endpoints for tunnels of various encapsulation
    types, including DVMRP [DVMRP], GRE [GRE], and IPv6 [IPV6]. This memo is a product
    of the Routing Policy System Working Group (RPS) in the Operational Requirements
    area of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Submit comments to &lt;rps@isi.edu&gt;
    or the author.</p>"
