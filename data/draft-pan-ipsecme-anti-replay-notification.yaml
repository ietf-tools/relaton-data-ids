abstract:
- content: "<p>Although RFC 4302 and RFC 4303 don't prohibit using Extended Sequence
    Number (ESN) when the anti-replay function is not enabled, many IPsec implementations
    require ESN to be used only with anti-replay. Therefore, failing to negotiate
    the use of ESN when the anti-replay is disabled will cause the sequence numbers
    to exhaust rapidly in high-traffic-volume scenarios, leading to the frequent rekey
    of Child SAs. This document defines the REPLAY_PROT_AND_ESN_STATUS Notify Message
    Status Type Payload in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to
    inform the peer of its replay protection status and capability of using ESN without
    anti-replay when creating the Child SAs, to address the above problem.</p>"
