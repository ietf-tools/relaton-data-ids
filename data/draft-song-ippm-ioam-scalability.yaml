abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several potential scalability issues when implementing
    in-situ OAM based on the current in-situ OAM documents and proposes the corresponding
    solutions and modifications to the current in-situ OAM specification. Specifically,
    we extend in-situ OAM to support more standard tracing data than is currently
    defined and add new features to avoid limitations on MTU, bandwidth, forwarding
    path length, and node processing capability. We provide use cases to motivate
    our proposal and base the changes on the current in-situ OAM header format specification.</p>"
