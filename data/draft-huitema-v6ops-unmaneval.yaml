abstract:
- content: "<p>In a companion paper we defined the 'unmanaged networks' scope, which
    typically correspond to home networks or small office networks, and the requirements
    for IPv6 transition mechanism in that scope. We start from this analysis and evaluate
    here the suitability of mechanisms defined in the NGTRANS working group.</p>"
