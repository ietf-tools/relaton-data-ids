abstract:
- content: "<p>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but communications
    are usually restricted to a single path per connection. Resource usage within
    the network would be more efficient were it possible for these multiple paths
    to be used concurrently. Multipath TCP is a proposal to achieve multipath transport
    in TCP. New congestion control algorithms are needed for multipath transport protocols
    such as Multipath TCP, as single path algorithms have a series of issues in the
    multipath context. One of the prominent problems is that running existing algorithms
    such as TCP New Reno independently on each path would give the multipath flow
    more than its fair share at a bottleneck link traversed by more than one of its
    subflows. Further, it is desirable that a source with multiple paths available
    will transfer more traffic using the least congested of the paths, hence achieving
    resource pooling. This would increase the overall utilization of the network and
    also its robustness to failure. This document presents a congestion control algorithm
    which couples the congestion control algorithms running on different subflows
    by linking their increase functions, and dynamically controls the overall aggresiveness
    of the multipath flow. The result is a practical algorithm that is fair to TCP
    at bottlenecks while moving traffic away from congested links.</p>"
