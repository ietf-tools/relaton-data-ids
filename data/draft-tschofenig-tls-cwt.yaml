abstract:
- content: <p>The TLS protocol supports different credentials, including pre-shared
    keys, raw public keys, and X.509 certificates. For use with public key cryptography
    developers have to decide between raw public keys, which require out-of-band agreement
    and full-fletched X.509 certificates. For devices where the reduction of code
    size is important it is desirable to minimize the use of X.509-related libraries.
    With the CBOR Web Token (CWT) a structure has been defined that allows CBOR-encoded
    claims to be protected with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). This document
    registers a new value to the "TLS Certificate Types" sub-registry to allow TLS
    and DTLS to use CWTs. Conceptually, CWTs can be seen as a certificate format (when
    with public key cryptography) or a Kerberos ticket (when used with symmetric key
    cryptography).</p>
