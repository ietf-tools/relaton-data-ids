abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a XML
    representation for information about computer security incidents. The driver for
    the standardization effort for IODEF is the desire to share the information as
    part of the cybersecurity response. As the security considerations of RFC5070
    notes, the data can be sensitive and should only be disclosed to appropriate parties.
    This document describes how to use the Plasma policy enforcement model to ensure
    access to the IODEF data follows the appropriate policies in a distributed environment
    and independent of the transports used to share the information.</p>"
