abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework and service level requirements for
    Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). This framework is intended to aid in
    developing and standardizing protocols and mechanisms to support interoperable
    L1VPNs. The document examines motivations for L1VPNs, high level (service level)
    requirements, and outlines some of the architectural models that might be used
    to build L1VPNs.</p>"
