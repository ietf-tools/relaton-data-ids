abstract:
- content: "<p>Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
    and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching
    them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches.
    NFC standards cover communications protocols and data exchange formats, and are
    based on existing radio-frequency identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC
    14443 and FeliCa. The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the
    NFC Forum, which was founded in 2004 by Nokia, Philips Semiconductors. The NFC
    technology has been widely implemented and available in mobile phones, laptop
    computers, and many other devices. This document describes how IPv6 is transforted
    over NFC using 6LowPAN techiques.</p>"
