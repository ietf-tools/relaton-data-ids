abstract:
- content: "<p>The Service Location Protocol (SLP) allows clients to discover services
    with little or no prior configuration. SLP can be used to advertise services of
    any kind through the use of URLs. However, SLP uses URLs for two purposes: as
    a LOCATOR (indicating the location of the service) and as an IDENTIFIER (used
    for subsequent operations on a service, such as registration, deregistration and
    looking up attributes.) Confounding these two functions in one object leads to
    certain problems. The serviceid: scheme separates identification from location,
    eliminating these problems.</p>"
