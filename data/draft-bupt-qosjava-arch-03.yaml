abstract:
- content: <p>QoSJava, an architecture decoupling QoS reuirements from QoS techniques
    is proposed in this draft. Referring to the idea of Java, QoSJava can conceal
    the heterogeneity of different QoS mechanisms as well as different vendors' devices.
    Users' requirements are translated into a "middle language", i.e. deployment task
    specification. And QoS mechanisms adapter plus Device Driver constitute the "Virtual
    Machine" of QoSJava. Thus network devices can be configured and QoS requirements
    can be fulfilled automatically. Moreover, QoSJava is not only compatible with
    current QoS mechanisms and devices, but open to new QoS solutions and advanced
    facilities in the future.</p>
