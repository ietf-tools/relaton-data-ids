abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic
    Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may be computed by Path Computation
    Elements (PCEs). Where the TE LSP crosses multiple domains, such as Autonomous
    Systems (ASes), the path may be computed by multiple PCEs that cooperate, with
    each responsible for computing a segment of the path. However, in some cases (e.g.,
    when ASes are administered by separate Service Providers), it would break confidentiality
    rules for a PCE to supply a path segment to a PCE in another domain, thus disclosing
    AS-internal topology information. This issue may be circumvented by returning
    a loose hop and by invoking a new path computation from the domain boundary Label
    Switching Router (LSR) during TE LSP setup as the signaling message enters the
    second domain, but this technique has several issues including the problem of
    maintaining path diversity. This document defines a mechanism to hide the contents
    of a segment of a path, called the Confidential Path Segment (CPS). The CPS may
    be replaced by a path-key that can be conveyed in the PCE Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) and signaled within in a Resource Reservation Protocol TE (RSVP-TE) explicit
    route object. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
