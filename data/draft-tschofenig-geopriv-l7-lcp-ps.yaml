abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement, lists requirements and
    captures discussions for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (LCP).
    This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value
    or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the
    access network. The obtained location information can then be used for a variety
    of different protocols and purposes. For example, it can be used as input to the
    Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) or to convey location within SIP
    to other entities.</p>"
