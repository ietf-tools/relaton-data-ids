abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Internet Indirection Infrastructure (Secure-i3) is a proposal
    for a flexible and secure overlay network that, if universally deployed, would
    effectively block a number of denial-of-service problems in the Internet. The
    Host Identity Protocol (HIP), on the other hand, is a proposal for deploying opportunistic,
    IPsec based end-to-end security, allowing any hosts to communicate in a secure
    way through the Internet. In this paper, we explore various possibilities for
    combining ideas from Secure-i3 and HIP, thereby producing an architecture that
    is more efficient and secure than Secure-i3 and more flexible and denial-of-service
    resistant than HIP.</p>"
