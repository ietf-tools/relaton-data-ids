abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Mobile IP Regional Paging (MIRP), a small and
    link-layer independent extension to Mobile IP [2] with regional registrations
    [3], to support power-constrained operation in the mobile nodes and to reduce
    routing state information in the visited domain. The extension allows a mobile
    node to enter a power saving idle mode during which its location is known with
    the coarse accuracy defined by a paging area. Downlink routes to idle mobile nodes
    terminate in a paging foreign agent, which re-establishes them on demand by means
    of paging. This does not require snooping of data packets but is a natural extension
    to network-level routing. Optionally, the mobile node and the visited domain can
    agree on communication time slots used for Agent Advertisements and paging, to
    restrict link interface power-on time in the mobile node.</p>"
