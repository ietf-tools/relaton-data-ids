abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant
    variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless channel conditions,
    interference, or the end-user's movement. These variations in capacity take place
    in the order of hundreds of milliseconds and is much too fast for end-to-end congestion
    signaling by itself to convey the changes. Media applications on the other hand
    demand both high throughput and low latency, and are able to dynamically adjust
    the size and quality of a stream to match available network bandwidth. However,
    catering to such media flows over a radio link where the capacity changes rapidly
    requires the buffers to be managed carefully. This draft proposes additional information
    about the media transported in each packet to manage the buffers and optimize
    the scheduling of radio resources. The set of information proposed here includes
    relative importance of the packet, burst length and timestamp to be conveyed by
    the media application in a header extension. This can be used to provide the wireless
    network the flexibility to prioritize packets that are essential when the radio
    capacity is temporarily low, defer packets that can tolerate some additional delay,
    or even drop packets selectively in more extreme conditions. Another aspect considered
    here is the means by which the media packet information is transported. Potential
    solutions include carrying this information in Media over QUIC extension headers,
    UDP options, or in a MASQUE encapsulation between the application server and wireless
    network entity.</p>"
