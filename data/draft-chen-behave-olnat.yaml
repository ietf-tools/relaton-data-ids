abstract:
- content: "<p>In NAT64 scenaires,sigle-point failure is a critical issue to restrict
    large-scale deployment. In order to overcome this hurdle, this memo proposed a
    optimal load-balance mechanism for NAT64. Through the new-defined evaluation metrics,
    several extended ICMP messages combining with anycast are performed to achieve
    optimal NAT64 selection. Meanwihle, the synchroniztion process of IP address mapping
    information is also designed to guarantee the service continuity.</p>"
