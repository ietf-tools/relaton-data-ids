abstract:
- content: "<p>AS_Path prepending provides a tool to manipulate the BGP AS_Path attribute
    through prepending multiple entries of an AS. AS_Path prepend is used to deprioritize
    a route or alternate path. By prepending the local ASN multiple times, ASes can
    make advertised AS paths appear artificially longer. Excessive AS_Path prepending
    has caused routing issues in the internet. This document provides guidance,to
    the internet community, with how best to utilize AS_Path prepend in order to avoid
    negatively affecting the internet.</p>"
