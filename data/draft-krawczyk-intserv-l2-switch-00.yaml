abstract:
- content: "<p>The presence of Layer-2 (L2) frame switching devices, such as ethernet
    and token-ring switches, as well as Frame Relay [FR1990], creates problems in
    delivering the end-to-end behavior as defined by the service models being developed
    by the Integrated Services Working Group [Guar95] [CL95] [Pred95] [CD95]. Resource
    reservation protocols (RSVP [RSVP96], ST2 [RFC1190], and ST2+ [RFC1819]) are used
    to signal the required Quality of Service (QoS) to the router nodes along the
    paths (or trees in the multicast case) from sender(s) to receiver(s). The hosts
    and routers are required to act as proxies for their attached media and, consequently,
    any L2 devices attached to that media. Unfortunately, most of these L2 devices
    do not have the ability to participate in the activities required to achieve the
    new service models.</p>"
