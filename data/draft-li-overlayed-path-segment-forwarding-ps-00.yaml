abstract:
- content: "<p>Various overlays are used in networks including WAN, enterprise campus
    and others. End to end path are divided into multiple segments some of which are
    overlay encapsulated to achieve better path selection, lower latency and so on.
    Traditional end-to-end transport layer is not very responding to microburst and
    non-congestive packet loss caused by the different characteristics of the path
    segments. With the potential transport enhancement for the existing or purposely
    created overlayed path segment, end to end throughput can be improved. This document
    illustrates the problems in some use cases and tries to inspire more about whether
    and how to solve them by introducing a reliable, efficient and non-intrusive transport
    forwarding over the overlayed path segment(s).</p>"
