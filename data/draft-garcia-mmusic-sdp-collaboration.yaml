abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is typically used in conjunction
    with the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for establishing multimedia sessions
    on the Internet. Typically these sessions include audio, video or messaging streams.
    Rich collaboration applications can complete these multimedia sessions, including
    view sharing with remote manipulation, co-web browsing, and file transfer.This
    document discusses rich collaboration between two endpoints and provides conventions
    and extension to SDP to enable these applications.</p>"
