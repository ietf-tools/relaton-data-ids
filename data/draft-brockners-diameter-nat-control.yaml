abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for
    the Diameter NAT Control Application (DNCA), allowing for per- endpoint control
    of large scale NAT devices, which are put in place to cope with IPv4-address space
    completion. The Diameter NAT Control Application allows external devices to configure
    and manage a Large Scale NAT (LSN) device - expanding the existing Diameter-based
    AAA and policy control capabilities with a NAT control component. These external
    devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server
    (NAS), or can be more centralized control plane devices such as AAA-servers. DNCA
    establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or
    server, and a large scale NAT device. This includes, for example, the control
    of the total number of NAT-bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific NAT-binding
    for a particular endpoint. In addition, it allows large scale NAT devices to provide
    information relevant to accounting purposes.</p>"
