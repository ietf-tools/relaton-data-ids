abstract:
- content: "<p>E.164 numbers are often used for fax addresses. Internet fax provides
    store-and-forward (T.37) and real-time (T.38) modes. Subscribers could use ENUM
    to store Internet fax preferences in DNS under their fax numbers. Network devices
    could then query DNS to retrieve that information. An example is subscriber preferences
    for receiving faxes via Internet mail or SIP delivery. Further work on ENUM for
    Internet Fax is indicated, one example being H.323 delivery. Policy aspects are
    out of scope of this draft. This document is not associated with any working group.
    Comments may be sent to the author.</p>"
