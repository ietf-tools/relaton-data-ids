abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Providers will apply their use case when conducting IPv6 transition
    and determine helpful solutions with the assistance of the IPv6 transition guideline
    document. More than one solution is possible, and decisions must be made from
    not only the technical point of view, but also from the economic point of view.
    This document describes the conclusions reached by one operator based on their
    considerations and their plans for IPv6 transition so as to assist others who
    may have similar circumstances.</p>"
