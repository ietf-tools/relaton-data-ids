abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to introduce the challenges to overcome when
    Network Management (NM) problems may require to couple with Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) solutions. On the one hand, there are many difficult problems in NM that
    to this date have no good solutions, or where any solutions come with significant
    limitations and constraints. Artificial Intelligence may help produce novel solutions
    to those problems. On the other hand, for several reasons (computational costs
    of AI solutions, privacy of data), distribution of AI tasks became primordial.
    It is thus also expected that network are operated efficiently to support those
    tasks. To identify the right set of challenges, the document defines a method
    based on the evolution and nature of NM problems. This will be done in parallel
    with advances and the nature of existing solutions in AI in order to highlight
    where AI and NM have been already coupled together or could benefit from a higher
    integration. So, the method aims at evaluating the gap between NM problems and
    AI solutions. Challenges are derived accordingly, assuming solving these challenges
    will help to reduce the gap between NM and AI.</p>"
