abstract:
- content: "<p>F.IFax, defines the service requirement for both real-time and store
    and forward facsimile over the Internet. For store and forward facsimile this
    Recommendation defines addressing, MIME encapsulation of document components and
    data formats for those components.. Store and forward facsimile uses Internet
    mail standard protocols for posting, relaying and delivery of store and forward
    facsimile document. It requires no changes to Internet standards or to ITU Facsimile
    Recommendations. Such an approach leads to a system that can be used universally
    without changes to Internet servers or other intermediate systems between the
    sender and the recipient and which permits interworking between facsimile store
    and forward users and users of general Internet mail.</p>"
