abstract:
- content: "<p>BikINI is designed to allow multiple client computers to access a mail
    message store on a central server. It operates over any reliable datastream protocol,
    but is commonly used over TCP. BikINI is designed to require minimal message parsing
    by the server, to be 8-bit clean for mail message content, and to be a lighter-weight
    and easier-to-implement than other remote message access protocols.</p>"
