abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the TLS Security Policy extension is to prevent downgrade
    attacks that are not otherwise prevented by the TLS protocol. In particular, the
    TLS Security Policy extension may be used to mandate support for revocation checking
    features in the TLS protocol such as OCSP stapling. Informing clients that an
    OCSP status response will always be stapled permits an immediate failure in the
    case that the response is not stapled. This in turn prevents a denial of service
    attack that might otherwise be possible.</p>"
