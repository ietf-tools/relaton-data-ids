abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the states which need to be added to the I-D
    tracker to make it possible for IAB and IRTF document shepherds (whoever the IAB
    and IRTF designate, e.g. the IAB Chair, RG Chairs) to update the I-D tracker during
    document shepherding. It is a companion document of draft-proto-wgchair-tracker-ext
    which describes additional requirements for the chairs to use the I-D tracker
    for managing WG documents from their earliest stages.</p>"
