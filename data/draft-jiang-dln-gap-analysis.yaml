- content: "<p>Deterministic latency network (DLN) is needed to provide guaranteed
    deterministic latency for use cases such as Cloud VR/Gaming and etc, especially
    for latency-critical traffic. This document analyzes the gaps in the existing
    IETF work on fulfilling the control plane and measurement needs of DLN.</p>"
