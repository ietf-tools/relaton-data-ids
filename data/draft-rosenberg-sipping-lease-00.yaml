abstract:
- content: "<p>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
    a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used by anyone
    on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance. An example of such
    an application is call transfer, based on the REFER method. To date, a variety
    of techniques have been proposed for the contruction of such URI. All of them
    have fatal drawbacks. This document proposes that the problem is actually one
    of URI leasing - a feature whereby a UA can dynamically request the creation of
    an address-of-record (AOR) within a domain. Requirements for a URI leasing mechanism
    are outlined.</p>"
