abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the usage of BGP-LS-SPF protocol in multi-
    segment SD-WAN scenarios. It allows SD-WAN tunnels to be published as logical
    links, which can cross the internet, MPLS networks, and various operator network.
    The BGP-LS-SPF protocol can construct an overlay network topology for logical
    links and physical links across these heterogeneous networks, and calculate the
    reachability routes of overlay network nodes based on this topology.</p>"
