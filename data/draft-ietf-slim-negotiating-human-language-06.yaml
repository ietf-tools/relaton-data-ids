abstract:
- content: <p>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences
    regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. When establishing interactive
    communication ("calls") there needs to be a way to negotiate (communicate and
    match) the caller's language and media needs with the capabilities of the called
    party. This is especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be
    handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user, or a translator
    or relay operator can be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies
    to non-emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling a company call center).
    This document describes the need and a solution using new SDP stream attributes.</p>
