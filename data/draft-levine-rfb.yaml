abstract:
- content: <p>RFB ("remote framebuffer") is a simple protocol for remote access to
    graphical user interfaces that allows a client to view and control a window system
    on another computer. Because it works at the framebuffer level, RFB is applicable
    to all windowing systems and applications. This document describes the protocol
    used to communicate between an RFB client and RFB server. RFB is the protocol
    used in VNC. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>
