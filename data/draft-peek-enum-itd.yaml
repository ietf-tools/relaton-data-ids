abstract:
- content: "<p>A holistic directory system is described which translates a standard
    E.164 telephone number into the Internet address information required to support
    IP-enabled communications applications such as real-time voice, voice-messaging,
    fax or unified-messaging. The proposed system utilizes two logical control tiers
    to implement the translation. The first logical control tier is patterned after
    a Top Level Domain (TLD) of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). This first-tier
    provides a mechanism for locating the appropriate directory within the second
    logical tier of the Internet-Telephony directory system where authoritative Internet
    address information is stored for a given E.164 number. This first-tier is expected
    to conform to the regulatory and operational standards defined by the Internet
    Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) for the operation
    of top-level domains. The second logical control tier provides a mechanism for
    accessing and managing authoritative Internet address information associated with
    an E.164 number. This tier consists of widely distributed DNS servers controlled
    by service providers, and corporate network operators. Distributed ownership of
    the second tier directories allows organizations to control the Internet address
    information associated with the E.164 numbers under their day-to-day control.</p>"
