abstract:
- content: "<p>It is common for Internet hosts to associate a relatively long-lived
    identifier, often called a username or owner name, to each TCP connection. The
    Identity Server announces the identifier associated with a particular TCP connection
    to the host on the other end of the connection. The Identity Server may be used
    on any host which associates a relatively long-lived identifier to each connection.</p>"
