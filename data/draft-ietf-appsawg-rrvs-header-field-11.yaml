abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) called "RRVS" to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers
    a point in time when the ownership of the target mailbox was known to the sender.
    This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership and thus prevent mail
    from being delivered to the wrong party. This document also defines a header field
    called "Require-Recipient-Valid-Since" that can be used to tunnel the request
    through servers that do not support the extension. The intended use of these facilities
    is on automatically generated messages, such as account statements or password
    change instructions, that might contain sensitive information, though it may also
    be useful in other applications.</p>
