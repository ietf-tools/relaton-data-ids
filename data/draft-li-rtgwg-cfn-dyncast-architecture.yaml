abstract:
- content: "<p>Compute First Networking (CFN) Dynamic Anycast refers to in-network
    edge computing, where a single service offered by a provider has multiple instances
    attached to multiple edge sites. In this scenario, flows are assigned and consistently
    forwarded to a specific instance through an anycast approach based on the network
    status as well as the status of the different instance. This document describes
    an architecture for the Dynamic Anycast (Dyncast) in Compute First Networking
    (CFN). It provides an overview, a description of the various components, and a
    workflow example showing how to provide a balanced multi-edge based service in
    terms of both computing and networking resources through dynamic anycast in real
    time.</p>"
