abstract:
- content: "<p>Topology Broadcast based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a link-state
    routing protocol designed for use in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) or an internet.
    TBRPF provides each node with the state of each link in the network, but does
    so much more efficiently than flooding (e.g., OSPF). TBRPF uses the concept of
    reverse-path forwarding to efficiently and reliably broadcast each link-state
    update along the minimum-hop-path tree rooted at the source of the update. The
    broadcast trees (one tree per source) are updated dynamically using the topology
    information that is received along the trees themselves, thus requiring very little
    additional overhead for maintaining the trees. This document describes TBRPF and
    discusses details for the implementation of TBRPF in IPv4-based MANETs.</p>"
