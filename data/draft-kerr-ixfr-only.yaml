abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents proposes a new QTYPE (Query pseudo RRtype) for the Domain
    Name System (DNS). IXFR-ONLY is a variant of IXFR (RFC 1995) that allows an authoritative
    server to incrementally update zone content from another (primary) server without
    falling back from IXFR to AXFR. This way, alternate peers can be contacted more
    quickly and convergence of zone content may be achieved much faster in important,
    resilient operational scenarios.</p>"
