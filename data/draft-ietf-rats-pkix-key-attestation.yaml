abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a vendor-agnostic format for attesting to the
    protection properties of a symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic key within a
    hardware cryptographic module to support applications such as providing evidence
    to a Certification Authority that a key is being protected in accordance with
    the requested certificate profile, or that HSMs can perform key import and maintain
    the private key protection properties in a robust way even when migrating keys
    across HSM vendors. This specification includes a format for requesting a key
    attestation containing certain attributes. This specification is called "PKIX
    Attestation" because it is designed to be easy to implement on top of a code base
    that already supports X.509 and PKCS#11 data models.</p>
