abstract:
- content: <p>This memo documents an optional type of Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
    area that is somewhat humorously referred to as a "not-so-stubby" area (or NSSA).
    NSSAs are similar to the existing OSPF stub area configuration option but have
    the additional capability of importing AS external routes in a limited fashion.
    The OSPF NSSA Option was originally defined in RFC 1587. The functional differences
    between this memo and RFC 1587 are explained in Appendix F. All differences, while
    expanding capability, are backward-compatible in nature. Implementations of this
    memo and of RFC 1587 will interoperate. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
