abstract:
- content: <p>Dyncast support in a network provides a client with a fresh optimal
    path to a service provider instance, where optimality includes both path and service
    provider characteristics. As a service invocation usually takes more than one
    packet, dyncast needs to provide instance affinity for each service invocation.
    Naive implementations of instance affinity require per-application, per service-invocation
    state in the network. The present short document defines a way to provide instance
    affinity that does not require, but also does not rule out per-application state.
    It also discusses how the information that an application needs to operate this
    mechanism can be provided via the discovery mechanisms offered by a CoRE (Constrained
    RESTful Environments) server, either in "/.well-known/core" or via the CoRE resource
    directory.</p>
