abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes the COSE encoding of proofs for post-
    order traversal binary Merkle trees, also known as history trees and Merkle mountain
    ranges. Proving and verifying are defined in terms of the cryptographic asynchronous
    accumulator described by ReyzinYakoubov (https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/718.pdf).
    The technical advantages of post-order traversal binary Merkle trees are discussed
    in CrosbyWallachStorage (https://static.usenix.org/event/sec09/tech/full_papers/crosby.pdf)
    and PostOrderTlog (https://research.swtch.com/tlog#appendix_a).</p>"
