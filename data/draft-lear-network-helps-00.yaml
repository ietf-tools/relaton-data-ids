abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the Edward Snowden's release of secret information, some in the
    IETF have taken an approach that the network is such a useful tool that it is
    also an enemy. With several high visibility attacks that have been based on low
    end systems (Things), it is now clear that not only is the network not the enemy.
    When the network has at least some information about a device, we get a second
    chance to limit attacks against the device and, in some cases, a third chance
    to limit attacks from the device. This memo discusses ways in which network protection
    assists in protection of devices, and some caveats around that protection, and
    suggests considerations implementers and protocol developers should consider as
    connectivity continues to expand to new applications.</p>"
