abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the framework and the operational procedure
    for deterministic networks with work conserving packet schedulers that guarantees
    end-to-end latency bounds to flows. Schedulers in core nodes of the network do
    not need to maintain flow states. Instead, the entrance node of a flow marks an
    ideal service completion time, called Finish Time (FT), of a packet in the packet
    header. The subsequent core nodes update FT by adding a delay factor, which is
    a function of the flow and upstream nodes. The packets in the queue are served
    in the ascending order of the FT. This technique is called fair queuing. The result
    is that flows are isolated from each other almost perfectly. The latency bound
    of a flow depends only on the flow's intrinsic parameters, except the maximum
    packet length among other flows sharing each output link with the flow.</p>"
