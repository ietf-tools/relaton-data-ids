abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Transport for the Syslog Protocol, that uses
    the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol. The DTLS protocol provides
    authentication and privacy services for SYSLOG applications. This document describes
    how using DTLS to transport SYSLOG messages makes this protection possible in
    an interoperable way. This transport is designed to meet the security and operational
    needs of network administrators, operate in environments where a datagram transport
    is preferred, and integrates well into existing public keying infrastructures.</p>"
