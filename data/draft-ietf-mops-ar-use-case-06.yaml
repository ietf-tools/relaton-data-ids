abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the issues involved in the use of Edge Computing
    resources to operationalize media use cases that involve Extended Reality (XR)
    applications. In particular, we discuss those applications that run on devices
    having different form factors and need Edge computing resources to mitigate the
    effect of problems such as a need to support interactive communication requiring
    low latency, limited battery power, and heat dissipation from those devices. The
    intended audience for this document are network operators who are interested in
    providing edge computing resources to operationalize the requirements of such
    applications. We discuss the expected behavior of XR applications which can be
    used to manage the traffic. In addition, we discuss the service requirements of
    XR applications to be able to run on the network.</p>"
