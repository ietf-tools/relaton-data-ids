abstract:
- content: "<p>The contents of this Internet Draft is a reprint of the body of the
    architecture document (DTS 02003 v0.10.8) of the TIPHON project. This document
    describes a functional architecture for the purposes of defining a voice over
    IP architecture that can interwork with the existing Switched Circuit Networks
    (SCN). The full document is publicly available and can be found at http://docbox.etsi.org/Tech-Org/TIPHON/Document/tiphon/07-
    drafts/wg2/DTS02003/ the current version is 0.10.8. Later versions will appear
    in the same directory. This full document describes protocol independent information
    flows and state diagrams on all the reference points. The next step in the TIPHON
    process will be the mapping of the reference points as defined in this document
    to existing standards. Since TIPHON does not intend to duplicate work so the project
    would appreciate assistance from IETF experts in the mapping of its information
    flows to the appropriate IETF protocols. Candidate protocols for the implementation
    of this architecture are SIP, MEGACOp and possibly others.</p>"
