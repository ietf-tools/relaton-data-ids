abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/IP using the Robust
    Header Compression Formal Notation. The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is
    designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around
    an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks
    by adding additional ROHC profiles. This draft describes a modification of previously
    published RTP profiles for ROHC to conform to ROHC-FN [2] and Prolog.</p>"
