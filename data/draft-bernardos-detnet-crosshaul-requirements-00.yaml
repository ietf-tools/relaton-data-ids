abstract:
- content: "<p>Future 5G networks will not make a clear distinction between fronthaul
    and backhaul transport networks, because varying portions of radio access network
    functionality might be moved toward the network as required for cost reduction
    and performance increase. This will pose additional challenges on the transport
    network, driving for a new design of integrated fronthaul and backhaul, usually
    referred to as crosshaul. This document present the crosshaul architecture framework
    being developed by the EU 5G-Crosshaul project, as well as identifies several
    key requirements for the transport network, with the goal of fostering discussion
    at the DETNET WG.</p>"
