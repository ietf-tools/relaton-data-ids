abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes TCP-DCR, a simple modification to the TCP congestion
    control algorithm to make it more robust to non-congestion events. In the absence
    of explicit notification from the network, the TCP congestion control algorithm
    treats the receipt of three duplicate acknowledgements as an indication of congestion
    in the network. This is not always correct, notably so in wireless networks with
    channel errors or networks prone to excessive packet reordering, resulting in
    degraded performance. TCP-DCR aims to remedy this by delaying the congestion response
    of TCP for a short interval of time tau, thereby creating room to handle any non-congestion
    events that may have occurred. If at the end of the delay tau, the event is not
    handled, then it is treated as a congestion loss. The modifications themselves
    do not handle the non-congestion event, but rather rely on some underlying mechanism
    to do this. This document discusses the implications of delaying congestion response
    on the fairness, TCP- compatibility and network dynamics, and the benefits to
    be gained by applying the TCP-DCR modifications to TCP.</p>"
