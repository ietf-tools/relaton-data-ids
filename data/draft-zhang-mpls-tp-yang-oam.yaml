abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP), specified
    in RFC 5921, is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic
    Engineering (MPLS-TE) and pseudowire (PW) data- plane architectures. A comprehensive
    set of Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) procedures that fulfill
    the MPLS-TP OAM requirements for fault, performance, and protection- switching
    management had been defined. YANG, defined in RFC 6020 and RFC 7950, is a data
    model definition language that was introduced to define the content of a conceptual
    data stores that allows networked devices to be managed using NETCONF, as specified
    in RFC 6241. This document presents the YANG Data model for MPLS-TP OAM, including
    the basic functions of Fault Management and Performance Monitoring.</p>"
