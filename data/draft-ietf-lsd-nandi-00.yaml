abstract:
- content: "<p>There are existing communities of LDAP, X.500 and Whois++ servers on
    the Internet. An LDAPv3 server can be a part of one of more of these communities.
    LDAP directory services would benefit from reduced naming conflicts and increased
    ability to locate servers and information both within LDAP islands and between
    LDAP and other communities. This document recommends guidelines for naming and
    interconnection of LDAP servers to enable the existence of communities of a loosely
    coupled LDAP-based directory service that can leverage the X.500 knowledge model
    and the existing infrastructure of names from the Domain Name System (DNS). This
    will facilitate the establishment of a global naming plan and the interconnection
    of a global directory.</p>"
