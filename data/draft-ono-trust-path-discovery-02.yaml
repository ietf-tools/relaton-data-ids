abstract:
- content: "<p>Chained or transitive trust can be used to determine whether incoming
    communication is likely to be desirable or not. We can build a chained trust relationship
    by introducing friends to our friends, for example. We propose mechanisms for
    discovering trust paths and binary responsive trustworthiness. The trust paths
    are based on a chain of trust relationships between users, a user and a domain,
    and domains. We apply this model to establishing relatively low-value trust suitable
    for deciding whether to accept communication requests such as emails, calls, or
    instant messages from strangers.</p>"
