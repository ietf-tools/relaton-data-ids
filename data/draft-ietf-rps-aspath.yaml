abstract:
- content: "<p>Ripe-181 [Bates et al., 1994] is a language to specify routing policy
    constraints for inter-domain routing in the Internet. Ripe-181 allows the specification
    of both import policy constraints (by specifying as-in and interas-in attributes)
    and export policy constraints (by specifying as-out and interas-out attributes).
    There are limitations in the types of preference and access control policies that
    can be described by RIPE-181 and the limitations became evident when several enterprises
    tried to use RIPE-181 to describe their routing policies. One such limitation
    is the lack of ability to specify autonomous-system path expressions, henceforth
    referred to as AS path expressions, in the policy attributes (i.e. as-in, interas-in,
    as-out and interas-out attributes). This document extends Ripe-181 to enable the
    specification of AS path expressions in the aut-num objects. It is assumed that
    the reader is familiar with Ripe-181.</p>"
