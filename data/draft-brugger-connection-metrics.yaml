abstract:
- content: "<p>Numerous metrics, or features, have been used to describe TCP connections.
    These features are frequently of interest to the network intrusion detection community,
    and occasionally the network engineering community. While researchers may understand
    these terms when used by others, there are no formal definitions of these terms
    such that two researchers looking at the same connection will necessarily calculate
    the same values for all the metrics. This paper will propose a potential set of
    connection metrics with formal definitions of each.</p>"
