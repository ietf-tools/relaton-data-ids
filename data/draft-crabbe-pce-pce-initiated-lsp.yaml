abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The extensions described
    in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provide stateful control of Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP) via PCEP, for
    a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs
    to the PCE. This document describes the creation and deletion of PCE- initiated
    LSPs under the stateful PCE model.</p>"
