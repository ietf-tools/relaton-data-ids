abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been substantial work within the IETF to define Internet
    Fax services based on an SMTP based store and forward model. This transmission
    model has imposed some limitations of the quality and type of content transmitted.
    A secondary issue with email based Internet fax is the inherent difficulty of
    ascertaining the capabilities of a recipient in advance of sending.</p>"
