abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the current specification of the Application Programming
    Interface used to access the services provided by the BBN implementation of the
    ST-II Protocol (RFC 1190). It is being circulated as a basis for discussion of
    a generic API. A generic API will allow application developers to implement applications
    capable of running on any ST-II implementation that conforms to the API. Comments
    and suggestions for the generic API are solicited from the community by the CIP
    Working Group. Some comments that have already been received are included in the
    Appendix.</p>"
