abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Mobile IPv6 and NEMO specifications support IPv6 only.
    This specification extends those standards to allow the registration of IPv4 addresses
    and prefixes, respectively, and the transport of both IPv4 and IPv6 packets over
    the tunnel to the HA. This specification also allows the Mobile Node to roam over
    both IPv6 and IPv4, including the case where Network Address Translation is present
    on the path between the mobile node and its home agent.</p>"
