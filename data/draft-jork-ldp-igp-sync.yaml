abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks depending on edge-to-edge establishment of MPLS forwarding
    paths via LDP, blackholing of traffic can occur in situations where the IGP is
    operational on a link and thus the link is used for IP forwarding but LDP is not
    operational on that link for whatever reason. This document describes a mechanism
    to avoid traffic loss due to this condition without introducing any protocol changes.</p>"
