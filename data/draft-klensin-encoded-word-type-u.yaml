abstract:
- content: <p>The "Encoded Word" conventions have been used extensively in email headers
    and elsewhere to permit the encoding of non-ASCII characters where only ASCII
    ones are normally permitted. The existing specification defines only two kinds
    of encoding, one of which cannot be understood easily by people and the other
    of which has been widely discredited. This document specifies a third encoding
    that is easily accessible by users and much more closely tied to contemporary
    practices. The current version of the proposal is intended for possible discussion
    in the EAI, IRI, and PRECIS WGs to see if it sheds light on other issues being
    discussed in those WGs. It is not, at this point, proposed for adoption.</p>
