abstract:
- content: "<p>Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) can be
    used to protect CoAP messages end-to-end between two endpoints at the application
    layer, also in the presence of intermediaries such as proxies. This document defines
    how to use OSCORE for protecting CoAP messages also between an origin application
    endpoint and an intermediary, or between two intermediaries. Also, it defines
    how to secure a CoAP message by applying multiple, nested OSCORE protections,
    e.g., both end-to-end between origin application endpoints, as well as between
    an application endpoint and an intermediary or between two intermediaries. Thus,
    this document updates RFC 8613. The same approach can be seamlessly used with
    Group OSCORE, for protecting CoAP messages when group communication with intermediaries
    is used.</p>"
