abstract:
- content: "<p>The transition from a pure IPv4 network to a network where IPv4 and
    IPv6 co-exist brings a number of extra security considerations that need to be
    taken into account when deploying IPv6 and operating the dual-protocol network
    and the associated transition mechanisms. This document attempts to give an overview
    of the various issues grouped into three categories: Issues due to the IPv6 protocol
    itself, due to transition mechanisms, and due to the way in which IPv6 is being
    deployed.</p>"
