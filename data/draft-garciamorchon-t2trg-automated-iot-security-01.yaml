abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard
    Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.
    The security needs are well-recognized but the design space of IoT applications
    and systems is complex and exposed to multiple types of threats. In particular,
    threats keep evolving at a fast pace while many IoT systems are rarely updated
    and still remain operational for decades. This document describes a comprehensive
    agile security framework to integrate existing security processes such as risk
    assessment or vulnerability assessment in the lifecycle of a smart object in an
    IoT application. The core of our agile security approach relies on two protocols:
    the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) and the Protocol for
    Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA). PASC is executed during the onboarding
    phase of a smart object in an IoT system and is in charge of automatically performing
    a risk assessment and assigning a security configuration - applicable to the device
    or the system - to defeat the identified risks. The assigned security configuration
    fits the specific environment and threat model of the application in which the
    device has been deployed. PAVA is executed during the operation of the IoT object
    and ensures that vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system are discovered
    in a proactive way. These two protocols can benefit users, manufactures and operators
    by automating IoT security.</p>"
