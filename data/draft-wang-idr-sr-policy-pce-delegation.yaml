abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates
    the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR policy is a set of
    candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment lists with necessary path
    attributes. The headend of an SR Policy may learn multiple candidate paths for
    an SR Policy. Candidate paths may be learned via a number of different mechanisms,
    e.g., CLI, NetConf, PCEP, or BGP. The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides
    path computation functions in support of traffic engineering in Multi Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Currently, when
    a controller uses BGP to deploy an SR Policy, there is no way to encode PCE delegation
    related options. The only way to import a PCE delegation is through local configuration
    management, e.g., Netconf, CLI or gRPC. This document defines extensions to BGP
    to distribute PCE delegation information within an SR policy.</p>"
