abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies automated description resolution mechanism for
    Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the "tag" scheme. Tag URIs (also known
    as "tags") are designed to be non-dereferenceable, however it may be useful for
    a tag minter to optinally provide a public easily accessible description of the
    entity associated with a tag.</p>
