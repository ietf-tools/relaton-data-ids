abstract:
- content: "<p>IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) is exploring a new routing and addressing
    architecture to address the issues with the current Internet, e.g., mobility,
    multi-homing, traffic engineering, and especially the routing scalability issue.
    This document describes a new identifier (ID)/locator split based routing and
    addressing architecture, called Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet
    (RANGI), in an attempt to deal with the above problems.</p>"
