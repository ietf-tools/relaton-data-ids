abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a formal description of the interactions between
    two SIP User Agents establishing a multimedia session, describing the negotiation
    of the two parties as an exchange of signals between two instances of networks
    of Finite State Machines (FSMs). The goal is to provide a common reference model
    for both SIP extensions and User Agent implementations: two flows that can be
    implemented by using the external interface of the FSMs are guaranteed not to
    conflict to each other. On the other hand a reference model for User Agents is
    expected to improve interoperability between different implementations and help
    implementors to model their software in a way that makes SIP extensions conforming
    to this document easier to implement.</p>"
