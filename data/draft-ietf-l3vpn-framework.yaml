abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for Layer 3 Provider-Provisioned
    Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). This framework is intended to aid in the standardization
    of protocols and mechanisms for support of layer 3 PPVPNs. It is the intent of
    this document to produce a coherent description of the significant technical issues
    that are important in the design of layer 3 PPVPN solutions. Selection of specific
    approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs, and detailed protocol
    specification, are outside of the scope of this framework document. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
