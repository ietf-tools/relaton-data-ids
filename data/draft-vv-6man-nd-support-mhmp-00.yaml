abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-home Multi-prefix IPv6 environment is the norm for businesses
    that need to have uplink resiliency. For any considered destination, the MHMP
    challenge may be split into 3 sub-challenges (important to solve in the below
    order): 1) the host should choose the proper source address for the packet, 2)
    the host should choose the best default router as the next-hop, 3) site topology
    may be complicated and may need the source routing through the site. This draft
    is concerned with the solution for the first two problems that need improvement
    for the ND (RFC 4861) SLAAC (RFC 4862) and Default Address Selection (RFC 6724).
    The last problem is considered as properly discussed by Multihoming in Enterprise
    (RFC 8678).</p>"
