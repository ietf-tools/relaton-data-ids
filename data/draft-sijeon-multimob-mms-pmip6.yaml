abstract:
- content: "<p>To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, [I-D.ietf-multimob- pmipv6-base-solution]
    has been submitted as a base solution that locates MR on the LMA and uses the
    PMIPv6 tunnel between LMA and MAG for MLD messages. In this draft, we present
    the direct routing solution that uses the direct connection between MAG and MR,
    and locates the MLD forwarding proxy function on MAGs. The proposed direct routing
    solution is compared with the base deployment solution.</p>"
