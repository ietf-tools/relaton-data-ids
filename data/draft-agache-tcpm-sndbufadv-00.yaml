abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators have difficulty in understanding the end-to-end performance
    of TCP connections through their networks. By observing packets at different vantage
    points on their path and maintaining per flow state, network operators can detect
    packet losses, retransmission and estimate RTTs, among other metrics. A key information
    needed by networks is whether a connection is limited by the network or by the
    application. This information is very difficult to accurately infer by passive
    measurements. We propose to advertise sendbuffer occupancy in TCP: each segment
    will carry the amount of backlogged data present in the sender's buffer. This
    information allows networks to discern between application-limited, network-limited
    and flow-control limited flows, creating new avenues of network optimization.</p>"
