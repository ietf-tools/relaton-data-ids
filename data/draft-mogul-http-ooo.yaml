abstract:
- content: "<p>The introduction of persistent connections and pipelining into HTTP
    has resulted in potential performance benefits, but has also exposed the problem
    of head-of-line blocking. A simple, compatible, and optional extension to HTTP
    to allow a server to issue responses out of order could significantly reduce HOL
    blocking. In this extension, clients add short ID fields to their requests, and
    servers echo these IDs back in their responses. This extension is defined as a
    hop-by-hop rather than end-to-end mechanism, so it avoids much of the complexity
    of the end-to-end approach.</p>"
