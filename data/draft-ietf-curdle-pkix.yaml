abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding formats
    for elliptic curve constructs using the curve25519 and curve448 curves. The signature
    algorithms covered are Ed25519 and Ed448. The key agreement algorithms covered
    are X25519 and X448. The encoding for public key, private key, and Edwards-curve
    Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) structures is provided.</p>"
