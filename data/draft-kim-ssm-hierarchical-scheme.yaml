abstract:
- content: "<p>Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) has been proposed to overcome the deployment
    limitations of PIM-SM such as handling of well-known sources, access control,
    and address allocation. However, current SSM work seems to neglect some other
    deployment issues such as the construction of the shortest path tree especially
    in inter-domain. The routing table entries for constructing SSM tree proportionally
    increase depending on the number of sources and groups.</p>"
