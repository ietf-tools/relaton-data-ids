abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an algorithm for challenge-response authentication
    developed by the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH). The specified mechanisms
    leverage the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm and offer one-way and
    mutual authentication, and electronic signature capabilities. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
