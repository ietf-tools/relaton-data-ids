abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail defines the From: field to indicate the author of the
    message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially handled the
    message, on the author's behalf. The Sender: field is optional, if it has the
    same information as the From: field. This was not a problem, until development
    of stringent protections on use of the From: field. It has prompted Mediators,
    such as mailing lists, to modify the From: field, to circumvent mail rejection
    caused by those protections. In effect, the From: field has become dominated by
    its role as a handling identifier. The current specification augments the altered
    use of the From: field, by specifying the Author: field, which ensures identification
    of the original author of the message and is not subject to modification by Mediators.</p>"
