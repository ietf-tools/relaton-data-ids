abstract:
- content: "<p>Configuration errors on Provider Edge (PE) routers in Layer-3 VPN networks
    based on [RFC2547] can lead to security breaches of the connected VPNs. For example,
    the PE router could be mistakenly configured such that a connected Customer Edge
    (CE) router belongs to an incorrect VPN. Here we propose a scheme that verifies
    local and remote routing information received by the PE router before it installs
    new VPN routes into the Virtual Routing &amp; Forwarding Instance (VRF). The proposed
    changes affect only the PE routers.</p>"
