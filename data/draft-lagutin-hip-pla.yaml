abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to provide Packet Level Authentication
    (PLA) functionality for the HIP protocol. PLA provides strong hop-by-hop security
    features that allow intermediate nodes to detect the hostile traffic quickly,
    and drop the traffic before it reaches the destination and can consume resources
    in the target network. Unlikely other similar solutions, PLA does not require
    excessive signaling or state in verifying nodes, and is path-independent, making
    it suitable for dynamic environments, such as ad-hoc networks.</p>"
