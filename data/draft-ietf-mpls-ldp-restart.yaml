abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism that helps to minimize the negative
    effects on MPLS traffic caused by Label Switching Router's (LSR's) control plane
    restart, specifically by the restart of its Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    component, on LSRs that are capable of preserving the MPLS forwarding component
    across the restart. The mechanism described in this document is applicable to
    all LSRs, both those with the ability to preserve forwarding state during LDP
    restart and those without (although the latter needs to implement only a subset
    of the mechanism described in this document). Supporting (a subset of) the mechanism
    described here by the LSRs that can not preserve their MPLS forwarding state across
    the restart would not reduce the negative impact on MPLS traffic caused by their
    control plane restart, but it would minimize the impact if their neighbor(s) are
    capable of preserving the forwarding state across the restart of their control
    plane and implement the mechanism described here. The mechanism makes minimalistic
    assumptions on what has to be preserved across restart - the mechanism assumes
    that only the actual MPLS forwarding state has to be preserved; the mechanism
    does not require any of the LDP-related states to be preserved across the restart.
    The procedures described in this document apply to downstream unsolicited label
    distribution. Extending these procedures to downstream on demand label distribution
    is for further study. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
