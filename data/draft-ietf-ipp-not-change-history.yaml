- content: "<p>This document contains the change history for the development of the
    IPP Notification specification. The IPP Notification specification is an extension
    to the IPP/1.0 &amp; IPP/1.1 model that allows clients to subscribe to printing
    related events. Subscriptions include 'Per-Job Submission subscriptions' and 'Per-Printer
    subscriptions'. Either subscription may specify job and/or printer events. This
    specification has been developed starting in the Fall of 1997.</p>"
