abstract:
- content: <p>E-VPN can be used as a control plane protocol for NVO3 network. In All-Active
    access scenario, loop &amp; echo forwarding prevention among multi-homed NVEs
    relies on "Split horizon" filtering mechanism. ESI MPLS label is leveraged to
    perform split horizon filtering in MPLS based EVPN network. In VXLAN or NVGRE
    encapsulation based overlay network, no MPLS is used. Therefore a new method is
    introduced in this document to achieve split horizon filtering in non-MPLS overlay
    network. Data plane of the overlay network is extended with a LAGID field. The
    function of LAGID is similar to ESI MPLS Label in [EVPN]. It is used to identify
    each Ethernet segment(ES) on each NVE.</p>
