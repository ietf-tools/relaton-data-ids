abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS)
    to support their operations. Many applications use the DNS to locate services
    for a domain; some, for example, transform identifiers other than domain names
    into formats that the DNS can process, and then fetch application data or service
    location data from the DNS. Proposals incorporating sophisticated application
    behavior using DNS as a substrate have raised questions about the role of the
    DNS as an application platform. This document explores the architectural consequences
    of using the DNS to implement certain application features, and it provides guidance
    to future application designers as to the limitations of the DNS as a substrate
    and the situations in which alternative designs should be considered.</p>"
