abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on overload and failure experience with link-state protocols,
    this draft identifies means to enable link-state protocols to: o avoid getting
    into congestion states wherever possible o respond gracefully to network overloads
    and failures o gracefully recover from massive loss of topology database information
    The proposed mechanisms include the following: o throttle setups of link adjacencies
    o reduce the rate of flooding of link-state-advertisements(LSAs) o prioritized
    treatment of Hello &amp; LSA ack packets o database backup &amp; resynchronization
    for graceful recovery from loss of topology database information.</p>"
