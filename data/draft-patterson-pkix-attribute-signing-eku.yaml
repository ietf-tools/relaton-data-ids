abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a value for the extendedKeyUsage X.509 extension
    that may be used to create a certificate that would be used to sign attribute
    assertions. This allows the differentiation of certificates used to identify a
    particular server (which would have a serverAuth EKU), from the certificate used
    by that server to sign attribute assertions, and would easily allow a policy to
    be developed for issuance of such a certificate to an identity provider.</p>"
