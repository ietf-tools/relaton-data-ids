abstract:
- content: "<p>Over time Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineered
    networks may be migrated to use Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). This will allow the
    networks to benefit from many new features that have been added to the GMPLS protocols.
    Additionally, such migration will facilitate easy interworking of packet networks
    that are controlled by IP/MPLS-TE protocols and networks that are controlled by
    GMPLS protocols. During this migration phase MPLS and GMPLS capable elements will
    have to co-exist and interwork. GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are subtly
    different from the MPLS protocols and so interworking and migration strategies
    are needed. This document describes issues associated with interworking of IP/MPLS-TE
    networks and GMPLS-based optical networks. Then it describes possible migration
    scenarios, mechanisms to compensate for the differences between MPLS and GMPLS
    protocols, and how to apply those mechanisms in order to achieve migration from
    MPLS to GMPLS.</p>"
