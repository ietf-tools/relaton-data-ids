abstract:
- content: "<p>The (Datagram) Transport Layer Security ((D)TLS) standard provides
    connection security with mutual authentication, data confidentiality and integrity,
    key generation and distribution, and security parameters negotiation. However,
    missing from the protocol is a way to multiplex several application data over
    a single (D)TLS. This document defines MTLS, an application-level protocol running
    over (D)TLS Record protocol. The MTLS design provides application multiplexing
    over a single (D)TLS session. Therefore, instead of associating a (D)TLS session
    with each application, MTLS allows several applications to protect their exchanges
    over a single (D)TLS session.</p>"
