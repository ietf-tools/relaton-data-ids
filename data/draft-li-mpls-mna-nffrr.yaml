abstract:
- content: <p>Protection switching for MPLS traffic was first introduced in "Fast
    Reroute Extensions to RSVP-TE for LSP Tunnels". Since then, Fast Reroute (FRR)
    has been successfully used in many MPLS networks to help ensure high availability
    in the face of failures. If there are multiple failures in a network, there are
    circumstances where FRR, if applied multiple times, can result in sub-optimal
    behavior, such as forwarding loops. Thus, it is useful to indicate in the forwarding
    plane that the attached traffic should not be subjected to further FRR redirection.
    This document describes a network action for identifying such traffic to be used
    in conjunction with "MPLS Network Action (MNA) Header Encodings".</p>
