abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC employs a Key Tag field in the RRSIG and DS resource records
    in order to efficiently identify the key that produced a DNSSEC signature and
    the key that should be used as a secure entry point into a delegated zone. The
    Key Tag was not intended to be a unique identifier. Key tag collisions can occur
    in practice for keys in the same zone, though they are relatively rare in normal
    operation. Colliding key tags impose additional work on a validating resolver
    because it then has to check signatures for each of the candidate set of keys
    identified by the Key Tag. Furthermore, they open up resolvers to computational
    denial of service attacks by adversaries deploying specially crafted zones with
    many intentionally colliding key tags. This document specifies updates to the
    DNSSEC protocol and the process of key generation to avoid colliding key tags.</p>"
