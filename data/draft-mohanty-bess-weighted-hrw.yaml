abstract:
- content: "<p>Rendezvous Hashing also known as Highest Random Weight (HRW) has been
    used in many load balancing applications where the central problem is how to map
    an object to as server such that the mapping is uniform and also minimally affected
    by the change in the server set. Recently, it has found use in DF election algorithms
    in the EVPN context and load balancing using DMZ. This draft deals with the problem
    of achieving load balancing with minimal disruption when the servers have different
    weights. It provides an algorithm to do so and also describes a few use-case scenarios
    where this algorithmic technique can apply.</p>"
