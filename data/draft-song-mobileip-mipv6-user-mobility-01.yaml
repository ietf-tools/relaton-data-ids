abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP can provide IP mobility. The mobile node identified by
    its Home Address can have transparent home IP routing service regardless of attaching
    point. However the need for the user mobility support has identified by wireless
    operators so as to provide IP routing service, based on the user identifier not
    based on home IP address. This document specifies the user mobility support for
    Mobile IPv6 through DNS, while providing semi-secure binding update mechanism
    for the route optimization between MN and CN.</p>"
