abstract:
- content: <p>BGP speakers learn their next hop addresse for NLRI in [RFC4271] in
    the NEXT_HOP field and in [RFC4760] in the "Network Address of Next Hop" field.
    Under certain circumstances, it might be desirable for a BGP speaker to know both
    the next hops and the next-next hops of NLRI to make optimal forwarding decisions.
    One such example is global load balancing (GLB) in a Clos network. [I-D.ietf-idr-entropy-label]
    defines the "Next Hop Dependent Capabilities Attribute" (NHC) which allows a BGP
    speaker to signal the forwarding capabilities associated with a given next hop.
    This document defines a new NHC capability, the Next-next Hop Nodes (NNHN) capability,
    which can be used to advertise the next-next hop nodes associated with a given
    next hop.</p>
