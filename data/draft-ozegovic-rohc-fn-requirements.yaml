abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes requirements expected to be achieved with profile
    formal notation system for ROHC. The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) [1] scheme
    is designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built
    around an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol
    stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles. The role of formal notation is to provide
    a simple method for ROHC profile specification. It is to be used in the phase
    of profile refinement to achieve maximal compression ratio possible, as well as
    in the phase of software implementation to provide unambiguous profile specification.</p>"
