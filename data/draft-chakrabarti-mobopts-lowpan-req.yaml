abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF LowPan working group defines IPv6 over low-power personal area
    network (IEEE 802.15.4). Lowpan architecture allows routing to take place at the
    link layer in order to save payload overhead over the IEEE 802.15.4 link and thus
    more efficient routing for low power, low data-rate networks such as sensor networks.
    This document discusses a few scenarios of mobility in LowPan network and states
    mobility requirements and goals for LowPan networks.</p>"
