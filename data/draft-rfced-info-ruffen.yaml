abstract:
- content: "<p>The Switch Broadcast Control and Delivery (SBCD) protocol is part of
    the InterSwitch Message Protocol (ISMP). ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch
    communication within distributed connection-oriented switching networks. The SBCD
    protocol is used to reduce the amount of broadcast traffic across the switch fabric
    by restricting unresolved broadcast packets to only those ports that belong to
    the same VLAN as the source.</p>"
