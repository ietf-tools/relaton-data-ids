abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call routing,
    rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is currently no standard mechanism
    by which a proxy can influence session policies such as the codecs or media types
    to be used. This document specifies a framework for SIP session policies. It defines
    two types of session policies, session-specific and session- independent policies
    and introduces a model, an overall architecture and the protocol components needed
    for session policies.</p>"
