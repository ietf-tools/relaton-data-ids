abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) can be used as provider tunnel
    for Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN). Global Table Multicast [RFC7716]
    or Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN). It is possible that not all routers
    in the provider network support BIER and there are various methods to handle BIER-incapable
    transit routers. However those methods assume the MVPN/EVPN Provider Edges (PEs)
    are BIER-capable. This document specifies a method to allow BIER- incapable routers
    to act as MVPN/EVPN PEs with BIER as the transport, by having the upstream BIER
    Forwarding Router (BFR) that is connected directly or indirectly via a tunnel
    to a BIER-incapable PE remove the BIER header and send the payload to the PE.</p>"
