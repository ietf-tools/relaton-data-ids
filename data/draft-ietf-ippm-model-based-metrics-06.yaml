abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Bulk Transport
    Performance target by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths.
    The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to key infrastructure, such
    as interconnects or even individual devices, to accurately detect if any part
    of the infrastructure will prevent any path traversing it from meeting the specified
    Target Transport Performance. The IP diagnostic tests consist of precomputed traffic
    patterns and statistical criteria for evaluating packet delivery. The traffic
    patterns are precomputed to mimic TCP or other transport protocol over a long
    path but are constructed in such a way that they are independent of the actual
    details of the subpath under test, end systems or applications. Likewise the success
    criteria depends on the packet delivery statistics of the subpath, as evaluated
    against a protocol model applied to the Target Transport Performance. The success
    criteria also does not depend on the details of the subpath, end systems or application.
    This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating most of the difficulties encountered
    by traditional bulk transport metrics. Model based metrics exhibit several important
    new properties not present in other Bulk Capacity Metrics, including the ability
    to reason about concatenated or overlapping subpaths. The results are vantage
    independent which is critical for supporting independent validation of tests results
    from multiple Measurement Points. This document does not define IP diagnostic
    tests directly, but provides a framework for designing suites of IP diagnostics
    tests that are tailored to confirming that infrastructure can meet a predetermined
    Target Transport Performance.</p>"
