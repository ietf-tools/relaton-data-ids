abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility of an IP-based node affects routing paths, and as a result,
    can have a significant effect on the protocol operation and state management.
    This document discusses the effects mobility can cause to the Next Steps in Signaling
    (NSIS) protocol suite, and shows how the NSIS protocols operate in different scenarios
    with mobility management protocols. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
