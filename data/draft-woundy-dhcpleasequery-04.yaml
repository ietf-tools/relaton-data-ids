abstract:
- content: "<p>Access concentrators that act as DHCP relay agents need to determine
    the endpoint locations of IP addresses across public broadband access networks
    such as cable, DSL, and wireless networks. Because ARP broadcasts are undesirable
    in public networks, many access concentrator implementations 'glean' location
    information from DHCP messages forwarded by its relay agent function. Unfortunately,
    the typical access concentrator loses its gleaned information when the access
    concentrator is rebooted or is replaced. This memo proposes that when gleaned
    DHCP information is not available, the access concentrator/relay agent obtains
    the location information directly from the DHCP server(s) using a new, lightweight
    DHCPLEASEQUERY message.</p>"
