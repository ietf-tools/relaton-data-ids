abstract:
- content: <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) incorporates a namespace that is comprised,
    in practice, of multiple so-called zones. Each zone is, in principal, a finite
    tree structure which can be administered autonomously, and is connected to exactly
    one parent zone and zero or more child zones. These connection points are known
    as zone cuts; a parent zone contains information that allows the servers responsible
    for the child zone to be found. The current DNS specification encodes that information
    about child zones using an "NS" resource record set in the parent zone, and a
    corresponding "NS" resource record set in the child zone. These two resource record
    sets have identical owner names, class, and resource record type but can differ
    in other respects such as the time-to-live (TTL) attribute, the resource record
    data associated with each set and the availability of cryptographic signatures.
    This property of being similar, related but potentially different has led to operational
    complexity. This document proposes a change to how zone cuts are encoded in the
    parent zone, allowing the resource records in the parent and the child zone to
    be more clearly distinguished and protected separately using cryptographic signatures.
    It is not at all clear that this is a good idea. To restate in stronger terms,
    the goal of the experiment described in this document is to determine just how
    bad an idea this is.</p>
