abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol that
    offers communication security services at the transport layer. The initial design
    of TLS was focused on the protection of applications running on top of the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). Subsequent standardization efforts lead to the publication of
    the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, which allows the re-use
    of the TLS security functionality and the payloads to be exchanged on top of the
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP). With the work on the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), as a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes
    and constrained networks, DTLS is a preferred communication security protocol.
    Smart objects are constrained in various ways (e.g., CPU, memory, power consumption)
    and these limitations may impose restrictions on the protocol stack such a device
    runs. This document only looks at the security part of that protocol stacks and
    the ability to customize TLS/DTLS. To offer input for implementers and system
    architects this document illustrates the costs and benefits of various TLS/DTLS
    features for use with smart objects and constraint node networks.</p>"
