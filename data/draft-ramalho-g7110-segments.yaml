abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes use cases for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.0 compression
    of ITU-T Recommendation G.711 payloads when deployed in transport system segments
    using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 defines a lossless
    and stateless compression for G.711 packet payloads typically used in IP networks.
    Although the use of ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 can be negotiated end-to-end, being lossless
    and stateless it can also be applied as a compression mechanism "in-the-middle"
    of an end-to-end ITU-T G.711 negotiated session. These "in-the-middle" applications
    of ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 are called "G.711.0 Compression Segments" in this document.
    This document outlines considerations and best practices (a.k.a. use cases) for
    these "G.711.0 compression segments".</p>
