abstract:
- content: "<p>Bluetooth protocol suite defines a set of security mechanisms between
    its devices. All the authentication procedure is based on the knowledge of a shared
    secret called PIN. Bluetooth suggests to use systems such as Diffie-Hellman method
    or others else to initiate the PIN between two unknown devices. This draft proposes
    a simple mechanism that help two entities already presented to an AAA infrastructure
    share the PIN and start secured Bluetooth communications with Bluetooth Security
    protocols.</p>"
