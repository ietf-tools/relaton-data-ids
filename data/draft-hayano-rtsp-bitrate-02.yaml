abstract:
- content: "<p>Typically, there is no use for providing bandwidth information from
    an RTSP 2.0 server to RTSP 2.0 clients. The bandwidth of the medias played out
    by the server is different from the available bandwidth in the network (which
    is also changing) and there is anyhow the need to perform congestion control during
    media playout. This is true for Internet deployments, or similar, but conveying
    information about bandwidth of the medias can be required in other deployments
    of RTSP 2.0. It might necessarily for RTSP 2.0 clients to obtain information about
    the by medias used bandwidth in networks that rely on bandwidth reservation initiated
    by the end host. An example is the Next Generation Network (NGN) standardized
    by ETSI TISPAN, where RTSP 2.0 clients must indicate the required bandwidth to
    the network. This memo discusses how to provide bandwidth information from RTSP
    2.0 servers to clients and how to introduce it in RTSP 2.0.</p>"
