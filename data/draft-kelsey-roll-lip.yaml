abstract:
- content: "<p>LIP is an extension of MPLS for use in Lossy and Low power Networks
    (LLN). Use of MPLS allows rapid response to local topology changes within an LLN,
    while still using full IP routing both within the LLN and for packets that cross
    into other domains. LIP has optional RIP commands for discovering and maintaining
    label switched tree routes. To support local route repair, labeled packets include
    a path metric used to detect loops in label-switched paths. Labeled messages may
    optionally include a source route or route record at the label level in order
    to allow their use without losing the advantages of label switching.</p>"
