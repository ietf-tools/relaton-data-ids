abstract:
- content: "<p>ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable routing,
    enhancing mobility and privacy in IPv6-based vehicular networks. In IPv6-based
    vehicular networks, ID/Location separation architecture is expected to offer benefits.
    This document analyzes how ID/Location separation protocols can adjust into IP
    based vehicular networks and suggests requirements for efficient ID/Location separation
    in vehicular networks.</p>"
