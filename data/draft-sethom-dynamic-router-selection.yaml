abstract:
- content: "<p>In a network topology where the host has multiple routers on its Default
    Router List, it is important to select the most suitable one according to node’s
    application requirements. This document describes an extension to router advertisement
    message [RFC 1256, RFC 2461] for dynamic router selection. This new functionality
    is implemented in routers with additional capabilities.</p>"
