abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a digest of the user network interface specification of
    NTT Communications' dual stack ADSL access service, which provide a IPv6/IPv4
    dual stack services to home users. In order to simplify user setup, these services
    have a mechanism to configure IPv6 specific parameters automatically. The memo
    focuses on two basic parameters: the prefix assigned to the user and the addresses
    of IPv6 DNS servers, and it specifies a way to deliver these parameters to Customer
    Premises Equipment (CPE) automatically. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
