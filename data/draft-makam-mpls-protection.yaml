abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) [1] integrates the label swapping
    forwarding paradigm with network layer routing. To deliver reliable service, MPLS
    requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on the
    label switched paths (LSPs). This requires that the label switched routers (LSRs)
    support failure detection, failure notification, and protection mechanisms, and
    that LSP signaling support the configuration of working and protection paths.
    With these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS protection,
    and discusses the requirements and mechanisms necessary to implement protection
    in MPLS networks.</p>"
