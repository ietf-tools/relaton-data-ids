abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a challenge of providing IPv6 multihoming sites with the basic
    benefits such as redundancy and load sharing, and at the same time, scaling the
    global IPv6 routing table. It is equally challenging to provide a solution which
    is simple enough to be operational manageable. This document proposes a simple
    solution which meets the requirements and is also operationally manageable.</p>"
