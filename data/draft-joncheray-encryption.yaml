abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of proposed modifications and extensions
    for the TCP protocol in order to support Public Key Encryption schemes. It introduces
    two new options for the TCP header as well as a minor modification of the semantic
    of bits 4 to 7, byte 12 of the TCP header. The proposal is designed to provide
    compatibility with older versions of TCP that do not incorporate those extensions.</p>"
