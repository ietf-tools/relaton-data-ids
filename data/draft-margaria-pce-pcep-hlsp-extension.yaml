abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Switched Paths (LSPs) set up in Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) or Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks can be used to form links to carry
    traffic in those networks or in other (client) networks. These LSPs can be referred
    to as Hierarchical LSPs (H-LSP). H-LSPs allow to improve the scalability of MPLS/GMPLS
    networks by creating hierarchies of TE-LSPs. Those hierarchies are an important
    state for optimal TE-Computation, therefore a stateful PCE should be able to discover
    and manage those H-LSPs. A PCE having a global view of the network, including
    Forwarding Adjacencies LSP (FA-LSP) and non FA- LSPs, can create more optimal
    hierachies and (re-)compute the TE-LSPs path to make use of the H-LSPs. In particular
    a PCE can better leverage the Private H-LSP introduced by RFC6107 without influencing
    the IGP, allowing a less disruptive use of Hierarchies. RFC6107 defined Protocol
    mechanisms to facilitate the establishment of such LSPs and to bundle traffic
    engineering (TE) links to reduce the load on routing protocols. This document
    defines PCEP extensions to learn about and control those H-LSPs.</p>"
