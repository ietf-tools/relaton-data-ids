abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines post-quantum hybrid key exchange methods based
    on classical ECDH key exchange and post-quantum key encapsulation schemes. These
    methods are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol. Note [EDNOTE:
    Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the IETF WG Mailing List or
    in the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/csosto-pk/pq-ssh/issues.]</p>"
