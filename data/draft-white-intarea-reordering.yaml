abstract:
- content: <p>Several link technology standards mandate that equipment guarantee in-order
    delivery of layer 2 frames, apparently due to a belief that this is required by
    higher layer protocols. In addition, certain link types can introduce out-of-order
    arrivals at the end of the layer 2 link, which the receiving equipment is required
    to rectify by delaying higher sequenced frames until all lower sequenced frames
    can be delivered or are deemed lost. The delaying of higher sequenced frames is
    generally done without any knowledge of the higher layer protocols in use, let
    alone any knowledge of higher layer protocol contexts (e.g. TCP connections) in
    the case that the layer 2 link is carrying a multiplex of such contexts. It could,
    for example, be the case that all of the higher sequenced frames being delayed
    are carrying packets for different layer 4 contexts than a single lower- sequenced
    frame that triggered the delay. The result is that this "re-sequencing" operation
    can introduce delays that result in degradation of performance rather than improving
    it. Moreover, modern, performant TCP and QUIC implementations support features
    that significantly improve their tolerance to out-of-order delivery. This draft
    is intended to promote an analysis and discussion of the sensitivity of modern
    IETF protocols to out-of-order delivery, and to potentially develop new information
    for layer 2 technology standards regarding the need to assure in-order delivery
    to support IETF protocols.</p>
