abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies the basic information to be handled by Service
    Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) when considering the deployment
    of value-added IP service offerings over the Internet. Such IP service offerings
    can be provided together with a given quality of service (QoS), which is expected
    to be defined in such SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services
    are likely to be provided over the whole Internet, their corresponding QoS will
    be based upon a set of technical parameters that both customers and services providers
    will have to agree upon. From this perspective, this draft aims at listing (and
    promoting a standard formalism for) a set of basic parameters which will actually
    compose the elementary contents of a SLS.</p>"
