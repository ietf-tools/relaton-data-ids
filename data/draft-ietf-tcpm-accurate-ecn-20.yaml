abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network
    nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate incipient congestion
    to the end-points. Receivers with an ECN- capable transport protocol feed back
    this information to the sender. ECN was originally specified for TCP in such a
    way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT).
    Recent new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center TCP (DCTCP)
    or Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate ECN feedback
    information whenever more than one marking is received in one RTT. This document
    updates the original ECN specification to specify a scheme to provide more than
    one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header. Given TCP header space is scarce,
    it allocates a reserved header bit previously assigned to the ECN- Nonce. It also
    overloads the two existing ECN flags in the TCP header. The resulting extra space
    is exploited to feed back the IP- ECN field received during the 3-way handshake
    as well. Supplementary feedback information can optionally be provided in a new
    TCP option, which is never used on the TCP SYN. The document also specifies the
    treatment of this updated TCP wire protocol by middleboxes.</p>"
