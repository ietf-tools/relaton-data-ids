abstract:
- content: <p>Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed, primary
    use but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as
    "white space". White space devices can make use of this spectrum; however, they
    must first determine which spectrum is unused or unoccupied by a primary user
    at their current location. A white space database can be consulted that holds
    information about primary users of the spectrum and that returns information about
    white space. In this document we introduce a Protocol for Access to WhiteSpace
    database (PAWS) which is for use between a white space device and a white space
    database. We give a framework for PAWS, a protocol stack that defines the interface
    between the white space device and the white space database, the parameters of
    the protocol, an XML schema that can encode the parameters, and example messages.
    The realization of the database and the calculation of protected contour are not
    considered in this framework draft.</p>
