abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the 'none' public key encryption algorithm
    for the Secure Shell protocol, which is useful for rekeying when the server has
    no keys to support for non-GSSAPI key exchange and when GSSAPI credentials are
    expired, or for use in embedded systems where there is a desire to minimize the
    overhead of rekeying to prevent sequence number rollover.</p>"
