abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to Resource Reservation Protocol
    - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks. The solution relies on RSVP-TE without requiring a multicast
    routing protocol in the Service Provider core. Protocol elements and procedures
    for this solution are described. There can be various applications for P2MP TE
    LSPs such as IP multicast. Specification of how such applications will use a P2MP
    TE LSP is outside the scope of this document.</p>"
