abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies how flow mobility can be realized for a mobile
    node with multiple network interfaces, for which the network provides mobility
    support by means of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). By introducing a "Primary Prefix",
    the mobile node is able to maintain IP data sessions when moving between different
    network interfaces. This document introduces a new set of ICMP and Mobility Header
    messages. It requires modifications of the mobile node. However, since support
    for simultaneous multi-access and flow mobility requires modifications of the
    mobile node anyway, the modifications suggested in this document are considered
    to be modest. The suggested enhancement is fully backwards compatible with the
    base Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification. The mobile node may be an IPv4-only node,
    IPv6-only node, or a dual-stack node.</p>
