abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a BNF-based notation for describing the behavior
    of protocol stacks with respect to compressing the protocol headers. The RObust
    Header Compression ROHC [1] scheme is designed to compress packet headers over
    error prone channels. It is built around an extensible core framework that can
    be tailored to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.
    The aim of the notation is to simplify the creation of new ROHC [1] profiles.</p>"
