abstract:
- content: "<p>LISP is an upgrade to the architecture of the IPvN internetworking
    system, one which separates location and identity (currently intermingled in IPvN
    addresses). This is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as a critically
    necessary evolutionary architectural step for the Internet. In LISP, nodes have
    both a 'locator' (a name which says _where_ in the network's connectivity structure
    the node is) and an 'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent
    handle for the node). A node may have more than one locator, or its locator may
    change over time (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the same identifier.
    One of the chief novelties of LISP, compared to other proposals for the separation
    of location and identity, is its approach to deploying this upgrade. (In general,
    it is comparatively easy to conceive of new network designs, but much harder to
    devise approaches which will actually get deployed throughout the global network.)
    LISP aims to achieve the near-ubiquitous deployment necessary for maximum exploitation
    of an architectural upgrade by i) minimizing the amount of change needed (existing
    hosts and routers can operate unmodified); and ii) by providing significant benefits
    to early adopters. This document is an introduction to the entire LISP system,
    for those who are unfamiliar with it. It is intended to be both easy to follow,
    and also give a fairly detailed understanding of the entire system.</p>"
