abstract:
- content: <p>Many stringent requirements are imposed on today's network, such as
    low latency, high availability and reliability in order to support several use
    cases such as IoT, Gaming, Content distribution, Robotics etc. Adoption of cloud
    and fog technology at the edge of the network allows operator to deploy a single
    "Service Function" to multiple "Execution locations". The decision to steer traffic
    to a specific location may change frequently based on load, proximity etc. Under
    the current SFC framework, steering traffic dynamically to the different execution
    end points require a specific 're-chaining', i.e., a change in the service function
    path reflecting the different IP endpoints to be used for the new execution points.
    This procedure maybe complex and take time. In order to simplify re-chaining and
    reduce the time to complete the procedure, we discuss separating the logical Service
    Function Path from the specific execution end points. This can be done by identifying
    the Service Functions using a name rather than a routable IP endpoint (or Layer
    2 address). This draft describes the necessary extensions, additional functions
    and protocol details in SFF (Service Function Forwarder) to handle name based
    relationships.</p>
