abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms for IS-IS to be self-configuring.
    Such mechanisms could reduce the management burden to configure a network. One
    obvious environment that could benefit from these mechanisms is IPv6 home network
    where plug-and-play would be expected. Besides home network, some simple enterprise/ISP
    networks might also potentially benefit from the self-configuring mechanisms.</p>"
