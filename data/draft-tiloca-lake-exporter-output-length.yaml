abstract:
- content: "<p>The lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol Ephemeral Diffie-
    Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC) allows two peers to compute a shared secret session
    key. Once the session key is available, the two peers can use the EDHOC_Exporter
    interface, e.g., to derive keying material for an application protocol. This document
    defines an in-band approach that can be used by the two peers to agree about the
    lengths of the outputs produced with the EDHOC_Exporter interface. The defined
    approach relies on an EDHOC External Authorization Data (EAD) item that can be
    exchanged in the first two EDHOC messages of an EDHOC session.</p>"
