abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an alternative way of providing Internet addressing
    and access. The addressing scheme builds on the idea of an 'IP Network Address
    Translator (NAT) [1], and relies on the Internet Service Provider's, gateway systems
    (hosts/routers) providing dynamic address translation from a pool of IP addresses.
    The access scheme splits each country/region into areas that are covered by local
    service providers who provide a Point of Presence (PoP) to the Internet. The areas
    will be defined by grouping together telephone area dial codes. Each area would
    be allocated to a service provider in much the same way as an independent radio
    station is licensed to use a given frequency. The dial-up users will gain access
    to their local service providers' PoP by calling a national 'local' number. The
    PTT's will direct all the calls to the service provider that has the concession
    for the users' area. Overall it is hoped that the proposals within this memo will
    act as a catalyst towards resolving the IP addressing problems and provide a foundation
    towards improving and rationalising dial-up access to the Internet.</p>"
