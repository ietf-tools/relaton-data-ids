abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines some extensions to the COPS protocol under
    the COPS-MAID client type to be used for the SP Control Plane procedures in a
    Multimedia Telephony Service (MTS) context. The reference SP network infrastructure
    is assumed to be based on MPLS/Diffserv Control and Data Planes. The proposed
    architecture is defined signalling independent because it is able to uphold different
    signalling protocols used by the MTS-enabled terminals (e.g. SIP, H.323, H.248-Megaco,
    MGCP, etc.) with a common approach. The overall specification relies on the identification
    of a common and generalized semantic for the service requests (policy &amp; CAC),
    which will encapsulate the client-specific information in a common format besides
    of the specific protocol (e.g. SIP, H.323, etc.). By means of this generalized
    architecture it is possible to reduce the complexity of the SP Control Plane architecture.</p>"
