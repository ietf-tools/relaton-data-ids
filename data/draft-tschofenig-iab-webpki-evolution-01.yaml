abstract:
- content: "<p>The problems with the WebPKI have received the attention by the Internet
    security community when DigiNotar, a Dutch certification authority, had a security
    breach in 2011 and in the same year a Comodo affiliate was compromised. Both cases
    led to fraudulent issuance of certificates and raise questions regarding the strength
    of the WebPKI used by so many applications. Almost 2 years have passed since these
    incidents and various standardization activities have happened in the meanwhile
    offering new technical solutions to make the public key infrastructure more resilient.
    The important question, however, is which of the technical solutions will get
    widespread deployment? In this document we compare the different technical solutions
    in an attempt to engage the impacted stakeholders to trigger deployment actions
    to improve the status quo. This document does not include any recommendations
    what techniques to use.</p>"
