abstract:
- content: "<p>This document briefly presents the Access Traffic Steering, Switching,
    and Splitting (ATSSS) service being specified within the 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP). The ATSSS service provides network support for multihomed devices
    to select a path for transmission (steer), move traffic from one path to another
    (switch), or use multiple paths simultaneously (split). TS 23.501 specifies an
    ATSSS architecture for TCP traffic. This document presents a snap-shot of the
    ongoing discussion in the 3GPP to enable ATSSS for non-TCP traffic, based on the
    use of QUIC, and assesses to what extent IETF specifications can be used to meet
    the ATSSS design goals. Apparent gaps are also documented.</p>"
