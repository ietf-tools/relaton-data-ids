abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a key management protocol to generate a handover
    key between a mobile node (MN) and an access router (AR) for the purpose of securing
    Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) signaling messages. As such, it specifies a message
    exchange between the MN and the AR and assumptions that must hold in order for
    this protocol to work. The protocol itself is described here for FMIPv6 use, but
    is applicable to other protocols that need to establish shared keys between the
    MN and a network entity.</p>"
