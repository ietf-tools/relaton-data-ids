abstract:
- content: <p>Zhang. Expires April 19, 2010 [page 1] Internet-Draft Management Virtual
    Router Redundancy Protocol October 2009 In this document, we propose a simplified
    VRRP protocol called the Slave Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (SVRRP).The
    design objective of SVRRP is to specify an election protocol that dynamically
    assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the SVRRP routers on a LAN,
    which is exactly as same as that of VRRP. However, SVRRP executions do not exchange
    signaling packets and need the assistance of VRRP to perform their functionality
    appropriately. This approach can be used to improve the efficiency of VRRP routers
    in certain scenarios. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [RFC2119].</p>
