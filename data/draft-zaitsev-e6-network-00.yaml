abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes new E6 addressing scheme for the creation of
    world-wide networks totally constructed on the base of Ethernet technology. Hierarchic
    E6 addresses with the length of 6 octets are used instead of both Ethernet MAC-addresses
    and IP-addresses which allows the routing within world-wide networks and cuts
    overhead of TCP, IP headers; the address space is extended in 16K times regarding
    IP addresses. Standard Ethernet LLC2 facilities are employed for guaranteed delivery
    of information. E6 Network Architecture simplifies packets processing aglorithms
    that improves the network performance and QoS.</p>"
