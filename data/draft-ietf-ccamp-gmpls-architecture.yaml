abstract:
- content: "<p>Future data and transmission networks will consist of elements such
    as routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop
    Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross-connects (OXCs),
    etc. that will use Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) to dynamically
    provision resources and to provide network survivability using protection and
    restoration techniques. This document describes the architecture of GMPLS. GMPLS
    extends MPLS to encompass time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, G.709), wavelength
    (lambdas), and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port
    or fiber). The focus of GMPLS is on the control plane of these various layers
    since each of them can use physically diverse data or forwarding planes. The intention
    is to cover both the signaling and the routing part of that control plane. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
