abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the R^5N DHT technical specification. R^5N is
    a secure distributed hash table (DHT) routing algorithm and data structure for
    decentralized applications. It features an open peer- to-peer overlay routing
    mechanism which supports ad-hoc permissionless participation and support for topologies
    in restricted-route environments. If desired, the paths data takes through the
    overlay can be recorded, allowing decentralized applications to use the DHT to
    discover routes. This document defines the normative wire format of protocol messages,
    routing algorithms, cryptographic routines and security considerations for use
    by implementers. This specification was developed outside the IETF and does not
    have IETF consensus. It is published here to guide implementation of R^5N and
    to ensure interoperability among implementations including the pre-existing GNUnet
    implementation.</p>"
