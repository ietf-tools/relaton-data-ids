abstract:
- content: "<p>The VTP Protocol specification defines a generic tunneling mechanism,
    as well as extensions for IP and IPX protocols. This specification will detail
    a method to establish Level 2 (PPP and SLIP) tunnels between two peers. This strawman
    proposal is intended as a recommendation for using VTP as a generic all-purpose
    tunnel scheme, as opposed to having multiple tunneling mechanism for layer 2 and
    3 protocols.</p>"
