abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs) is
    documented in RFC 3490 and associated documents and commonly known as IDNA. While
    that protocol was being developed (and more recently), there were a number of
    alternate proposals and suggestions for different ways to do IDNs. IDNA was favored
    over those alternatives, but variations on them seem to keep reappearing with
    the suggestion that they are novel ideas. This memo describes some of those suggested
    alternatives and summarizes the reasons why they were not favored over IDNA.</p>"
