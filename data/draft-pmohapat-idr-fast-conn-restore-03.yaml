abstract:
- content: <p>A BGP route defines an association of an address prefix with an "exit
    point" from the current Autonomous System (AS). If the exit point becomes unreachable
    due to a failure, the route becomes invalid. This usually triggers an exchange
    of BGP control messages after which a new BGP route for the given prefix is installed.
    However, connectivity can be restored more quickly if the router maintains precomputed
    BGP backup routes. It can then switch to a backup route immediately upon learning
    that an exit point is unreachable, without needing to wait for the BGP control
    messages exchange. This document specifies the procedures to be used by BGP to
    maintain and distribute the precomputed backup routes. Maintaining these additional
    routes is also useful in promoting load balancing, performing maintenance without
    causing traffic loss, and in reducing churn in the BGP control plane.</p>
