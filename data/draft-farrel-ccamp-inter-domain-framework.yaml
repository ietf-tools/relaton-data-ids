abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for establishing and controlling
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched
    Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain networks. For the purposes of this document, a domain
    is considered to be any collection of network elements within a common sphere
    of address management or path computational responsibility. Examples of such domains
    include IGP areas and Autonomous Systems.</p>"
