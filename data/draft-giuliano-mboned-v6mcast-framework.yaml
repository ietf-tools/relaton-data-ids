abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architectural framework for deploying interdomain
    multicast for IPv6 with simplicity, scalability, efficiency and security as the
    primary goals, applying the lessons learned from deploying IPv4 multicast. In
    order to achieve this objective, the deprecation of network-based source discovery,
    and therefore Any Source Multicast, is proposed. Source-Specific Multicast is
    proposed as the service model supported for deploying interdomain IPv6 multicast.
    The architectural components responsible for providing source discovery are also
    discussed.</p>"
