abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional hierarchical structure of cellular networks has led
    to deployment models which are heavily centralized. Mobility management with centralized
    mobility anchoring in existing hierarchical mobile networks is quite prone to
    suboptimal routing and issues related to scalability. Centralized functions present
    a single point of failure, and inevitably introduce longer delays and higher signaling
    loads for network operations related to mobility management. To make matters worse,
    there are numerous variants of Mobile IP in addition to other protocols standardized
    outside the IETF, making it much more difficult to create economical and interoperable
    solutions. In this document we examine the problems of centralized mobility management
    and identify requirements for distributed and dynamic mobility management.</p>"
