abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast was not originally supported with SR, as indicated in [RFC8402]:
    Segment Routing is defined for unicast. However, with the wide development and
    deployment of SR and SRv6 technology, there have been proposals to develop SR-based
    multicast solutions, showing the interests to develop multicast solutions that
    facilitate incremental deployment based on SR and SRv6. This document examines
    two typical SRv6 multicast approaches and considers a number of different aspects
    to provide a framework for understanding. The purpose is to help the working group
    and IETF community to understand and thus evaluate these possible impacts.</p>"
