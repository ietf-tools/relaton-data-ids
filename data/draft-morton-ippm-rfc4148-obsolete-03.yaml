abstract:
- content: <p>This memo reclassifies RFC 4148, "IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics
    Registry", as Obsolete, and withdraws the IANA IPPM Metrics Registry itself from
    use because it is obsolete. The current registry structure has been found to be
    insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics. Despite apparent efforts
    to find current or even future users, no one responded to the call for interest
    in the RFC 4148 registry during the second half of 2010. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
