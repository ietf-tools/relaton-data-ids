abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP Authentication Header (AH) is used to provide connectionless
    integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams (hereafter referred
    to as just 'authentication'), and to provide protection against replays. This
    latter, optional service may be selected when a Security Association is established.
    AH provides authentication for as much of the IP header as possible, as well as
    for upper level protocol data. However, some IP header fields may change in transit
    and the value of these fields, when the packet arrives at the receiver, may not
    be predictable by the transmitter. The values of such fields cannot be protected
    by AH. Thus the protection provided to the IP header by AH is somewhat piecemeal.</p>"
