abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) is used
    for recording and collecting operational and telemetry information. Specifically,
    IOAM allows telemetry data to be pushed into data packets while they traverse
    the network. This document introduces a new IOAM option type called the Direct
    Export (DEX) option, which is used as a trigger for IOAM data to be directly exported
    to a collector without being pushed into in-flight data packets.</p>"
