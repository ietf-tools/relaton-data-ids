abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Intermediate System to Intermediate System
    (IS-IS) extensions necessary to support link state routing for any protocols running
    directly over Layer-2. While supporting this concept involves several pieces,
    this document only describes extensions to IS-IS. Furthermore, the Type, Length,
    Value pairs (TLVs) described in this document are generic Layer-2 additions, and
    specific ones as needed are defined in the IS-IS technology-specific extensions.
    We leave it to the systems using these IS-IS extensions to explain how the information
    carried in IS-IS is used. [STANDARDS- TRACK]</p>"
