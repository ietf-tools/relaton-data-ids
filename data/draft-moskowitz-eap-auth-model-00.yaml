abstract:
- content: "<p>There is considerable confusion surrounding authentication styles and
    the nature of the resulting trust. This paper is an attempt to develop categories
    of authentication methods and present examples of each. In so doing, it develops
    an Authentication Functional Layering Model. It will look at the components of
    authentication, the flows, channels, algorithms, and entities. The taxonomy presented
    here is new; it has been created to facilitate discussion and understanding. Only
    two-party authentications are presented here.</p>"
