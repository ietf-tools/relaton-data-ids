abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP/IP stack provides protocol features that can potentially be
    abused by on-path attackers to inject metadata about a traffic flow into that
    traffic flow in band. When this injected metadata is provided by an entity with
    knowledge about the natural person associated with a traffic flow, it becomes
    a grave threat to privacy, which we term a hypercookie. This document defines
    a threat model for hypercookie injection and hypercookie coercion attacks, catalogs
    protocol features that may be used to achieve them, and provides guidance for
    defeating these attacks, with an analysis of protocol features that are disabled
    by the proposed defeat mechanism. The deployment of firewalls that detect and
    reject abuse of protocol features can help, but the relative ease of injecting
    metadata for attackers on path, and trivial combination of metadata injection
    attacks, leads to a recommendation to add cryptographic integrity protection to
    transport layer headers to defend against injection attacks. tl;dr: at least with
    respect to metadata injection in the current Internet protocol stack, everything
    is ruined.</p>"
