abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet has been widely deployed in metro-networks, and there are
    more and more customers select Ethernet PW services. With the deployment of IEEE
    802.1ah network, there is a need to support 802.1ah attachment circuit. Based
    on the two modes defined in RFC 4448, this document introduces a new Ethernet
    encapsulation mode to support the new AC type. This document also describes some
    scenarios and procedures pertaining to the new mode. Some considerations relating
    to multi-segment PW are also discussed.</p>"
