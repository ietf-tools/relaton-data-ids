abstract:
- content: "<p>The environment in which RFCs are produced has changed significantly
    since the inception of the series: the process for producing RFCs is now a heavyweight
    process; there is a large and growing set of errata, many with serious implications;
    and the expectations around the use of RFCs have changed significantly as document
    technology has evolved. In this new environment, the long-standing principle of
    immutability of RFCs, prevents the RFC Series from achieving its goals of technical
    excellence and easily understood documentation. This document addresses that by
    identifying a possible way forward of a new principle of limited mutability for
    the RFC Series that allows the publishing of new versions of RFCs in limited circumstances,
    replacing the principle of immutability.</p>"
