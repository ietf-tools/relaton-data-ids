abstract:
- content: "<p>Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files and the MUD URIs that point
    to them are defined in RFC 8520. This document introduces a new type of MUD file
    to be delivered in conjunction with a MUD file signature and/or to be referenced
    via a MUD URI embedded in other documents or messages, such as an IEEE 802.1AR
    Secure Device Identifier (DevID) or a CBOR Web Token (CWT). These signed documents
    can be presented to other entities, e.g., a network management system or network
    path orchestrator. If this entity also takes on the role of a verifier as defined
    by the IETF Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture, this verifier can
    use the references included in the MUD file specified in this document to discover,
    for example, appropriate reference value providers, endorsement documents or endorsement
    distribution APIs, trust anchor stores, remote verifier services (sometimes referred
    to as Attestation Verification Services), or transparency logs. All theses references
    in the MUD file pointing to resources and auxiliary RATS services can satisfy
    general RATS prerequisite by enabling discovery or improve discovery resilience
    of corresponding resources or services.</p>"
