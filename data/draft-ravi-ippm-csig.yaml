abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents Congestion Signaling (CSIG), an in-band network
    telemetry protocol that allows end-hosts to obtain visibility into fine-grained
    network signals for congestion control, traffic management, and network debuggability
    in the network. CSIG provides a simple, low-overhead, and extensible packet header
    mechanism to obtain fixed-length summaries from bottleneck devices along a packet
    path. This summarized information is collected over L2 CSIG-tags in a compare-and-replace
    manner across network devices along the path. Receivers can reflect this information
    back to senders via L4+ CSIG reflection headers. CSIG builds upon the successful
    aspects of prior work such as switch in-band network telemetry (INT) that incorporates
    multibit signals in live data packets. At the same time, CSIG's end-to-end mechanism
    for carrying the signals via fixed size header is simple, practical and deployable
    akin to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). In addition to a detailed description
    of the end-to-end protocol, this document also motivates the use cases for CSIG
    and the rationale for design choices made in CSIG. It describes a set of signals
    of interest to applications (minimum available bandwidth, maximum link utilization,
    and maximum hop delay), methods to compute these signals in network devices, and
    how these signals can be leveraged in applications. Additionally, it describes
    how attributes about the bottleneck's location can be carried and made useful
    to applications. It also provides the framework to incorporate future signals.
    Finally, this document addresses incremental deployment, backward compatibility
    and nuances of CSIG's applicability in a range of scenarios.</p>"
