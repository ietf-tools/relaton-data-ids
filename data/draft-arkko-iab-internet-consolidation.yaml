abstract:
- content: "<p>Many of us have held a vision of the Internet as the ultimate distributed
    platform that allows communication, the provision of services, and competition
    from any corner of the world. But as the Internet has matured, it seems to also
    feed the creation of large, centralised entities in many areas. This phenomenon
    could be looked at from many different angles, but this memo considers the topic
    from the perspective of how available technology and Internet architecture drives
    different market directions.</p>"
