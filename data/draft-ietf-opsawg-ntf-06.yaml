abstract:
- content: "<p>Network telemetry is a technology for gaining network insight and facilitating
    efficient and automated network management. It encompasses various techniques
    for remote data generation, collection, correlation, and consumption. This document
    describes an architectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by challenges
    that are encountered as part of the operation of networks and by the requirements
    that ensue. Network telemetry, as necessitated by best industry practices, covers
    technologies and protocols that extend beyond conventional network Operations,
    Administration, and Management (OAM). The presented network telemetry framework
    promises better flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and performance.
    In addition, it facilitates the implementation of automated control loops to address
    both today's and tomorrow's network operational needs. This document clarifies
    the terminologies and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry
    system from several different perspectives. The framework and taxonomy help to
    set a common ground for the collection of related work and provide guidance for
    related technique and standard developments.</p>"
