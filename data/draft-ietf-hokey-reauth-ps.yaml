abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) re-authentication
    problem statement. The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying
    framework is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers without re-executing
    an EAP method. This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless
    environments. This document details the problem and defines design goals for a
    generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
