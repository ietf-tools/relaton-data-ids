abstract:
- content: "<p>Most protocols and applications are designed for connections that are
    fairly static. When a node changes its point of attachment to the Internet frequently,
    it must be able to rapidly adapt to the new environment. Traditionally, each application
    and protocol tries to do this independently of each other. In some cases, applications
    have been tailored to communicate with one other protocol layer to notice such
    changes. The main problem with this approach is that adding new protocols and
    applications to the node cannot be made in a generic way. In order to obtain at
    least some level of context awareness, protocols and applications must be specifically
    tailored to intercommunicate. This also adds complexity to application and protocol
    design, since protocols and applications perform a wide range of tasks for which
    they have not originally been designed. To overcome these problems, we add a new
    Context Aware Management (CAM) layer to the Internet Protocol stack. The purpose
    of CAM is to optimize the functionality of the node by monitoring the environment
    for changes and by adapting the behavior of the node accordingly. The protocols
    and applications thus perform the tasks for which they have been designed in the
    first place, and CAM makes the decisions regarding which protocols to use and
    with what parameters.</p>"
