abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specify Chempat as a generic family of instantiated Post-Quantum/Traditional
    (PQ/T) Hybrid Key Exchange Methods (KEMs). The goal is to provide a generic combiner
    construct that can be analysed separately for security assurance, and to offer
    concrete instantiated algorithms for integration into protocol and implementations.
    Identified instances are provided based on traditional Diffie-Hellman key agreement
    using curves P-256, P-384, X25519, X448, brainpoolP256, brainpoolP384 combined
    with post quantum methods ML-KEM-768, ML-KEM-1024, Streamlined NTRU Prime sntrup761,
