abstract:
- content: "<p>There needs to be a solution for locating and capturing data in a standardized
    way. Data may be cached, copied and/or stored at multiple locations in the network
    on route to its final destination. With an increasingly high volume of devices
    connecting to the Internet, support for network caching and replication is critical
    for continuous data availability. There are data repositories throughout a modern
    network and there needs to be a standardized way to locating the repositories
    and discovering the desired data within. There are several use cases which illustrate
    a need for a data discovery solution. An application might need to query the network
    to discover resources (program, service, resource) that can help the local application
    perform a particular task. Additionally, there could be volumes of data which
    needs to be searched and discovered in order to provide a result to be acted upon
    by the application. These are a couple of the use cases being addressed in this
    document.</p>"
