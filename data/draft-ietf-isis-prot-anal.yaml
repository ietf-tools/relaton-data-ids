abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of two reports on the Integrated ISIS protocol.
    The other report documents operational experience with the protocol. These two
    reports are required by the IAB/IESG in order for an Internet routing protocol
    to advance to Draft Standard Status. Integrated ISIS is an Interior Gateway Protocol
    and is designed to carry both IP and ISO CLNP routing information. Integrated
    ISIS is currently designated as a Proposed Standard. The protocol was first published
    in RFC 1195. Internet Draft [2] was published subsequently to RFC 1195 and documents
    the current version of the protocol. This report summarizes the key features of
    Integrated ISIS. It also attempts to analyze how the protocol will perform and
    scale in the Internet. Please send comments to isis@merit.edu.</p>"
