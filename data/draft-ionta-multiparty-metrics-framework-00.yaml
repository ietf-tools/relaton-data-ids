abstract:
- content: <p>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex growth
    of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along the Core network,
    is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly derived from a "Network-Oriented
    point of view", and therefore a general perspective, not focused on specific services
    - with some more Performance factors, so to include a "Service-Oriented point
    of view", more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own characteristics
    in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and so on. Almost nothing about
    this new approach has been standardized yet for the core network. To achieve the
    above goal, and starting from the one-to-group performance metrics outlined in
    RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metrics composition/aggregation framework is proposed
    in this memo, where the main focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video
    providers, online biding, online stock market, etc.). Finally this memo is tuned
    to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes, framework concepts, and need to widen
    the current performance metrics depending on the application, service etc.</p>
