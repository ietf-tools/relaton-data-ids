abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution policy
    that contains filters and actions that apply when packets are received on a router
    with the flow specification function turned on. The popularity of these flow specification
    filters in deployment for DoS and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more
    BGP flow specification match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow specification
    actions. Two solutions exist for adding new filters: 1) expanding the BGP Flow
    Specification version 1 (NLRI match filters and extended communities actions)
    to included limited number of filters and actions, and 2) creating a BGP Flow
    Specification version 2 that allows for ordering filters and actions (using new
    NLRI and wide-communities for actions). The two solutions can exist in parallel.
    This document contains an overview existing proposals for expansion of BGP flow
    specification policy, proposals for BGP Flow Specification v1 and a new BGP Flow
    specification version 2 that supports order of filters and actions plus allowing
    more actions. This document also provides rules for the interaction of IDR Flow
    Specification policy (session ephemeral policy) with policy found in I2RS (reboot
    ephemeral policy), and policy found in ACLs and Policy routing (configuration
    policy). This document does not contain the individual definitions of policy rule
    conditions or actions.</p>"
