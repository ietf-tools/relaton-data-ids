abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification QuicR, an unified media delivery protocol over QUIC.
    It aims at supporting multiple application classes with varying latency requirements
    including ultra low latency applications such as interactive communication and
    gaming. It is based on a publish/subscribe metaphor where entities publish and
    subscribe to data that is sent through, and received from, relays in the cloud.
    The information subscribed to is named such that this forms an overlay information
    centric network. The relays allow for efficient large scale deployments.</p>"
