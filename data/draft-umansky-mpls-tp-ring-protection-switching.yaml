abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to address the requirements for
    protection of the Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label
    Switched Paths (LSP) in a ring topology. The mechanism defined herein is designed
    to support point-to-point as well as point-to-multipoint LSPs. The MPLS-TP section
    layer OAM is used to monitor the connectivity between each two adjacent nodes
    using the mechanisms defined in the [MPLS-TP OAM]. The Automatic Protection Switching
    (APS) protocol is used for coordination of protection switching actions between
    the ring nodes.</p>"
