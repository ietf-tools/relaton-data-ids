abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the analysis of the applicability of Abstraction
    and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration (POI),
    provided in RFC YYYY, to cover multi-layer service assurance scenarios, for end-to-end
    customer L2VPN or L3VPN connectivity services setup over underlying transport
    optical paths, with specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. EDITORS
    NOTE: Replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of draft-ietf- teas-actn-poi-applicability
    once it has been published. Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified
    for each multi-layer (packet over optical) service assurance scenario with a specific
    focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network Controllers
    Interface) in the ACTN architecture.</p>"
