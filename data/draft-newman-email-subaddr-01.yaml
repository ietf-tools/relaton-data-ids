abstract:
- content: "<p>It is often useful for a single user to have multiple email addresses
    which can be used to assist categorizing incoming email. One way of doing this
    is to divide the local-part of an email address into user and detail parts. The
    user part is used to route the message within the specified domain and the detail
    part is used to route the message according to a particular user's wishes. This
    specification formalizes the de-facto standard for subaddressing in use today
    and includes advice and requirements for final delivery agents, MUAs and mail
    list servers which wish to support subaddressing.</p>"
