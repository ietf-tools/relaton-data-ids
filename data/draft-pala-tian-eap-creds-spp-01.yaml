abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that
    rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network
    access, the need for a standardized credentials provisioning and management framework
    is paramount. The 802.1x architecture allows for entities (e.g., devices, applications,
    etc.) to authenticate to the network by providing a communication channel where
    different methods can be used to exchange different types of credentials. EAP-CREDS
    is an EAP method that specifically designed for credential provisioning and management.
    If implemented in Access Networks (e.g., wired), EAP-CREDS can offer credentials
    management services such as registration, provisioning, and renewal. Besides,
    EAP-CREDS provides protocol encapsulation mechanism that allows it to use with
    other credential management protocols. Therefore, this document defines how to
    use EAP-CREDS with the Simple Provisioning Protocol (SPP) to support the provisioning
    and management of authentication credentials for user and/or devices in an access
    network. Other credential provisioning protocols can also use this document as
    a guideline and template for its own encapsulation with EAP-CREDS.</p>"
