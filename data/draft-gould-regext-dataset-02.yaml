abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a Data Set File (DSF) format that can be used
    to define and pass bulk data between a client and a server. This format is extensible
    to pass any set of simple data types in a set of records contained in the body
    of the file. The file format also supports storing the result of processing the
    data set that MAY be generated by the server and returned to the client. The file
    format consists of an XML definition header and a Comma-Separated Values (CSV)
    data section delimited by "-----BEGIN DATA SET-----" and "----- END DATA SET-----"
    lines. The XML definition header defines the format of the CSV data section, contains
    additional meta-data, and optionally includes a digital signature to identify
    the source and ensure that the data has not been tampered with between the parties
    (source, client, and server). The interface (manual or automated) that is used
    to submit the file and receive the result file is not defined within this document.</p>
