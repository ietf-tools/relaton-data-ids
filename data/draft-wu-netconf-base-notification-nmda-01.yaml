abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
    manipulate configuration datastores. NMDA introduces additional datastores for
    systems that support more advanced processing chains converting configuration
    to operational state. However, client applications are not able to be aware of
    common events pertaining to additional datstores, such as a data validation state
    change in NETCONF server, that may impact management applications. This document
    updates [RFC6470] to allow a NETCONF client to receive additional notifications
    for some common system events pertaining to the Network Management Datastore Architecture
    (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].</p>"
