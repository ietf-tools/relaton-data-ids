abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses and describes design choices made in order
    to utilize Information Centric Networking (ICN) for the Internet of Things (IoT).
    Based on requirements and challenges identified in draft-zhang-icnrg-iotchallenges-00,
    we propose design choices for an IoT architecture to handle these requirements,
    while providing efficiency and scalability. An objective is to, as far as possible,
    not require IoT specific changes of the ICN architectures per se, but we do indicate
    some potential modifications of ICN that would improve efficiency and scalability
    for IoT and other applications. Furthermore, the document starts outlining how
    to map the proposed design choices to existing ICN architectures, in a first instance
    shown for CCN1.0.</p>"
