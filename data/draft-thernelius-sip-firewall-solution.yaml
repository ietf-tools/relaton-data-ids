abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution that is able to handle SIP signaling
    together with NAT enabled firewalls. The intent is to show that existing firewalls
    do not have to be replaced by 'SIP enabled' ones, instead they will only have
    to be reconfigured slightly. The main feature of this solution is using MGCP from
    a session control proxy to open/close holes in an RTP proxy which then enables
    RTP traffic to flow between interconnected networks. Worth noting is that this
    solution will not only work for SIP, it will also work for other protocols, such
    as H.323 or Real Audio. It does not even have to be RTP that is passed through
    the RTP proxy, though this draft assumes that the RTP stream is accompanied by
    RTCP. The solution will work for any protocol that wishes to open/close ports
    dynamically in the RTP proxy (maybe it should be called Forwarding Engine in the
    general case).</p>"
