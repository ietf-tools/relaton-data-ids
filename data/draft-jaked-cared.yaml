abstract:
- content: "<p>Some encrypted DNS clients require anonymity from their encrypted DNS
    servers to prevent third parties from correlating client DNS queries with other
    data for surveillance or data mining purposes. However, there are cases where
    the client and server have a pre-existing relationship and each wants to prove
    its identity to the other. For example, an encrypted DNS server may only wish
    to accept queries from encrypted DNS clients that are managed by the same enterprise,
    and an encrypted DNS client may need to confirm the identity of the encrypted
    DNS server it is communicating with. This requires mutual authentication. This
    document discusses the circumstances under which client authentication is appropriate
    to use with encrypted DNS, the benefits and limitations of doing so, and recommends
    authentication mechanisms to be used when communicating with TLS-based encrypted
    DNS protocols.</p>"
