abstract:
- content: "<p>As the foundation of the current new round of industrial revolution,
    the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) based on cyber-physical systems (CPS)
    [smart-factory] has become the focus of research in various countries. One of
    the key issues in the entire development stage of IIoT is the standardization
    of the IIoT architecture. With the development of intelligent manufacturing technology,
    the number of IIoT devices is expected to increase sharply, and large amounts
    of data will be generated in the industrial manufacturing process. However, traditional
    industrial networks cannot meet the IIoT requirements for high data rates, low
    latency, massive connections, interconnection, and interoperability. Current IIoT
    architectures also have various limitations, including those in mobility, security,
    scalability, and communication reliability. These limitations hinder the development
    and implementation of IIoT. As a network layer protocol, IPv6 can solve the problem
    of IPv4 address exhaustion. Meanwhile, as a high-speed, low-latency, wireless
    communication technology, 5G has great potential in promoting IIoT. To solve the
    aforementioned problems, this draft proposes an IIoT architecture based on IPv6
    and 5G. The architecture can provide high-speed, low- latency communication services
    and possesses massive connectivity, mobility, scalability, security, and other
    features for industrial devices. It can also provide generalized, refined, flexible
    network services for devices outside factories. Moreover, an information model
    is defined to standardize the representation of information in IIoT. The security
    challenges in and recommendations for IIoT are also discussed.</p>"
