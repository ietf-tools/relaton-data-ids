abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications using the Internet already have access to topology information
    of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to Internet routing
    tables at looking glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded
    to many application clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network
    topologies from the point of view of ISPs (henceforth referred as Providers).
    In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and
    a way to distribute it. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service
    provides network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences
    of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns
    while maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information
    of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified
    view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize
    them. Additional services are built on top of the maps. This document describes
    a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. Although the ALTO Service would primarily
    be provided by the network operator (e.g., an ISP), content service providers
    and third parties could also operate this service. Applications that could use
    this service are those that have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples
    of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</p>"
