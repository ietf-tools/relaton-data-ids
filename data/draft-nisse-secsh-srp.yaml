abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an experimental method for authentication and keyexchange
    in the Secure Shell protocol. The main virtue of the SRP protocol [SRP] is that
    it provides authentication based on a small secret (typically a password). It
    is useful in situations where no authentic host key is known. For Secure Shell,
    it can be used as a bootstrapping procedure to get the host key of a server in
    a safe way. SRP also provides authentication of the user, which means that it
    might make sense to either skip the secsh 'ssh-userauth'-service [SSH-USERAUTH]
    when using SRP, or allow login with the 'none' or 'external-keyx' method.</p>"
