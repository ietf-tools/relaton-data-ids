abstract:
- content: "<p>The service function chaining concept differentiates between a service
    function chain and a service function path. A chain is a sequence of service function
    types whereas a path is a sequence of service function instances that realize
    each type of service function. This document describes the architectural approach
    to reducing the abstract service function chain to the concrete service function
    path.</p>"
