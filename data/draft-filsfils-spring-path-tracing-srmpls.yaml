abstract:
- content: "<p>Path Tracing provides a record of the packet path as a sequence of
    interface ids. In addition, it provides a record of end-to-end delay, per-hop
    delay, and load on each interface that forwards the packet. Path Tracing has the
    lowest MTU overhead compared to alternative proposals such as [INT], [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data],
    [I-D.song-opsawg-ifit-framework], and [I-D.kumar-ippm-ifa]. Path Tracing supports
    fine grained timestamp. It has been designed for linerate hardware implementation
    in the base pipeline. This document defines the Path Tracing specification for
    the SR-MPLS dataplane. The Path Tracing specification for the SRv6 dataplane is
    defined in [I-D.filsfils-spring-path-tracing].</p>"
