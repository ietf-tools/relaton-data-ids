abstract:
- content: "<p>The RPL specification allows nodes running with storing or non- storing
    modes to operate in the same network. We describe how such a mix can result in
    network partitioning even when there are plenty of physical links available in
    the network. The partitioning affects both upwards (nodes to root) and downwards
    (root to leaf) traffic. This routing pathology stems from a recommendation made
    in the RPL specification forcing nodes with different modes of operation to join
    the RPL network as leaf nodes only. We propose a solution that modifies RPL by
    mandating that all the nodes parse and interpret source routing headers and storing
    mode nodes to sometimes act like a non-storing mode root by attaching source routing
    headers.</p>"
