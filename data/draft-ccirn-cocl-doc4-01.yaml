abstract:
- content: "<p>The long-term approach is based on the use of transport-layer relays
    known as transport service bridges, or TS-bridges. Further, the long-term approach
    also assumes that knowledge of the TS-bridges is hidden from the end-systems.
    The companion memo identifies the short-term approach towards TS-bridges. The
    purpose of this memo is three-fold: first, to identify the infrastructure which
    is expected to exist in the long-term; second, to describe the use of NL-relays
    in such an environment. And, third, to describe the use of TS-bridges in such
    an environment.</p>"
