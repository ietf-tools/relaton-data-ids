abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes TCP Fast Window Advance (FWA) flag in TCP Header
    to avoid the Head of Line Blocking in TCP long alive connections and in TCP long
    fat networks. FWA flag shall be set by the sender to force the TCP receiver to
    change its expected sequence number. This allows the application sender to send
    fresh application session to receiver on the existing TCP connection without blocking
    on the earlier session. The FWA flag is will solve long standing Head of Line
    (HOL) blocking problem in TCP for certain TCP applications.</p>"
