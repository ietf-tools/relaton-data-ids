abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies two approaches by which multimedia data (e.g.,
    MBone conferences), transmitted using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP), may be recorded
    to Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files. The first method requires a minimum
    amount of buffering at the recording station but results in recordings which identically
    preserve the received content including out of order packets, network ''jitter'',
    etc. The second approach requires buffering at the recording station but results
    in enhanced recordings (i.e., higher percentage of correctly ordered packets,
    elimination of a percentage of received jitter, potential recovery of a percentage
    of lost packets). Both approaches record all received RTP content and the relevant
    subset of RTCP information. This recording occurs transparently to the MBone conference
    or RTP session, and does not involve any alterations to normal RTP, RTCP, or ASF
    use.</p>"
