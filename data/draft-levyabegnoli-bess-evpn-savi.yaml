abstract:
- content: "<p>Source Address Validation procedures have been specified in the SAVI
    Working Group and provide a set of mechanisms and state machines to verify Source
    Address ownership. The main mechanisms are described in [RFC6620] and [RFC7513].
    [RFC7432] and furthermore [RFC9161] specify how an EVPN network could learn and
    distribute IP addresses. [RFC9161] describes a mechanism by which the PE can proxy
    some ND messages based on this information. In this document, we review how these
    two sets of specifications and underlying mechanisms can interact to provide Source
    Address Validation in an EVPN network.</p>"
