abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the metanetwork of networks that exchange electronic mail, there
    are many directory services that provide partial coverage ofnetwork users; that
    is, directories with information about some subset of a particular network's user
    population. Searching the collection of available directories is time-consuming
    and requires knowledge of each directory's user interface. Although X.500 is currently
    under study as a basis for an Internet-wide directory service, it is unlikely
    that a universal user registry will be in place in the near future. The Knowbot
    Information Service provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous directory services
    that simplifies the task of locating users in the combined network.</p>"
