abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we discuss how SIP can traverse enterprise and residential
    firewalls and NATs. This environment is challenging because we assume here that
    the end user has little or no control over the firewall or NAT, and that the firewall
    or NAT is completely ignorant of SIP</p>"
