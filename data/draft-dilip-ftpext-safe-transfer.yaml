abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a mechanism to overcome one of the cumbersome aspects
    of file transfer. Ftp fails to transfer the data as there is not enough disk space
    on the remote machine, but it fails only after it does the substantial data transfer
    and discovers that there is no more disk space left on the remote machine. The
    basic intention is to provide FTP Extension for checking the availability of the
    disk space before starting the actual file transfer operation on remote machines.</p>"
