abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
    underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used to support
    one or a group of VPN+ services. In the context of network slicing, a VTN could
    be instantiated as a network resource partition (NRP). This document specifies
    the IGP mechanisms with necessary extensions to advertise the associated topology
    and resource attributes for scalable Segment Routing (SR) based NRPs. Each NRP
    can have a customized topology and a set of network resources allocated from the
    physical network. Multiple NRPs may shared the same topology, and multiple NRPs
    may share the same set of network resources on some network segments. This allows
    flexible combination of the network topology and network resource attributes to
    build a relatively large number of NRPs with a relatively small number of logical
    topologies. A group of resource-aware SIDs and SRv6 Locators can be assigned to
    each NRP. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both Segment Routing with MPLS
    data plane (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6). This document
    also describes the mechanism of using dedicated NRP ID in the data plane instead
    of the per-NRP resource-aware SIDs and SRv6 Locators to further reduce the control
    plane and data plane overhead of maintaining a large number of NRPs.</p>"
