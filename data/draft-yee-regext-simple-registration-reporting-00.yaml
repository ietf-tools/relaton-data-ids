abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain name registries and registrars report to each other by sharing
    bulk information through files. This document creates two IANA registries to create
    a standard reporting mechanism between domain name registries and registrars.
    The first IANA registry lists standard data elements and their syntax for inclusion
    in the files. The second IANA registry lists standard reports based on the standard
    data elements. Each report is a file formatted as a CSV file. The advantage of
    this reporting mechanism is that reports, each file, can be imported by recipients
    without any prior knowledge of their contents, although reporting is enhanced
    with a minimum of knowledge about the files. The mechanism for the transmission
    and reception of the files is a matter of local policy.</p>"
