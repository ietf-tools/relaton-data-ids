abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces new header fields for use in Internet email, to
    allow the author of a message to specify primary (To) and secondary (Cc) recipients
    who, in the author's opinion, should not be recipients of a reply to the message.
    These new fields are designed to be highly compatible with pre-existing mail handling
    programs, and to facilitate a graceful transition. If this document is favorably
    received, it is the author's intent to submit this document (as an individual
    submission) for consideration for Proposed Standard status. Unless IESG directs
    otherwise, public discussion of this document should be on the ietf-822@imc.org
    mailing list. Comments may also be sent to the author.</p>"
