abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines encoding instructions that may be used in an
    Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) specification to alter how ASN.1 values are
    encoded by the Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER) and Canonical Robust XML Encoding
    Rules (CRXER), for example, to encode a component of an ASN.1 value as an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) attribute rather than as a child element. Some of these
    encoding instructions also affect how an ASN.1 specification is translated into
    an Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) specification. Encoding instructions that
    allow an ASN.1 specification to reference definitions in other XML schema languages
    are also defined. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
