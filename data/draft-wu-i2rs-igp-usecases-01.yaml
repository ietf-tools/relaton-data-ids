abstract:
- content: "<p>A link-state routing protocol such as OSPF or IS-IS is an essential
    component for a routing system. With substantial effort on the IGP protocols,
    the infrastructure of the network has achieved high reliability. During past years
    they have been operated and maintained through typical CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.
    As modern networks become larger and more complex, the IGP protocol may require
    a programmatic interface which is able to facilitate additional control and observation
    in such networks. Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) is a standards-based
    interface which provides a programmatic way to control and observe the IGP protocol.
    I2RS can be used to operate, maintain and monitor the routing-related state. This
    document describes set of use cases for which I2RS can be used for IGP protocol.
    It is intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing information
    models and a set of interfaces to the IGP protocol.</p>"
