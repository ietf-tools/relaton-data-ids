- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) records
    operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses
    a path between two points in the network. This document discusses additional data
    fields and associated data types to be added to the IOAM data fileds described
    in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]. In-situ OAM data fields can be encapsulated into
    a variety of protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, Geneve, IPv6 (via extension
    header), or IPv4.</p>"
