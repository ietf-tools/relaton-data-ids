abstract:
- content: "<p>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2116] requires a reliable transport
    for end-to-end communication. While historically TCP has been used for this purpose,
    this document proposes an alternative -- the Stream Control Transmission Protocol
    (SCTP) [RFC4960]. Similar to TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport
    connection to applications. Additionally, SCTP offers other innovative services
    unavailable in TCP. The objectives of this draft are three-fold: (i) to highlight
    SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP, (ii) to propose a design
    for persistent and pipelined HTTP 1.1 transactions over SCTP's multistreaming
    service, and (iii) to share some lessons learned from implementing HTTP over SCTP.
    Finally, open issues warranting more discussion and/or investigation are listed.</p>"
