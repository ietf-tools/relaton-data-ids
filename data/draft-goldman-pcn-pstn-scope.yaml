abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF PCN Working Group has continued its work investigating pre-
    congestion and admission control mechanisms. This work has progressed under the
    current charter, but has not yet considered related legacy PSTN interactions or
    the need for ubiquitous connectivity between users on dissimilar networks. The
    PCN charter could be improved by a strong positive statement to the effect committing
    to future work addressing legacy networks. In that light, please consider the
    questions below which include differential PCN treatment based on traffic types,
    security, and PSTN interoperability concerns. It seems helpful to have a touchstone
    of some concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway in order
    to confirm that they will be addressed in future work. This attempt is motivated
    by a desire to avoid the accidental omission of a topic that may be hard to "retrofit"
    in later.</p>
