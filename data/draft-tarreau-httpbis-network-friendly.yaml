abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an upgrade to HTTP messaging which aims at being
    faster, more robust and more friendly to mobile networks than the current version,
    while retaining the same semantics and offering a high enough compatibility level
    to make it possible to implement highly efficient gateways between existing implementations
    and this presently described version, thus offering a smooth upgrade path for
    legacy applications.</p>"
