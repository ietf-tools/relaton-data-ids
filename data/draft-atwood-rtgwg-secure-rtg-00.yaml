abstract:
- content: "<p>When tightening the security of the core routing infrastructure, two
    steps are necessary. The first is to secure the routing protocols' packets on
    the wire. The second is to ensure that the keying material for the routing protocol
    exchanges is distributed only to the appropriate routers. This document specifies
    a way of organizing the security parameters and a method for conveniently controlling
    those parameters using YANG and NETCONF.</p>"
