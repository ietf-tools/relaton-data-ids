abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum
    (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service [RFC4761] [RFC4762].
    The proposed solution is characterized by breaking pseudowire setup between Leaf
    endpoints in E-Tree instance to fulfill the specific E-Tree requirement: Leaf
    cannot communicate with Leaf. Backward compatibility is also considered in this
    document.</p>"
