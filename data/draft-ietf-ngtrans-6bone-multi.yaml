- content: "<p>This document exposes some issues for multihomed routing domains using
    the aggregatable addressing and routing scheme. A routing domain is multihomed
    when it uses two or more providers of the upper level. Most of these issues are
    not specific to IPv6 but are consequences of the addressing and routing scheme.</p>"
