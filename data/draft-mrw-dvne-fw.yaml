abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the management and configuration requirements
    for large Virtual Networks (VNs). VNs are private networks that employ tunneling
    technologies to overlay private network links over physical IP networks. As VNs
    grow, the amount of administrative effort required to manually configure virtual
    nodes and to set up the required tunnels becomes prohibitive. The DVNE protocol
    automates this process, elminating much of the administrative work involved in
    setting up a virtual network.</p>"
