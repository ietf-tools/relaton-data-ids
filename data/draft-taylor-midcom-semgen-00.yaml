abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is written to aid the process of selecting and completing
    the definition of the MIDCOM protocol, which will operate between MIDCOM agents
    and middleboxes such as firewalls and NATs. It describes the semantics which the
    protocol must support. These semantics are derived from the MIDCOM requirements
    and the MIDCOM usage scenarios which helped to inspire the requirements. This
    document was derived from draft-taylor-midcom-semantics-00.txt. The present version
    incorporates tentative conclusions reached in discussion at the IETF 54 meeting
    of the MIDCOM WG. It removes the concrete expression of the MIDCOM requests, responses,
    and notifications in favour of those presented in draft-stiemerling- midcom-semantics-xx.txt.</p>"
