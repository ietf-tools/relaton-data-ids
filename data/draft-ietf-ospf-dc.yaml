abstract:
- content: <p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.
    OSPF behavior over demand circuits (DC) is optimized in RFC 1793 to minimize the
    amount of overhead traffic. A part of the OSPF demand circuit extensions is the
    Hello suppression mechanism. This technique allows a demand circuit to go down
    when no interesting traffic is going through the link. However, it also introduces
    a problem, where it becomes impossible to detect an OSPF-inactive neighbor over
    such a link. This memo introduces a new mechanism called "neighbor probing" to
    address the above problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
