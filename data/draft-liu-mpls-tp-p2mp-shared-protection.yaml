abstract:
- content: "<p>This document will describle two protection solutions to support protection
    of failures in p2mp path in MPLS-TP. According to the protection Requirements
    in RFC 5654, there are requirements for MPLS-TP to support sharing of protection
    resources such that protection paths that are known not to be required concurrently
    can share the same protection resources. In addition, there is a requirement for
    MPLS-TP to support unidirectional 1:n protection for p2mp paths. These requirements
    are further addressed in draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk. so this draft will present
    proposed solutions. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
