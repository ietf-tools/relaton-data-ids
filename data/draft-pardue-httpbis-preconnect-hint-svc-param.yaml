abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP resources from one origin often have relationships to resources
    on other origins. This document outlines how a "preconnectHint" SvcParamKey for
    SVCB, could be used to provide an early indication of origins that are related
    to the current origin. Clients could use this information to opportunistically
    prepare and open connections, with the expectation that they will be used to fetch
    related resources. This mechanism provides information from a source that is not
    the authenticated origin, which could cause the client to perform actions that
    no other party would ask them to do; privacy considerations due to this are visited.</p>
