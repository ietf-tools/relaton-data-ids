abstract:
- content: "<p>Implementation of IoT systems imposes a requirement of M2M semantic
    interoperability. This problem is addressed by a number of ongoing attempts to
    define and standardize IoT information and data models. At present this work is
    fragmented across several standards with different approaches, scope, objectives,
    terminology, and assumptions that makes them difficult to understand and compare.
    This document is part of the effort to alleviate that problem by means of more
    streamlined presentations and descriptions. We are advocating for clear articulation
    of the intent and implicit or explicit assumptions in SDO specifications using
    the common terminology. Such clarifications would aid IoT practitioners and potential
    adopters to make meaningful comparisons and facilitate selection of IoT specifications
    that are the best fit for their intended purpose. To that end, we propose that
    creators of IoT standards address a list of questions that would characterize
    their work in comparable ways, somewhat akin to the intent of nutrition labels
    for food. This paper describes the basic design principles and practices of IoT
    information and data model definitions, and proposes an initial list of questions
    that SDOs may address to facilitate understanding and comparisons. Our intent
    is to evolve and refine this list over time by actively soliciting and incorporating
    feedback and suggestions of IoT community.</p>"
