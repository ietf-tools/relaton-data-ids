abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose to use an IPv6 tunneling mechanism and encapsulate IPv4
    packets into IPv6 packets. This eases the transition and routers do not need to
    support IPv6 and IPv4 routing tables. The IN_ADDR.arpa domain is used to find
    IPv4 to IPv6 correspondence in a way that does not prevent the asymmetrical routing
    and multi-homing. The model also simplifies IPv4 address management since the
    address has no more a localization function but only an identification function.</p>"
