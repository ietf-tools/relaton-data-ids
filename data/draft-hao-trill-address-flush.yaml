abstract:
- content: "<p>The TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol,
    by default, learns end station addresses from observing the data plane. This document
    specifies a message by which an originating TRILL switch can explicitly request
    other TRILL switches to flush certain MAC reachability learned through the egress
    of TRILL Data packets. This is a supplement to the TRILL automatic address forgetting
    and can assist in achieving more rapid convergence in case of topoogy or configuration
    change.</p>"
