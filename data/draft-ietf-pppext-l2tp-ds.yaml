abstract:
- content: "<p>The L2TP document [1] defines the base protocol which describes the
    method of tunneling PPP [2] data. The L2TP base protocol does not address any
    Differential Services extensions. Since the market is reluctant to outsource dial
    access without any Quality of Service assurances, this draft addresses this problem
    by allowing each L2TP Data Session to be assigned an appropriate differential
    services indicator.</p>"
