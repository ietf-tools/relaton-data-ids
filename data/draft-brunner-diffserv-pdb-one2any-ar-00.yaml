abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) called one-to-any
    Assured Rate. The PDB is useful to implement services in a Differentiate Services
    domain, which need an assured rate. The assurance is given with a certain well-defined
    probability for traffic using this PDB. However, no delay and no jitter guarantees
    are provided.</p>"
