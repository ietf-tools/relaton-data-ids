abstract:
- content: "<p>TMMH is a 'universal' hash function suitable for message authentication
    in the Wegman-Carter paradigm. It is simple, quick, and especially appropriate
    for Digital Signal Processors and other processors with a fast multiply operation.
    This document specifies version two of TMMH, which eliminates the large storage
    requirement for hashing large messages that was present in version one.</p>"
