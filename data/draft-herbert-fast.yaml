abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets (FAST) protocol.
    This is a generic and extensible protocol for hosts to signal network nodes to
    request services or to gain admission into a network. A ticket is data that accompanies
    a packet and indicates a granted right to traverse a network or a request for
    network services to be applied (in the latter case the ticket serves as a service
    profile). Applications request tickets from a local agent in their network and
    attach issued tickets to packets. Firewall tickets are issued to grant packets
    the right to traverse a network; service tickets indicate the desired service
    to be applied to packets. A single ticket may provide both firewall and service
    ticket information and semantics. Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</p>"
