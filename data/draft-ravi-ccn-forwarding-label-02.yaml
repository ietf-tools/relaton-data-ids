abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to enable ID and Locator namespace
    split in the CCN protocol that has several applications such as towards Interest
    routing optimization, mobility, handling indirections in manifests, and routing
    scalability. We enable this through the notion of forwarding-label (FL) object,
    which is an optional hop-by-hop payload in the Interest message with a locator
    name which identifies a network domain, router, or a host. Depending on the application
    and trust context, an FL object can be subjected to policy based actions by the
    forwarders such as invoking security verification or enabling other service-centric
    actions such as FL object replacement. FL object can be inserted by the applications
    or by the network. To enable dynamic name resolution FL objects can also be modified
    in the network by designated points such as the edge routers.</p>"
