abstract:
- content: "<p>White space allocation and reutilization has attracted increasing attention
    since they allow a more efficient way to gather spectrum usage information and
    keep assigning a proper spectrum to a secondary user. This document provides an
    extended protocol to construct a specific white space usage map with better interaction
    between devices and spectrum database. By this mechanism, the Master device or
    Slave Device sends the environmental spectrum to the Database and obtains more
    frequency points to select the most appropriate white space spectrum it could
    use in the local regulatory domain. With regard to White Space Database, more
    white space information can be recorded for devices to choose. The mechanism is
    an extension of protocol to access spectrum database. We develop extended protocol
    data models under different scenarios to enhance interaction of these networks.</p>"
