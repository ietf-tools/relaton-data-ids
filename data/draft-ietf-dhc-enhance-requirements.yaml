abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a widely deployed
    framework for host registration and configuration [DHC]. DHCP, however, was designed
    only for fixed hosts on physically secure LANs. Other protocols fill some of the
    gap. PPP [PPP] is a good solution for many commercial service providers (where
    framing is needed). Mobile IP [MIP] is ideal for registering and configuring roaming
    users (when transparent address binding is needed). This still leaves many environments
    where there is no ideal solution, such as: roaming users who do not need transparent
    address binding e.g., a mobile web browser), and commercial service providers
    who want to support home networking with multiple nodes. This draft proposes DHCP
    as the best protocol to meet these new needs, because it leave open how (and whether)
    to provide other functions, such as framing (e.g., PPP), locating (e.g., Mobile
    IP in co-located mode), inter-domain AAA (e.g., [AAAR]), or address distribution
    (e.g., [DAAP]). We describe and solicit feedback on seven new requirements that
    would be placed on DHCP to meet these needs.</p>"
