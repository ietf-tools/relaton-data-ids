abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a detailed description of some scenarios where
    SIP Connectivity could be easily achieved only in a peer to peer fashion. Other
    than identifying use cases where a P2P SIP overlay Network is the only affordable
    solution, it describes how, under some circumstances, signaling and media communications
    both to and from public domains can be achieved with P2P SIP. Furthermore, it
    identifies some additional elements which can be shared by community members or
    let out by access providers for extending SIP Connectivity to such limited environments.</p>"
