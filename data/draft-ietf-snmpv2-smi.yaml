    residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base
    (MIB). Collections of related objects are defined in MIB modules. These modules
    are written using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1].
    It is the purpose of this document, the Structure of Management Information (SMI),
    to define that subset. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
