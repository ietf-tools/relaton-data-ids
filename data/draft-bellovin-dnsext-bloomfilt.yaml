abstract:
- content: "<p>Some aspects of DNSSEC, such as NXDOMAIN error messages, require an
    authenticated answer. Producing this answer requires complex mechanisms, online
    storage of the zone's secret key, expensive online computations, or massive zone
    files. As an alternative, we propose storage of authenticated pointers to Bloom
    filters. This scheme provides large reductions in the size of, and computational
    expense to produce, partially-signed zone files.</p>"
