abstract:
- content: "<p>Acknowledgement (ACK) is a basic function and implemented in most of
    the ordered and reliable transport protocols [RFC0793]. Traditional ACK is designed
    with high frequency to guarantee correct interaction between sender and receiver.
    Delayed byte-counting ACK or periodic ACK with large interval are proposed in
    prior work to reduce ACK intensity. High-throughput transport over wireless local
    area network (WLAN) becomes a demanding requirement with the emergence of 4K wireless
    projection, VR/AR-based interactive gaming, and more. However, the interference
    nature of the wireless medium induces an unavoidable contention between data transport
    and backward signaling, such as acknowledgement. This document presents the problems
    caused by high-intensity ACK in WLAN. We also analyze the possibility of ACK optimization
    in WLAN and the compatibility issues with existing systems.</p>"
