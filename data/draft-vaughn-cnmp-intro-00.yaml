abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the first
    version of the Condensed Network Management Protocol (CNMP) Framework. This Framework
    follows the Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv3), but CNMP provides
    a more efficient encoding of data by using Octet Encoding Rules (OER) coupled
    with a more compact set of message structures, including a set of "dynamic objects",
    which are defined at runtime, as originally used by the Simple Transportation
    Management Protocol (STMP). The document is intended to provide an option to using
    SNMPv3 and is not intended to replace SNMPv3. SNMPv3 will continue to offer the
    advantage of providing a conceptually simple protocol, whereas CNMP allows more
    compact messaging in high volume and bandwidth constrained environments.</p>
