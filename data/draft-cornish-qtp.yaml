abstract:
- content: "<p>QTP is a simple protocol for multiplexing short-duration connections
    over an arbitrary transport service such as UDP. QTP is an open standard to allow
    dial-up Credit Authorization Terminals (CAT) or Point-Of-Sale (POS) terminals
    to connect into IP hosts. These transactions require fast connection times, efficient
    concentration of many sessions, fault tolerant operation, and the ability to transfer
    access network addressing (called and calling numbers) along with transaction
    data.</p>"
