abstract:
- content: "<p>When the 5321.MailFrom domain in an e-mail message has a DNS MX Resource
    Record (RR), it is making an explicit statement that it is willing to accept email.
    However, when the domain has just a DNS A or AAAA RR, there mail clients cannot
    easily tell whether the domain accepts mail, as many hosts on the Internet advertise
    an A or AAAA RR regardless of whether they want to accept email. The NULL MX RR
    formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain announces that it accepts
    no mail.</p>"
