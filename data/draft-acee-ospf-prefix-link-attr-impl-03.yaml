abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the results of the OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attributes
    implementation survey. The survey has seven questions related to the implementer's
    support of OSPFv2 Prefix/Link Attributes. After a brief summary of the results,
    each response is listed. This document contains responses from six implementers
    who completed the survey. No external means were used to verify the accuracy of
    the information submitted by the respondents. The respondents are considered experts
    on the products they reported on. Additionally, responses were omitted from implementers
    who indicated that they have not implemented the function yet.</p>"
