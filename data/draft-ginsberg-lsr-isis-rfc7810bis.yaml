abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information
    networks (e.g., stock market data providers), network- performance criteria (e.g.,
    latency) are becoming as critical to data-path selection as other metrics. This
    document describes extensions to IS-IS Traffic Engineering Extensions (RFC 5305)
    such that network-performance information can be distributed and collected in
    a scalable fashion. The information distributed using IS-IS TE Metric Extensions
    can then be used to make path-selection decisions based on network performance.
    Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network-performance
    information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring network performance or
    acting on that information, once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.
    This document obsoletes RFC 7810.</p>"
