abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to minimize the delay induced
    by the presence of MPTCP-unfriendly nodes in some of the paths selected by a MPTCP
    endpoint, and which may support the establishment of MPTCP subflows. Concretely,
    this procedure allows a MPTCP endpoint to assess whether the networks the endpoint
    connects to are compliant with MPTCP signals or not. The procedure is not enabled
    for every new MPTCP connection; it is activated upon bootstrap or when a network
    attachment change occurs (e.g., attach to a new network, discover a new external
    IP address, etc.).</p>"
