abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes usecases and requirements for MPLS big label.
    The MPLS label format and encoding method have been specified in [RFC 3032], the
    label value is represented by 20-bit space and support up to 1 million of instances.
    This proven technology has been widely deployed and worked fine for years. However
    in certain network deployment scenarios of recent years, the 20-bit MPLS label
    space is no longer sufficient to support the widespread adoption of network virtualization
    technologies. In what follows we will describe each of the usecase respectively</p>"
