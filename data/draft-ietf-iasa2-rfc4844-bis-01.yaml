abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework for an RFC Series and an RFC
    Editor function that incorporate the principles of organized community involvement
    and accountability that has become necessary as the Internet technical community
    has grown, thereby enabling the RFC Series to continue to fulfill its mandate.
    Cover Note: {{ RFC Editor: Please remove this cover note prior to publication.
    }} The IASA2 WG asks the IAB to publish this replacement for RFC 4844. The document
    is changed for alignment with the new structure for the IETF Administrative Support
    Activity (IASA), eliminating all references to the IETF Administrative Oversight
    Committee (IAOC).</p>"
