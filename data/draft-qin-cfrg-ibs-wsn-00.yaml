abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an identity-based security scheme for wireless
    sensor network (WSN) on the basis of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE). Each cluster
    head can perform as a private key generator (PKG) in case that the sole PKG is
    captured, which will lead to the whole network disabled. The proposed scheme can
    reduce the consumption of key resources and improve the security of the WSN by
    dispersing PKG function. The analysis shows that the scheme can resist various
    attacks.</p>"
