abstract:
- content: "<p>The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates
    sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair of unidirectional
    IPsec security associations between these two nodes. The standard mechanism to
    secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent
    Nodes relies on the use of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent
    Node verifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Address and its
    Care-of Address. The mechanism also requires the correspondent node to send keying
    material to both of these addresses. RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism
    that allows a Mobile Node that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address
    (RFC 3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent its
    Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its Cryptographically Generated
    Addresses. Note that Cryptographically Generated Addresses have also been used
    to counter similar security issues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure
    Neighbor Discovery (RFC 3971.) This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a
    Mobile Node use a similar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its
    sent to its Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use of Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses.</p>"
