- content: "<p>The goal is to develop an architecture and protocols for the management
    and operation of server pools supporting highly reliable applications, and for
    client access mechanisms to a server pool. This document defines requirements
    and architecture for management and access to server pools, including requirements
    from a variety of applications, building blocks and interfaces, different styles
    of pooling, security requirements and performance requirements such as failover
    times and coping with heterogeneous latencies.</p>"
