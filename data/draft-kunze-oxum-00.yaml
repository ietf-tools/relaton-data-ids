- content: '<p>This document specifies "oxum", a two-part number, OCTETS.STREAMS,
    that is a kind of simple size summary for complex digital objects. In the mainstream
    case of a complex object that is a set of files, the STREAMS part is the total
    number of files and the OCTETS part is the total number of 8-bit bytes across
    all those files; for example, an oxum of 876543.21 could mean a total of 876,543
    bytes across 21 files. Which set of streams comprises a complex object for an
    oxum computation depends in general on the object''s type. One important type
    is the stream set defined by the set of files contained in a file hierarchy. An
    oxum is not a checksum in that, while a changed oxum means a changed object, an
    unchanged oxum does not mean an unchanged object.1. The size of a digital object
    It can be hard to characterize the size of an arbitrary digital object. Word count,
    page count, image dimensions, video running time, or number of database records
    might all be useful metrics, depending on the type of the object. For a single
    file, one crude but easily obtained metric is the number of octets (8-bit bytes)
    in the file. This document introduces an analogous metric for a _complex digital
    object_, by which we mean an object that is not equivalent to a single file. A
    complex object may consist of a group of files or parts of one or more files (e.g.,
    a database).2. The octet stream sum (oxum) A complex digital object that has a
    well-defined set of octet streams, such as a document represented by a group of
    14 text and image files, has a well-defined "oxum" (octet stream sum). The oxum
    is a two part number such as 567898.14 which corresponds to 567,898 octets spread
    over 14 files. The general form of an oxum is OCTETS.STREAMS where STREAMS is
    the total number of streams (e.g., files) and OCTETS is the total number of octets
    across all those streams. In general, these two numbers will be positive integers,
    although there may be situations (not described here) in which it makes sense
    for either one of them to be left unspecified with a hyphen (''-''). The period
    (''.'') separator is required. Other examples: 1998.10 # 1998 octets spread over
    10 streams 105.3 # 105 octets, 3 streams (not 105 and 3 tenths) 21436794142.831
    # almost 19 Gigabytes spread over 831 streams 709895249489.8756 # about 661 Gb,
    or 710 Gb if you divide by 1000 -.1 # one stream, but number of octets not known
    yet The oxum is designed to be machine readable and to fit into a variety of syntactic
    contexts, such as command lines, file paths, URL [RFC3986] query strings, and
    XML [XML] tags. Note that the oxum is _not_ designed as a secure digest or checksum.
    While an oxum cannot change without a change to the object, an unchanged oxum
    absolutely does not imply an unchanged object. Do not use oxum in place of a cryptographic
    digest algorithm (cf. SHA1 [RFC3174]).3. Oxum complex object types An _oxum object
    type_ is used to describe how to derive an object''s stream set. For oxum to be
    meaningful for an object type, the type must have a well-defined, canonical stream
    set. Once the stream set is known, the oxum computation is straightforward and
    the streams can be processed in any order. One especially natural way to derive
    a stream set is to define a way to reduce an object type to a file group. Files
    are primal streams. In this document, a "regular" file is a contiguous sequence
    of octets with a well-defined start and end, whether the sequence is named in
    static storage (e.g., "memo.pdf") or is unnamed and recently retrieved (e.g.,
    a web page) from a network socket. There are many filesystem entities that are
    not regular files, including directory nodes, block special files, and symbolic
    links. In this document, the word "file" usually refers to a regular file. A (regular)
    file is an oxum-ready stream. As a base case, a complex object consisting of exactly
    one file has an oxum of the form "OCTETS.1", as in 12345.1 Things get more interesting
    when dealing with more than one file. Any private or public agreement can be made
    about what constitutes a file group, hence a stream set, for the purposes of an
    oxum computation. A stream set might be declared to comprise all the attachments
    of an email message, or all the files resulting from a normalized dump procedure
    run against the tables of a database. An easily delineated group is all the files
    contained in a directory. Any recognized group of regular files can form on oxum
    stream set, including a simple manifest or list of filenames. For example, a transfer
    protocol might use oxum to help set the receiver''s expectations in terms of total
    bytes and files contained in a transferred package [GRABIT].</p>'
