abstract:
- content: "<p>In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127 prefix
    lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers. Under certain situations,
    this may lead to one router claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast
    being implemented. This document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions
    to the problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided between two routers.</p>"
