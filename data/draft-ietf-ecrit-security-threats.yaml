abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the security threats associated with the marking
    of signalling messages to indicate that they are related to an emergency, and
    with the process of mapping locations to Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)
    that point to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). This mapping occurs as part
    of the process of routing emergency calls through the IP network. Based on the
    identified threats, this document establishes a set of security requirements for
    the mapping protocol and for the handling of emergency-marked calls. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
