abstract:
- content: "<p>The NSIS operation will be greatly affected by the multihoming development
    in IETF such as Monami6, Shim6, etc. Solutions from these groups introduce different
    architecture elements and assumptions to the network layer, and thus render the
    current NSIS protocols ineffective or irrelevant. This draft provides an analysis
    of the multhoming scenarios that have impacts on the NSIS operation. Requirements
    for NSIS multihoming support are derived from the discussions of the NSIS applicability
    in these scenarios.</p>"
