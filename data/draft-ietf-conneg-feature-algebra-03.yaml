abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of Internet application protocols have a need to provide content
    negotiation for the resources with which they interact [1]. A framework for such
    negotiation is described in [2]. Part of this framework is a way to describe the
    range of media features which can be handled by the sender, recipient or document
    transmission format of a message. A format for a vocabulary of individual media
    features and procedures for registering media features are presented in [3]. This
    document describes an algebra and syntax that can be used to define feature sets
    which are formed from combinations and relations involving individual media features.
    Such feature sets are used to describe the media feature handling capabilities
    of message senders, recipients and file formats. This document also outlines an
    algorithm for feature set matching.</p>"
