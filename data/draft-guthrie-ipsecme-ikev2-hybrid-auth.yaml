abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow hybrid non-composite authentication. The intended purpose
    for this extension is to enable the use of a Post-Quantum (PQ) digital signature
    and X.509 certificate in addition to the use of a traditional authentication method.
    This document enables peers to signify support for hybrid non-composite authentication,
    and send additional CERTREQ, AUTH, and CERT payloads to perform multiple authentications.</p>"
