abstract:
- content: "<p>Microsoft released a commercial Instant Messaging product in July of
    1999 called MSN Messenger Service. This document describes the protocol used by
    that product for core instant messaging and presence functionality. While this
    protocol does not meet many of the requirements of the IMPP working group, it
    is provided as background information on existing Instant Messaging implementations.
    This protocol is provided 'as is' without warranty of any kind.</p>"
