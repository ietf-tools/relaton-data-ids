abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model
    in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.
    These challenges render traditional security key management mechanisms infeasible
    since round trip delays may exceed the duration of communication opportunities.
    This document therefore proposes requirements and outlines a design for security
    key management in DTNs.</p>"
