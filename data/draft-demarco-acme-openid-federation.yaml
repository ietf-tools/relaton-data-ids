abstract:
- content: "<p>The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol allows
    server operators to obtain TLS certificates for their websites, based on a demonstration
    of control over the website's domain via a fully-automated challenge/response
    protocol. OpenID Federation 1.0 defines how to build a trust infrastructure using
    a trusted third-party model. It uses a trust evaluation mechanism to attest the
    possession of public keys, protocol specific metadata and various administrative
    and technical information related to a specific entity. This document defines
    how X.509 certificates associated with a given OpenID Federation Entity can be
    issued by an X.509 Certification Authority through the ACME protocol to the organizations
    which are part of a federation built on top of OpenID Federation 1.0.</p>"
