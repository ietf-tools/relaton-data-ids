abstract:
- content: "<p>Optimizations to the PIM-DM protocol [RFC3973] are proposed that dramatically
    reduce the PIM-DM routing overhead on local area networks containing large numbers
    of PIM routers. These optimizations reduce the likelihood of two or more routers
    emitting redundant JOIN or PRUNE messages onto the same LAN. While these optimizations
    are of general applicability to large LANs, they were motivated in particular
    by performance requirements for supporting PIM-DM across LANs emulated by IP tunneling
    over large wireless MANETs. PIM-DM routers supporting these optimizations will
    interoperate with standard PIM-DM as defined in RFC 3973, even on the same LAN.
    However, to obtain maximum benefit from these optimizations, all PIM-DM routers
    on the LAN SHOULD support them.</p>"
