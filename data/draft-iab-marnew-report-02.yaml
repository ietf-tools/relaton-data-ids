abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and GSM Association (GSMA) held
    a joint workshop on Managing Radio Networks in an Encrypted World (MaRNEW), on
    September 24-25, 2015. This workshop aimed to discuss solutions for bandwidth
    optimization on mobile networks for encrypted content, as current solutions rely
    on unencrypted content, which is not indicative of the security needs of today's
    Internet users. The workshop gathered IETF attendees, IAB members, and participants
    from various organizations involved in the telecommunications industry including
    original equipment manufacturers, content providers, and mobile network operators.
    The group discussed Internet encryption trends and deployment issues identified
    within the IETF and the privacy needs of users that should be adhered to. Solutions
    designed around sharing data from the network to the endpoints and vice versa
    were then discussed; in addition, issues experienced when using current transport-layer
    protocols were also discussed. Content providers and Content Delivery Networks
    (CDNs) gave their own views of their experiences delivering their content with
    mobile network operators. Finally, technical responses to regulation were discussed
    to help the regulated industries relay the issues of impossible-to-implement or
    bad-for-privacy technologies back to regulators. A group of suggested solutions
    were devised, which will be discussed in various IETF groups moving forward.</p>"
