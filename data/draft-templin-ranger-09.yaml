abstract:
- content: <p>RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing
    in networks with global enterprise recursion. The term "enterprise network" within
    this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios,
    where an "enterprise" can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network,
    as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation,
    or as large as the global Internet itself. Such networks will require an architected
    solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations
    for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security. These
    considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles
    apply even for clean-slate approaches. The RANGER architecture addresses these
    requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.
