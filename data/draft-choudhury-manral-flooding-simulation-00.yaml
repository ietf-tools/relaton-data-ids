abstract:
- content: "<p>The full flooding of LSAs in OSPF may cause large CPU and memory consumption
    at node processors of a network with large number of nodes, links, adjacencies
    per node and LSDB size. An LSA storm, defined as the near-simultaneous update
    of a large number of LSAs, in such networks may cause network instability and
    outage. We do a simulation study of four alternative algorithms to full flooding
    to determine their ability to handle large LSA storms. Algorithm 2 does full flooding
    but in case two neighbors are connected by multiple interfaces, flooding is done
    over only one such interface. The other algorithms are based on Algorithm 2 and
    employ further flooding restrictions. In Algorithm 3 each node asks only a subset
    of its one-hop neighbors, known as multipoint relays, to flood further. In Algorithm
    4 flooding is done only over a minimum spanning tree. Algorithm 5 uses full flooding
    (as in Algorithm 2) for LSAs carrying intra-area topology information and restricted
    flooding over a minimum spanning tree (as in Algorithm 4) for other LSAs.</p>"
