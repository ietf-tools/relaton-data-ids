abstract:
- content: <p>The Link Management Protocol (LMP) is defined to manage traffic engineering
    (TE) links. In its present form, LMP focuses on peer nodes, i.e., nodes that peer
    in signaling and/or routing. This document proposes extensions to LMP to allow
    it to be used between a peer node and an adjacent optical line system (OLS). These
    extensions are intended to satisfy the "Optical Link Interface Requirements" described
    in a companion document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
