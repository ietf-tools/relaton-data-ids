abstract:
- content: "<p>Application-aware Networking (APN) aims to convey Application-aware
    Information (APN attribute) including APN ID and APN parameters indicating application
    group-level and user group-level requirements along with the data packets into
    the network and enable the network to provide corresponding fine-granular network
    services. There have been challenges of the privacy and security issues that could
    potentially be introduced by conveying the APN attribute into the network. This
    document describes the security and privacy considerations of APN in various possible
    scenarios wherein APN will be deployed.</p>"
