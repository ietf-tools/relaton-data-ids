    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
    In particular, it describes a representation of the authentication communities
    defined in the companion memo: Authentication and Privacy in the SNMP as objects
    in the Internet Standard MIB. These definitions are consistent with the administrative
    strategies set forth in the companion memo: Administration of SNMP Communities.</p>"
