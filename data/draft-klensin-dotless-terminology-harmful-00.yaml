abstract:
- content: <p>The history of the DNS has included a great deal of confusion about
    terminology that has, in turn, led to discussions in which different parties have
    used the same words for different things. For example, "host name" has been used
    to describe both fully-qualified domain names with particular properties and the
    first label component of such names. While established inconsistent uses may be
    impossible to correct, it is in the interest of the community to avoid increasing
    the confusion. There have recently been a number of discussions about "dotless
    domains" with at least four different definitions used or implied in different
    contexts. This document explains those uses and recommends avoiding the use of
    the term.</p>
