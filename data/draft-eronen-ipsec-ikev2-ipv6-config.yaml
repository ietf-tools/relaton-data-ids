abstract:
- content: "<p>When IKEv2 is used for remote VPN access (client to VPN gateway), the
    gateway assigns the client an IP address from the internal network using IKEv2
    configuration payloads. The configuration payloads specified in RFC 4306 work
    well for IPv4, but make it difficult to use certain features of IPv6. This document
    describes the limitations of current IKEv2 configuration payloads for IPv6, and
    explores possible solutions that would allow IKEv2 to set up full- featured virtual
    IPv6 interfaces.</p>"
