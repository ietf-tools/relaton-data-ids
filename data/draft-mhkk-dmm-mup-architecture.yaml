abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture for
    Distributed Mobility Management. The requirements for Distributed Mobility Management
    described in [RFC7333] can be satisfied by routing fashion. In MUP Architecture,
    session information between the entities of the mobile user plane is turned to
    routing information so that mobile user plane can be integrated into dataplane.
    MUP architecture is designed to be pluggable user plane part of existing mobile
    service architectures, enabled by auto-discovery for the use plane. Segment Routing
    provides network programmability for a scalable option with it. While MUP architecture
    itself is independent from a specific dataplane protocol, several dataplane options
    are available for the architecture. This document describes IPv6 dataplane in
    Segment Routing case due to the DMM requirement, and is suitable for mobile services
    which require a large IP address space.</p>"
