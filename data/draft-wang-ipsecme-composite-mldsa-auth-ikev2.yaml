abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft specifies composite ML-DSA authentication in the Internet
    Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296]. Namely, the authenticaiton
    in the IKEv2 is completed by using a compiste signature of ML-DSA [FIPS203], the
    newly post-quantum digital singature standard, and one of the following traditional
    singature algorithms, SA-PKCS#1v1.5, RSA-PSS, ECDSA, Ed25519, and Ed448. These
    concrete composite algorithm specifications follow [OGPKF24]. Composite ML-DSA
    authenticatio is achieved by asking to add a new value in the "IKEv2 Authentication
    Method" registry [IANA-IKEv2], mantained by IANA. After that, two peers MUST send
    the SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS Notify, defined in [RFC9593], to negotiate the specific
    composite ML-DSA algoithms. [EDNOTE: Code points for composite ML-DSA authentication
    may need to be assigned in the "IKEv2 Authentication Method" registry, maintained
    by IANA]</p>'
