abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the proposal for a SIP extension to allow authentication
    of a user-agent through a proxy to a RADIUS server using CHAP put forward by Byerly
    and Williams [BYERLY]. An alternative method is offered which does not require
    any changes to the SIP protocol as defined in [SIP]. It also will not require
    any modification to the way RADIUS clients communicate with RADIUS Servers [RADIUS],
    although it will change the way some of the fields are interpreted by the RADIUS
    server.</p>"
