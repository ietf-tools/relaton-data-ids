abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is focused on how to serve time critical
    flow with low data loss and bounded delay. Unlike contemporary solution which
    improves QoS such as TE, redundant bandwidth provisioning and dedicated channel
    reservation, DetNet provides more general approaches that use IP-based techniques
    and guarantee the worst-case latency of DetNet flows while allowing sharing among
    best-effort flows. For this purpose, DetNet may require upgraded or redefined
    data plane as well as control plane, since current networking cannot assure maximum
    end-to-end latency. This document describes some technical requirements on possible
    data plane, control plane and DetNet flow modeling that can help to clarify those
    capabilities DetNet should have.</p>"
