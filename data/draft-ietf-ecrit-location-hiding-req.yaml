abstract:
- content: "<p>The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency
    Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group describes an
    architecture where location information is provided by access networks to endpoints
    or Voice over IP (VoIP) service providers in order to determine the correct dial
    string and information to route the call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
    To determine the PSAP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), the usage of the Location-to-Service
    Translation (LoST) protocol is envisioned. This document provides a problem statement
    and lists requirements for situations where the Internet Access Provider (IAP)
    and/or the Internet Service Provider (ISP) are only willing to disclose limited
    or no location information. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
