abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a POF-ICN based multihoming transmission framework.POF
    is an SDN forwarding plane technology proposed by Huawei,we use it to enable information-centric
    networking (ICN). The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture
    of the multihoming transmission system.we first describe the relationships among
    the various components of mobile networks and the newly added entities, such as
    Mobility management and Session management.Then we describe the Multihoming transmission
    operation flow to to outline what each components needs to accomplish and to how
    these components and mechanisms fit together.</p>"
