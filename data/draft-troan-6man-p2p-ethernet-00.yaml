abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet topology is no longer a shared medium. It is a long time since
    Ethernet has been a thick yellow cable snaking its way from station to station.
    Ethernet is now effectively deployed in a hub and spoke topology. With a point
    to point link between a host and the network device. This memo describes a set
    of simplications for how to run IP over such links, where the physical topology
    is exposed in the network layer topology.</p>"
