abstract:
- content: "<p>Some services provided by intermediaries depend on the ability to inspect
    the message bodies in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). When sensitive information
    is included in these bodies, a SIP User Agent (UA) needs to protect it from intermediaries
    except those that the UA agreed to disclose it to. This document proposes a mechanism
    for securing information passed between an end user and intermediaries using S/MIME.
    It also proposes mechanisms for an intermediary to notify the UA about its need
    to inspect an S/MIME-secured message body, and to notify the need for the message
    body to be transmitted securely.</p>"
