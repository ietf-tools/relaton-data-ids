abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a change to the way that IPv6 link local addresses
    are constructed, so that a node can guarantee that all of its link local addresses
    are unique within the node. The current definition of a link local address, a
    well known prefix, some number of zero bits, and a link specific unique token,
    ensures that it will be unique on the link, which is what is required for communications
    using those addresses over the link, but does not require uniqueness of the addresses
    within a node. In some cases all of a nodes interfaces may share the same link
    local address. Even the possibility of this means that link local addresses, which
    may in some situations be the only addresses that exist, cannot be used for internal
    definition of interfaces, or other purposes within the node. This draft suggests
    a method by which nodes may overcome this problem, by redefining the bits between
    the prefix and the token to be available to be used by the node to cause the addresses
    to be unique.</p>"
