abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network
    nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate incipient congestion
    to the endpoints. Receivers with an ECN-capable transport protocol feed back this
    information to the sender. ECN was originally specified for TCP in such a way
    that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recent
    new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center TCP (DCTCP) or
    Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate ECN feedback
    information whenever more than one marking is received in one RTT. This document
    updates the original ECN specification in RFC 3168 to specify a scheme that provides
    more than one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header. Given TCP header space
    is scarce, it allocates a reserved header bit previously assigned to the ECN-Nonce.
    It also overloads the two existing ECN flags in the TCP header. The resulting
    extra space is exploited to feed back the IP-ECN field received during the 3-way
    handshake as well. Supplementary feedback information can optionally be provided
    in two new TCP option alternatives, which are never used on the TCP SYN. The document
    also specifies the treatment of this updated TCP wire protocol by middleboxes.</p>"
