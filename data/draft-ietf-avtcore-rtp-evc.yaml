abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding standard
    ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1 [EVC], also known as Essential Video Coding
    [EVC] and developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 (MPEG). The RTP payload format allows
    for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each
    RTP packet payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.
    The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video
    streaming, and high-bitrate entertainment-quality video, among other applications.</p>"
