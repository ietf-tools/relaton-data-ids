abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a uniform programmatic interface to the Internet
    name resolution system, in which differences between IPv4, IPv6, IPX, and CLNP
    are irrelevant to the applications programmer. This work was originally motivated
    by the desire to minimize the impact on standard BSD utilities to support TUBA,
    but work equally well for IPv6.</p>"
