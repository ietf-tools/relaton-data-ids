abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generic Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol depends on
    packet interception to identify the nodes that should participate in signalling
    sessions. The base protocol assumes n-tuple analysis of the packet header as the
    interception algorithm. This document describes an experimental extension to GIST
    to use the Router Alert Option (RAO) to enhance interception efficiency. It describes
    the tradeoffs in using such an approach including the impact on legacy equipment
    and protocol deployability, and also the considerations to be taken into account
    in selecting values for the RAO value field.</p>"
