abstract:
- content: "<p>ISA100.11a is a Working Group at the ISA SP100 standard committee that
    covers Wireless Systems for Industrial Automation and Process Control. The WG
    is mandated to design a scalable, industrial grade LowPAN for devices such as
    sensors, valves, and actuators. The upcoming standard uses the 6LoWPAN format
    for the network header. It also introduces the concept of a Backbone Router to
    merge small LoWPANs via a high speed transit and scale the ISA100.11a network.
    This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the Backbone Router concept.</p>"
