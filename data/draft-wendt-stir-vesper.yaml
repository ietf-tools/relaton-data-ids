abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the STIR architecture by defining a secure telephone
    identity token and PASSporT with a type of “vesper” and specifies the use of Selective
    Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) for representing persona related claim information intended
    to be associated with verifiable information such as the assignment of a telephone
    number or the output of a Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB)
    type of vetting process or Rich Call Data (RCD) or claims of consent provided
    to the telephone number holder. It defines logical roles that form trusted relationships
    to establish overall eco-system trust. These roles are in the context of a Subject
    Entity (SE) that is the end entity that is the holder and has the right to use
    a telephone number. An Issuing Agent (IA) establishes the Subject Entity to the
    perform the initial vetting and establishment of the persona to the eco-system.
    A Notary Agent (NA) is a neutral role that maintains a graph of relationships
    between all roles, claims, and identities with a corresponding transparency log
    that generates verifiable receipts to “notarize” the recording of these relationships
    and claims being established. Importantly, privacy is enabled in this Notary role
    because the submitters have the option of submitting hashes of claims to protect
    information, or may usefully want to publicly declare their association to a claim
    to allow the public monitoring to avoid duplicate, mistaken or negligent claims
    which can be identified before enabling any illegitimate usage in the eco-system.
    A Claim Agent (CA) is a party that produces claims in the form of SD-JWT + receipts
    from the NA. There is multiple specific claim agent types and the claims definitions
    of key value pairs they are required or optionally can include. These SD- JWT
    + receipt objects are then collected by the SE into a digital wallet that it can
    then use for selective disclosure presentation and incorporate into a “vesper”
    PASSporT with different “vesper” claim SD-JWT + receipt objects and signed by
    the delegate certificate with telephone number to tie the telephone number back
    to the SE.</p>"
