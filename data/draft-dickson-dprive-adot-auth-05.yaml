abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism for DNS resolvers to discover
    support for TLS transport to authoritative DNS servers, to validate this indication
    of support, and to authenticate the TLS certificates involved. This requires that
    the name server _names_ are in a DNSSEC signed zone. This also requires that the
    delegation of the zone served is protected by [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack], since
    the NS names are the keys used for discovery of TLS transport support. Additional
    recommendations relate to use of various techniques for efficiency and scalability,
    and new EDNS options to minimize round trips and for signaling between clients
    and resolvers.</p>"
