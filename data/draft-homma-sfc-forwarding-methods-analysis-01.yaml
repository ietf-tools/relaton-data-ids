abstract:
- content: <p>Some working groups of the IETF and other Standards Developing Organizations
    are now discussing use cases of a technology that enables data packets to traverse
    appropriate service functions located remotely through networks. This is called
    Service Chaining in this document. (Also, in Network Functions Virtualisation
    (NFV), a subject that forwarding packets to required service functions in appropriate
    order is called VNF Forwarding Graph.) This draft does not focus only on SFC method,
    and thus, use the term "Service Chaining". SFC may be one of approaches to realize
    Service Chaining. There are several Service Chaining methods to forward data packets
    to service functions, and the applicable methods will vary depending on the service
    requirements of individual networks. This document presents the results of analyzing
    packet forwarding methods and path selection patterns for achieving Service Chaining.
    For forwarding data packets to the appropriate service functions, distribution
    of route information and steering data packets following the route information,
    are required. Examples of route information are packet identifier and the routing
    configurations based on the identifier. Also, forwarding functions are required
    to decide the path according to the route information.</p>
