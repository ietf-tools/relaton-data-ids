abstract:
- content: "<p>Data centers have become critical components of the infrastructure
    used by network operators to provide services to their customers. Data centers
    are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by gateway routers and one
    data center typically has more than one gateway for commercial, load balancing,
    and resiliency reasons. Segment routing is a popular protocol mechanism for operating
    within a data center, but also for steering traffic that flows between two data
    center sites. In order that one data center site may load balance the traffic
    it sends to another data center site it needs to know the complete set of gateway
    routers at the remote data center, the points of connection from those gateways
    to the backbone network, and the connectivity across the backbone network. This
    document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to allow
    each gateway router to advertise the routes to the prefixes in the data center
    site to which it provides access, and also to advertise on behalf of each other
    gateway to the same data center site.</p>"
