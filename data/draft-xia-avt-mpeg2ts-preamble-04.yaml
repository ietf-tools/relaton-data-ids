abstract:
- content: "<p>The ITU-T Rec. H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS)
    addresses the combining of one or more elementary streams of video and audio,
    as well as other data, into single or multiple streams which are suitable for
    storage or transmission. The necessary and sufficient information contained in
    the Program Specific Information(PSI) tables to demultiplex and present programs
    must be acquired before a RTP receiver can process any data received in MPEG2-TS.
    In this document, a Retransmission Server is specified to deliver MPEG2-TS preamble
    prior to unicast burst RTP packets. The Retransmission Server caches raw RTP packets
    with MPEG2-TS preamble information, and sends them to the RTP receiver which initiates
    rapid acquisition of MPEG2-TS multicast sessions.</p>"
