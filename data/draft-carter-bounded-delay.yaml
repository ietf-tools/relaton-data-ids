abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a proposed new service class for the internet
    which is intended to provide for some small proportion of the total traffic on
    each link, a quantifiable, low-delay service having essentially no packet-loss.
    We call this proposed service, Bounded- delay (BD). The approach is consistent
    with the architecture and philosophy of diff-serv, and could potentially make
    use of the proposed EF PHB. BD is similar in many respects to Premium service
    which has been described previously [Twobit], except that BD is intended specifically
    to allow control of end-to-end delay in a quantifiable manner.</p>"
