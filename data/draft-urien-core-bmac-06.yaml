abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft context, things are powered by micro controllers units
    (MCU) comprising a set of memories such as static RAM (SRAM), FLASH and EEPROM.
    The total memory size, ranges from 10KB to a few megabytes. In this context code
    and data integrity are major security issues, for the deployment of Internet of
    Things infrastructure. The goal of the bijective MAC (bMAC) is to compute an integrity
    value, which cannot be guessed by malicious software. In classical keyed MACs,
    MAC is computing according to a fixed order. In the bijective MAC, the content
    of N addresses is hashed according to a permutation P (i.e. bijective application).
    The bijective MAC key is the permutation P. The number of permutations for N addresses
    is N!. So the computation of the bMAC requires the knowledge of the whole space
    memory; this is trivial for genuine software, but could very difficult for corrupted
    software, especially for time stamped bMAC.</p>"
