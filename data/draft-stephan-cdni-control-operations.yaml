abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the role of the CDNI control interface and proposes
    a framework clarifying the control operations for CDNI. It does not make any assumption
    about the protocol implementation, which may be either manual or automated. Furthermore,
    both uCDN and dCDN could initiate Control operations.</p>"
