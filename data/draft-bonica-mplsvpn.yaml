abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures that can be used to deliver MPLS
    services over Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN). Using these procedures,
    a VPN customer can signal MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP) from Customer Edge (CE)
    router to CE router. Although a Service Provider (SP) network carries the Customer
    LSP (C-LSP) from one CE router to another, the C-LSP does not interact with the
    SP network's routing or signaling infrastructure.</p>"
