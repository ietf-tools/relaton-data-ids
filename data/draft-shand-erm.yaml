abstract:
- content: "<p>Conventional multicast builds a tree structure from the source of a
    multicast stream to the destinations of that stream. Multicast packets are forwarded
    from the sources down the tree by each intervening router. Each router contains
    state information to determine the next hop forwarding destination(s) for a packet.
    Where there are a large number of groups, this gives rise to a scaling problem.
    The amount of state to be stored in the routers becomes impossibly large. It is
    attractive to consider the use of multicast to provide applications such as n-way
    voice and video conferencing, which would require a very large number (perhaps
    millions) of relatively small (between 3 and 10 members) multicast groups.</p>"
