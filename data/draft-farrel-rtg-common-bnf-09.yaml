abstract:
- content: "<p>Several protocols have been specified in the Routing Area of the IETF
    using a common variant of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of representing message syntax.
    However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF. There is value
    in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly used
    together. This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation. Updating existing
    documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented
    would be a substantial piece of work. This document provides a formal definition
    of the variant of BNF that has been used (that we call Routing BNF) and makes
    it available for use by new protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
