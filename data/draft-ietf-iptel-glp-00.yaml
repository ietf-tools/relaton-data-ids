abstract:
- content: "<p>Given a gateway and a (possibly empty) list of gateway attributes,
    the 'gateway location problem' is to find a gateway serving the given phone number
    that satisfies the attribute set. This problem has also been referred to as the
    'call routing problem' as the answer returned may not be an IP-PSTN gateway but
    an intermediate signaling server. Part of the solution to this problem is the
    maintenance and distribution of the call routing tables. This document describes
    a protocol for maintaining a distributed call routing database across multiple
    administrative domains. The protocol uses the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol
    (SCSP) to maintain the distributed database. This document describes the problem
    of gateway location and a potential solution that uses SCSP as the foundation
    for distributing the call routing tables.</p>"
