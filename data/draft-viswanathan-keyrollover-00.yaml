abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the authentication for routing and management protocols
    based on preconfigured keys,the need and basis for key rollover, and an mechanism
    to seamlessly rollover the authentication keys. It is intended for an application
    where secure administrative access to all the end-points of the protocol connection
    is normally available. The strategy described herein improves upon the current
    practice where a key is preconifigured at all endpoints and the key rollover is
    done manually within a short synchronized window to avoid connection drops due
    to key mismatch.</p>"
