abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for IPv6-over-(foo)-over-IPv4
    links, where (foo) is either an encapsulating layer (e.g., UDP) or a NULL layer.
    It is essentially a lightweight, link-layer mechanism for neighbors to establish
    security associations, discover and dynamically re-adjust maximum receive unit
    (MRU) estimates, and perform unreachability detection. The protocol makes no attempt
    to ensure reliable message delivery; this function is performed by higher-layer
    protocols, e.g. TCP.</p>"
