abstract:
- content: "<p>It is expected that future mobile devices will equip multiple wireless
    interfaces in order to access the Internet ubiquitously. For such a multimode
    mobile node (MMN) that might have multiple home addresses to associate with its
    interfaces, the MMN has to keep its interfaces awake to listen the packets to
    these home addresses (HoAs). Therefore, the MMN consumes a considerable energy
    to maintain the reachablilities of these HoAs/interfaces. The draft presents the
    benefits to use multiple care-of addresses and/or home addresses to save the idle-mode
    power consumption of an MMN, and also discusses the impacts and the requirements
    of the existing IETF protocols to support the proposed low power operations.</p>"
