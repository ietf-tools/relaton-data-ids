abstract:
- content: "<p>Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established
    using signaling techniques, but their paths may first be determined. The Path
    Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate technology for
    the determination of the paths of P2MP TE LSPs. This document describes extensions
    to the PCE Communication Protocol PCEP) to handle requests and responses for the
    computation of paths for P2MP TE LSPs.</p>"
