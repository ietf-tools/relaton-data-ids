abstract:
- content: <p>Achieving internationalized access to domain names raises many complex
    issues. These are associated not only with basic protocol design, such as how
    names are represented on the network, compared, and converted to appropriate forms,
    but also with issues and options for deployment, transition, registration, and
    administration. The IETF Standards for Internationalized Domain Names, known as
    "IDNA", focuses on access to domain names in a range of scripts that is broader
    in scope than the original ASCII. The development process made it clear that use
    of characters with similar appearances and/or interpretations created potential
    for confusion, as well as difficulties in deployment and transition. The conclusion
    was that, while those issues were important, they could best be addressed administratively
    rather than through restrictions embedded in the protocols. This document defines
    a set of guidelines for applying restrictions of that type for Chinese, Japanese
    and Korean (CJK) scripts and the zones that use them and, perhaps, the beginning
    of a framework for thinking about other zones, languages, and scripts. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>
