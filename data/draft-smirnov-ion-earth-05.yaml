abstract:
- content: "<p>The EARTH could be positioned between MARS [1] and VENUS [2], however
    EARTH deals not only with address resolution but with routing issues as well.
    This document describes a solution simplifying distribution of IP multicast flows
    over ATM clouds with the use of point-to-multipoint connections. The EARTH solution
    includes: - the notion of multicast IP subnet over ATM; - IP multicast addresses
    (Class D) resolution to ATM addresses; - support for IP multicast shortcuts over
    multiple LISs and for the DVMRP capable egress routers; - support for a multicast
    group management and receiver-initiated quality of service (QoS) specification;
    - optional replication of EARTH servers with server synchronisation based on SCSP
    [3]. The current version of EARTH proposal has an extension to solve problems
    of ATM backbone for the Internet with DVMRP support over MLIS; while retaining
    support for ATM subnets (LANs). Another extension addresses redundant EARTH servers
    specifying, how SCSP protocol could be re-designed to run over MLIS.</p>"
