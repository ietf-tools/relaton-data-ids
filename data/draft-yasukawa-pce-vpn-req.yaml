abstract:
- content: <p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. An important application of MPLS and GMPLS
    networks is Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that may be constructed using Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in the MPLS and GMPLS networks as VPN tunnels. PCE may be
    applied as a tool to compute the paths of such tunnels in order to achieve better
    use of the network resources and to provide better levels of service to the VPN
    customers. Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication
    Protocol Generic Requirements". This document complements the generic requirements
    and presents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements that
    are specific to the application of PCE to VPNs.</p>
