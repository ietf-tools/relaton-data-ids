abstract:
- content: <p>The scenarios where Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)
    protocols interact with each other need special considerations. An analysis of
    all the scenarios that involve this interaction is necessary in order to provide
    guidelines to PMIPv6 protocol design and applicability. This document describes
    all identified possible scenarios, which require an interaction between PMIPv6
    and MIPv6 and discusses all issues related to these scenarios. Solutions to enable
    these scenarios are also described.Requirements Language The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
    2119 [RFC2119].</p>
