abstract:
- content: <p>This is an extension to the XDR specification to allow for bits to be
    described and sent. With protocols that have a large number of boolean values
    the existing standard requires each to be individually packed into a 32-bit value.
    This addition does not alter any existing XDR data streams or effect existing
    implementations. * This specification describes how to pack a bit-boolean and
    short bit-width data values into the 32-bit XDR block chunks. * And this specification
    describes how to describe them by extending "The XDR Language Specification" to
    include bits. * And a new namespace declaration type is specified to aid in the
    reduction of name collisions in large projects. While in draft status, a new Open
    Source XDR generation tool is being developed [xdrgen].</p>
