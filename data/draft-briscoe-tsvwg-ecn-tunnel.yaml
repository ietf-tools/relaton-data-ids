abstract:
- content: "<p>This document redefines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN)
    field of the outer IP header of a tunnel should be constructed. It brings all
    IP in IP tunnels (v4 or v6) into line with the way IPsec tunnels now construct
    the ECN field. It includes a thorough analysis of the reasoning for this change
    and the implications. It also gives guidelines on the encapsulation of IP congestion
    notification by any outer header, whether encapsulated in an IP tunnel or in a
    lower layer header. Following these guidelines should help interworking, if the
    IETF or other standards bodies specify any new encapsulation of congestion notification.</p>"
