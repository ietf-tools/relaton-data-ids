abstract:
- content: '<p>The IETF P2PI workshop conducted in the end of May 2008 at MIT in Boston
    has identified a number of potential documents for the IETF to work on. One is
    a transport protocol with congestion control mechanism that enables an advanced
    networking application to minimize the extra delay it induces in the bottleneck
    while implementing an end-to-end version of scavenger service. At least one such
    protocol has now been implemented by a major peer-to-peer application and deployed
    in the wild with favorable results. Another is a document that addresses community
    concerns about the use of multiple transport connections by peer-to-peer applications,
    both when these connections run to the same peer and to different peers. These
    two items appear to fall within the Transport area, but not within the charter
    of any existing working group. It is not obvious what WG''s charter could be naturally
    extended to encompass these two items. The TANA BoF is held to explore the problem
    space, gauge the interest in the problems within the Transport area, and to see
    if the community and the area directors believe that it makes sense to form a
    TANA working group within the Transport area chartered to work on 1. standardizing
    end-to-end congestion control that enables advanced application to minimize the
    delay they introduce into the network and a protocol using it and 2. a document
    describing the current practice of peer-to-peer apps'' use of multiple transport
    connections and recommendations in this space.1. Requirements notation The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in [RFC2119].2. Congestion control that minimizes delay and a UDP-based
    protocol using it The standard congestion control in TCP is based on loss and
    has not been designed to drive delay to any given value. Because TCP needs losses
    to back off, when a FIFO bottleneck lacks AQM, TCP fills the buffer, effectively
    maximizing possible delay. Large number of the thinnest links in the Internet,
    particularly most uplinks of home connections, lack AQM. They also frequently
    contain enough buffer space to get delays into hundreds of milliseconds and even
    seconds. There is no benefit to having delays this large, but there are very substantial
    drawbacks for interactive applications: games and VoIP become impossible and even
    web browsing becomes very slow. While a number of delay-based congestion control
    mechanisms have been proposed, they were generally not designed to minimize the
    delay induced in the network. It is desirable to have a congestion control mechanism
    that would allow to keep the latency across the congested bottleneck low even
    as it is saturated. This would allow applications that send large amounts of data,
    particularly upstream on home connections, such as peer-to-peer application, to
    operate without destroying the experience in interactive applications. It is possible
    to design congestion control mechanisms that take advantage of delay measurements
    and can back off before loss occurs. One such mechanism has been deployed by BitTorrent
    in the wild with the BitTorrent DNA client. This mechanism not only allows to
    keep delay across a bottleneck low, but also yields quickly in the presence of
    competing traffic with loss-based congestion control. Standardization of a congestion
    control mechanism that meets these design objectives would enable other advanced
    networking applications to better get out of the way of interactive apps. To deploy
    a protocol using such congestion control in today''s Internet, the protocol needs
    to be designed to work with existing deployed NATs, firewalls, and other middleboxes.
    This limits the choices of the transport framing to TCP and UDP. Modifying TCP
    is out of scope for TANA, because it is a more ambitious project while advanced
    applications can use a special protocol to talk among instances of themselves.
    This leaves us with UDP as the underlying framing for the protocol. In addition
    to direct and immediate benefits for advanced application, such congestion control
    would lay the foundation for a possible future evolution of the Internet where
    loss is not part of the designed behavior and delay is minimized.3. Use of multiple
    transport connections by peer-to-peer applications The community is concerned
    about the possible use of multiple transport connections by peer-to-peer clients,
    particularly if the goal of such use is to circumvent fairness mechanisms in TCP.
    Peer-to-peer clients are designed to open connections to multiple other peers
    to organize a well-connected mesh. For example, with just a single connection
    per peer, peers would pair off and be quickly out of trading material; with two
    connections, peers would form long chains that still promote segmentation and
    are fragile. There is confusion about whether peer-to-peer applications are also
    designed to open multiple connections to the same peer to get an unfair share
    of bottleneck capacity. (I am personally not familiar with examples of P2P clients
    that are designed to open multiple connections to the same destination, for any
    purpose.) While the use of multiple transport connections, even to the same destination,
    has been common since the advent of the web browser, peer-to-peer applications
    are believed by some to open an unusually large number of connections and send
    data for particularly long periods of time. The most common P2P protocol, BitTorrent,
    uses a mechanism called "choking" to limit the number of connections that actually
    send and receive data. Many more connections are open that used for data. Most
    connections are only used for small pieces of metadata. This further complicates
    the analysis and can create the impression that the peer uses many more connections
    than it actually does. Both the IETF transport community and the designers of
    P2P apps would benefit from clarity produced by a document that would 1. describe
    the current practice of multiple connections use by peer-to-peer apps and 2. make
    recommendations about the best such practices.</p>'
