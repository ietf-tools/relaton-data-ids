abstract:
- content: "<p>Revised Domain Name System (DNS) protocol extensions to authenticate
    the data in DNS and provide key distribution services have been defined in draft-ietf-dnssec-secext2-*.txt,
    which obsoletes the original DNS security protocol definition in RFC 2065. In
    addition, symetric key DNS transaction signatures have been defined in draft-
    ietf-dnsind-tsig-*.txt. Secure DNS Dynamic Update operations were also been defined
    [RFC 2137] in connection RFC 2065. This document updates secure dynamic update
    in light of draft-ietf-dnssec-secext2- *.txt and draft-ietf-dnsind-tsig-*.txt.
    It describes how to use digital signatures covering requests and data to secure
    updates and restrict updates to those authorized to perform them as indicated
    by the updater's possession of cryptographic keys.</p>"
