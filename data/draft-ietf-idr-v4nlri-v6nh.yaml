abstract:
- content: "<p>MultiProtocol-BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of Network Layer
    protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined
    by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier
    (SAFI). The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only have
    provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol
    when advertising an IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or a VPN-IPv4
    NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising an
    IPv4 NLRI or a VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6
    protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the
    address of the Next Hop for an IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the
    IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of the
    protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP
    Peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4
    NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.</p>"
