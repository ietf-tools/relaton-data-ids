abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a 'payload compression transform' based on the LZS
    compression algorithm. The transform can be used to compress the payload field
    of an IP datagram that uses the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) format. The
    compression transform proposed here is stateless, meaning that a datagram can
    be decompressed independently of any other datagram. Compression is performed
    prior to the encryption operation of ESP, which has the side benefit of reducing
    the amount of data that must be encrypted. This memo anticipates a forthcoming
    ESP document that will supercede [Atkins96]. The forthcoming document will allow
    for ESP payloads to be compressed via transforms such as the one described in
    this memo.</p>"
