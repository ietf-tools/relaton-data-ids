abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new IO_ADVISE operation for NFSv4.2 that clients
    can use to communicate expected I/O behavior to the server. By communicating future
    I/O behavior such as whether a file will be accessed sequentially or randomly,
    and whether a file will or will not be accessed in the near future, servers can
    optimize future I/O requests for a file by, for example, prefetching or evicting
    data. This operation can be used to support the posix_fadvise function as well
    as other applications such as databases and video editors.</p>"
