abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained devices are nodes with limited processing power, storage
    space, and transmission capacities. In many cases, these devices do not provide
    user interfaces, and they are often intended to interact without human intervention.
    This document includes a collection of representative use cases for authentication
    and authorization in constrained environments. These use cases aim at identifying
    authorization problems that arise during the life cycle of a constrained device
    and are intended to provide a guideline for developing a comprehensive authentication
    and authorization solution for this class of scenarios. Where specific details
    are relevant, it is assumed that the devices use the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) as a communication protocol. However, most conclusions apply generally.</p>"
