abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network
    nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate incipient congestion
    to the end-points. Receivers with an ECN- capable transport protocol feed back
    this information to the sender. ECN is specified for TCP in such a way that only
    one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recent new TCP
    mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center TCP (DCTCP) or Low Latency
    Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate ECN feedback information
    whenever more than one marking is received in one RTT. This document specifies
    a scheme to provide more than one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header. Given
    TCP header space is scarce, it allocates a reserved header bit, that was previously
    used for the ECN-Nonce which has now been declared historic. It also overloads
    the two existing ECN flags in the TCP header. The resulting extra space is exploited
    to feed back the IP- ECN field received during the 3-way handshake as well. Supplementary
    feedback information can optionally be provided in a new TCP option, which is
    never used on the TCP SYN.</p>"
