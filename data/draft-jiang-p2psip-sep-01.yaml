abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Service Extensible Protocol (SEP), which
    is the peer protocol spoken between P2PSIP Overlay peers to share information
    and organize the P2PSIP Overlay Network. SEP uses a flexible forwarding mechanism
    to avoid congestion in the Overlay. It also proposes a general service discovery
    method and a built-in NATtraversal mechanism. By using these methods, SEP tries
    to improve the success rate and reduce the latency of the transaction.</p>"
