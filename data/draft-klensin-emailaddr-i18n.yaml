abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalization of electronic mail addresses is, if anything,
    more important than the already-completed effort for domain names. In most of
    the contexts in which they are used, domain names can be hidden within or as part
    of various types of references. Email addresses, by contrast, are crucial: use
    of names of people or organizations as, or as part of, the email local part is,
    for obvious reasons, a well-established tradition on the network. Preventing people
    from spelling their names correctly is, in the long term, inexcusable. At the
    same time, email addresses pose a number of special problems -- they are more
    difficult than simple domain names in some respects, but actually easier in others.
    This document discusses the issues with internationalization of email addresses,
    explains why some obvious approaches are incompatible with the definitions and
    use of Internet mail, and proposes a solution -- for both addressing and email
    internationalization more generally -- that is likely to serve users and the network
    well for the long term.</p>"
