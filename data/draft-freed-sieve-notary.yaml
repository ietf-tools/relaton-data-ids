    and "redirect-deliverby" extensions to the Sieve email filtering language. The
    "envelope-dsn" and "envelope- deliverby" extensions provide access to additional
    envelope information provided by the delivery status notification (DSN) and Deliver-By
    SMTP extensions, respectively. The "redirect-dsn" and "redirect-deliverby" extensions
    extend Sieve's redirect action to provide control over delivery status notification
    and Deliver-By parameters, respectively. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
