abstract:
- content: <p>A number of applications and services running over IP/MPLS networks
    have strict requirements relating to their routing, or the performance of the
    path supporting their traffic flow, for instance, in terms of characteristics
    such as latency, loss, or bandwidth availability. Segment routing provides a means
    by which the data- plane of an IP/MPLS network can be programmed to support such
    "performance engineered" paths. This document describes an architecture for the
    use of such performance engineered label switched paths, and the control-plane
    functionality required to allow both distributed and centralised computation of
    acceptable forwarding paths.</p>
