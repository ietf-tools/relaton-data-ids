abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 rapid deployment (6rd) builds upon mechanisms of 6to4 (RFC3056)
    to enable a service provider to rapidly deploy IPv6 unicast service to its existing
    IPv4 sites. Like 6to4, it utilizes stateless IPv6 in IPv4 encapsulation in order
    to transit IPv4-only network infrastructure. Unlike 6to4, 6rd requires a service
    provider to use one of its own IP prefixes rather than the fixed 6to4 prefix.
    A service provider has used this mechanism for its own "rapid deployment" of IPv6
    (five weeks from first exposure to "opt-in" deployment for 1,500,000 residential
    sites).</p>
