abstract:
- content: "<p>Network survivability is the ability of a network to recover traffic
    delivery following failure or degradation of network resources. Survivability
    is critical for the delivery of guaranteed network services, such as those subject
    to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that place maximum bounds on the length
    of time that services may be degraded or unavailable. The Transport Profile of
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet-based transport technology
    based on the MPLS data plane that reuses many aspects of the MPLS management and
    control planes. This document comprises a framework for the provision of survivability
    in an MPLS-TP network; it describes recovery elements, types, methods, and topological
    considerations. To enable data-plane recovery, survivability may be supported
    by the control plane, management plane, and by Operations, Administration, and
    Maintenance (OAM) functions. This document describes mechanisms for recovering
    MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs). A detailed description of pseudowire recovery
    in MPLS-TP networks is beyond the scope of this document. This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet-based
    transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
