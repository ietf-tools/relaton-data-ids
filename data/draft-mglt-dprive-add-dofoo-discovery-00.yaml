abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism that enables a DNS client to discover
    other DNS alternatives such as DoT or DoH for one specific domain. This document
    also extends this discovery mechanism to an Internet wide of open resolvers search
    - though this is expected to be described further in a separate document. While
    search are always initiated by the DNS client, this document also indicates how
    a resolver MAY indicate a DNS client its preference for using alternative flavors
    of transport layer.</p>"
