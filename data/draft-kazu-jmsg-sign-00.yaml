abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a signing procedure for Japanese message. The procedure
    guarantees signature validity even messages are processed through message transfer
    agents which carelessly transform character set encodings. To sign Japanese message
    digitally, local forms such as EUC/Japanese, Shift-JIS, etc., are first converted
    into the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP, then duplicated into two objects. The first
    object is transformed into the signature form proposed in this memo and a detached
    digital signature is calculated over it. An entire digital signature is created
    with the second object and the detached digital signature. Japanese text is verified
    as the signature form instead of the transfer form. To encrypt Japanese message,
    the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP, is used.</p>"
