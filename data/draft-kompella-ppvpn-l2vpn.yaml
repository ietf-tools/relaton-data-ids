abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM circuits
    have been around a long time. While these VPNs work well, the costs of maintaining
    separate networks for Internet traffic and VPNs and the administrative burden
    of provisioning these VPNs have led Service Providers to look for alternative
    solutions. In this document, we present a VPN solution where from the customer's
    point of view, the VPN is based on Layer 2 circuits, but the Service Provider
    maintains and manages a single network for IP, IP VPNs, and Layer 2 VPNs.</p>"
