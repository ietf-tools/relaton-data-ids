abstract:
- content: "<p>With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based interactive services
    such as cloud gaming have gained substantial attention. To ensure users' quality
    of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may require not only high bandwidth
    (e.g., high-resolution media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency
    and low lagging). However, the quality perceived by a user with mobile and wireless
    device may vary, as a function of many factors, and unhandled changes can substantially
    compromise the user's QoE. In this document, we investigate network-aware applications
    (NAA), which realize cloud- based interactive services with improved QoE, by efficient
    utilization of a solution named Mobile and Wireless Information Exposure (MoWIE).
    In particular, this document demonstrates, through realistic evaluations, that
    mobile network information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can effectively
    expose the dynamicity of the underlying network and can be made available to applications
    through MoWIE; using such an information, the applications can then adapt key
    control knobs such as media codec schemes, encapsulation, and application layer
    processing to minimize QoE distortion. Based on the evaluations, we discuss how
    the MoWIE features can define extensions of the ALTO protocol, to expose more
    lower-layer and finer grain network dynamics.</p>"
