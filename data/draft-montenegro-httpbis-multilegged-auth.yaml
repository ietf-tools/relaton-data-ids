abstract:
- content: "<p>In line with the HTTP compatibility goal for HTTP 2.0, HTTP 2.0 must
    also be compatible with currently deployed authentication schemes. This draft
    addresses this goal in the presence of multiplexing (expected to be part of HTTP
    2.0), while addressing some of the issues currently encountered when performing
    multilegged authentication.</p>"
