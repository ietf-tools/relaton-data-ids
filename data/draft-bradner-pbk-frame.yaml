abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo considers the need to authenticate the source of a network
    communication where the actual identity of the source is not important but it
    is important and that successive messages in the communication come from the same
    source. This memo defines the use of specially generated public/private key pairs,
    known as Purpose- Built Keys (PBKs), to provide this assurance. This memo is not
    a full specification of a PBK protocol, but rather a model or framework for development
    of PBK in applications</p>"
