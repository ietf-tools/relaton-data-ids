abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new IS-IS flooding mechanism which separates
    multiple flooding instances for dissemination of routing information and other
    types of application-specific information to minimizes the impact of non-routing
    information flooding on the routing convergence and stability. Due to different
    flooding information has different requirements on the flooding rate, these multi-flooding
    instances should be given various priorities and flooding parameters. An encoding
    format for IS-IS Multi-Flooding Instance Identifier (MFI-ID) TLV and Update Process
    are specified in this document.</p>"
