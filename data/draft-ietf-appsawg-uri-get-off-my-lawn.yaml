abstract:
- content: <p>Section 1.1.1 of RFC 3986 defines URI syntax as "a federated and extensible
    naming system wherein each scheme's specification may further restrict the syntax
    and semantics of identifiers using that scheme." In other words, the structure
    of a URI is defined by its scheme. While it is common for schemes to further delegate
    their substructure to the URI's owner, publishing independent standards that mandate
    particular forms of URI substructure is inappropriate, because that essentially
    usurps ownership. This document further describes this problematic practice and
    provides some acceptable alternatives for use in standards.</p>
