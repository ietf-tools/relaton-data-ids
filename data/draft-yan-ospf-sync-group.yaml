abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a fundamental component for a routing system. It depends on
    the flooding mechanism to advertise and synchronize link-state database among
    distributed nodes in a network. As modern networks become larger and more complex,
    more and more nodes and adjacencies are involved. As a result, massive link-state
    information are generated and synchronized which are becoming an overhead of networks
    nowadays. This document proposes a new design of OSPF database synchronization
    that is slightly different from the one stated in OSPF. This new design can help
    to alleviate the overhead by dividing OSPF routers into independent synchronization
    groups and limiting synchronization across the group border. Since less burden
    from synchronization, it is possible to accommodate more OSPF routers and adjacencies
    in a network.</p>"
