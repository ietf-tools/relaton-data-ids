abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [RFC8279] is an architecture that
    provides multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain multicast related per-flow state. BIER can be supported in
    MPLS and non-MPLS networks. The common BIER header format and encapsulation for
    MPLS and non-MPLS networks is specified in [RFC8296]. BIER in Ethernet encapsulation
    is an example of BIER encapsulation in non-MPLS networks. [RFC8401] specifies
    the required extensions to the IS-IS [RFC1195] protocol for the distribution of
    BIER sub-domain information including the Sub-sub-TLV required to support BIER
    in MPLS encapsulation for MPLS networks. This document specifies the required
    extensions to the IS-IS [RFC1195] protocol for supporting BIER in non-MPLS networks
    using BIER in Ethernet encapsulation.</p>
