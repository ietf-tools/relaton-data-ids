abstract:
- content: "<p>Chrysolite is a combination of differing technologies to create a wide
    area switched Ethernet solution. Each Chrysolite switch has a unique MAC address
    (N-MAC). A link state protocol provides pairwise shortest paths between the N-MACs
    (one N-MAC per switch). Customers connect to the Chrysolite cloud using Ethernet
    connections. By setting the locally administered bit in the Ethernet address used
    to connect to the Chrysolite cloud, customers can directly encapsulate traffic
    into assigned source and destination C-MAC (MAC) addresses. Each of these C-MAC
    addresses specifies a unique customer 'VLAN circuit'. This proves end to end paths
    across the Chrysolite cloud without requiring any special headers, MAC in MAC
    or Q-in-Q encapsulation.</p>"
