abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides for the carriage of voicemail messages over
    the Internet. The concept described in this document was originally called VPIM
    v3. This term has been dropped to reflect the fact that it is not a successor
    format to VPIM v2, but rather an alternative specification for a different application.</p>"
