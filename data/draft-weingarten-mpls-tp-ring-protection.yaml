abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an applicability statement to address the requirements
    for protection of ring topologies for Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSP) on multiple layers. The MPLS-TP Requirements
    document specifies specific criteria for justification of dedicated protection
    mechanism for particular topologies, including optimizing the number of OAM entities
    needed, minimizing the number of labels for protection paths, minimizing the number
    of recovery elements in the network, and minimizing the number of control and
    management transactions necessary. The document proposes a methodology for ring
    protection based on existing MPLS-TP survivability mechanisms, specifically those
    defined in MPLS-TP Linear Protection, without the need for specification of new
    constructs or protocols. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications
    Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within
    the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities
    of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
