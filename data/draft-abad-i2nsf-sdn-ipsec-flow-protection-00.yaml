abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use case of providing IPsec-based flow
    protection by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller and raises
    the requirements to support this service. It considers two main scenarios: (i)
    gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-gateway (Road Warrior). For the gateway-to-gateway
    scenario, this document describes a mechanism to support the distribution of IPsec
    information to flow-based Network Security Functions (NSFs) that implements IPsec
    to protect data traffic. between network resources to protect data traffic with
    IPsec and IKE, in intra and inter-SDN cases. The host-to-gateway case defines
    a mechanism to distribute IPsec information to the NSF to protect data with IPsec
    between an end user's device (host) and a gateway.</p>"
