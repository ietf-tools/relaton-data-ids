abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP/2.0 as specified in RFC2543 provides a mechanism for a proxy involved
    in a SIP transaction to authenticate the originator of the request. Unfortunately,
    this mechanism is not well defined when more than one proxy in a requestâ€™s path
    desires such authentication. This draft proposes a mechanism that would allow
    authentication in that scenario to work as expected. Under this proposal, SIP
    clients would issue requests with multiple Proxy-Authorization headers, one for
    each challenge it has seen in the lifetime of a given call leg. Authenticating
    SIP proxies would search each request for a Proxy- Authorization response to its
    own challenge, passing any others downstream unaltered.</p>"
