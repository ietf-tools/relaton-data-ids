abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
    the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic
    algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is
    at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in
    such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite public
    keys and composite signature data. This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey,
    CompositeSignatureValue, and CompositeParams, which are sequences of the respective
    structure for each component algorithm. This document also defines algorithms
    for generating and verifying composite signatures. This document makes no assumptions
    about what the component algorithms are, provided that their algorithm identifiers
    and signature generation and verification algorithms are defined.</p>"
