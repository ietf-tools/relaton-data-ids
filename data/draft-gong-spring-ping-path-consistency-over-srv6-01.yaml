abstract:
- content: "<p>In the SRv6 network, the headend node could use Ping (ICMPv6 Echo)
    to detect the connectivity of the SRv6 path to implement path switching. When
    a headend use Ping to detect the segment list/CPath of SRv6 Policy, the forward
    path of ICMPv6 Echo Request message is indicated by segment list, the reverse
    path of ICMPv6 Echo Reply message is via the shortest path from the destination
    node to the source as determined by routing. The forward path and reverse path
    of ICMPv6 message are likely inconsistent going through different intermediate
    nodes or links. This document describes how to ensure the consistency of the forward
    path and the reverse path when using ICMPv6 Echo messages to detect SRv6 Policy.</p>"
