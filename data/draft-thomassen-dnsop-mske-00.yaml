abstract:
- content: "<p>Answering DNSKEY/CDS/CDNSKEY queries in an [RFC8901] multi-signer DNSSEC
    configuration requires all operators to serve not only their own public key information,
    but also include each other's public keys. This ensures that clients obtain a
    consistent view of the DNSSEC configuration regardless of who is answering a given
    query. In order to enable operators to import the keys needed for assembling these
    responses, a method for discovering them is necessary. This document specifies
    how DNS operators can announce which are the keys they intend to use for signing
    a given zone (DNSKEY) and which keys are designated for secure entry into the
    zone (CDS/CDNSKEY). It further introduces the CNS record type to facilitate proactive
    discovery of the aforementioned signals. Taken together, these parts function
    as an authenticated multi-signer key-exchange (MSKE) scheme. This MSKE mechanism
    uses the signaling mechanism introduced in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dnssec-bootstrapping]
    to complete the automated workflows described in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation].</p>"
