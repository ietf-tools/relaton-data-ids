abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for UUIDs
    (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier).
    A UUID is 128 bits long, and can guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs
    were originally used in the Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open
    Software Foundation\\'s (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), and then
    in Microsoft Windows platforms. This specification is derived from the DCE specification
    with the kind permission of the OSF (now known as The Open Group). Information
    from earlier versions of the DCE specification have been incorporated into this
    document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
