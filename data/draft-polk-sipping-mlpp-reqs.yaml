abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes considerations and requirements for the extension
    of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] to support Multi-Level Precedence
    and Preemption (MLPP) functionality originally set forth in [2&amp;3]. This document
    will be limited in scope to the requirements of the SIP Protocol; MLPP within
    the IETF, utilizing other IETF Protocols, is left to other documents, therefore
    is considered out of scope here - although there is a general explanation of how
    MLPP functions currently within private circuit switched networks to give the
    necessary operational background for these requirements.</p>"
