abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2006, the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising
    the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID: two proposed email authentication
    protocols. Both of these protocols enable one to publish, via the Domain Name
    System, a policy declaring which mail servers were authorized to send email on
    behalf of the domain name being queried. There was concern that the two would
    conflict in some significant operational situations, interfering with message
    delivery. The IESG required all of these documents (RFC 4405, RFC 4406, RFC 4407,
    and RFC 4408) to be published as Experimental RFCs and requested that the community
    observe deployment and operation of the protocols over a period of two years from
    the date of publication to determine a reasonable path forward. After six years,
    sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiments thus
    created can be considered concluded. This document presents those findings. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
