abstract:
- content: "<p>Microloops are brief packet loops that occur in the network following
    a topology change (link down, link up, node fault or metric change events). Microloops
    are caused by the non-simultaneous convergence of different nodes in the network.
    If nodes converge and send traffic to a neighbor node that has not converged yet,
    traffic may be looped between these two nodes, resulting in packet loss, jitter,
    and out-of-order packets. This document presents some optional implementation
    methods aimed at providing loop avoidance in the case of IGP network convergence
    event in different scenarios.</p>"
