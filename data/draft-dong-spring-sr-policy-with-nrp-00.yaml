abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated information. A Network Resource
    Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources and associated policies in
    the underlay network, which can be used to support one or a group of Enhanced
    VPN or RFC 9543 network slice services. In SR networks where there are multiple
    NRPs, an SR Policy may be associated with a particular NRP. Within an NRP, SR
    Policy can be used for forwarding traffic which is mapped to the NRP, so that
    the traffic can be provided with the subset of network resources and policy of
    the NRP for guaranteed performance. The association between SR Policy and NRP
    needs to be specified. This document defines extensions to the SR Policy Architecture
    to allow the association of the SR Policy candidate paths with NRPs.</p>"
