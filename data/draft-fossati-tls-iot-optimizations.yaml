abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet protocols work well in a variety of environments, including
    Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. While there are some optimization possibilities
    to reduce code size, bandwidth utilization, and to improve battery lifetime, in
    general most Internet protocols are also applicable to constrained environments.
    TLS and DTLS are two such security protocols that can be used by many IoT devices
    since DTLS/TLS provide lot of flexiblity in terms credential choice, ciphersuite
    usage, etc. The DICE working group has developed a specification that profiles
    the use of TLS and DTLS for IoT environments, without changing the TLS/DTLS specifications.
    This memo goes a step further and proposes changes to the DTLS/TLS protocol to
    introduce further optimizations. Since the ongoing work on TLS/DTLS 1.3 already
    offers several improvements (compared to previous versions) this document focuses
    on the use of version 1.3 and suggests further optimizations.</p>"
