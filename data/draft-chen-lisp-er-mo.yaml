abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism of providing mapping service for
    LISP-like architecture. The mapping service comprises of EID Router (ER) mechanism
    and supplementary DHT Mapping Overlay (MO), in which ER mechanism is for reducing
    forwarding entries in routers while driving the packets to the destination through
    tunnels, and the DHT MO serves as a supplement that provides specific mappings
    to reduce the number of tunnels. The mechanism is flexibly deployable for ISPs
    since it costs little and is easy to progress.</p>"
