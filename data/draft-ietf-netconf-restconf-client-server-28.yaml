abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines two YANG modules, one module to configure a RESTCONF
    client and the other module to configure a RESTCONF server. Both modules support
    the TLS transport protocol with both standard RESTCONF and RESTCONF Call Home
    connections. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft contains
    placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values at the time
    of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that are needed.
    No other RFC Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document. Artwork
    in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in progress. Please apply
    the following replacements (note: not all may be present): * AAAA --&gt; the assigned
    RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto- types * BBBB --&gt; the assigned RFC
    value for draft-ietf-netconf-trust- anchors * CCCC --&gt; the assigned RFC value
    for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore * DDDD --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-
    server * EEEE --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-
    server * FFFF --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-
    server * GGGG --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-http- client-server
    * HHHH --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-netconf- client-server
    * IIII --&gt; the assigned RFC value for this draft Artwork in this document contains
    placeholder values for the date of publication of this draft. Please apply the
    following replacement: * 2022-12-12 --&gt; the publication date of this draft
    The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains the text "one or more
    YANG modules" and, later, "modules". This text is sourced from a file in a context
    where it is unknown how many modules a draft defines. The text is not wrong as
    is, but it may be improved by stating more directly how many modules are defined.
    The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains a self- reference to
    this draft, along with a corresponding Informative Reference in the Appendix.
    The following Appendix section is to be removed prior to publication: * Appendix
    A. Change Log</p>'
