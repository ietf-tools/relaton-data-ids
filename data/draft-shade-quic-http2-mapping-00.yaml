abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable
    in a transport for HTTP/2, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control,
    and low-latency connection establishment. This document describes a mapping of
    HTTP/2 semantics over QUIC. Specifically, this document identifies HTTP/2 features
    that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes how the other features can be implemented
    atop QUIC.</p>"
