abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines SIP extensions for session recording to meet the
    requirements in the "Requirements for SIP-based Media Recording (SIPREC)" document.
    In particular, mechanisms to allow SIP elements to distinguish between the Recording
    Session and the Communication Session. Also a mechanism for a UA to learn that
    the communication session is being recorded is proposed. The Metadata about the
    session is not covered by this document. SIP feature tags 'srs', 'src', and 'recorded'
    are defined to identify the Session Recording Server, Session Recording Client,
    and the presence of recording in the communication session.</p>
