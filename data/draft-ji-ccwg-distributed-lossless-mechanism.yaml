abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a congestion control mechanism based on distributed
    AIDC lossless network. It can effectively solve the problem of declining model
    training performance due to congestion and packet loss on long-distance links
    when training large models across multiple data centers within a region. In addition,
    this document outlines the practice scenario of this congestion control mechanism.</p>"
