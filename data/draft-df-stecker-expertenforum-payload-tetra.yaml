abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
    format to be used for TETRA encoded speech signals. The payload format is designed
    to be able to interoperate with existing TETRA transport formats on non-IP networks.
    This version of the document does not specify a file format for transport of TETRA
    speech data in storage mode applications such as email as would be required by
    the IETF. A media type registration is included, specifying the use of the RTP
    payload format and the storage format.</p>"
