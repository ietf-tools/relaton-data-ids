abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent advances in Internet of Things(IoT) have increased the usage
    of sensing technologies. Breakthroughs is microelectronics have increased the
    use of wearable devices to monitor human body functions and its surroundings.
    A typical wearable device has low resources in terms of power and processing capabilities.
    Reducing the energy consumption is one of the key design factors in a wearable
    network so that the devices may work for longer duration. Idle listening and overhearing
    are major causes of energy consumption. These issues can be resolved by maximizing
    the sleeping time of a device (switched off) and avoid unnecessary wakeup time
    (idle listening) to save energy. An external wakeup scheduling to handle the sleep/wakeup
    cycle of a device can be adapted. This document describes how a 2wakeup scheduling
    using an out-of-bound external wake up mechanism can work to successfully increase
    the lifetime of a typical body-centric wearable network (S-BCN).</p>"
