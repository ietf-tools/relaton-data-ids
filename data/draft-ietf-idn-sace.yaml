- content: "<p>This document describes a way to encode non-ASCII characters in host
    names in a way that is completely compatible with the current ASCII only host
    names that are used in DNS. It can be used both with DNS to support software only
    handling ASCII host names and as a way to downgrade from 8-bit text to ASCII in
    protocols.</p>"
