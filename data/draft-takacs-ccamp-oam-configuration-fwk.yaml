abstract:
- content: <p>OAM functions are essential to ensure that the desired service level
    of traffic engineered connections are met. In certain technologies OAM entities
    are inherently established once the connection is set up. However other technologies,
    especially OAM for packet switched networks, require an extra configuration step
    after connection establishment to setup OAM entities. This document specifies
    extensions to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of OAM entities
    along with LSP signalling.Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in</p>
