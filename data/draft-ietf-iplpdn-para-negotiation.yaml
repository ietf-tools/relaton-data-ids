- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms for negotiating operational parameters
    wherever SNAP encapsulation of Internet Protocols is available. For example, it
    is suitable for use in conjunction with RFC 1294 (Multiprotocol Over Frame Relay)
    and RFC 1356 (Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN in the Packet Mode),
    and potentially others. The mechanisms described here are intended as optional
    extensions, intended to facilitate interoperation in public networks were preconfiguration
    may not have been done symmetrically by all parties who wish to exchange information.</p>"
