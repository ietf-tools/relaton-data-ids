abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent Internet Draft [1] argues that the common use of POST to proide
    a uniform method of passing blocks of data to an application, is being misused
    in the definition of new application protocols, such as the Internet Printing
    Protocol. Cohen et. al. argue that a new PUSH method be defined for this purpose.
    This Internet Draft argues that the existing POST method proides all of the required
    functionality for back end applications, such as Print, without sacrificing the
    leels of security that customers expect. More importantly, from the customer\\022s
    point of iew, it does this without any impact to existing, installed network components.</p>"
