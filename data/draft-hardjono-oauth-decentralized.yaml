abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an alternative service architecture for user-
    centric control of the sharing of resources following the UMA model, such as personal
    data, using the decentralized peer-to-peer computing paradigm. The term 'control'
    is used here to denote the full capacity of the user to freely select (i) the
    entities with whom to share resources (e.g. data), and (ii) the entities which
    provide services implementing user-controlled resource sharing. The peer-to- peer
    service architecture uses a set of computing nodes called OAuth2.0 Nodes (ON)
    that are part of a peer-to-peer network as the basis for the decentralized service
    architecture.</p>"
