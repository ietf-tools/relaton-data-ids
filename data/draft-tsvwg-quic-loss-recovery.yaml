abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure
    transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for HTTP/2 semantics.
    While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application protocol, QUIC builds on decades
    of transport and security experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive
    as a modern general-purpose transport. QUIC implements the spirit of known TCP
    loss recovery mechanisms, described in RFCs, various Internet-drafts, and also
    those prevalent in the Linux TCP implementation. This document describes QUIC
    loss recovery, and where applicable, attributes the TCP equivalent in RFCs, Internet-
    drafts, academic papers, and/or TCP implementations.</p>"
