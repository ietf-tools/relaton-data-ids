abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives a general set of objective criteria to evaluate
    an autoconfiguration mechanism in a MANET environment. All criteria are important
    to outline an evaluation of an autoconfiguration mechanism. These criteria have
    been grouped into three classes: functional criteria, performance criteria and
    usability criteria. For each of the criteria, a description is outlined, hints
    are given on how to perform an adequate measure of the criterium, and an evaluation
    features the importance of the criterium in the full evaluation of a mechanism.</p>"
