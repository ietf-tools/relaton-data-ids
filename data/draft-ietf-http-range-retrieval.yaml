abstract:
- content: "<p>It is possible in Web clients to interrupt the connection before the
    data transfer has finished. As a result the client may have partial documents
    or images loaded into its memory. It would be useful to be able to request the
    server to return the missing portion of the document only, instead of retransferring
    the entire file, if the page is re-entered later.</p>"
