abstract:
- content: "<p>Ad Hoc networks often present an interesting environment for IPv6 addressing
    due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes
    must assign IPv6 addresses to their interface connections to Ad Hoc networks that
    are locally unique but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes must
    therefore be able to assign self-generated addresses to their interfaces when
    there are no IPv6 Internetworking routers present that can coordinate topology-
    relative IPv6 addresses or prefixes. This document specifies IPv6 address types
    that can be assigned to Ad Hoc network interfaces.</p>"
