- content: "<p>The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) defines a mechanism for sending
    session-based instant messages. The session is negotiated using the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). MSRP can be used in
    a centralized conference just as any other media type. This document provides
    requirements in support for MSRP in centralized conferences, including requirements
    to provide private instant messages within a conference.</p>"
