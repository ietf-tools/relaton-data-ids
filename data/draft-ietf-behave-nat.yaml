abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines basic terminology for describing different types
    of behavior for NATs when handling unicast UDP. It also defines a set of requirements
    for NATs that would allow many applications, such as multimedia communications
    or online gaming, to work consistently. Developing NATs that meet this set of
    requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications will function
    properly.</p>"
