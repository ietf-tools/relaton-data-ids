abstract:
- content: <p>This is an initial draft for consideration by the SPEERMINT WG as a
    candidate for the chartered work item dealing with "the minimum set of requirements
    for SIP-based VoIP interconnection (BCP)", due in March 2007. In its present form,
    this draft is intended solely to provide a basis for WG discussion about requirements
    selection. As such, it is primarily structural and descriptive in nature, leaving
    prescriptive content to later revisions driven by WG consensus.</p>
