abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many circumstances in LDAP [1] when the result of a Search
    operation returns attribute values that have the distinguished name (DN) syntax.
    This document defines controls that allow the client to request that the server
    tag each DN with its object classes. This is a useful feature because object classes
    such as groups [3] may hold many DNs, each of which is a potentially different
    object class. When using this control in a search, the LDAP client request that
    the server return the object classes of each DN that is an attribute value of
    the search result. This control also defines a way to limit the kinds of DNs that
    should be returned in a Search result.</p>"
