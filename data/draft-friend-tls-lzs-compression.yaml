abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (RFC 2246) includes features
    to negotiate selection of a lossless data compression method as part of the TLS
    Handshake Protocol and then to apply the algorithm associated with the selected
    method as part of the TLS Record Protocol. TLS defines one standard compression
    method, which specifies that data exchanged via the record protocol will not be
    compressed. This document describes an additional compression method associated
    with the Lempel-Ziv-Stac (LZS) lossless data compression algorithm for use with
    TLS. This document also defines the application of the LZS algorithm to the TLS
    Record Protocol. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
