abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of
    the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header (ACH). RFC
    5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be carried in messages on
    the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between the fixed header fields and the G-ACh
    message. These TLVs are called ACH TLVs No Associated Channel Type yet defined
    uses an ACH TLV. Furthermore, it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces
    significant problems to the fast-path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to
    be processed substantially in hardware, the use of TLVs in undesirable. This document
    updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the associated registry.</p>"
