abstract:
- content: <p>This memo presents a technique for a SSH (Secure Shell) server to initiate
    the underlying TCP connection to the SSH client. This role reversal is necessary
    in cases where the SSH client would otherwise be unable to initiate an SSH connection
    to the SSH server, such as a device "calling home" on its first boot.</p>
