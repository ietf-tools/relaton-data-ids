abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism that provides Mobile IP nodes and
    agents with the necessary keys and information needed to establish mobility security
    associations within a foreign network. This mechanism aims at reducing the latency
    and computational burden introduced by public-key based key management protocols
    in network topologies where visiting mobile nodes register with their respective
    home agents several times through different foreign agents requiring Mobile-Foreign
    Authentication. This mechanism employs a key distribution center capable of generating
    the security contexts needed to authenticate Mobile IP control messages. This
    mechanism, designed as an extension to the Mobile IP protocol, preservs backward
    compatibility and interoperability with RFC2002 compliant implementations of Mobile
    IP.</p>"
