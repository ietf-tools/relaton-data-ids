abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishing
    multimedia sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is used in
    streaming media systems. RTSP has a dual role: it establishes a media session
    for the delivery of streaming media as well as controls the streaming session
    once it has been set up. Since SIP is also used for session establishment, there
    exists an overlap between the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP. In this
    document, we describe a model adopted by ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP, and Open IPTV Forum
    (OIPF) in which SIP and the SDP offer/answer model are used to set up a streaming
    session with an RTSP control channel and one or more media delivery streams. Such
    a model is beneficial since it allows the reuse of current architecture and functionality
    (e.g., authentication, charging, and QoS) established around SIP for RTSP- based
    streaming. The model benefits applications such as Internet Protocol Television
    (IPTV). In addition to the model, the document specifies two new variants of RTSP.</p>"
