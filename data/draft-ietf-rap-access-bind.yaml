abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an ever-growing distinction between edge and core functionality.
    While the core continues to focus on stability and pure forwarding functionality,
    the edges increasingly need to deal with dynamic capabilities like QoS management,
    VPN encapsulations, encryption, dynamic steering and service monitoring. The dynamic
    deployment of these functions is dependent on specific contextual knowledge such
    as the physical location of the data stream and the identity of the client or
    system generating the data.</p>"
