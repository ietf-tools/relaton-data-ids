abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet
    of Things. It was created as a common language for use in the development of the
    One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions. Tools convert this format
    to database formats and other serializations as needed. An SDF specification describes
    definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events, Actions,
    Properties), as well as the Data types for the information exchanged in those
    interactions. A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in version (-00)
    of this document; version (-05) was designated as an _implementation draft_, labeled
    SDF 1.1, at the IETF110 meeting of the ASDF WG (2021-03-11). The present version
    (-06) is intended for discussion at the ASDF interim meeting on 2021-06-02.</p>"
