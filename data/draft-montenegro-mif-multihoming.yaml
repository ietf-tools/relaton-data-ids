abstract:
- content: "<p>Increasingly, hosts have more than one network interface active at
    any given point in time. Such multiplicity of interfaces leads to multiple and
    potentially conflicting (or overlapping) sets of configuration information and
    policies. How these are arbitrated and managed influence how the host resolves
    DNS queries, and-with respect to outgoing packets-how it selects a source address
    and an outgoing interface.</p>"
