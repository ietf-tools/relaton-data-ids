    (with real time characteristics) between two end systems. It is part of the OSI
    model of the Network layer, the Internet layer ot the DoD model respectively.
    It is not a separate protocol, but rather an additional service, of which applications,
    exchanging data in real time, can take advantage. In the current document this
    service is defined as an option of the Internet Protocol.</p>"
