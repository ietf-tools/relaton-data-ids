abstract:
- content: "<p>The base mobile-IP specification allows mobile computers to move freely
    between various points of attachment to the Internet. However, each time the mobile
    computer moves, a Registration Request message has to be approved by the mobile
    node's Home Agent. In cases where the home agent is far away, it may become too
    expensive or (in the cases of network partition) even impossible to complete these
    frequent registrations. In this draft document, we specify a new variety of registration,
    using a Regional Registration Request and Regional Registration Reply, that is
    no longer always required to be transacted with the home agent.</p>"
