abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for establishing connectivity for
    a network routed VPN. It makes use of a Policy Server to get information on the
    establishment of tunnels between the Edge Devices of a Service Provider's network.
    Use of a Policy Server allows a network operator to enable the tunnel topology
    which is most suited to the VPN; provides a mechanism to learn about the current
    state of the VPN connectivity; and enables the addition and removal of tunnels
    to reflect current network demands. The proposed extensions are independent of
    the specific tunneling technology deployed in the core of the network, i.e. MPLS,
    ATM, FR or IP. The document also defines the extensions required to the COPS (Common
    Open Policy Service) protocol being developed in the IETF for communication between
    the Edge Devices and the Policy Server to exchange VPN connectivity information.</p>"
