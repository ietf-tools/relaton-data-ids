abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an architectural framework for mobility management
    (MM) in general with an emphasis on localized mobility management (LMM). MM requires
    new architectural entities to be added to the Internet Protocol version 4 and
    version 6. Also the availability of mobility management must be advertised by
    these entities extending ICMPv4 and v6. The document identifies these entities
    as routing proxies (RP) and defines abstractly the behaviour of RPs and their
    interactions with the existing entities and the router/agent advertisements that
    RP needs to issue in order to let its presence known. Basic architecture can be
    optimized by either informing the end nodes in order to achieve route optimization
    and/ or by localizing mobility management. LMM itself requires new entities identified
    as localized routing proxies or localized mobility agents (LMA) to be introduced
    to the basic architectures of mobility management. The behaviour of LMA is abstractly
    defined. The document also identifies a number of open issues whose resolution
    is crucial to the standardization of LMM protocols.</p>"
