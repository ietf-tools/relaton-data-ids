abstract:
- content: <p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides efficient asynchronous
    group key establishment for large groups with up to thousands of clients. In MLS,
    any member can commit a change to the group, and consequently, all members must
    download, validate, and maintain the full group state which can incur a significant
    communication and computational costs, especially when joining a group. This document
    defines an MLS extension to support "light clients" that don't undertake these
    costs. A light client cannot commit changes to the group, and only has partial
    authentication information for the other members of the group, but is otherwise
    able to participate in the group. In exchange for these limitations, a light client
    can participate in an MLS group with significantly lower requirements in terms
    of download, memory, and processing.</p>
