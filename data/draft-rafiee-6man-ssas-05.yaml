abstract:
- content: "<p>The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an Organizationally
    Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE Standards Association and an Extension
    Identifier assigned to the hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291)
    [RFC4291]. This fact thus means that a node will always have the same Interface
    ID (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Because the node's IP address
    does not change, the node will be vulnerable to privacy related attacks. Currently
    this problem is addressed by the use of two mechanisms that do not make use of
    the MAC address, or other unique values that can be used for ID generation, for
    randomizing the IID; Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and
    Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is the computational
    cost involved for the IID generation and in the verification process. The problem
    with the latter approach is that it lacks necessary security mechanisms and provides
    the node with only partial protection against privacy related attacks. This document
    proposes the use of a new algorithm for use in the generation of the IID while,
    at the same time, securing the node against some types of attack, like IP spoofing.
    These attacks are prevented by the addition of a signature to messages sent over
    the network and by finding a binding with the nodes' IP address and its public
    key. The use of theResource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), introduced in this
    document, is based on the centralized version explained in RFC 6494 and RFC 6495.</p>"
