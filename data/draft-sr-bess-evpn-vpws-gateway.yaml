abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet VPN Virtual Private Wire Services (EVPN VPWS) need to be deployed
    in high scale multi-domain networks, where each domain can use a different transport
    technology, such as MPLS, VXLAN or Segment Routing with MPLS or IPv6 Segment Identifiers
    (SIDs). While the transport interworking solutions on border routers spare the
    border routers from having to process service routes, they do not always meet
    the multi-homing, redundancy, and operational requirements, or provide the isolation
    that each domain requires. This document analyzes the scenarios in which an interconnect
    solution for EVPN VPWS using EVPN Domain Gateways is needed, and adds the required
    extensions to support it.</p>"
