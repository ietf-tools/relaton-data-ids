    (LLMNR) in PCP scenarioes. Depending on that, it could not only avoid adherence
    to DNS during PCP server name resolving, but also company with PCP FQDN DHCP options
    extention to accomplish PCP server discovery. In order to fit LLMNR into PCP network,
    particular LLMNR deployment guide and relevant configurations are considerated
    along with PCP elements installation.</p>"
