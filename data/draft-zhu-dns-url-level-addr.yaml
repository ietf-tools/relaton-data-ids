abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently there are a number of efforts [sw1, sw2, in,tpc, etc.] of
    trying to connect the packet-switching network with circuit-switching network,
    especially connecting the Internet with public telephone networks. The first problem
    of such interconnection is naming and addressing, later will come with directory
    services and routing problems. This draft concentrates on naming for DNS and URL.
    Other problems are discussed in other documents [utrpt, framework].</p>"
