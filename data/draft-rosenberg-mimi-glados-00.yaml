abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for the discovery problem in MIMI
    (More Instant Messaging Interoperability). The discovery problem is the technique
    by which a user in one messaging provider can determine the preferred messaging
    provider for a target user identified by an email address or phone number. The
    discovery problem has been the subject of numerous - largely failed - standardization
    attempts at the IETF. This document outlines these attempts and hypothesizes the
    reasons for their failure, using that to define a set of requirements to avoid
    these failures in a next attempt. The new proposed solution, called the Global
    Lookup and Discovery of Services (GLADOS) protocol, is a centralized internet-wide
    provider that interfaces with application providers.</p>"
