abstract:
- content: "<p>In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking
    architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available
    Internet paths to endpoints, and provides for endpoints and applications to use
    these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic. This
    document poses questions in path-aware networking open as of 2020, that must be
    answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware internetworks.
    It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking proposed
    Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in
    this space.</p>"
