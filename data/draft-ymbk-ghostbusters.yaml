abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource certificates
    completely obscure names or any other information which might be useful for contacting
    responsible parties to deal with issues of certificate expiration, maintenance,
    roll-overs, compromises, etc. This draft describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record
    containing human contact information to be signed (indirectly) by a resource-owning
    certificate. The data in the record are those of a severely profiled vCARD.</p>"
