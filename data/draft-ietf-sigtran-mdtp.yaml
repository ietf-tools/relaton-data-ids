abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft discusses a new protocol, namely the Multi-network
    Datagram Transmission Protocol (MDTP), that is intended to provide fault-tolerant
    reliable data transfer between communicating entities over IP networks [1]. MDTP
    is proposed as an application-level protocol that is designed to support redundant
    networks and transparent fault management. MDTP also provides timing control and
    configuration flexibilities to meet the stringent timing requirements often found
    in telephony signaling protocols. The motivation of developing MDTP is to support
    Internet-based high reliability applications such as signaling and call control
    for Internet telephony.</p>"
