abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUERY opcode in the DNS is designed for unicast. With the development
    of multicast capabilities in the DNS, it is desireable to have a more robust opcode
    for server interactions since a single request may result in replies from multiple
    responders. So DISCOVER is defined to deal with replies from multiple responders.
    As such, this document extend the core DNS specifications to allow clients to
    have a method for coping with replies from multiple responders. Use of this new
    opcode may facilitate DNS operations in modern networking topologies. A prototype
    of the DISCOVER opcode was developed as part of the TBDS project, funded under
    DARPA grant F30602-99-1-0523.</p>"
