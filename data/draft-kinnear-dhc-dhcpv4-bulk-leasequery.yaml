abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a requestor to request information
    about DHCPv4 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for individual bindings.
    In some situations individual binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.
    This document expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequery protocol to allow for bulk transfer
    of DHCPv4 address binding data via TCP.</p>"
