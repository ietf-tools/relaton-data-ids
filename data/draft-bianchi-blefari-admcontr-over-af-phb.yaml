abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo shows that an AF PHB class, as defined in RFC 2597, is capable
    of supporting explicit per flow admission control. Admission control is obtained
    by a suitable use of two out of the three drop precedence levels. Level 1 is dedicated
    to conforming accepted traffic, i.e. traffic that has passed admission control
    test and conforms to edge-policing functions. Level 2 is used as an implicit signaling
    pipe and acts as the core network support for the admission control procedure.</p>"
