abstract:
- content: "<p>The Benchmarking Methodologies defined in RFC2544 [1] are IP version
    independent however, they do not address some of the specificities of IPv6. This
    document provides additional benchmarking guidelines which in conjunction with
    RFC2544 will lead to a more complete and realistic evaluation of the IPv6 performance
    of network elements.</p>"
