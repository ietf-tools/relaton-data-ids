abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a type of Layer-2 Provider Provisioned
    Virtual Private Network (L2 PPVPN) offered service, which has been described in
    [PPVPN-FRWK]. If the Service Provider network provides IP multicast functionality,
    then this network capability can be leveraged in providing very efficient VPLS
    service and yet simplifying the implementation of such service. This document
    describes a solution for providing VPLS service based on IP multicast feature
    referred to as Multicast Virtual Private LAN Service (MVPLS).</p>"
