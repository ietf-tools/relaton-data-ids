abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data center (DC) applications
    and as the next generation virtual private LAN services in service provider (SP)
    applications. The use of host IP default route and host unknown MAC route within
    a DC is well understood in order to ensure that leaf nodes within a DC only learn
    and store host MAC and IP addresses for that DC. All other host MAC and IP addresses
    from remote DCs are learned and stored in DC GW nodes thus alleviating leaf nodes
    from learning host MAC and IP addresses from the remote DCs. This draft further
    optimizes the MAC and IP address learning at the leaf nodes such that a leaf node
    within a DC only needs to learn and store MAC and IP addresses associated with
    the sites directly connected to it. A leaf node does not need to learn and store
    MAC and IP addresses from any other leaf nodes thus reducing the number of learned
    MACs and IP addresses per EVI substantially. The modifications provided by this
    draft updates and extends RFC7024 for BGP EVPN Address Family.</p>"
