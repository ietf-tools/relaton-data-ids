abstract:
- content: "<p>The potential advertisement of non-best paths by a BGP speaker supporting
    the add-path or the best-external extensions makes it difficult for other BGP
    speakers to identify the paths that have been selected as best by those who advertise
    them. This information is required for proper operation of some applications.
    Towards that end, this document proposes marking the paths using extended communities
    that encode the path type.</p>"
