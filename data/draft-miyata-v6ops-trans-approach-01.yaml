abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 address is estimated to run out shortly. So as [I-D.durand-v6ops-natv4v6v4]
    stated, we have to consider IPv6 only node for smooth transition. On the other
    hand, IETF have deprecated the NAT-PT with some reasons. And now we need to seek
    alternative solutions. Before talking specific technology, we need to consider
    overall strategy for translation technology.</p>"
