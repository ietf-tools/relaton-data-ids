abstract:
- content: "<p>User agents such as caches and web indexers, which act on behalf of
    more than one user are often given access to documents which are restricted by
    IP address or domain. These agents then republish this information to users outside
    the allowed block, as there is currently no means of marking these objects with
    their access restrictions. This document details an extension to the Cache-control
    header in HTTP/1.1 [HTTP/1.1] to add information about IP or domain based access
    restrictions. It also stresses that Cache-control should apply to all User-agents
    which work on behalf on a number of users, and not just to caches.</p>"
