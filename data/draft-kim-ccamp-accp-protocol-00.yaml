abstract:
- content: "<p>The configuration of control channels with a higher reliability would
    be an important factor for the more stable provision of communication environment
    in non-(G)MPLS and (G)MPLS networks. This document specifies an automatic control
    channel protection (ACCP) protocol that runs between a pair of nodes and is used
    to support the resilience capability of control channels. The ACCP protocol is
    based on the concept of common channel signaling in ITU-T and the current control
    channel management function of LMP in IETF. This ACCP protocol provides functions
    such as identification of direct and indirect control channels, automatic and
    forced switchover of those channels, and so on for the resilience of control channels.</p>"
