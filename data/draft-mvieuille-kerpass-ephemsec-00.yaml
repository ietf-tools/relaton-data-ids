abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies EPHEMSEC, an algorithm for generating one-
    time passwords (OTPs) and one-time keys (OTKs). Unlike traditional OTP algorithms
    that rely solely on static shared secrets, EPHEMSEC uses public key cryptography,
    which simplifies secure deployment on authentication servers. EPHEMSEC also supports
    binding the generated OTP/OTK to contextual data. When this context is obtained
    and injected by a trusted agent, the resulting codes can be made resistant to
    phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, EPHEMSEC includes a built-in
    time synchronization mechanism that embeds a synchronization hint into the generated
    output. This allows both parties to deterministically derive the same OTP/OTK
    value without requiring trial-and-error validation, enabling compatibility with
    protocols such as Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) and TLS with Pre-Shared
    Key (TLS-PSK) that require exact secret agreement.</p>"
