abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent Discussions within the IETF and in other fora have highlighted
    differences in interpretation of the set of standards associated with ENUM and
    DDDS, on which it relies. Specifically, the operation and semantics surrounding
    support for non-terminal NAPTRs has led to some confusion. This document is an
    attempt to add clarification to non- terminal NAPTR processing. In this, it clarifies
    RFC3403. A subsequent document will build on this one to extend RFC3761 further,
    permitting registration of non-terminal Enumservices.</p>"
