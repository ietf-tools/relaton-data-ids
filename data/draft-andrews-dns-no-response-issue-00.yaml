abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond to queries
    causes both immediate operational problems and long term problems with protocol
    development. This document will identify a number of common classes of queries
    that some servers fail to respond too. This document will also suggest procedures
    for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply to reduce / eliminate the problem.</p>"
