abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP-based distributed system and software application layer often
    use heartbeat to maintain the network topology status. However, the heartbeat
    setting is long, which prolongs the system fault detection time. IP-based storage
    network is the typical usage of that scenario. When an IP-based storage network
    fault occurs, NVMe connections need to be switched over. Currently, no effective
    method is available for quick detection, switchover is performed only based on
    keepalive timeout, resulting in low performance. This document defines the basic
    framework of how network assisted host devices can quickly detect application
    connection failures caused by network faults.</p>"
