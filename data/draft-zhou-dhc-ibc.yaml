abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides security methods based on identity based cryptography
    to protect DHCP messages. Identity based cryptography is a special kind of public
    key cryptography. Specifically, an authetication protocol based on IBS (identity
    based signature) algorithms is proposed. A key distribution method adopting IBE
    ( identity based encryption) algorithms is also proposed, where key is used as
    a shared secret in calculating authentication information according to authentication
    protocol specified in RFC 3315.</p>"
