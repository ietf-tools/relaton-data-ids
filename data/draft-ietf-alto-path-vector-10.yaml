abstract:
- content: <p>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization protocol [RFC7285]. The current ALTO Cost Services allow applications
    to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path defined by its source and destination.
    The present extension provides abstracted information on particular network parts
    or elements traversed by a path between its source and destination. Examples of
    such abstracted parts are networks, data centers or links. This is useful for
    applications whose performance is impacted by particular network parts they traverse
    or by their properties. Applications having the choice among several connection
    paths may use this information to select paths accordingly and improve their performance.
    In particular, they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent
    traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This document introduces a new cost
    type called Path Vector. A Path Vector is an array of entities that each identifies
    an abstracted representation of a network part and that are called Abstract Network
    Element (ANE). Each ANE is defined by a set of properties. ANE properties are
    conveyed by an ALTO information resource called "Property Map", that can be packed
    together with the Path Vectors in a multipart response. They can also be obtained
    via a separate ALTO request to a Property Map. An ALTO Property Map is an extension
    to the ALTO protocol, that is specified in another document entitled "Unified
    Properties for the ALTO Protocol" [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].</p>
