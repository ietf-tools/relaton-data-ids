abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 offers significant advantages over IPv4, however it will take
    long time to replace IPv4 with IPv6. Therefore, these two protocols are expected
    to coexist during the transition period. Currently, there are many transition
    devices deployed to solve transition problems. Most of them only use one technology
    (either translation or tunneling). However, any transition technology has limitation
    and application scope. In transition scenarios, besides IP version of source,
    middle and destination network, the network characteristic (a regular edge network
    or a backbone) has key impact on system performance of transition methods. Therefore,
    we need to decide which transition method should be used in some typical transition
    scenarios and how the transition and tunneling devices collaborate for solving
    transition problems. This draft introduces a smart toolbox named PET (shortfor
    Prefixing, encapsulation and translation) which includes all fundamental elements
    needed in all transition scenarios, such as the control and data plane operations
    of tunneling and translation. Based on PET, we propose a network side transition
    solution. In this framework, there deploys only one kind of transition device,
    i.e. PET. Through the collaboration of PETs, the transition problems can be solved.
    In this draft, we give the advantages and disadvantages of all transition methods
    PET may adopt according to IP version of source, middle and destination network,
    and the network characteristic.</p>"
