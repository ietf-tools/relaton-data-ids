abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI)
    protocol element, as an extension of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). An
    IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO
    10646). Grammar and processing rules are given for IRIs and related syntactic
    forms. In addition, this document provides named additional rule sets for processing
    otherwise invalid IRIs, in a way that supports other specifications that wish
    to mandate common behavior for 'error' handling. In particular, rules used in
    some XML languages (LEIRI) and web applications are given. Defining IRI as new
    protocol element (rather than updating or extending the definition of URI) allows
    independent orderly transitions: other protocols and languages that use URIs must
    explicitly choose to allow IRIs. Guidelines are provided for the use and deployment
    of IRIs and related protocol elements when revising protocols, formats, and software
    components that currently deal only with URIs. [RFC Editor: Please remove this
    paragraph before publication.] This document is intended to update RFC 3987 and
    move towards IETF Draft Standard. This is an interim version in preparation for
    the IRI BOF at IETF 76 in Hiroshima. For discussion and comments on this draft,
    please use the public-iri@w3.org mailing list.</p>"
