abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines protocols, procedures, and conventions to be
    employed by peers implementing the Generic Security Service Application Program
    Interface (GSS-API) when using the Kerberos Version 5 mechanism. RFC 1964 is updated
    and incremental changes are proposed in response to recent developments such as
    the introduction of Kerberos cryptosystem framework. These changes support the
    inclusion of new cryptosystems, by defining new per-message tokens along with
    their encryption and checksum algorithms based on the cryptosystem profiles. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
