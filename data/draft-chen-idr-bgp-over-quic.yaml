abstract:
- content: "<p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an autonomous system routing protocol.
    The main function of BGP is to exchange routing and reachability information between
    autonomous systems(AS) on the Internet. BGP uses TCP to implement reliable and
    orderly transmission of information. Similar to TCP, QUIC is a UDP-based, byte-stream-based
    reliable data transmission service. In addition, by integrating with TLS 1.3,
    QUIC also supports functions such as establishing connections with minimum latency
    and providing confidentiality and integrity protection for the transmitted data,
    and multi-stream multiplexing. Taking use of QUIC for BGP can achieve the possible
    advantages. This document defines the mechanism of BGP over QUIC to and corresponding
    procedures.</p>"
