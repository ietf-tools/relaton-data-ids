abstract:
- content: "<p>The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure detailed by Neighbor
    Discovery Protocol (NDP) requires nodes to wait for a quantified time interval
    during which the configured address is checked for duplication in the connected
    link. This delay affects normal communication in a Mobile Node (MN) during the
    DAD time interval thereby hampering Fast Handoff. The expected use of Mobile IP
    on a wide scale and the need for a minimal time delay during the handoff process
    require alternate mechanisms for overcoming the DAD time interval. This draft
    presents a mechanism wherein the Access Router's (AR) Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE)
    is used to minimize the delay associated with the DAD procedure.</p>"
