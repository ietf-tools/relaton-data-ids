abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File Sharing version 4 (NFSv4)
    to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by the NFSv4
    server. This ability to bypass the server for data access can increase both performance
    and parallelism, but requires additional client functionality for data access,
    some of which is dependent on the class of storage used. The main pNFS operations
    document specifies storage-class-independent extensions to NFS; this document
    specifies the additional extensions (primarily data structures) for use of pNFS
    with block- and volume-based storage. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
