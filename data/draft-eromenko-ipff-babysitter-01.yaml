abstract:
- content: "<p>Babysitter is a form of an advanced NAT, mostly for desktop clients.
    It gives mixed IP-FF and IPv4 clients access to IPv4-only Internet. It is somewhat
    resembling NAT64 + DNS64 combo, and will aid during transition period. Assumption:
    We work on IPv4-only Internet, but we want to implement both IP-FF and IPv4 hosts
    inside our organization, so nodes can work between themselves with, and take advantage
    of, IP-FF, but still able to connect to the Internet. If/when this assumption
    is invalid, and end-to-end IP-FF becomes commonplace, other forms of connection
    should be used, and babysitter may be disabled.</p>"
