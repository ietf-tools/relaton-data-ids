abstract:
- content: "<p>As mobile edge computing networks sink computing tasks from cloud data
    centers to the edge of the network, tasks need to be processed by computing resources
    close to the user side. Therefore, CATS was raised. Reducing carbon footprint
    is a major challenge of our time. Networks are the main enablers of carbon reductions.
    The introduction of computing dimension in CATS makes it insufficient to consider
    the energy saving of network dimension in the past, so the green for CATS based
    on network and computing combination is worth exploring. This document outlines
    a series of challenges and associated research to explore ways to reduce carbon
    footprint and reduce network energy based on CATS.</p>"
