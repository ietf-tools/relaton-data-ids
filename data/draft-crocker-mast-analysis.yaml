abstract:
- content: "<p>An IP Address serves the dual roles as references to a 'place' on the
    Internet and to a host on the Internet, labeled 'locator' and 'identifier', respectively.
    Systems that use IP Addresses as identifiers cannot support dynamic changes in
    the mapping between the identifier and the locator. For a system to use a different
    IP Address pair, participants must initiate a new exchange. In the case of TCP,
    this means a new connection. In recent years, there have been efforts to overcome
    this limitation, through different approaches at different places in the Internet
    architecture. This paper reviews the basic requirements for support of multiaddressing
    (mobility and multihoming), and the efforts to support them. Barriers to adoption,
    administrative overhead, and operational efficiency are of particular concern.</p>"
