abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IPv6 node processing an IPv6 packet does not support an IPv6
    option whose two-highest-order bits of the Option Type are '10', it is required
    to respond with an ICMPv6 Parameter Problem error message, even if the Destination
    Address of the packet was a multicast address. This feature provides an amplification
    vector, opening the door to an IPv6 version of the 'Smurf' Denial-of-Service (DoS)
    attack found in IPv4 networks. This document discusses the security implications
    of the aforementioned options, and formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 4443 such
    that this attack vector is eliminated. Additionally, it describes a number of
    operational mitigations that could be deployed against this attack vector.</p>"
