abstract:
- content: "<p>The information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm offers replication
    of autonomously verifiable content throughout a network, in which content is bound
    to names instead of hosts. This has proven beneficial in particular for the constrained
    IoT. Several approaches, the most prominent of which being Content-Centric Networking
    (CCNx) and Named-Data Networking (NDN), propose access to named content directly
    on the network layer. Independently, the CoRe WG developed mechanisms that support
    autonomous content processing, on-path caching, and content object security using
    CoAP proxies and OSCORE. This document describes a data-centric deployment option
    using standard CoAP features to replicate information-centric properties and benefits
    to the host-centric IoT world.</p>"
