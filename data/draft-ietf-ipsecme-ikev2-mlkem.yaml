abstract:
- content: "<p>NIST recently standardized ML-KEM, a new key encapsulation mechanism,
    which can be used for quantum-resistant key establishment. This draft specifies
    how to use ML-KEM as an additional key exchange in IKEv2 along with traditional
    key exchanges. This Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanism
    approach allows for negotiating IKE and Child SA keys which are safe against cryptanalytically-relevant
    quantum computers and theoretical weaknesses in ML-KEM.</p>"
