    in Framework[6] for transcoding with the Session Initiation Protocol. The model
    might be applied for more general-purpose services satisfying the requirements
    of multimedia applications without an additional INVITE, meanwhile the existing
    two models, The third party call control model and The conference bridge model,
    are applied for the specific application requirements in support of deaf, hard
