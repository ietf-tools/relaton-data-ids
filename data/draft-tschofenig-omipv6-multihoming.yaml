abstract:
- content: "<p>The Optimized Mobile IPv6 with CGA (OMIPv6-CGA) protocol specifies
    a new route optimization (RO) to solve the mobility problem. Privacy extensions
    for OMIPv6 adds anonymity and unlinkability support to the OMIPv6-CGA protocol.
    This document combines OMIPv6-CGA including its privacy extension with support
    for multi-homing. As such, it offers an efficient and secure multi-homing and
    mobility support for MIPv6 using CGAs including privacy support.</p>"
