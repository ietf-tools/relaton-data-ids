abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used to
    route both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. Integrated IS- IS can now
    also be used to route IPv6 [12]. RFC 1195 [1] places certain topological restrictions
    on networks that are routed using Integrated IS-IS, specifically that every Intermediate
    System in a level-1 area must be able to forward all network layer protocols that
    are present in that area, and that every level-2 Intermediate System must be able
    to forward all network layer protocols present in the routing domain. The mechanism
    described in this document enables an Intermediate System or a group of Intermediate
    Systems that do not support a particular network layer protocol to be used in
    a level-1 area or level-2 subdomain where that network layer protocol is present.
    Specifically the mechanism provides automatic encapsulation and unencapsulation
    so that a packet or PDU may pass through an Intermediate System that would not
    normally be able to forward that type of packet.</p>"
