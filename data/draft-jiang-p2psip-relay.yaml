abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an optional extension to RELOAD to support direct
    response and relay peer routing modes. RELOAD recommends symmetric recursive routing
    for routing messages. The new optional extensions provide a shorter route for
    responses reducing the overhead on intermediary peers and describe the potential
    cases where these extensions can be used.</p>"
