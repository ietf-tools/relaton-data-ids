abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to differentiate
    the various traffic flow session within network. The current definition of IPv6
    Flow Label focuses mainly on how the packet source forms the value of this field
    and how the forwarder in-path treats it. There is no analysis on the relation
    between the flow label from source nodes and its corresponding value in return
    packet. This draft analyzes the requirements for flow label reflection between
    the upstream session and the corresponding downstream session. Based on the analysis,
    the flow label reflection mechanism is proposed in this document.</p>"
