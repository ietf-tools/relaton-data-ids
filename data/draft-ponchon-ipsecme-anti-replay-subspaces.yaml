abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the challenges of running IPsec with anti-
    replay in multi-core environments where packets may be re-ordered (e.g., when
    sent over multiple IP paths, traffic-engineered paths and/or using different QoS
    classes). A new solution based on splitting the anti-replay sequence number space
    into multiple different sequencing subspaces is proposed. Since this solution
    requires support on both parties, an IKE extension is proposed in order to negotiate
    the use of the anti-replay sequence number subspaces.</p>"
