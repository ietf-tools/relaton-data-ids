abstract:
- content: <p>One of the major features or requirements of Cloud is on-demand CRUD
    (Create / Read / Update / Delete) of Cloud resources or associated resources.
    The on-demand feature dictates that resources are CRUD in a time-frame in the
    order of seconds or few minutes since the arrival of the resource CRUD request.
    Many network resources cannot be CRUD in that time-frame. With the support of
    programmable networking (or SDN) in the model of I2RS will facilitate programming
    of network resources rapidly, thus facilitating CRUD of Cloud or related network
    resources on-demand. Network resources associated with many network services can
    be either a Cloud resource or directly associated with a Cloud resource. These
    resources should be CRUD on-demand in Cloud timescale. In this draft, employing
    Hybrid (virtual) Cloud as a use case and using I2RS as the "model", we will define
    few requirements for programmable on-demand interfaces to network services or
    I2NS.</p>
