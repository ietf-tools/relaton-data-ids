abstract:
- content: "<p>The SELECT protocol allows Internet users to supply their ratings of
    Internet documents, and to use ratings provided by other users to filter and select
    what to read In particular, SELECT supports so-called collaborative filtering.
    By this is meant that the filtering and selection for a particular user is made
    based on ratings provided by special groups of raters, such as peer groups, people
    with similar values, interests and expertise as the person for whom the selecting
    and filtering is done. The SELECT functionality is downwards compatible with PICS
    [PICS 1, PICS 2], but a major difference is that while PICS is mainly oriented
    towards keeping out unsuitable information from children (blackballing), SELECT
    is mainly oriented towards helping people find the best and most valuable information
    for them on the Internet (goldballing). A syntactical difference from PICS is
    that the encodings in SELECT are using the XML encoding format.</p>"
