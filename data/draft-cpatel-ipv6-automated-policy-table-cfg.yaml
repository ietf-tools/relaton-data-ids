abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method to manage the address selection policy
    tables in network hosts using RA's (Router Advertisements). The aim is to provide
    an easy method to network operators to control the src/dest address used by the
    host in communication within, and outside of the site(s) in which the host resides.
    Control of the policy tables allows 1) the user to control the scope in which
    a host may operate, and 2) non-disruption of intra-site traffic during renumbering
    caused by change in the global prefix used by the site to connect to the Internet.
    A major impact of the last benefit would be to provide one less incentive to advertise
    routes to the stable network prefixes in the Internet.</p>"
