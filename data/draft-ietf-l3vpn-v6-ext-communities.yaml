abstract:
- content: "<p>Current specifications of BGP Extended Communities (RFC 4360) support
    the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, but do not support an IPv6 Address
    Specific Extended Community. The lack of an IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community
    may be a problem when an application uses the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community,
    and one wants to use this application in a pure IPv6 environment. This document
    defines a new BGP attribute, the IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community, that
    addresses this problem. The IPv6 Address Specific Extended Community is similar
    to the IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community, except that it carries an IPv6
    address rather than an IPv4 address. [STANDARDS TRACK]</p>"
