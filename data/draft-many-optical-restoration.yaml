abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft presents the mechanism and corresponding signalling
    protocol extensions for provisioned and dynamic lightpath restoration schemes.
    The mechanisms proposed cover shared meshed restoration as well as provisioned
    and non-provisioned schemes. The former (equivalent to lightpath protection) implies
    the provisioning of backup lightpaths in advance before failures occur.</p>"
