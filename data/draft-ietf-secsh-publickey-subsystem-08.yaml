abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Shell defines a user authentication mechanism that is based
    on public keys, but does not define any mechanism for key distribution. No common
    key management solution exists in current implementations. This document describes
    a protocol that can be used to configure public keys in an implementation-independent
    fashion, allowing client software to take on the burden of this configuration.
    The Public Key Subsystem provides a server-independent mechanism for clients to
    add public keys, remove public keys, and list the current public keys known by
    the server. Rights to manage public keys are specific and limited to the authenticated
    user. A public key may also be associated with various restrictions, including
    a mandatory command or subsystem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
