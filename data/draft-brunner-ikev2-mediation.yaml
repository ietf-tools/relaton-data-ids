abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the IKEv2 Mediation Extension (IKE-ME), a connectivity
    extension to the Internet Key Exchange IKEv2. IKE-ME allows two peers, each behind
    one or more Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls to establish a direct
    and secure connection without the need to configure any of the intermediate network
    devices. To establish this direct connection, a process similar to Interactive
    Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is used.</p>"
