abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism by which packets of Real-Time Transport
    Protocol (RTP) audio streams can indicate, in an RTP header extension, the audio
    level of the audio sample carried in the RTP packet. In large conferences, this
    can reduce the load on an audio mixer or other middlebox which wants to forward
    only a few of the loudest audio streams, without requiring it to decode and measure
    every stream that is received.</p>"
