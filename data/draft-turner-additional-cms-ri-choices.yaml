abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) allows revocation information
    to be conveyed as part of the SignedData, EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData, and
    AuthEnvelopedData content types. The preferred format for revocation information
    is the Certificate Revocation List (CRL), but an extension mechanism supports
    other revocation information formats. This document defines two additional revocation
    information formats for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses and
    Server-Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) requests and responses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
