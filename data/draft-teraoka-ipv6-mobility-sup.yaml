abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a protocol to support mobility in IPv6. The mobile
    node has an identifier (home address) and a temporary address (care-of address).
    The IPv6 base header includes the temporary addresses so that the source and destination
    addresses are always topologically significant, while the identifiers are included
    in the Destination Options Header. End nodes may have authentic cache information
    between identifiers and addresses for routing optimization. This protocol introduces
    two new destination options: `Source Identifier' and `Destination Identifier',
    and also introduces two control packets using UDP.</p>"
