abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) are used to protect data exchanged over a wide range of application protocols
    and can also form the basis for secure transport protocols. Over the years, the
    industry has witnessed several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks
    on the most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation. This document
    provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services
    that use TLS and DTLS. These recommendations are applicable to the majority of
    use cases. RFC 7525, an earlier version of the TLS recommendations, was published
    when the industry was transitioning to TLS 1.2. Years later, this transition is
    largely complete, and TLS 1.3 is widely available. This document updates the guidance
    given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525. In addition, this document updates
    RFCs 5288 and 6066 in view of recent attacks.</p>"
