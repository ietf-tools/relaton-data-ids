abstract:
- content: "<p>PPP multiplexing is a technique to encapsulate and carry multiple subframes
    inside a single PPP superframe as defined in RFC3153. With the existing Muxing
    mechanism, the carrier superframes waits for certain time for the incoming frames
    to be multiplexed, but this wait period may have impact on the delay constrains
    for the subframes. On the other hand lesser wait period for superframes so as
    to reduce the delay means lesser multiplexing efficiency. This document describe
    a method to achive maximum multiplexing efficiency for PPP Multiplexing over a
    link especially during low and medium traffic scenarios with out effecting the
    delay constraints required for different types of traffic over that link. With
    priority multiplexing technique delay for real time traffic during Multiplexing
    can be reduced, still assuring maximum Multiplexing efficiency</p>"
