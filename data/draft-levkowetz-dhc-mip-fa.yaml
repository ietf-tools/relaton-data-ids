abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    option with sub-options. One sub-option may be used by a DHCP client to provide
    mobile IP related identity information to the DHCP server. Another sub-option
    may be passed from the DHCP Server to the DHCP Client to announce the presence
    of one or more mobile IP Mobility Agents. For each announced Mobility Agent, information
    is provided which is the same as that of the classical Mobile IP Agent Advertisement
    extension to ICMP Router Advertisements.</p>"
