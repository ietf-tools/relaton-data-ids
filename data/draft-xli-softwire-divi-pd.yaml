abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the address specifications and deployment considerations
    of address-sharing dual stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation with prefix delegation
    (dIVI-pd). The dIVI-pd keeps the features of stateless, end-to-end address transparency
    and bidirectional-initiated communications of the original stateless IPv4/IPv6
    translation, while it can utilize the IPv4 addresses more effectively. In addition,
    it does not require the DNS64 and ALG, and can be used with prefix delegation.</p>"
