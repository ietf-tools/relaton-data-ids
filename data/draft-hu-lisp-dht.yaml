abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a DHT based distributed EID-to-RLOC mapping method.
    The distributed EID-to-RLOC mapping is stored in an overlay, which is different
    from the data forwarding plane, and made up by DHT rings. The DHT based overlay
    is deployed in an AS, and the inter-AS communication is through DHT Border Server,
    which in located in the border of DHT rings. The DHT Border Server is used to
    flood the cross routing and forward the cross domain data packet. The DHT based
    Distributed mapping system is a hybrid push and pull method.</p>"
