abstract:
- content: "<p>A framework for providing various Layer 1 and Layer 2 services over
    a Packet Switched Network has been described in [3]. This draft provides encapsulation
    formats and guidelines for transporting a variety of ATM services over a PSN.
    This draft includes refinements to draft-brayley-pwe3-atm-service that was previously
    submitted to the PWE3 working group. It reuses the ATM cell and AAL5 encapsulation
    defined in the original martini encapsulation draft [7], but includes an applicability
    statement for each service along with ATM OAM handling and QoS guidelines.</p>"
