abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-core-dynlink] defines five CoAP Observaton attributes (minimum
    period, maximum period, band step, less than and greater than) to control when
    notifications are sent. These attributes are insufficient for some use cases.
    This document specifies additional attributes allowing for notification bands,
    initialization values, band step, sample number window and sample time window
    to allow for a wider range of use cases.</p>"
