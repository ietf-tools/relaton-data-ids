abstract:
- content: "<p>Various overlay tunnels are used in networks including WAN, enterprise
    campus and others. End to end paths are partitioned into multiple segments using
    overlay tunnels to achieve better path selection, lower latency and so on. Traditional
    end-to-end transport layers respond to packet loss slowly especially in long-haul
    networks: They either wait for some signal from the receiver to indicate a loss
    and then retransmit from the sender or rely on sender's timeout which is often
    quite long. LOOPS (Localized Optimization of Path Segments) attempts to provide
    non end-to-end local based in-network recovery to achieve better data delivery
    by making packet loss recovery faster. In an overlay network scenario, LOOPS can
    be performed over the existing, or purposely created, overlay tunnel based path
    segments. This document illustrates the slow packet loss recovery problems LOOPS
    tries to solve in some use cases and analyzes the impacts when local in-network
    recovery is employed as a LOOPS mechanism.</p>"
