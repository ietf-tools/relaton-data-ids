abstract:
- content: "<p>The growth in mobile terminal access to the Internet has been one of
    the greatest growth areas in the past year. Indeed the so-called 3rd generation
    mobile networks being designed are premised upon Internet services and protocols.
    Both mobility and wireless access bring with them unique requirements that needs
    to be addressed within the Internet community such as address space and limited
    access bandwidth. This document is a synthesis of a yearlong study of mobile operators
    and mobile ISPs to crystallise these unique requirements. These are provided for
    guidance and are not intended to be prescriptive on the current Internet Architectural
    Framework.</p>"
