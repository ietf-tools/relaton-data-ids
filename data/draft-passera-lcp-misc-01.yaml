abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents five extensions to the PPP/LCP Protocol : *
    Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) looking for its Operating
    System file. * Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) looking
    for its configuration file. * Request from an equipment to receive Discard frame
    when no Data frame can be sent. When no Discard or Data frames are received the
    link will be brought down. This method is more efficient than using a timeout
    and/or a keepalive mecanism. * Interface Bandwidth and Delay measurements. These
    informations can be used by OSPF or any other IGP protocol.</p>"
