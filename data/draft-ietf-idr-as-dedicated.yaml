abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increased growth of the Internet, the number of customers
    using BGP4 has grown significantly. RFC1930 outlines a set of guidelines for when
    one needs and should use an AS. However, the customer and service provider (ISP)
    are left with a problem as a result of this in that while there is no need for
    an allocated AS under the guidelines, certain conditions make the use of BGP4
    a very pragmatic and perhaps only way to connect a customer homed to a single
    ISP. This paper proposes a solution to this problem in line with recommendations
    set forth in RFC1930. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
