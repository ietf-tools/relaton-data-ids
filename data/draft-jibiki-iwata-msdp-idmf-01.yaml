abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a general inter-domain multicast forwarding (IDMF)
    mechanism for the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol and its application to the
    MSDP specific forwarding extension (MSDP-FE). Although there have been various
    inter-domain multicast routing and forwarding protocols, they are still limited
    in their capacity to handle policy routing, QoS routing, accounting and security,
    which network administrators are willing to use in their network. In order to
    overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach to create an inter-domain
    multicast forwarding tree (or routing table) among multiple PIM-SM domains with
    logical multicast paths over which multicast packets are forwarded or flooded.
    The logical multicast paths are created by either the IP-in-IP tunneling method,
    the IP masquerade-like method, or the MPLS label switched path (LSP) method, which
    can easily reuse policy routing and QoS routing for unicast routing. These logical
    multicast paths are established among IDMF- capable nodes, which are located within
    each PIM-SM domain, either manually or by a dynamic IDMF tree construction protocol.
    This general framework for IDMF can be used as an MSDP based forwarding mechanism.
    Furthermore, the IDMF-capable nodes (i.e., MSDP-FE-capable nodes) can also function
    as a proxy sender of multicast packets. This can prevent a multicast receiver
    from changing an RP-tree into a global SP-tree, and also can help to reduce, on
    the surface, the number of multicast sources for a particular multicast group.
    This property can be effectively used for accounting, security, and scalability
    enhancement required for inter-domain communication.</p>"
