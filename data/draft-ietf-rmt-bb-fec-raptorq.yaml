abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) scheme, corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 6, for the RaptorQ FEC code and
    its application to reliable delivery of data objects. RaptorQ codes are a new
    family of codes that provide superior flexibility, support for larger source block
    sizes, and better coding efficiency than Raptor codes in RFC 5053. RaptorQ is
    also a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated
    on the fly by the encoder from the source symbols of a source block of data. The
    decoder is able to recover the source block from almost any set of encoding symbols
    of sufficient cardinality -- in most cases, a set of cardinality equal to the
    number of source symbols is sufficient; in rare cases, a set of cardinality slightly
    more than the number of source symbols is required. The RaptorQ code described
    here is a systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding
    symbols that can be generated. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
