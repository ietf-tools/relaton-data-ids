abstract:
- content: "<p>Motivated by the need to find and evaluate better ways for reaching
    on-line content in upcoming Future Internet environments, ICN has been increasingly
    deployed in an broad range of research and experimental actions. Some deployments
    even go as far as subjecting ICN to new scenarios beyond content-reaching, exposing
    the flexibility of ICN core primitives in supporting such mechanisms. In this
    sense, besides analyzing and discussing the role of network management procedures
    in ICN environments, this document also analyzes possibilities on how intrinsic
    core ICN mechanisms can be reutilized for network management. We consider that
    the availability of management mechanisms for ICN will foster their deployment
    and, as such, should be tackled still in the design and experimentation phases.
    Perhaps ICN can adapt successful mechanisms from the host- centric paradigm, or
    new network management schemes can be designed. Perhaps even both. This document
    centralizes that discussion, drawing the attention of the ICNRG community to this
    underdeveloped area of research in ICN.</p>"
