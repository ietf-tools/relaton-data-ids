abstract:
- content: "<p>In RFC6232(Purge Originator Identification TLV for IS-IS), ISIS POI
    (Purge Originator Identification) TLV is added to the purge LSP to record the
    system ID of the IS generating it. At present, OSPF purge does not contain any
    information identifying the Router that generates the purge. This makes it difficult
    to locate the source router. While OSPF protocol is difficult to add additional
    content to the purge LSA, this document proposes generating a POI LSA together
    with a purge LSA to record the router ID of the router generating the purge. To
    address this issue, this document defines a POI LSA to record the router ID of
    the OSPF generating it.</p>"
