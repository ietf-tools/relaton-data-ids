abstract:
- content: "<p>To allow traversal of firewalls or provide additional network services
    such as QoS or supplemental bandwidth, it is necessary to deploy application-aware
    network elements. Such network elements are costly to create, deploy, and are
    unable to adequately cope with changes to the application itself, stifling innovation.
    This document describes a different approach, where the application explicitly
    signals its needs to the network.</p>"
