abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability and automation
    by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [RFC4210] and the related
    Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) [RFC4211]. It specifies a subset of
    CMP and CRMF focusing on typical uses cases relevant for managing certificates
    of devices in industrial and IoT scenarios. To limit the overhead of certificate
    management for constrained devices only the most crucial types of transactions
    are specified as mandatory. To foster interoperability also in more complex scenarios,
    other types of transactions are specified as recommended or optional.</p>"
