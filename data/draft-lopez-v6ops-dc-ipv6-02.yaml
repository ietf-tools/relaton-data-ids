abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to provide a reference framework for datacenter
    operators planning for a migration of their infrastructures to IPv6. It aims to
    offer a scheme for evaluating different products and architectures, and therefore
    it is also addressed to manufacturers and solution providers, so they can use
    it to gauge their solutions. We believe this will translate in a smoother and
    faster transition of these infrastuctures into IPv6 The document focuses on the
    DC infrastructure itself, its operation, and the aspects related to DC interconnection
    through IPv6. It does not consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet
    services provided by applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6 beyond
    the specific aspects related to how their deployment on the DC infrastructure.
    Apart from facilitating the migration procedure itself, the mechanisms outlined
    here are intended to make this migration as transparent as possible (if not completely
    transparent) to applications and services running on the DC infrastructure, as
    well as to take advantage of IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally
    and across the Internet.</p>"
