- content: "<p>This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) as a transport protocol for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).
    It provides guidances on when and how to use DTLS with the currently standardized
    STUN Usages. It also specifies modifications to the STUN URIs and TURN URIs and
    to the TURN resolution mechanism to facilitate the resolution of STUN URIs and
    TURN URIs into the IP address and port of STUN and TURN servers supporting DTLS
    as a transport protocol.</p>"
