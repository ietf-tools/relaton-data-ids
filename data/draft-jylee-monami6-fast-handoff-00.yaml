abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces extensions to Fast-handover Mobile IPv6 [6]
    that improves handover latency in Mobile IPv6 procedures in case mobile nodes
    have multiple wireless interfaces. In the basic Fast MIPv6 [6], the PAR (previous
    access router) forwards the arriving packets for the mobile node to the NAR (new
    access router) by setting up a tunnel to the NAR in order to prevent packet losses
    incurred by handover latency during handover procedure. Recently, many mobile
    nodes begin to have multiple wireless interfaces, and multiple active IPv6 Care-of-Addresses
    are assigned and registered simultaneously to a Home Agent [2] in order to utilize
    multiple wireless interfaces in terms of bandwidth, delay, etc. Furthermore, the
    Mobile IPv6 with extension to multiple CoA registration also needs fast handover
    procedure to reduce handover latency and packet losses. However, in the Mobile
    IPv6 with multiple CoA registration, packet tunneling to a NAR during handoff
    of one interface can incur performance degradation due to severe packet reordering
    when multiple interfaces are simultaneously used for load sharing. This is because
    the partial traffic flow coming from the interface involved in handover is suspended
    during handover and later tunneled to a NAR, while the other partial traffic flow
    is continuously forwarded to the mobile node through the other stable interface,
    which could incur severe reordering if the handover is delayed or unstable by
    ping-pong effects. We thus propose in this document an extension to Fast handover
    Mobile IPv6 procedure which can indicate a specific tunneling destination except
    the NAR, for example, other interfaces (or CoAs) in the same mobile node. This
    extension not only enhances the traffic quality during handoff but also improves
    the handover signaling performance because data traffic is redirected to another
    interface during handover signaling.</p>"
