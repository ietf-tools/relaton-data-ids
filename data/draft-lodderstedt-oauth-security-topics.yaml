abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft gives a comprehensive overview on open OAuth security topics.
    It is intended to serve as a tool for the OAuth working group to systematically
    address these open security topics, recommending mitigations, and potentially
    also defining OAuth extensions needed to cope with the respective security threats.
    This draft will potentially become a BCP over time.</p>"
