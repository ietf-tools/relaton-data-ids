abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP) transported employing Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) messages. As such, it defines an EAP lower-layer based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP.
    One of the primer goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled device (EAP peer) that
    intends to join a security domain managed by a domain Controller (EAP authenticator).
    Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between
    them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling
    the establishment of a security association between them. This document also provides
    guidelines on how to generate key material for other types of security associations.</p>"
