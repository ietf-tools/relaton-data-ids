abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of cryptographic
    algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data. There is currently
    an IANA registry for these algorithms that is incomplete in that it lacks the
    implementation status of each algorithm. This document provides an applicability
    statement on algorithm implementation compliance status for DNSSEC implementations.
    This status is to measure compliance to this RFC only. This document replaces
    that registry table with a new IANA registry table for Domain Name System Security
    (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers that lists (or assigns) each algorithm's status based
    on the current reference.</p>"
