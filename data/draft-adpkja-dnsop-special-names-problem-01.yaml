abstract:
- content: "<p>The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the Domain
    Name System (DNS). However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally different
    from the DNS, and may or may not share the same namespace. When an end-user triggers
    resolution of a name on a system which supports multiple, different protocols
    (or resolution mechanisms) for name resolution, it is desirable that the protocol
    used is unambiguous, and that requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently
    answered using another. [RFC6761] introduced a framework by which, under certain
    circumstances, a particular domain name could be acknowledged as being special.
    This framework has been used twice to reserve top- level domains (.local and.onion)
    that should not be used within the DNS to avoid the possibility of namespace collisions
    in parallel use of non-DNS name resolution protocols. Various challenges have
    become apparent with this application of the guidance provided in [RFC6761]. This
    document aims to document those challenges in the form of a problem statement,
    to facilitate further discussion of potential solutions.</p>"
