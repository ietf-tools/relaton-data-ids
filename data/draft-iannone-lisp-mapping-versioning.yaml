abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the LISP Map-Versioning mechanism. This is
    mechanism to provide in-packet information about EID-to-RLOC mappings used to
    encapsulate LISP data packets. The proposed approach is based on associating a
    version number to EID-to-RLOC mappings and transport such a version number in
    the LISP specific header of LISP- encapsulated packets. LISP Map-Versioning is
    particularly useful to inform communicating xTRs about modification of the mappings
    used to encapsulate packets. Note that, in the LISP encapsulation and in the Map
    Records, bits used for Map-Versioning can be safely ignored by xTRs that do not
    support the mechanism.</p>"
