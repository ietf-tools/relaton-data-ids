abstract:
- content: "<p>The 3GPP Rel-18 has completed the working item (WID) of the DetNet,
    i.e., the Deterministic Network. This WID defines and standardizes how a 5G system
    (5GS) may behave as a logical DetNet transit node, as well as how a 5GS DetNet
    node may integrate into the IP-domain deterministic network. A 5GS logical DetNet
    node bears the ‘composite’ architecture in that it could act as one or more DetNet
    routers. While the 3GPP Rel-18 work has referenced the IETF Detnet YANG model
    draft for the purpose of provisioning the DetNet traffic parameters to a 5GS logical
    DetNet node, the per-(logical)-node parameter provisioning needs to be further
    improved. This draft defines some new DetNet YANG parameters, e.g., the type of
    a DetNet node, the composite node ID, and the flow direction within a 5GS logical
    node, via reusing the existing IETF YANG model. Toward the end, we also discuss
    some complicated 5GS related DetNet scenarios that would be considered for future
    extensions.</p>"
