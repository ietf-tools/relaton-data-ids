abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto
    a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file. The Flexible File
    Version 2 Layout Type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS that
    allows the use of storage devices that require only a limited degree of interaction
    with the metadata server and use already-existing protocols. Data replication
    is also added to provide integrity.</p>"
