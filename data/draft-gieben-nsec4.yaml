abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the
    NSEC resource record for authenticated denial of existence, and the NSEC3 resource
    record for hashed authenticated denial of existence. This document introduces
    an alternative resource record, NSEC4, which similarly provides authenticated
    denial of existence. It permits gradual expansion of delegation-centric zones,
    just like NSEC3 does. With NSEC4 it is possible, but not required, to provide
    measures against zone enumeration. NSEC4 reduces the size of the denial of existence
    response and adds Opt-Out to unhashed names.</p>"
