abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record allows a
    domain to communicate an issuance policy to Certification Authorities (CAs) but
    only allows a domain to define a policy with CA-level granularity. However, the
    CAA specification (RFC 8659) also provides facilities for an extension to admit
    a more granular, CA-specific policy. This specification defines two such parameters:
    one allowing specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URIs and one allowing
    specific methods of domain control validation as defined by the Automatic Certificate
    Management Environment (ACME) protocol to be required.</p>"
