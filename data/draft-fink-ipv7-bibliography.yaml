abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft provides a bibliography of documents which address
    the routing and addressing scaling problems in the current IP architecture, and
    the design of the next generation of the IP protocol suite, commonly referred
    to as IPv7. This document is intended to simplify the process of locating all
    of the relevant documents pertaining to this area. These documents take various
    forms, including Request For Comments (RFCs), Internet Drafts (I-Ds), and other
    papers produced either by Working Groups of the IETF or individuals actively working
    in this area. It is suggested that Internet Drafts related to this topic reference
    this bibliography I-D, which will be updated on a regular basis as new documents
    are published or existing ones are modified or change status, e.g. from Internet
    Draft to RFC.</p>"
