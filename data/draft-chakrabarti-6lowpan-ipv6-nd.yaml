abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF 6LowPan working group defines IPv6 over low-power personal area
    network (IEEE 802.15.4). IEEE 802.15.4 link layer does not have multicast support,
    although it supports broadcast. Due to the nature of LowPan network or sensor
    networks, broadcast messages should be minimized. This document suggests some
    optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery related multicast messages in order to
    reduce signaling in the low-cost low-powered network.</p>"
