abstract:
- content: "<p>When running a multi-level multicast routing protocol, upper levels
    need to know about group memberships in lower levels in a protocol- independent
    fashion. Domain Wide Multicast Group Membership Reports allow this information
    to be learned in a fashion similar to IGMP[Fenn97] at the domain level. This document
    is a product of the IDMR working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force.
    Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing
    list at idmr@cs.ucl.ac.uk and/or the author.</p>"
