- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism to relay the state(s) of an Internet
    Draft to the reader. This mechanism may be used, in part, to encourage or discourage
    review submission, test suite creation, and prototype implementation of the entire
    draft or its portions. The state of the draft is declared using a human-friendly
    notation suitable for automated extraction of standard states.</p>"
