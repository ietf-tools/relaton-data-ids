abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a randomized hashing scheme consisting of a
    simple message randomization transform that when used as a front-end to regular
    hash-then-sign signature schemes, such as RSA and DSS, frees these signatures
    from their current vulnerability to off-line collision attacks against the underlying
    hash function. The proposed mechanism can work with any hash function as-is and
    requires no change to the underlying signature algorithm. Incorporating this mechanism
    into existing applications requires changes that are comparable in their complexity
    to accommodating a new (deterministic) hash function such as SHA-256. Visit http://www.ee.technion.ac.il/~hugo/rhash/
    for more information and updates on this work.</p>"
