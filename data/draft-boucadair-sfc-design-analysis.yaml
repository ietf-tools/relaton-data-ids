abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at analyzing the various design options and providing
    a set of recommendations for the design of Service Function Chaining solution(s).
    Note: o The analysis does not claim to be exhaustive. The list includes a preliminary
    set of potential solutions; other proposals can be added to the analysis if required.
    o The analysis is still ongoing. The analysis text will be updated to integrate
    received comments and inputs. o Sketched recommendations are not frozen. These
    recommendations are provided as proposals to kick-off the discussion and to challenge
    them. o The analysis does not cover any application-specific solution (e.g., HTTP
    header) because of the potential issues inherent to (TLS) encrypted traffic. o
    The analysis will be updated to take into account the full set of SFC requirements.</p>"
