abstract:
- content: <p>Experience with the mechanism described in "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4
    Relay Routers" [RFC3068] has shown that the mechanism is not a reliable means
    for communicating with resources in the public IPv6 Internet. This limits the
    applicability of the "6to4" mechanism described in [RFC3056].</p>
