- content: "<p>Sending on QUIC streams can only be aborted early by the sender with
    a RESET_STREAM frame. This document describes how a receiver can indicate when
    the data they have received is enough, allowing the sender to reliably deliver
    some data, but abort sending for anything more than the indicated amount.</p>"
