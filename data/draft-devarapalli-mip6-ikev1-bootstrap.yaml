abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping mechanisms require the use of
    IKEv2 between the mobile node and the home agent. If the Mobile IPv6 signaling
    messages are protected by IKEv1 and IPsec as described in RFC 3776, then the bootstrapping
    mechanism based on IKEv2 cannot be used. This document describes a bootstrapping
    mechanism for Mobile IPv6 when RFC 3776 is used.</p>"
