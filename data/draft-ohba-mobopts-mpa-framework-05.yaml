abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre- Authentication
    (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing
    mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms to support
    inter-domain handover. MPA is a mobile-assisted, secure handover optimization
    scheme that works over any link-layer and with any mobility management protocol
    and is best applicable to support optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's
    pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow
    many of the handoff related operations to take place before the mobile has moved
    to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and
    its applicability for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols
    during inter-domain handover.</p>"
