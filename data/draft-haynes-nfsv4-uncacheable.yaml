abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network File System v4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to cache both
    the metadata and the data for a file object. It can also cache the metadata for
    a directory object. Caching the dirents (i.e., the metadata) allows the client
    to avoid querying the server to refresh information. But this defeats the server
    checking to see if the user has permission to view the dirent's attributes. Caching
    the data can cause performance impacts if the page cache hit rate is low.. This
    document introduces a new file attribute called uncacheable which indicates that
    the client MUST NOT cache the metadata or data for that dirent. This document
    extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7863).</p>"
