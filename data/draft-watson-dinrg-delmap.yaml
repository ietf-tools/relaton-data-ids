abstract:
- content: "<p>Delegated namespaces underpin almost every Internet-scale system -
    domain name management, IP address allocation, Public Key Infrastructure, etc.
    - but are centrally managed by entities with unilateral revocation authority and
    no common interface. This draft specifies a generalized scheme for delegation
    that supports explicit time-bound guarantees and limits misuse. Mappings may be
    secured by any general purpose distributed consensus protocol that supports voting;
    clients can query the local state of any number of participants and receive the
    correct result, barring a compromise at the consensus layer.</p>"
