abstract:
- content: "<p>The wide deployment of wireless devices, with their low installed cost
    (compared to wired devices), will significantly improve the productivity and safety
    of industrial plants. It will simultaneously increase the efficiency and safety
    of the plant's workers, by extending and making more timely the information set
    available about plant operations. The new Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) defines a Distance Vector protocol that is designed for such networks.
    The aim of this document is to analyze the applicability of that routing protocol
    in industrial LLNs formed of field devices.</p>"
