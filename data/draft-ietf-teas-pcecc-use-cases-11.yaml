abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of a Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) system. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
    a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic
    demands. PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs),
    which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
    Communication Protocol (PCEP). SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS
    traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in
    a range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing (SR), Service Function
    Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. It is, therefore,
    reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments
    to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. A PCE as a Central
    Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane
    by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing
    it. This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines
    its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through
    a number of use cases. PCEP extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered
    in separate documents.</p>"
