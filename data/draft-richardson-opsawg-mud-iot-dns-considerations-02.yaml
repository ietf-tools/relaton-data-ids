abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details concerns about how Internet of Things devices
    use IP addresses and DNS names. The issue becomes acute as network operators begin
    deploying RFC8520 Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) definitions to control
    device access. This document explains the problem through a series of examples
    of what can go wrong, and then provides some advice on how a device manufacturer
    can best make deal with these issues. The recommendations have an impact upon
    device and network protocol design. {RFC-EDITOR, please remove. Markdown and issue
    tracker for this document is at https://github.com/mcr/iot-mud-dns-considerations.git
    }</p>"
