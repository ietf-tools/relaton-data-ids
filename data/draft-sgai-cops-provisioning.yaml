abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a clear need for a standard way to provision policies to network
    devices. These policies may be related to QoS (Quality of Service), Security,
    VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), etc. The IETF RSVP Admission Policy (RAP) WG
    has defined the COPS (Common Open Policy Service) protocol [COPS] and a scalable
    policy control model for RSVP [RSVP]. This document describes a new client type
    ('Provisioning') for the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol to support
    policy provisioning. This new client type is independent of the type of policy
    and it is based on the concept of PIBs (Policy Information Bases [PIB]. The example
    of provisioning used in this document is QoS Policy Provisioning in a Differentiated
    Services (DiffServ) environment.</p>"
