abstract:
- content: "<p>Many distributed applications may benefit from a high bandwidth connection
    to the Internet. However, this requires high bandwidth links between remotes sites.
    A low-cost solution to deliver high bandwidth services over wide geographical
    areas via the use of broadcast satellite networks has been proposed by [ASBD].
    However, this solution is based on low cost receivers with zero bandwidth return.
    Connection over the satellite link is therefore unidirectional. The integration
    of these satellite networks with the Internet requires changes in common routing
    protocols.</p>"
