abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to simplify the deployment of AAAA records in the DNS, name
    servers should only perform automatic inclusion of these RRs when there is an
    explicit indication that the resolver can understand those RRs. This document
    proposes the use of a bit in the EDNS0 header to provide that explicit indication
    and describes the necessary protocol changes to implement that notification.</p>"
