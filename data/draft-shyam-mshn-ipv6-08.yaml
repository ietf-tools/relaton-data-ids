abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to address an approach for reorganization of entire
    network in a large address space. It describes how a three- tier mesh structured
    hierarchy can be established based on fragmenting the entire space into some regions
    and sub regions inside each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant
    to this architecture in the context of IPv6. This document also tries to come
    out with an approach how IP switch based network can perform as good as ATM network
    for the processing of real time traffic.</p>"
