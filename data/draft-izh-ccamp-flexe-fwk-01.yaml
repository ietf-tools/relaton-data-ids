abstract:
- content: <p>Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates
    of the Ethernet PHY(s). OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was the first
    step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY rates. OIF has recently
    approved another implementation agreement [OIFFLEXE1] which allows complete decoupling
    of the MAC data rates and the Ethernet PHY(s) that support them. This includes
    support for (a) MAC rates which are greater than the rate of a single PHY (satisfied
    by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC rates which are less than the rate of
    a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple FlexE client signals carried over a
    single PHY, or over a collection of bonded PHY(s). The FlexE Shim functions which
    bond multipe Ethernet PHY(s) to realize a large "pipe" view of the connectivity
    between two FlexE aware devices as a collection of multiple point-to-point links
    (one link per Ethernet PHY). These logical point-to-point links can either be
    direct links (without an intervening transport network), or realized via an Optical
    transport network. This document describes usecases that reflect FlexE deployment
    scenarios and specifies the technical requirements for extensions to GMPLS control
    plane protocols to support these scenarios.</p>
