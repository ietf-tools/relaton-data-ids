abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a high-level overview architecture for building
    overlay networks in NVO3. The architecture is given at a high-level, showing the
    major components of an overall system. An important goal is to divide the space
    into individual smaller components that can be implemented independently and with
    clear interfaces and interactions with other components. It should be possible
    to build and implement individual components in isolation and have them work with
    other components with no changes to other components. That way implementers have
    flexibility in implementing individual components and can optimize and innovate
    within their respective components without requiring changes to other components.</p>"
