abstract:
- content: "<p>An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service
    using the described technique. This identification information can be used by
    the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server
    to a single entity. This can used to reduce the secrecy for push subscription
    URLs by being able to restrict subscriptions to a specific application server.
    An application server is further able include additional information the operator
    of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application server.</p>"
