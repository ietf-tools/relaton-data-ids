abstract:
- content: "<p>Location of a caller is essential to processing an emergency call.
    Location is needed to correctly route the call, and to correctly dispatch help
    to the right place. Location can be specified in geographic (latitude, longitude)
    or civic (country, province, locality) forms. This document proposes a DNS-based
    mechanism to lookup emergency calling URIs and related emergency information from
    a known civic location in a specific form. Other companion documents propose a
    non DNS-based approach to determine civic location from geographic location, and
    describe how to discover a civic location in the appropriate local form(s) for
    this application.</p>"
