abstract:
- content: "<p>Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile nodes
    (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling process.
    NEMO Basic support protocol [RFC3963] is standardized to provide network mobility
    support. Current mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 [RFC6275] and PMIPv6
    [RFC5213], rely on a central mobility anchor in order to provide mobility support
    for the mobile nodes. These centralized approaches show some big issues, such
    as a single point of failure, non-optimal routing, and scalability. Ever-increasing
    demand for the mobile traffic changes the network architecture from hierarchical
    to flat architecture, and distributed mobility management (DMM) approaches are
    being researched to adapt the new flat architecture and overcome big above issues.
    This document presents about detailed protocol operation to support network mobility
    in the DMM domain.</p>"
