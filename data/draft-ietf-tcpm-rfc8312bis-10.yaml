abstract:
- content: "<p>CUBIC is a standard TCP congestion control algorithm that uses a cubic
    function instead of a linear congestion window increase function to improve scalability
    and stability over fast and long- distance networks. CUBIC has been adopted as
    the default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux, Windows, and Apple
    stacks. This document updates the specification of CUBIC to include algorithmic
    improvements based on these implementations and recent academic work. Based on
    the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, it also moves the specification
    to the Standards Track, obsoleting RFC 8312. This also requires updating RFC 5681,
    to allow for CUBIC's occasionally more aggressive sending behavior.</p>"
