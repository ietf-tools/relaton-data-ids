abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the OSPF version 2 and 3 protocols
    to support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic
    Engineering (TE) for multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes). OSPF-TE v2 and v3 extensions
    are defined for the flooding of TE information about inter-AS links that can be
    used to perform inter-AS TE path computation. No support for flooding information
    from within one AS to another AS is proposed or defined in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
