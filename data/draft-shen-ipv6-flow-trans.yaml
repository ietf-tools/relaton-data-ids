abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a Mobile IPv6 and RSVP interworking scheme. In
    this scheme, the underlying mobility support mechanism is required to provide
    a unique flow identity regardless of node mobility, making node mobility transparent
    to flow QoS handling mechanisms. Thus QoS signaling delay as well as data packet
    delays and losses during handoff can be reduced. We also discuss solutions to
    achieve this scheme which utilizes the new IPv6 flow label. Finally, issues related
    to security and scalability will also be considered.</p>"
