abstract:
- content: "<p>The exploration of outer space depends heavily upon communications
    technology and in many cases, uses IP. IP address allocation has been formally
    assigned to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), but there is no formal allocation
    of address space for networks in outer space. This document describes updates
    existing address allocation procedures to include address space for outer space.</p>"
