abstract:
- content: "<p>RFCs 3689 and 3690 detail requirements for an Emergency Telecommunications
    Service (ETS), of which an Internet Emergency Preparedness Service (IEPS) would
    be a part. Some of these types of services require call preemption; others require
    call queuing or other mechanisms. IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC)
    procedure and a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for the data that meet the needs of this
    architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is appropriate to any service that
    might use H.323 or SIP to set up real-time sessions. The key requirement is to
    guarantee an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized user in
    time of crisis. This document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the context
    of the US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the Multi-Level Precedence
    and Preemption (MLPP) and Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS)
    standards. The architectures described here are applicable beyond these organizations.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
