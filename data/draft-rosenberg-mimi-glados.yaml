abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for the discovery problem in MIMI
    (More Instant Messaging Interoperability). The discovery problem is the technique
    by which a user in one messaging provider can determine the preferred messaging
    provider for a target user identified by an email address or phone number. The
    discovery problem has been the subject of numerous - largely failed - standardization
    attempts at the IETF. This document outlines these attempts and hypothesizes the
    reasons for their failure, using that to define a set of requirements to avoid
    these failures in a next attempt. The new proposed solution, called Global Lookup
    and Discovery of Services (GLADOS), is a distributed service wherein the data
    is stored and managed by local providers that exchange routing information to
    facilitate a global lookup capability over a flat namespace.</p>"
