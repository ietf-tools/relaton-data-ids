abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a performance analysis on various congestion
    control algorithms(CCAs) in an operational low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite network
    (LSN). Internet CCAs are expected to perform well in any Internet path, including
    those paths with LEO satellite links. Our analysis results reveal that existing
    CCAs struggle to deal with the drastic network variations caused by the mobility
    of LEO satellites, resulting in poor link utilization or high latency. Further,
    this document discusses the key challenges of achieving high throughput and low
    latency for end-to-end connections over an LSN, and provides useful information
    when the LSN-specific congestion control principles for the Internet is standardized
    in the future.</p>"
