abstract:
- content: "<p>A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is formed by the spontaneous association
    of wireless and mobile devices capable of communicating among them even when there
    is no networking infrastructure available. Several unicast Internet gateway mechanisms
    have been proposed within the IETEF MANET WG. However, the particular nature of
    the IP Multicast model poses some additional requirements which need to be satisfied
    by candidate solutions. This document aims at identifying the requirements that
    a multicast solution for MANET interworking with a fixed IP Multicast network
    should satisfy.</p>"
