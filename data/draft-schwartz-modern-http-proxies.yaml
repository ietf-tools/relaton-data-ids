abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP proxying features have long been part of the core HTTP specification.
    However, the core proxying functionality has several important deficiencies in
    modern HTTP environments. This specification defines alternative proxy service
    configurations for HTTP requests and TCP connections. These services are identified
    by URI Templates and designed for parallelism with DoH, MASQUE, and Oblivious
    HTTP.</p>"
