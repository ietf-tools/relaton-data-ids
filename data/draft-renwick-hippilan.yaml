abstract:
- content: "<p>The ANSI X3T9.3 committee has drafted a proposal for the encapsulation
    of IEEE 802.2 LLC PDUs and, by implication, IP on HIPPI. Another X3T9.3 draft
    describes the operation of HIPPI physical switches. X3T9.3 chose to leave HIPPI
    networking issues largely outside the scope of their standards; this document
    discusses methods of using of ANSI standard HIPPI hardware and protocols in the
    context of the Internet, including the use of HIPPI switches as LANs and interoperation
    with other networks. This memo is intended to become an Internet Standard. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
