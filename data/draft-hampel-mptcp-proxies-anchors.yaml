abstract:
- content: "<p>MPTCP proxies and anchors are network-based functions, which support
    MPTCP connections. The MPTCP proxy provides multipath support for MPTCP-capable
    hosts on behalf of their MPTCP-unaware peers. This facilitates incremental deployment
    of MPTCP. The MPTCP anchor permits subflow establishment for MPTCP connections
    when direct interaction between end hosts fails. This permits tolerance to local
    IP protocol restrictions and it provides robustness in case of break- before-make
    mobility events. MPTCP proxies and anchors are especially suited for wireless
    access environments.</p>"
