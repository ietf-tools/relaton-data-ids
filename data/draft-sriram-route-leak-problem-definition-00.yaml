abstract:
- content: <p>A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing system,
    known as 'route leaks', has received significant attention in recent years. Frequent
    incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet routing are labeled
    "route leaks", but to date we have lacked a common definition of the term. In
    this document, we provide a working definition of route leaks, keeping in mind
    the real occurrences that have received significant attention. Further, we attempt
    to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on
    observed events on the Internet. We aim to provide a taxonomy that covers several
    forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern to Internet user
    community as well as the network operator community.</p>
