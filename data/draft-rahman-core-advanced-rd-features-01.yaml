abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource Directory (RD) is a key element for successful deployments
    of constrained networks. Similar to the HTTP web search engines (e.g. Google,
    Bing), the RD for CoAP should also support useful search query responses beyond
    a basic listing of relevant links. This document proposes several new features
    to be considered for the RD. The only goal of this document is to trigger discussion
    in the CoRE WG so that all relevant features for RD evolution are taken into account
    during CoRE re-charter activities.</p>"
