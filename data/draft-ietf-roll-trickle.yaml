abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trickle algorithm allows nodes in a lossy shared medium (e.g.,
    low-power and lossy networks) to exchange information in a highly robust, energy
    efficient, simple, and scalable manner. Dynamically adjusting transmission windows
    allows Trickle to spread new information on the scale of link-layer transmission
    times while sending only a few messages per hour when information does not change.
    A simple suppression mechanism and transmission point selection allow Trickle's
    communication rate to scale logarithmically with density. This document describes
    the Trickle algorithm and considerations in its use. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
