abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end-
    systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by different
    ISPs. While this scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile
    devices), currently most end- systems are single-homed (e.g. desktop PCs in an
    enterprise). This memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to
    multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at the end-systems
    but somewhere within the network.</p>"
