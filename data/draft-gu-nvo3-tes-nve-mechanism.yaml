abstract:
- content: "<p>his draft introduces the interaction required between TES to NVE when
    NVE is located in an external box to TES . The signaling between TES and NVE has
    to be designed carefully to reflect all the interaction requirements. This document
    describes the relevant considerations for such design and also provides a basic
    analysis of the potential reusable protocols. Currently this draft focuses on
    the general interaction procedures with relevant parameters and the signaling
    design consideration. It may be extended to show more detailed signalling design
    recommendation and/or solution recommendation in the future with the progress
    of NVO3's work.</p>"
