abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) protocol and its
    extension for inbound calls to single user devices provide an alternative to the
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for several use cases. This leads to many questions
    - how is RIPT different from SIP and why? What should be standardized and what
    should not? How much of SIP do those two specifications replace? This document
    discusses the differences and their motivations, and presents an analysis across
    the set of SIP specifications, and analyzes whether the two RIPT documents replace
    each with similar capability, whether they eliminate the need for that specification,
    or whether some or all of that specification are not addressed by RIPT.</p>"
