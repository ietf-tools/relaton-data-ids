abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing-aware traffic steering (CATS) is a traffic engineering approach
    [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis] that takes into account the dynamic nature of computing
    resources and network state to optimize service-specific traffic forwarding towards
    a given service instance. Various relevant metrics may be used to enforce such
    computing-aware traffic steering policies.It is critical to meet different types
    of computing-aware traffic steering requirements without disrupting the existing
    network architecture. In this context, this document proposes a computing-aware
    traffic steering solution based on the SR- TE infrastructure of the current traffic
    engineering technology to reduce device resource consumption and investment and
    meet the requirements for computing-aware traffic steering of network devices.</p>"
