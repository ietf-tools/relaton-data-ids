abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports the outcome of a workshop held by the Internet
    Architecture Board (IAB) on the future of Internet messaging. The workshop was
    held on 6 and 7 October 2004 in Burlingame, CA, USA. The goal of the workshop
    was to examine the current state of different messaging technologies on the Internet
    (including, but not limited to, electronic mail, instant messaging, and voice
    messaging), to look at their commonalities and differences, and to find engineering,
    research, and architectural topics on which future work could be done. This report
    summarizes the discussions and conclusions of the workshop and of the IAB. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
