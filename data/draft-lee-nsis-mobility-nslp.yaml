abstract:
- content: "<p>The NSIS working group is standardizing a signaling protocol suite
    with QoS signaling as the first use case. The overall signaling protocol suite
    is decomposed into a generic lower layer with separate upper layers for signaling
    applications. The upper layer protocol, called NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP),
    has an end-to-end scope and contains application specific functionality. One of
    the important features of an NSLP is mobility support. This document identifies
    desired mobility functions in an NSLP for QoS signaling (QoS-NSLP) in the network.</p>"
