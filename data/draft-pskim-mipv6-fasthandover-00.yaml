abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new fast handover scheme for Mobile IPv6 based
    wireless networks. To implement the proposed scheme, the beacon message used in
    L2 is defined newly by adding a specific subfield to the capability information
    field. In addition, Router Information Request/Reply messages used in L3 are defined
    newly. The proposed scheme provides the faster acquisition of new access router's
    network information than the existing one, which might be advantageous for the
    low handover latency. In addition, the proposed scheme might reduce amount of
    traffic in comparison with the existing one, which might be remarkable when there
    are many mobile nodes that are now connecting to current access router. Moreover,
    in the proposed scheme, a mobile node can know whether it changes access router
    or access point, which can remove redundant traffic of the existing one.</p>"
