abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new resource record for the Domain Name System
    (DNS). This record may be used to store public keys for use in IP security (IPsec)
    systems. The record also includes provisions for indicating what system should
    be contacted when an IPsec tunnel is established with the entity in question.
    This record replaces the functionality of the sub-type #4 of the KEY Resource
    Record, which has been obsoleted by RFC 3445. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
