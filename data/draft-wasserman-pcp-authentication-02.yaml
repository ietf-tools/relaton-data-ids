abstract:
- content: "<p>An IPv4 or IPv6 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to flexibly
    manage the IP address and port mapping information on Network Address Translators
    (NATs) or firewalls, to facilitate communications with remote hosts. However,
    the un-controlled generation or deletion of IP address mappings on such network
    devices may cause security risks and should be avoided. In some cases the client
    may need to prove that it is authorized to modify, create or delete PCP mappings.
    This document proposes an in-band authentication mechanism for PCP that can be
    used in those cases. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used to perform
    authentication between PCP devices.</p>"
