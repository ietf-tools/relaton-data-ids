abstract:
- content: "<p>The 4rd automatic tunneling mechanism makes IPv4 Residual Deployment
    possible via IPv6 networks without maintaining for this per-customer states in
    4rd-capable nodes (reverse of the IPv6 Rapid Deployment of 6rd). To cope with
    the IPv4 address shortage, customers can be assigned IPv4 addresses with restricted
    port sets. In some scenarios, 4rd-capable customer nodes can exchange packets
    of their IPv4-only applications via stateful NAT64s that are upgraded to support
    4rd tunnels (in addition to their IP/ICMP translation of RFC6145).</p>"
