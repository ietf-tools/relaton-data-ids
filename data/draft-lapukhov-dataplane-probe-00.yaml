abstract:
- content: "<p>Detecting and isolating network faults in IP networks has traditionally
    been done using tools like ping and traceroute (see [RFC7276]) or more complex
    systems built on similar concepts of active probing and path tracing. While using
    active synthetic probes is proven to be helpful in detecting data-plane faults,
    isolating fault location has proven to be a much harder problem, especially in
    diverse networks with multiple active forwarding planes (e.g. IP and MPLS). Moreover,
    existing end-to-end tools do not generally support functionality beyond dealing
    with packet loss - for example, they are hardly useful for detecting and reporting
    transient (i.e. milli- or even micro-second) network congestion. Modern network
    forwarding hardware can enable more sophisticated data-plane functionality that
    provides substantial improvement to the isolation and identification capabilities
    of network elements. For example, it has become possible to encode a snapshot
    of a network elements forwarding state within the packet payload as it transits
    the device. One example of such device/network state would be queue depth on the
    egress port taken by that specific packet. When combined with a unique device
    identifier embedded in the same packet, this could allow for precise time and
    topological identification of the the congested location within the network. This
    document proposes a standard format for embedding telemetry information in UDP-based
    probing packets, i.e. packets designated for testing the network while not carrying
    application traffic. These active probes could be conveyed over multiple protocols
    (ICMP, UDP, TCP, etc.) but this document specifically focuses on UDP, given its
    simple semantics. In addition this document provides recommendations on handling
    the active probes by devices that do not support the required data-plane functionality.</p>"
