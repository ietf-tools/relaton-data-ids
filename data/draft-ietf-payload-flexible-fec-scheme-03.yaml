abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved
    parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP. These parity codes are systematic
    codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols.
    These repair symbols are sent in a repair flow separate from the source flow that
    carries the source symbols. The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes which
    are defined in this specification offer a good protection against random and bursty
    packet losses, respectively, at a cost of decent complexity. Moreover, alternate
    FEC codes may be used with the payload formats presented. The RTP payload formats
    that are defined in this document address the scalability issues experienced with
    the earlier specifications including RFC 2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and
    offer several improvements. Due to these changes, the new payload formats are
    not backward compatible with the earlier specifications, but endpoints that do
    not implement the scheme can still work by simply ignoring the FEC packets.</p>"
