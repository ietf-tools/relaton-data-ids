abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) plays a crucial role
    in securing inter-domain routing. However, the current RPKI Repository system
    suffers from fundamental limitations in reliability, scalability, and security.
    In particular, single-point failures at repository publication points (PPs), the
    growing number of bidirectional connections with relying parties (RPs), and the
    lack of mechanisms to mitigate misbehavior by certification authorities (CAs)
    pose significant risks to the integrity, authority, and resilience of the global
    RPKI ecosystem. This document proposes the Decentralized RPKI Repository (dRR),
    a novel repository architecture that decouples RPKI object signing from data distribution.
    dRR introduces a distributed federation of certificate servers (CSs) and a layer
    of Monitors to achieve robust, scalable, and auditable RPKI data management. The
    architecture maintains full compatibility with the existing RPKI trust model rooted
    in the five RIR trust anchors, enabling incremental deployment without disrupting
    current relying parties (RPs) validation semantics. By doing so, dRR addresses
    longstanding repository challenges and enhances the overall trustworthiness and
    efficiency of RPKI-based routing security.</p>"
