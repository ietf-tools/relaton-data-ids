abstract:
- content: "<p>Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been considered
    in G.709. Multi stages multiplexing would be desirable to facilitate the introduction
    of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to upgrade
    every node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and
    transit across the 2.5G TS region. Multi stages multiplexing are also used to
    support the multi-domain OTN applications based on carrier-Carrier, regional-national
    core interconnection or network tunnels design. This document describes the framework
    for multi stages multiplexing configuration in G.709 Optical Transport Network.</p>"
