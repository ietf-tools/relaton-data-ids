abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient and service aware flexible end-to-end routing in future communication
    networks is achieved by routing protocol approaches making use of Identifier Locator
    separation systems. Since these systems require a correlation between identifiers
    and location which might allow tracking and misusage of individuals' identities
    and locations such operation demands for highly secure measures to preserve privacy
    of users and devices. This document tries to identify and describe typical use
    cases and derive thereof a problem statement describing issues and challenges
    for application of privacy preserving Identifier-Locator split (PidLoc) approaches.</p>"
