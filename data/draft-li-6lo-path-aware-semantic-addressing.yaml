abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Path-Aware
    Semantic Addressing (PASA) that enables IP packet stateless forwarding. No routing
    table needs to be built, rather, the forwarding decision is based solely on the
    destination address structure. This document focuses on carrying IP packets across
    an LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the topology is static, the location
    of the nodes is fixed, and the connection between the nodes is also rather stable.
    This specifications describes the PASA architecture, along with PASA address allocation,
    forwarding mechanism, header format design, including length-variable fields,
    and IPv6 interconnection support.</p>"
