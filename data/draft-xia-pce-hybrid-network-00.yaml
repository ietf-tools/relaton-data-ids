abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. One key application of the PCE-based architecture
    is the computation of inter-domain Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE-LSP)
    paths(i.e. inter-area, inter-AS, inter-provider, etc.). In this case, cooperation
    between PCEs is desirable due to the partial topology visibility available to
    each separate PCE. Per-domain path computation is another method that can be used
    to determine paths for inter-domain TE-LSPs when PCE cooperation is not applied
    in the network. In practice, some Service Providers may choose not to implement
    PCEs within their network that can cooperate with PCEs that are outside their
    network. In this case, a scenario may exist where an LSP spans multiple autonomous
    systems (ASes), some of which have PCEs capable of cooperation with external PCEs
    and some of which do not. For example, some ASes may be PCE-enabled, while others
    consist of just normal LSRs. Another scenario arises if a PCE fails or becomes
    unreachable. This gives rise to the same lack of inter-PCE cooperation. Both cases
    are named Hybrid PCE Networks in this document. This document describes the specific
    issues introduced for end-to-end path computation in Hybrid PCE Networks and defines
    extensions to the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to perform inter-domain LSP
    computation in Hybrid PCE Networks.</p>"
