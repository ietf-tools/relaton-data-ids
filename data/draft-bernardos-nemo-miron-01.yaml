abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam
    and attach to different access networks without disrupting the ongoing sessions
    that nodes of the network may have. By extending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile
    Routers, nodes of the network are not required to support any kind of mobility,
    since packets must go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional
    tunnel. Communications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent,
    and therefore better paths may be available. Additionally, this solution adds
    packet overhead, due to the encapsulation. This document describes an approach
    to the Route Optimisation for NEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for
    NEMO (MIRON). MIRON enables mobility-agnostic nodes within the mobile network
    to directly communicate (i.e. without traversing the MRHA bi-directional tunnel)
    with Correspondent Nodes. The solution is based on the Mobile Router performing
    the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling on behalf of the nodes of the mobile
    network. This document (in an appendix) also analyses how MIRON fits each of the
    NEMO RO Aeronautics requirements.</p>"
