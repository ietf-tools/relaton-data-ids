abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the design of Unicorn, a multi-domain, geographically-distributed,
    data-intensive analytics system. The setting of such a system includes edge science
    networks, which provide storage and computation resources for collecting, sharing
    and analyzing extremely large amounts of data, and transit networks, which provide
    networking resources to connects edge science networks for transmitting large
    science datasets. The key design challenge is to accurately discover and represent
    resource information from different domains. Unicorn leverages multiple ALTO services,
    including ALTO-Path Vector, ALTO-Routing State Abstraction, ALTO-Server-Side Event
    and ALTO-Flow Cost Service to address this challenge. In particular, Unicorn decomposes
    the resource discovery into three phases. The first phase is to identify endpoint
    resource, e.g., dataset storage location, computation resource location and output
    storage resource location. The second phase is to identify the reachability information
    between the locations of storage and computation resources. The third phase is
    to identify the available networking resource connecting different storage and
    computation resources. All information collected through these three phases can
    be used by a logically centralized scheduling system to orchestrate the resources
    usage.</p>"
