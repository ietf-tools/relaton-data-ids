abstract:
- content: "<p>DKIM associates a domain name with a message stream, using cryptographic
    methods, to permit reliable and accurate reputation- oriented analysis of the
    stream. It is possible for an authorized user to conspire for additional distribution
    of a message, leveraging the domain name reputation for promoting spam. This is
    called DKIM Replay. DKOR defines a means of limiting that ability, by associating
    original addressing information with the message's DKIM signature, to detect distribution
    beyond the intended recipient. DKOR uses existing DKIM services and only requires
    implementation of the additional DKOR requirements by the signer and any receiving
    site wishing to participate in DKOR services. Other DKIM receivers can process
    the same DKIM signature without knowledge of DKOR.</p>"
