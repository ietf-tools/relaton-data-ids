abstract:
- content: "<p>SCHC compression mechanism for LPWAN network enables IPv6 on devices
    connected to a constrained network (LPWAN). They can communicate with a CoAP server
    located anywhere in the Internet. LPWAN network characteristics limits the number
    of exchanges and may impose a long RTT. The CoAP server must be aware of these
    properties to manage correctly requests. The Time Scale option allows a device
    to inform a CoAP server of the duration the message ID value should be kept in
    memory to manage correctly message duplication.</p>"
