abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a SIP event package for subscribing to a buddy
    list. A buddy list is a collection of presentities that a subscriber is interested
    in learning presence state for. Instead of the subscriber sending a SUBSCRIBE
    to each buddy individually, the subscriber can subscribe to their buddy list as
    a whole, and then receive notifications when the state of any of their buddies
    changes.</p>"
