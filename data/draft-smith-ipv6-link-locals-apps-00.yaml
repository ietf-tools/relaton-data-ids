abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Link-Local addresses can be used by applications. Doing so when
    possible will provide robustness and security benefits to the application. This
    memo describes the properties of Link-Local addresses and the benefits and limitations
    of using them in applications. It then describes how to use them in applications
    that use the Sockets API.</p>"
