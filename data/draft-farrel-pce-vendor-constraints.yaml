abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path
    computation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and
    Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also between cooperating PCEs. In PCEP the
    path computation requests carry details of the constraints and objective functions
    that the PCC wishes the PCE to apply in its computation. The mechanisms defined
    for indicating objective functions include the capability to convey vendor-specific
    objective functions. This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific
    constraints in PCEP.</p>"
