- content: "<p>The scope of this document is to propose a new option to be used in
    conjunction with the CoAP proxy mechanisms. Several content types can be converted
    stateless into each other. The conversion may result in much more efficient representation
    of the resource. But currently no mechanism exists to indicate the proxy to perform
    the compression.</p>"
