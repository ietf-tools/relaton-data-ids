abstract:
- content: "<p>In some multihoming SRv6 L3VPN scenarios, once fast reroute has taken
    place, a second fast reroute is undesirable and may cause looping. This document
    proposes a mechanism to prevent further fast reroutes by advertising No-Further-FRR
    behaviors for L3 SRv6 Service SIDs in BGP messages.</p>"
