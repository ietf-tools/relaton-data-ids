abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new document series called Set of RFC Documents
    (SRDs). SRDs will be distinguished by names and serial numbers. SRDs contain Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) which can automatically produce HTML and plaintext versions
    for human consumption With many RFC being updated, this creates difficulty when
    determining which RFCs are necessary as references when implementing or using
    protocols. Grouping RFC into sets that embody a specific endeavour would permit
    stable references for those interested in discovering related details. The SRD
    name may also serve as a reference for topical information stored in a database
    that is made available.</p>"
