abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two services that vendors may provide in support
    of Internet privacy-enhanced mail: certifying authority services on behalf of
    organizations, and organizational notary services for users. It also specifies
    the forms for interacting with vendors providing those services. This document
    is intended as a reference for vendors and for implementors of privacy-enhanced
    mail software; it is not at the appropriate level for users. The document also
    lists vendors.</p>"
