abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the treaties maintained by the International Telecommunication
    Union is the International Telecommunication Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose
    historically has been to create international service uniformity and a global
    monopoly cartel for provisioning legacy international telecommunication services.
    Nations such as the U.S. and Canada have typically neither signed them nor accepted
    their provisions. The 1988 version of the ITRs was similar in purpose and effect,
    but failed in its objectives because the mandated OSI services and ITU-T standards
    were unsuccessful in the marketplace. In addition, most of the world's Nation-States
    moved away from monopoly government-run telecom provisioning to competitive market
    models. This also resulted in a substantial decline of the ITU itself as an intergovernmental
    home for monopoly Nation-State providers. Given this institutional decline and
    the vestigial opposition of some ITU Members to this provisioning paradigm shift,
    efforts were begun a decade ago by some ITU participants and officials to imbue
    the ITU with a vast expansion of its scope and jurisdiction and impose new regulatory
    controls through revisions to the moribund ITRs. Most progressive national Administrations
    opposed these efforts. The conflict played out in Dec 2012 in Dubai at a global
    treaty conference known as the WCIT. Only 89 of the ITU 193 member nations signed
    the resulting treaty instrument at Dubai - largely those without significant national
    communication infrastructure, or those favoring strong regulatory regimes for
    Internet use. The result was an embarrassing miscalculation for those seeking
    these changes. It bifurcated the treaty basis for the ITU. This document analyses
    the many adverse effects of the resulting treaty, and identifies problems that
    may arise for those states acceding to the treaty. It concludes by noting how
    the Internet community, including citizens of non-signatory countries, benefit
    from the rejection of this broken treaty instrument.</p>"
