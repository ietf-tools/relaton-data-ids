abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes use cases for LISP in the area of end Host mobility.
    The applicability of end host mobility can be found in data centers, where Virtual
    Machines (VM's) can be moved freely from one physical server onto another physical
    server, independent of location, without having to change the IP/MAC-addresses
    inside those VMs, nor impacting traffic flows to and from those VMs. Wireless
    end hosts are another area of applicability. Although this draft will not address
    wireless end host mobility, most of the same principles apply. Traditionally L2
    extension technologies have been used to handle mobility events, but they could
    lead to suboptimal routing of traffic to and from the end host after the mobility
    event, as well as created big broadcast domains. This memo describes how LISP
    solves the traffic optimization issues caused by a mobility event of an end host
    like a Virtual Machine, as it decouples the identity of the end host from its
    location, such that traffic will always be forwarded to the correct location.
    More-over the LISP control plane can be leveraged to discover and distribute the
    reachability information of end hosts such that end to end broadcast domains,
    and their associated problems, are no longer needed. Various sub-use cases will
    be looked at in this draft, depending on whether mobility is achieved at L2 (using
    MAC-addresses as EID) or at L3 (using IP addresses as EIDs), and whether subnets
    are L2 extended across LISP sites or not. This memo also describes how to handle
    mobility in the case where the default gateway of the end host is not capable
    of performing the LISP map-and-encap function, while the LISP xTR function is
    located one or more L3 hops away from the default gateway.</p>"
