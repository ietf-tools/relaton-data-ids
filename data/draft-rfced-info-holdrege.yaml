abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Control Protocol used between a Network Access
    Server (NAS) and a Signaling Gateway (SG). The requirements of this protocol are
    Call Control, Circuit Maintenance and Resource Management. This protocol must
    be reliable in nature and support redundant links between the NAS and SG. It's
    important to note that the NAS could be handling either packetized voice or data
    for access to the Internet.</p>"
