abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and defines the managed objects for dynamic
    configuration of middleboxes. The scope of the middleboxes to which these managed
    objects apply is limited to NATs and Firewalls. However, the MIB module as defined
    by this document is intended to provide a baseline for the dynamic configuration
    of other types of middleboxes. The applicability of existing Management Information
    Base (MIB) modules to the MIDCOM requirements, framework and semantics is described.
    Additional managed objects are defined to satisfy the entirety of the MIDCOM requirements,
    framework and semantics, providing a complete MIDCOM MIB for NATs and Firewalls
    to fully realize the requirements of the MIDCOM protocol.</p>"
