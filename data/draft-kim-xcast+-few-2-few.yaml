abstract:
- content: "<p>Xcast+[2] is newly proposed multicast scheme to support IGMPv2/MLDv3
    in Explicit Multicast(Xcast)[1]. Xcast+ is suitable for one-to-few multicast applications.
    In order to support few-to- few communication naturally, the control plane of
    existing Xcast+ should be extended. In this document, a new control plane for
    few- to-few communication for Xcast+ is specified. In order to acheive this, the
    concept of logical core (LC) is newly introduced.</p>"
