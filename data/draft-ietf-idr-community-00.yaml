abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute
    [2] in simplifying the implementation and configuration of routing policies in
    the multi-provider Internet. It shows how the community based configuration can
    be used to replace the AS-based customization of the BGP 'LOCAL_PREF' attribute,
    a common method used today. Not only does the technique presented simplifies configuration
    and management at the provider level, it also represents a paradigm shift in that
    it gives the potential for the customer to control its own routing policy with
    respect to its service provider, as well as providing the ability for policy configuration
    to be done at a prefix based granularity rather than the more common AS based
    granularity.</p>"
