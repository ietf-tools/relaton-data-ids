abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital signatures are used within X.509 certificates, Certificate
    Revocation Lists (CRLs), and to sign messages. This document describes the conventions
    for using the Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard (SLH-DSA) in Internet
    X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists. The conventions for the associated
    signatures, subject public keys, and private key are also described. [EDNOTE:
    This draft is not expected to be finalized before the NIST PQC Project has standardized
    FIPS 205 Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Standard. The current FIPS draft
    was published August 24, 2023 for public review. Final versions are expected by
    April 2024. This specification will use object identifiers for the new algorithms
    that are assigned by NIST, and will use placeholders until these are released.]</p>"
