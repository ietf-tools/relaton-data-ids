abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliable group communication is required in distributed applications,
    such as distributed file systems (HDFS, GFS and Ceph), where such group communication
    is defined by the sender and the group members are small (e.g. three). However,
    existing standards for reliable multicast transport are receiver-initiated and
    suffer from inefficiency in either host-side protocols or multicast routing. This
    draft proposes a sender-initiated, efficient, congestion-aware and robust reliable
    multicast solution in Software-Defined Networks (SDN), called MCTCP (MultiCast
    TCP). The main idea behind MCTCP is to manage the multicast groups in a centralized
    manner, and reactively schedule multicast flows to active and low-utilized links,
    and it is implemented by extending TCP as the host-side protocol and managing
    multicast groups in SDN-controller.</p>"
