abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses most common scenarios of connecting an enterprise
    network to multiple ISPs using an address space assigned by an ISP. The problem
    of enterprise multihoming without address translation of any form has not been
    solved yet as it requires both the network to select the correct egress ISP based
    on the packet source address and hosts to select the correct source address based
    on the desired egress ISP for that traffic. [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming]
    proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a new routing functionality
    (Source Address Dependent Routing) to solve the uplink selection issue and using
    Router Advertisements to influence the host source address selection. While the
    above-mentioned document focuses on solving the general problem and on covering
    various complex use cases, this document describes how the solution proposed in
    [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-enterprise-pa-multihoming] can be adopted for limited number of
    common use cases. In particular, the focus is on scenarios where an enterprise
    network has two Internet uplinks used either in primary/backup mode or simultaneously
    and hosts in that network might not yet properly support multihoming as described
    in [RFC8028].</p>"
