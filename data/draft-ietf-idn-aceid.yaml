abstract:
- content: "<p>In IETF IDN WG, various kinds of ASCII Compatible Encodings, hereafter
    abbreviated as 'ACE', are discussed as methods for realizing multilingual domain
    names (hereafter referred to as 'MDN'). Each ACE uses a prefix or a suffix as
    an identifier in order for MDNs to fit within the existing ASCII domain name space.
    In other words, acceptance of an ACE proposal as an Internet standard means that
    the existing ASCII domain name space will be partitioned, in order to accommodate
    MDN space. This document describes possible trouble in the standardization process
    of ACE, and proposes a solution for it.</p>"
