abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests some possible areas for extending the IETF 'conneg'
    working group's capability description framework, described in [2,3,4]. The suggested
    areas for extension have been motivated by WWW Consortium (W3C) work on Composite
    Capability/Preference Profiles (CCPP) [5] that parallels some aspects of the IETF
    'conneg' work. This is presented as a discussion document, with a view to maybe
    integrating some of these ideas into ongoing 'conneg' work, and to indicate some
    areas for ongoing collaboration between the IETF and W3C in the area of content
    description.</p>"
