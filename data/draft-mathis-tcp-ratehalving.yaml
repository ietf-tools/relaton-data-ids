abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides a detailed description of the Rate-Halving algorithm.
    As specified by RFC2581, Fast Recovery adjusts the congestion window (cwnd) by
    transmitting new data only during the second half of the recovery interval. The
    Rate-Halving algorithm adjusts the congestion window by spacing transmissions
    at the rate of one data segment per two segments acknowledged over the entire
    recovery period, thereby sustaining the self-clocking of TCP and avoiding a burst.
    Since it is largely independent of the details of the data retransmission strategy,
    the Rate-Halving algorithm can be used with several standard and experimental
    TCP implementations: NewReno, SACK, and ECN.</p>"
