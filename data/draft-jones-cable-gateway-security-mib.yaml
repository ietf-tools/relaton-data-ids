abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based security management
    of CableHome 1.0 compliant residential gateway devices. This memo specifies a
    MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set
    of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
    This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet Engineering
    Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
    mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com and/or the author.</p>"
