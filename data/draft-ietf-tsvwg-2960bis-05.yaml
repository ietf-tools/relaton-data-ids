abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 2960 and RFC 3309. It describes the Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of
    broader applications. SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on top of
    a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services to
    its users: -- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data, --
    data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size, -- sequenced delivery
    of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for order-of-arrival
    delivery of individual user messages, -- optional bundling of multiple user messages
    into a single SCTP packet, and -- network-level fault tolerance through supporting
    of multi-homing at either or both ends of an association. The design of SCTP includes
    appropriate congestion avoidance behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade
    attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
