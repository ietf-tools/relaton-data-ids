abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a brief note about pricing the Internet. The focus is the use
    of pricing for usage of the infrastructure for transmitting and receiving IP packets,
    rather than of services such as WWW, FTP, Archie, Gopher etc. In this we propose
    subscription based pricing, and a mechanism based on dynamic host address allocation
    drawn from a set of seperately routed addresses to give priority levels. The idea
    of subscriptions here is not that all service pricing should be achieved through
    subscriptions per se. They are seen as a way of policing priority access to service
    bottlenecks, and thus can be deployed incrementally at weak interconnection points
    in a network, or between ISPs. Users of these subscriptions could easily be entire
    organisations (represented by network numbers, or CIDRized collections of network
    numbers, or ASs and so on). These organisations could employ refinement techniques
    to provide more usage oriented charging if needed.</p>"
