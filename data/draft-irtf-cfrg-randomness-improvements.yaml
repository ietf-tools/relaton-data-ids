abstract:
- content: <p>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    and related security protocols. Weak or predictable "cryptographically secure"
    pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious
    purposes. An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken
    as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This
    document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their
    CSPRNGs using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or
    otherwise subverted CSPRNGs. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research
    Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</p>
