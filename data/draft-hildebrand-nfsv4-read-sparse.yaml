abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new READPLUS operation for NFSv4.2 to support
    efficient reading of sparse files, which are growing in the data center due to
    the increasing number of virtual disk images. READPLUS has all the features and
    functionality of READ, but has an extensible return value that includes an easy
    and efficient way for administrators to copy and manage sparse files without wasting
    disk space or transferring data unnecessarily.</p>"
