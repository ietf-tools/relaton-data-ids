abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this document is to define and formalize the use of
    IP-based VLAN switching in the context of virtualization of network services.
    Networking infrastructure appliances may host multiple virtual instances of network
    services. IP address inspection on a packet coming from an external network such
    as the Internet can be used to switch the packet into a VLAN, through use of VLAN
    tags on Ethernet frames. The tagged frame is subsequently fed to a VLAN-aware
    networking infrastructure appliance where the packet is directed to a virtualized
    service instance. This method of IP-based VLAN switching on a packet assists in
    hosting multiple virtual instances of network services on servers and other appliances.</p>"
