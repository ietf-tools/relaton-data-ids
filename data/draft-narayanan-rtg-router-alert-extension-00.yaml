abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers
    to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet. RSVP, PGM and IGMP are some
    of the protocols which make use of the IP Router Alert option. The current specification
    for the IP Router Alert Option does not define mechanisms to facilitate discriminating
    across different users of Router Alert. As a result, networks using router Alert
    may have more secuity exposure than necessary and/or may unnecessarily block some
    transit Router Alert packets. This document describes new rules for the IP Router-Alert
    Option that aid routers to process these packets more selectively.</p>"
