abstract:
- content: "<p>One key component of traffic engineering is a concept known as constraint
    based routing. In constraint based routing a topology database is maintained on
    all participating nodes. This database contains a complete list of all the links
    in the network that participate in traffic engineering and for each of these links
    a set of constraints, which those links can meet. Bandwidth, for example, is one
    essential constraint. Since the bandwidth available changes as new LSPs are established
    and terminated the topology database will develop inconsistencies with respect
    to the real network. It is not possible to increase the flooding rates arbitrarily
    to keep the database discrepancies from growing. A new mechanism is proposed whereby
    a source node can learn about the successes or failures of its path selections
    by receiving feedback from the paths it is attempting. This information is most
    valuable in failure scenarious but is benificial during other path setup functions
    as well. This fed-back information can be incorporated into subsequent route computations,
    which greatly improves the accuracy of the overall routing solution by significantly
    reducing the database discrepancies.</p>"
