abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Receiver Initiated Shortcut Path (RISP) protocol
    for NBMA networks. The protocol extends the NHRP message set by adding Callback
    Request and Reply messages to allow the destination host (or its corresponding
    egress router) to establish a shortcut path for a data flow, using the existing
    NBMA signaling protocols. Because of this receiver-initiated mechanism, a shortcut-capable
    network can use just the NBMA ARP servers, such as the ATMARP servers, instead
    of the more complex Next Hop Servers. This draft also describes how to extend
    NHRP with the new, receiver-initiated mechanism.</p>"
