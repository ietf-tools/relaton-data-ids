abstract:
- content: "<p>As multiple organizations interconnect their networks through peering
    agreements, it is desirable to preserve the services enabled by a LISP overlay
    over such interconnection of independent networks. This specification documents
    the requirements imposed by the deployment scenario in which multiple organizations
    federate their backbones with the objective of running a LISP overlay to enable
    services such as mobility or VPNs. The requirements for policies, enforcement
    and authoritative control of network assets are captured from the perspective
    of the operator.</p>"
