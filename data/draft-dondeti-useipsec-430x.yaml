abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec encapsulation can be used to provide a secure channel between
    two entities, to enforce controlled access to a network, or to provide any combination
    of integrity protection, confidentiality, replay protection, and traffic flow
    confidentiality of data being transmitted between two or more endpoints over untrusted
    transmission media or networks. Whereas various assortments of the protections
    are possible to provide, it is not always safe to use some of the combinations.
    Next, IPsec SAs are established either manually or using a key management protocol
    such as IKEv2 with entity authentication verified locally or with the assistance
    of a third party. This document specifies when and how to use IPsec and IKEv2
    and what combinations of protections afforded by those protocols are safe and
    when.</p>"
