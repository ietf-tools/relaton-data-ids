abstract:
- content: "<p>In OSPF protocol, LSAs with the LS age at MaxAge are not used in routing
    table calculation and MUST be flushed in the network. In some cases, the flushing
    of OSPF MaxAge LSAs may cause flooding storm of OSPF packets and severely impact
    network stability and the services provided by the network. This document specifies
    a backward compatible mechanism to mitigate the impact of MaxAge LSA flushing
    in OSPF networks.</p>"
