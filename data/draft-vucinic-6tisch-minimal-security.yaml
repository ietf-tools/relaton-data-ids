abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the minimal mechanisms required to support secure
    initial configuration in a device being added to a 6TiSCH network. The goal of
    this configuration is to set link-layer keys, and to establish a secure session
    between each joining node and the JCE who may use that to further configure the
    joining device. Additional security behaviors and mechanisms may be added on top
    of this minimal framework.</p>"
