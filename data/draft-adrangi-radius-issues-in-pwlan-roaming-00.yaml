abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a number of IETF drafts that describe use of RADIUS in a
    variety of scenarios. However, in the context of Public Wireless LAN (PWLAN) deployments,
    there are still some areas where either use of RADIUS is unclear or not covered.
    To address this problem, we first need to generate a list of RADIUS issues significant
    to public wireless LAN roaming (authenticating and obtaining service on a network
    operated by or affiliated with a home providerâ€™s 'roaming partner'). Once these
    issues are understood and analyzed, we can take appropriate actions to solve them.
    This document describes some of RADIUS issues encountered in PWLAN deployments
    and roaming scenarios.</p>"
