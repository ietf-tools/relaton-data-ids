abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines an extension to
    the offer/answer model used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This extension
    allows endpoints to traverse firewalls and NATs. However, in cases where highly
    restrictive firewalls exist, or where network failures have occurred, ICE may
    not be able to successfully find a media path. This document provides an error
    response code that can be used with SIP in these cases.</p>"
