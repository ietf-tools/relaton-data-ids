abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the Mapping Service for the Locator/ID Separation
    Protocol (LISP), implemented by two new types of LISP- speaking devices -- the
    LISP Map-Resolver and LISP Map-Server -- that provides a simplified "front end"
    for one or more Endpoint ID to Routing Locator mapping databases. By using this
    service interface and communicating with Map-Resolvers and Map-Servers, LISP Ingress
    Tunnel Routers and Egress Tunnel Routers are not dependent on the details of mapping
    database systems, which facilitates experimentation with different database designs.
    Since these devices implement the "edge" of the LISP infrastructure, connect directly
    to LISP-capable Internet end sites, and comprise the bulk of LISP-speaking devices,
    reducing their implementation and operational complexity should also reduce the
    overall cost and effort of deploying LISP. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
