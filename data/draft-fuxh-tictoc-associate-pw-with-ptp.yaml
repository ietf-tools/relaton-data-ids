abstract:
- content: "<p>[1588overMPLS] defines two methods for transporting PTP messages (PDUs)
    over an MPLS network. The second method is to transport PTP messages inside a
    PW via Ethernet encapsulation. When PHP is applied to PTP LSP or the PW is etablished
    between two routers directly and no PTP LSP is needed, PW label must be associated
    with PTP application at the PW termination point. This document introduces a mechanism
    to associate PW label with PTP application.</p>"
