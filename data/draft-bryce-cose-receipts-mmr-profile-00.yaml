    COSE Receipts document [I-D.ietf-cose-merkle-tree-proofs] specifically for use
    with ledgers based on post-order traversal binary Merkle trees and which are designed
    for high throughput, ease of replication and compatibility with commodity cloud
    storage. Post-order traversal binary Merkle trees, also known as history trees,
    are more commonly known as Merkle Mountain Ranges.</p>"
