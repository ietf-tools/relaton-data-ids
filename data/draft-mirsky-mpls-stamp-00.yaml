abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), defined in RFC
    8762 and RFC 8972, is expected to be able to monitor the performance of paths
    between systems that use a wide variety of encapsulations. This document defines
    encapsulation and bootstrapping of a STAMP test session over an MPLS Label Switched
    Path.</p>"
