abstract:
- content: "<p>In various situations, such as TV broadcasting with several regional
    sources, it is required to setup a series of Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic
    Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) between a set of head-end Label Switching
    Routers (LSRs) and a group of leaf LSRs referred to as a Leaf Group. Setting up
    such a series of P2MP TE LSPs requires for the set of head-end LSRs to be aware
    of all leaf LSRs, which may lead to the cumbersome configuration of a potentially
    large number of leaf LSRs on each head-end LSRs. Furthermore leaf LSRs may want
    to dynamically join or leave a Leaf Group without requiring manual configuration
    on the head-end LSRs. This document specifies IGP routing extensions for IS-IS
    and OSPF so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of leaf LSRs members
    of a Leaf Group, in order to automate the creation and modification of a series
    of P2MP TE-LSPs.</p>"
