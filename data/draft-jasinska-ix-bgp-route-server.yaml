abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a specification for multilateral interconnections
    at Internet exchange points (IXPs). Multilateral interconnection is a method of
    exchanging routing information between three or more exterior BGP speakers using
    a single intermediate broker system, referred to as a route server. Route servers
    are typically used on shared access media networks, such as Internet exchange
    points (IXPs), to facilitate simplified interconnection between multiple Internet
    routers.</p>"
