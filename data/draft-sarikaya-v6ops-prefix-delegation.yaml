abstract:
- content: "<p>As interest in IPv6 deployment in cellular networks increases, several
    migration issues have been being raised; IPv6 prefix management is the issue addressed
    in this document. Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we
    use DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to address such prefix management issues as an access
    router offloading delegation of prefixes and release tasks to a DHCPv6 server.
    The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the
    DHCPv6 server. The access router may next do stateless or stateful address allocation
    to the mobile node, e.g., with a Router Advertisement or using DHCP. We also describe
    prefix management using Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
