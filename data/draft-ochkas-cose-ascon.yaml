abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and
    CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) serializations with Ascon which received
    a lot of attention in the area of lightweight cryptography. In 2019, as a part
    of CAESAR competition, Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a were selected as the first choice
    for the lightweight authenticated encryption [asconv1.2-caesar]. After, in 2023,
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected Ascon family of
    cryptographic algorithms to be the standard for lightweight cryptography [asconv1.2-nist].
    This recognition make it particularly interesting to use Ascon with COSE and JOSE
    structures. This document does not define any new cryptography, only serializations
    of existing cryptographic systems described in [NIST.SP.800-232].</p>"
