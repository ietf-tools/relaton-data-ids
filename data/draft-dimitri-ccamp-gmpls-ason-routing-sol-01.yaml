abstract:
- content: "<p>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to
    control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These
    include support for requesting TDM connections including SONET/SDH and Optical
    Transport Networks (OTNs). This document provides the extensions of the IETF Link
    State Routing Protocols to meet the routing requirements for an Automatically
    Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.</p>"
