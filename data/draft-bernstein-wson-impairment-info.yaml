abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an information model for the optical impairment
    characteristics of optical network elements for use in GMPLS/PCE control plane
    protocols and mechanisms. This information model supports Impairment Aware Routing
    and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which path computation
    and optical path validation are essential components. This is not a general network
    management information model. This model is based on ITU-T defined optical network
    element characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related specifications.
    This model is intentionally compatible with a previous impairment free optical
    information model used in optical path computations and wavelength assignment.</p>"
