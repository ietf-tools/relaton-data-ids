abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum describes an internetworking architecture of Cell Switch
    Router (CSR) and related control protocol overview. Cell Switch Router is an ATM-based
    label switching router that can provide ATM cut-through paths for packet flows
    with various levels of granularity while retaining current router-based internetworking
    architecture. The proposed architecture is able to provide the cut-through path
    in response to the creation of IP forwarding entry (topology-driven), the arrival
    of data packets (traffic-driven), and the reception of control packets such as
    RSVP (request-driven). One important feature that is provided by the proposed
    architecture is interoperability with the emerging ATM network platform, specified
    by the ATM Forum and/or ITU-T, which provides PVC (Permanent Virtual Channel),
    VP (Virtual Path), or SVC (Switched Virtual Channel) services.</p>"
