abstract:
- content: "<p>At present, many security products are deployed in the network, and
    the security functions of security products overlap. Atomized security function
    refers to the smallest representation unit of security function, which cannot
    be split again and can be implemented by independent code. Atomized security functions
    can quickly and effectively assemble security capabilities and provide security
    services. It no longer takes security products as the unit, but atomic security
    functions as the basic unit, by reorganize and define the security functions supported
    by existing network devices then provide guidance for secure routing, finally,
    each security function will be uniformly coded.</p>"
