abstract:
- content: "<p>Path MTU discovery as it exists now finds the least MTU of a given
    path. Traceroute through IP option [3] provides a method for finding the MTU on
    each hop using an ICMP message as a reply from the target host, with output link
    MTU in a portion of the message. The method proposed in this document intends
    to find the outbound MTU on each hop on an internet path, without using the ICMP
    message for traceroute. This mechanism intends to acheive the same goal as the
    traceroute through IP option, but through a different mechanism. Discovery of
    the MTU of each router on a internet path would serve as a valuable network debugging
    tool. The way in which it is proposed to be implemented, it has the advantage
    of being automatically supported by all of the routers that support the TCP layer.
    It has a couple of disadvantages that it generates quite a few TCP packets and
    the amount of time it takes to run to discover each MTU along the path is quite
    substantial. This document specifies the MTU discovery mechanism with the existing
    IP and TCP options and the ICMP message types that exist on all routers that support
    TCP layer in the internet. This method is suggested as an alternative to the Traceroute
    through IP option [3]. The intention is not to obsolete RFC 1393. This document
    also suggests that by default a reply SYN packet from a target host should include
    a MSS value that is derived from the MTU of the connected network of the outbound
    interface.</p>"
