abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines and describes the IntermediateResponse message,
    a general mechanism for defining single-request/multiple-response operations in
    Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The IntermediateResponse message
    is defined in such a way that the protocol behavior of existing LDAP operations
    is maintained. This message is intended to be used in conjunction with the LDAP
    ExtendedRequest and ExtendedResponse to define new single-request/multiple-response
    operations or in conjunction with a control when extending existing LDAP operations
    in a way that requires them to return intermediate response information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
