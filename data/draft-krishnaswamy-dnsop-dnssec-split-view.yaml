abstract:
- content: "<p>The security extensions to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC) allow for
    integrity protection, whereby it is possible to make a determination of the verity
    of data returned from the Domain Name System in response to a query. Current operation
    of the Domain Name System also allows for the creation of multiple views of data,
    where the answer returned in response to a query is dependent on the origin of
    the query. Data integrity and the ability to return possibly conflicting values
    as in split-views may be construed to be mutually conflicting goals; but this
    apparent dichotomy is resolvable in practice through careful configuration. This
    document provides recommendations for configuring a manageable split-view DNSSEC
    environment in a representative enterprise network.</p>"
