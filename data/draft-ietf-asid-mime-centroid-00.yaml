abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an directory profile for carrying centroid or other
    indexing information pertaining to one or more directory entities within an application/directory
    MIME Content-Type. The profile consists of type definitions, what the types are
    allowed to contain, and rules for their use and interpretation within the application/directory
    body part. The scheme is fairly general and with a few extensions could be used
    to handle directory modification information pertaining to a single entity, or
    sets of modifications pertaining to many entries, in addition to updates to centroid
    or other index information that apply to many entities.</p>"
