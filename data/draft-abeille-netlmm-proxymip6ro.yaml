abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is specifying a protocol for network-based localized mobility
    management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management and
    de-registration into account. This document specifies a protocol for route optimization
    in networks, which support network-based mobility management. The specified protocol
    focuses on efficient set up and maintenance of a route optimized path between
    two mobile nodes and suits complex mobility scenarios as well as networks with
    multiple mobility anchors.</p>"
