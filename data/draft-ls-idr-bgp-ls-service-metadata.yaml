abstract:
- content: "<p>In edge computing, a service may be deployed on multiple instances
    within one or more sites, called edge service. The edge service is associated
    with an ANYCAST address in IP layer, and the route of it with potential service
    metatdata will be distributed to the network. The Edge Service Metadata can be
    used by ingress routers to make path selections not only based on the routing
    cost but also the running environment of the edge services. The service route
    with metadata can be collected by a PCE(Path Compute Element) or an analyzer for
    calculating the best path to the best site/instance. This draft describes a mechanism
    to collect the information of the service routes and related service metadata
    in BGP-LS.</p>"
