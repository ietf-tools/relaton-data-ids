abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required
    implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and the Optimized
    Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2). This document specifies how an
    included integrity check value (ICV) and a timestamp TLV, defined in RFC6622bis,
    are used by NHDP and OLSRv2 for countering a number of security threats. The ICV
    TLV uses a SHA-256 based HMAC and a single shared secret key. The timestamp TLV
    is based on POSIX time, and assumes that the clocks in all routers in the network
    can be synchronized with sufficient precision. The mechanism in this specification
    can also be used for other MANET protocols using RFC5444.</p>"
