abstract:
- content: "<p>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers, it is impossible
    to determine which subscriber has initiated that TCP connection. This memo describes
    a technique to share the identity of a subscriber that initiated a TCP connection
    with the TCP server.. The proposed method avoids altering the application-level
    payload and works well with SSL-protected connections.</p>"
