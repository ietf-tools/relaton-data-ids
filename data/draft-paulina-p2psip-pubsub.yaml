abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a generic publish-subscribe protocol, that
    can be built on top of RELOAD or P2PP. It works both for the unstructured and
    DHT-based Peer-to-Peer networks. Moreover it is highly customizable to address
    the optimization issues and support different topology structures. It can be used
    to implement P2P-SIP services such as presence or event notification.</p>"
