abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide information to the gen-
    eral Internet community regarding security expectations of Internet Ser- vice
    Providers (ISPs). It is not the intent of this document to define a set of require-
    ments that would be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to provide the community
    with a framework for discussion of security expectations with current and prospective
    service providers. This document is written from the perspective of the consumer.
    Companion documents provide information from the ISP perspective.</p>"
