abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism by which an appropriate ringback
    tone may be played to the calling party when the called party's device is alerting.
    It is written specifcally to address the case where the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) is used to initiate voice-over-IP calls. It also lists ringback characteristics
    for several countries.</p>"
