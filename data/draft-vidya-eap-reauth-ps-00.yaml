abstract:
- content: "<p>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748
    [1] is a generic framework for network access authentication, in which a peer
    engages in a full EAP conversation each time. A full EAP conversation involves
    several roundtrips between the peer and the authentication server in the home
    domain, and that is not acceptable for fast roaming. In this document, we explain
    the requirements for low-latency EAP re-authentication and associated key management.</p>"
