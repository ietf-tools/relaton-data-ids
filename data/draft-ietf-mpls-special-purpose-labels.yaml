abstract:
- content: <p>Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes. A block
    of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are commonly called
    "reserved labels". They will be called "special-purpose labels" in this document.
    As there are only 16 of these special-purpose labels, caution is needed in the
    allocation of new special-purpose labels; yet, at the same time, forward progress
    should be allowed when one is called for. This memo defines new procedures for
    the allocation and retirement of special-purpose labels, as well as a method to
    extend the special-purpose label space and a description of how to handle extended
    special-purpose labels in the data plane. Finally, this memo renames the IANA
    registry for special-purpose labels to "Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values" and
    creates a new registry called the "Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values"
    registry. This document updates a number of previous RFCs that use the term "reserved
    label". Specifically, this document updates RFCs 3032, 3038, 3209, 3811, 4182,
    4928, 5331, 5586, 5921, 5960, 6391, 6478, and 6790.</p>
