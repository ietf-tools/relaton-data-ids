abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'Age' response-header field in HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2068] is intended
    to provide a lower bound of an estimate of a response message's age (time since
    generation), by explicitly indicating the amount of time that is known to have
    passed since the response message was retrieved or revalidated. There has been
    considerable controversy over when the Age header field should be added to a response.
    This document explains the issues, rebuts a previous proposal, and provides a
    set of proposed changes for the revision of RFC 2068.</p>"
