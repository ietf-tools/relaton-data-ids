abstract:
- content: "<p>In the core of a high-capacity network, service differentiation may
    still be needed to support applications' utilization of the network. Applications
    with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into
    Diffserv service classes based on end- to-end behavior requirements of the applications.
    However, some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single forwarding
    treatment may satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance requirements
    of two or more service classes. In these cases, it may be desirable to aggregate
    two or more Diffserv service classes into a single forwarding treatment. This
    document provides guidelines for the aggregation of Diffserv service classes into
    forwarding treatments. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
