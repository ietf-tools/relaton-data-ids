abstract:
- content: "<p>The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which use BIER
    natively in IPv6. This document is intended to help the WG with this effort by
    describing the problem space of transporting packets, with Bit Index Explicit
    Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment. There will be a need to send
    IPv6 payloads, to multiple IPv6 destinations, using BIER. There have been several
    proposed solutions in this area. But there hasn't been a document which describes
    the problem and why this may be necessary. The goal of this document is to describe
    the BIER IPv6 problem space, basic use cases, why new solutions may be needed
    and briefly summarize some of the proposed solutions.</p>"
