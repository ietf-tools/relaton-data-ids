abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an experimental DHCPv6 default route option
    which provisions static routing information to client nodes. The option facilitates
    central configuration of a multi-access client node's default router list with
    the IPv6 address, MAC address, and lifetime of the route, which is preferred in
    certain multi-access network environments. In addition, the DHCP option defined
    in this document can provide operational simplicity in network coverage extension
    scenarios using inexpensive (and limited resource) consumer-grade equipment. Finally,
    the proposed DHCP option has been implemented and tested in practice; its experimental
    use points to benefits with respect to reduced signaling and energy consumption
    compared to existing default route configuration mechanisms.</p>"
