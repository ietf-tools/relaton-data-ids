abstract:
- content: "<p>Mcntp (Multicast News Transfer Protocol) provides a way to use the
    IP multicast infrastructure to transmit NetNews articles between news servers.
    Doing so will reduce the bandwidth that is actually needed for transmission of
    articles which is mostly done via NNTP. This does not affect how news reading
    clients communicate with servers.</p>"
