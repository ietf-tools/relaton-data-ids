abstract:
- content: "<p>A cryptographically generated address (CGA) is an IPv6 address generated
    by applying a hash function over the public key of a node and some additional
    parameters. CGA ownership can be asserted only by the node claiming the address,
    but is readily verifiable using the public-key of that node by any other entity.
    Such address authorization is also plausible using symmetric keys, where a node
    generating the self-identifying address shares a key with the verifier or its
    agent. This document specifies symmetric-key based address (SBA) generation. The
    infrastructure support comes with several advantages including proxy-mode operation;
    the symmetric key usage results in efficient operation; and finally the use of
    keyed hashing provides security advantages over CGAs.</p>"
