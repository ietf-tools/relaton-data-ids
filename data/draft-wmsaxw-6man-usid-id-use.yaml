abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.
    It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending the packet with a list
    of instructions, a.k.a. segments. A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address, or IPv6 address. Segment Routing can
    be applied in the MPLS data plane by encoding segments in an MPLS label stack.
    It also can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by encoding a list of segment identifiers
    in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH). In this document is described
    the use of unified segment identifiers in use cases where interworking between
    SR-MPLS and SRv6 is required.</p>"
