abstract:
- content: <p>The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) denotes a trend where a large number
    of embedded devices employ communication services offered by Internet protocols.
    Many of these devices, often called "smart objects", are not directly operated
    by humans but exist as components in buildings or vehicles, or are spread out
    in the environment. Following the theme "Everything that can be connected will
    be connected", engineers and researchers designing smart object networks need
    to decide how to achieve this in practice. This document offers guidance to engineers
    designing Internet- connected smart objects.</p>
