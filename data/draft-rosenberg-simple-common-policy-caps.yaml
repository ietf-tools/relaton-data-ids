abstract:
- content: "<p>An important component of presence and location services is policy.
    Policy systems allow the presentity or location target to grant access to specific
    pieces of information to specific watchers or requestors. These policy systems
    can be extremely simple, allowing a user to accept or block requests based solely
    on the identity of the requestor, to extremely complex, allowing for time based
    rules that grant or deny specific pieces of information. Policy systems often
    support vendor proprietary features. To allow for interoperability between clients
    which set such policies, and servers which execute them, it is necessary for clients
    to be able to determine the capabilities of the server to which it is connected.
    This specification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) based format for
    expressing such capabilities.</p>"
