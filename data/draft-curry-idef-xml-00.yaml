abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format (IDEF) is to
    define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest
    to intrusion detection and response systems, and to the management systems which
    may need to interact with them. The goals and requirements of the IDEF are described
    in [2]. This Internet-Draft describes a proposed implementation of the data format
    component of the IDEF, using the Extensible Markup Language (XML) [3] to represent
    the class hierarchy defined by Debar and Huang [4]. The rationale for choosing
    XML is explained, a Document Type Definition (DTD) is developed, and examples
    are provided.</p>"
