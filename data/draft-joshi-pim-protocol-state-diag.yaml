abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast networks are being deployed in large numbers. It becomes
    very important that, proper mechanisms are in place for troubleshooting error
    conditions and diagnosing other failure situations. Since multicasting has little
    support from IP in this matter (since ICMP does not support multicasting and broadcasting)
    it behooves that, multicast routing protocols, embed these features in themselves.
    There are various debugging tools available to debug Multicast connectivity [ssmping][3]
    and to trace multicast routes [mtrace][4] but there is none to diagnose, troubleshoot
    routing protocol states. Since PIM protocol family is probably the most widely
    used multicast routing protocol, this draft suggests an extension to PIM protocol
    to diagnose and troubleshoot various PIM states in PIM routers.</p>"
