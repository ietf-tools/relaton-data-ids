abstract:
- content: "<p>The increasing world-wide demands in deep space scientific missions,
    such as Lunar, Mars and other Planetary Exploration, along with the rapidly growing
    advances in space communication technologies have triggered the vision of so called
    future Deep Space Information Networks (DSINs). The coined DSIN paradigm is envisioned
    to be an integrated high speed self-organizing hypernetwork consisting of the
    terrestrial ground-based information networks and the outer space- based entities
    to provide maximum network capacity. In this document, the problem of network
    infrastructure and architecture for DSINs is investigated. Taking into account
    the major challenges or characteristics affecting link, networking, transport,
    and security design of DSINs, this document employs hypergraph theory to construct
    network infrastructure and node architecture of space optical switching, and further
    presents a five-layered hypernetwork model of DSINs to enhance network connectivity.
    Combining with the benefits in interconnection and interoperability of heterogeneous
    challenged networks, brought by the well-known Delay-and Disruption-Tolerant Networking
    (DTN) architecture, this document proposes a novel architecture of DSINs from
    two levels including Layered Protocol Stack and Management Plane. The proposed
    architecture preliminarily achieves the basic concepts and the relevant mechanisms
    of wisdom network, and the performance and quality of service (QoS) of DSINs are
    thereby improved.</p>"
