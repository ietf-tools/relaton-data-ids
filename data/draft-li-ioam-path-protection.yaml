abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ operation and maintenance management (IOAM, In-situ OAM), as
    a network performance monitoring technology, is based on the principle of path-associated
    detection to perform specific field marking/coloring and identification on actual
    service flows, and perform packet loss and delay measurement. It can quickly perceive
    network performance-related faults, and accurately delimit boundaries and do troubleshooting.
    However, the current IOAM solution has shortcomings too. For example, after the
    service traffic path switching, the IOAM cannot continue working. This paper proposes
    a scheme to achieve automatic performance monitoring through service path switching
    and linkage with IOAM, which enhances the feasibility of the IOAM scheme in large-scale
    deployment and the completeness of IOAM technology.</p>"
