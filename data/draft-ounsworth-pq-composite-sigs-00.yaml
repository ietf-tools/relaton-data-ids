abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
    the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic
    algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is
    at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in
    such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite public
    keys and composite signature data. This document defines the structures CompositePublicKey,
    CompositeSignatureAlgorithmParams, and CompositeSignatureValue which are sequences
    of the respective structure for each component algorithm. This document also defines
    algorithms for generating and verifying composite signatures. This document makes
    no assumptions about what the component algorithms are, provided that their algorithm
    identifiers and signature generation and verification algorithms are defined.</p>"
