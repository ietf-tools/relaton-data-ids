abstract:
- content: "<p>A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and
    an IPsec security association with its home agent before it can start utilizing
    Mobile IPv6 service. RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these parameters are
    statically configured. Ongoing work aims to make this information dynamically
    available to the mobile node. An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping
    solution is to support interworking with the existing authentication, authorization
    and accounting infrastructure. This document defines new attributes that facilitate
    Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping via a RADIUS infrastructure. This information exchange
    may take place as part of the initial network access authentication procedure
    or as part of a separate protocol exchange between the mobile node, the home agent
    and the AAA infrastructure.</p>"
