abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the logic for third-party and network security
    to complement strong cryptographic protocols, and presents data, including independently
    verifiable data, helping scale the importance of blocking attacks that might be
    hiding in encrypted network traffic. This report includes data from multiple sources.
    Some of that data is verifiable.</p>"
