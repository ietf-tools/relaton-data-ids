abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines enhancements to the OSPF protocol to support a new
    class of link-state advertisements (LSA) called Opaque LSAs. Opaque LSAs provide
    a generalized mechanism to allow for the future extensibility of OSPF. Opaque
    LSAs consist of a standard LSA header followed by application-specific information.
    The information field may be used directly by OSPF or by other applications. Standard
    OSPF link-state database flooding mechanisms are used to distribute Opaque LSAs
    to all or some limited portion of the OSPF topology. This document replaces [RFC2370],
    and adds to it a mechanism to enable an OSPF router to validate AS-scope opaque
    LSAs originated outside of the router's OSPF area.</p>"
