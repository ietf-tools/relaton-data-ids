abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Internet Standard
    Management Framework are widely used for the management of communication devices,
    creating a need to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances)
    from non-SNMP management environments. For example, when out-of-band IP management
    is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not
    support in-band IP access), a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device
    for management is needed. Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) fit this need well,
    as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication
    endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols. This document defines a URI
    scheme so that SNMP can be designated as the protocol used for management. The
    scheme also allows a URI to designate one or more MIB object instances. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
