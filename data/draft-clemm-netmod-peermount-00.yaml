abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism, Peer-Mount, that allows YANG datastores
    to reference and incorporate information from remote datastores. This is accomplished
    by extending YANG with the ability to define mount points that reference data
    nodes in other YANG subtrees and subsequently allowing those data nodes to be
    accessed by client applications as if part of an alternative data hierarchy. In
    addition, means to manage and administer tho mount points are provided. This facilitates
    the development of applications that need to access network-wide data that treanscends
    individual network devices while ensuring network-wide data consistency. One example
    concerns example applications that require a network inventory and/or network
    topology with access to select management data within the nodes that comprise
    it. The concept of Peer-Mount was first introduced in an earlier Internet Draft
    that was no longer pursued due to lack of interest at the time. It is being revived
    now in light of renewed IETF interest in network inventory, network topology,
    and related use cases, for which Peer- Mount is of specific interest. Other concepts
    defined in the earlier draft, notably Alias-Mount, are not considered here since
    they provide other capabilities that are less applicable to those topics.</p>"
