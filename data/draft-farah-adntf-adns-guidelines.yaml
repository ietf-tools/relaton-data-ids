abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been several attempts aimed at developing an Arabic Domain
    Name System (ADNS) using Arabic characters in an Arabic-language coherent fashion.
    In the beginning of the second quarter of 2003, an Arabic Domain Name Task Force
    (ADNTF) was formed under the auspices of United Nations Economic and Social Commission
    for Western Asia (ESCWA), and the guidance of Multilingual Internet Names Consortium
    (MINC); one of its main objectives was to help define standards for ADNS through
    a Request For Comments (RFC) document. This document resolves many technical and
    linguistic issues, including the adoption of the client-side DNS-based approach
    to name resolution; syntax of the proposed Arabic Domain Names together with the
    character set and many Arabic language-specific issues were clearly resolved.
    This Internet-Draft proposes guidelines that are compatible with the Internet
    Consortium for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) as far as Domain Names System (DNS) and Internationalized Domain
    Names (IDN) standards are concerned. Technical, management, operational, and language-specific
    issues are discussed and recommendations are made.</p>"
