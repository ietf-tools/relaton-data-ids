abstract:
- content: '<p>The server end-point does not respond with acknowledgment (ACK) in
    non-confirmable(NON)mode of CoAP. However, the server responds the client with
    a status code indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy
    the request". But there may be typical scenarios, while updating resources in
    NON mode, where any kind of response from the server may be considered redundant.
    Thus, in this case, the transaction becomes completely open-loop with no reverse
    path from the server to the client. This kind of exchange may be useful in constrained
    systems looking for maximized throughput with minimized resource consumption.
    This draft introduces a header option: ''No-Resp'' to suppress any response from
    the server and discusses an exemplary but practical use case which actually motivated
    this proposition based on real experience.</p>'
