abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol. It extends the ALTO Cost Map and ALTO Property Map
    services so that an application can decide which endpoint(s) to connect based
    on not only numerical/ordinal cost values but also fine-grained abstract information
    of the paths. This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by
    specified components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer
    that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding
    such paths. This extension introduces a new abstraction called Abstract Network
    Element (ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector
    of ANEs. Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation
    of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints.</p>"
