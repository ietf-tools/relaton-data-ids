abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a binary serialisation of Structured Headers
    for HTTP, along with a negotiation mechanism for its use in HTTP/2. It also defines
    how to use Structured Headers for many existing headers - thereby "backporting"
    them - when supported by two peers.</p>
