abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for automating the process of creating
    Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in the protocol is a
    method for retrieving the external IP address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing
    a client to make this external IP address and port number known to peers that
    may wish to communicate with it. This protocol is implemented in current Apple
    products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.</p>"
