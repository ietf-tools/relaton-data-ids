- content: "<p>This document specifies the schemas and models required to realize
    the data formats and interfaces for Intent-Based Networking (IBN). They are needed
    to enable the composition of services to build a translation engine for IBN-based
    network management. This intent translation engine (called an intent translator)
    is an essential function for network intents to be enforced into a target network
    for the configuration and management of the network and its security.</p>"
