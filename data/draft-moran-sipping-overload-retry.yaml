abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP servers can become overload and unable to handle all SIP messages
    they receive. Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control
    mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are
    still vulnerable to overload. This document proposes an architecture for determining
    when a client should throttle the sending of SIP requests vs. retrying them.</p>"
