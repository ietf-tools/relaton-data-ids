abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined
    network and cost maps to provide basic network information, where the cost maps
    allow only one JSON value for a requested metric. This document introduces several
    protocol extensions to allow ALTO clients to support use cases such as context
    based connection selection in cellular networks and calendaring for unattended
    data. This document refers to other extension proposals posted in the ALTO WG
    that can support the present use cases as well. Likewise, some of the proposed
    extensions may serve other ALTO use cases.</p>"
