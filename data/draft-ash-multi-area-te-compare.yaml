abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft makes comparisons of various multi-area TE methods, which
    are evaluated against specific criteria. Four basic path selection approaches
    are compared: a) distributed methods, b) path-computation-server (PCS) methods
    (centralized &amp; distributed), c) interarea-flooding methods, and d) multiple-path-compare
    methods. These approaches include needs to support PCS functionality, query functionality,
    crankback functionality, summary-te-LSA functionality, and TE feedback functionality.
    The target is to converge on a reduced subset of required multi-area TE methods
    and protocol extensions.</p>"
