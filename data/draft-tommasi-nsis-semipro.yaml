abstract:
- content: "<p>Re-establishment of the QoS after a Mobile Node handover must be done
    as quickly as possible in order to reduce degradation or interruption of the QoS
    and it is especially useful when realtime applications are used. We propose a
    Semi-Proactive procedure for a fast QoS re-establishment in environments where
    there are Mobile Nodes. The basic idea of this procedure is to perform as many
    operation as possible before the handover (in a proactive way). Resources are
    reserved only after the handover on the effective new data path, in order to avoid
    their waste. Moreover, we propose to buffer at the Candidate CRossover Node -
    CCRN (an intermediate node on end-to-end data path) the packets directed to the
    Mobile Node during the handover. In this way the total QoS re-establishment time
    is reduced. This buffering also guarantees, for the buffered packets, the same
    QoS treatment of the other packets (the no-buffered ones).</p>"
