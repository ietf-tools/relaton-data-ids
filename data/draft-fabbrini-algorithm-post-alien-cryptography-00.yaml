abstract:
- content: <p>This memo aims to introduce the concept of "post-alien cryptography",
    presenting a symmetric encryption algorithm which, in our opinion, can be considered
    the first ever designed to face the challenges posed by contact with an alien
    civilization. FC1 cipher offers an unprecedented grade of confidentiality. Based
    on the uniqueness of the modular multiplicative inverse of a positive integer
    a modulo n and on its computability in a polynomial time, this non-deterministic
    cipher can easily and quickly handle keys of millions or billions of bits that
    an attacker does not even know the length of. The algorithm's primary key is the
    modulo, while the ciphertext is given by the concatenation of the modular inverse
    of blocks of plaintext whose length is randomly chosen within a predetermined
    range. In addition to the full specification here defined, in a related work we
    present an implementation of it in Julia Programming Language, accompanied by
    real examples of encryption and decryption.</p>
