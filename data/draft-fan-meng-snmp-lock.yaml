abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is intended to provide a lock mechanism to SNMP for protecting
    SET operations from being interrupted by any other network management operations
    such as NETCONF &lt;edit-config&gt; or CLI writes. This memo defines a portion
    of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.
    In particular, it extends LOCK-MIB defined in [I-D.meng-fan-lock-mib] to define
    objects for managing SNMP locks. The lock acquisition and release can be achieved
    through manipulating those objects.</p>"
