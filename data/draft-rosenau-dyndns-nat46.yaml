abstract:
- content: "<p>Many devices in private homes can be controlled via Web browser from
    another computer in the internet. This assumes that the IP address of the device
    is known and that the private internet access has a public IP address at all.
    Due to the IPv4 address shortage many internet providers only provide IPv6 internet
    access while many internet accesses (and therefore Web browsers) are IPv4-only.
    This document describes a method that allows an internet service provider that
    also provides dynamic DNS to the customers to allow accessing IPv6-only devices
    from IPv4-only Web browsers.</p>"
