abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet MANET Encapsulation Protocol (IMEP) is designed to support
    the operation of many routing algorithms or other Upper Layer Protocols (ULP)
    in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET). The MANET computing environment is very different
    from the ordinary computing environment in that these mobile computers will be
    connected to the network via wireless links. Such links are particularly vulnerable
    to eavesdropping, replay, spoofing, and other attacks. The use of IMEP results
    in a mobile node relying on other MANET nodes to perform routing operations on
    behalf of the transmitting node. This routing function constitutes a significant
    vulnerability if the IMEP management messages are not authenticated. The risk
    of attacks on MANET routing control messages necessitates a MANET Authentication
    Architecture to protect these messages in some networking contexts. Consequently
    all MANET nodes SHOULD be able to perform authentication. The MANET Authentication
    Architecture provides MANET routers with the ability to choose between multiple
    authentication options ranging from simple to complex, while leaving the option
    of no authentication in some contexts. IMEP messages between MANET routers are
    authenticated with the IMEP Authentication object. This document describes how
    MANET nodes using IMEP and desiring authentication SHOULD authenticate IMEP messages.
    Mechanisms described herein will allow these nodes to use either secret key type
    cryptosystems or public key type cryptosystems (with digital certificates and
    digital signatures) for authenticating IMEP management messages. The use of of
    secret key mechanisms will facilitate research and experimentation of MANET networks
    while the use of public key cryptosystems will allow MANET to scale to thousands
    of MANET mobile nodes.</p>"
