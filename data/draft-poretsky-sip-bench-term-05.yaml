abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performance
    in networking devices. Terms are included for test components, test setup parameters,
    and performance benchmark metrics for black-box benchmarking of SIP networking
    devices. The performance benchmark metrics are obtained for the SIP control plane
    and media plane. The terms are intended for use in a companion methodology document
    for complete performance characterization of a device in a variety of conditions
    making it possible to compare performance of different devices. It is critical
    to provide test setup parameters and a methodology document for SIP performance
    benchmarking because SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational
    conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements. It is necessary
    to have terminology and methodology standards to ensure that reported benchmarks
    have consistent definition and were obtained following the same procedures. Benchmarks
    can be applied to compare performance of a variety of SIP networking devices.</p>"
