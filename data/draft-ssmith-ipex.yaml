abstract:
- content: "<p>The Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) Protocol provides a uniform
    mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs [ACDC-ID] in a securely attributable
    manner. A single protocol is able to work for both types of exchanges by recognizing
    that all exchanges (both issuance and presentation) may be modeled as the disclosure
    of information by a Discloser to a Disclosee. The difference between exchange
    types is the information disclosed not the mechanism for disclosure. Furthermore,
    the chaining mechanism of ACDCs and support for both targeted and untargeted ACDCs
    provide sufficient variability to accommodate the differences in applications
    or use cases without requiring a difference in the exchange protocol itself. This
    greatly simplifies the exchange protocol. This simplification has two primary
    advantages. The first is enhanced security. A well-delimited protocol can be designed
    and analyzed to minimize and mitigate attack mechanisms. The second is convenience.
    A standard simple protocol is easier to implement, support, update, understand,
    and adopt. The tooling is more consistent. This IPEX [IPEX-ID] protocol leverages
    important features of ACDCs and ancillary protocols such as CESR [CESR-ID], SAIDs
    [SAID-ID], and CESR-Proofs [Proof-ID] as well as Ricardian contracts [RC] and
    graduated disclosure (partial, selective, full) to enable contractually protected
    disclosure. Contractually protected disclosure includes both chain-link confidential
    [CLC] and contingent disclosure [ACDC-ID].</p>"
