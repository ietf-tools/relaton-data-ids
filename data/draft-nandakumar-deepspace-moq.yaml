abstract:
- content: "<p>Deep Space communications can be benefited by a publish/subscribe,
    store-and-forward and asymmetric delivery network over IP that allows communications
    across links with high latencies and dynamic network conditions (losses and high
    bit error rates). This specification proposes to use Media over QUIC Transport
    (MOQT) [MoQTransport] as the common delivery protocol for deep space communications.</p>"
