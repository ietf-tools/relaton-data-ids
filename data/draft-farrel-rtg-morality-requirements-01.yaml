abstract:
- content: <p>It has often been the case that morality has not been given proper consideration
    in the design and specification of protocols produced within the Routing Area.
    This has led to a decline in the moral values within the Internet and attempts
    to retrofit a suitable moral code to implemented and deployed protocols has been
    shown to be sub-optimal. This document specifies a requirement for all new Routing
    Area Internet-Drafts to include a "Morality Considerations" section, and gives
    guidance on what that section should contain. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>
