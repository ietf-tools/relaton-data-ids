abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two new Multi Topology Routing Identifiers (MT
    IDs), based on [RFC5120] and two new Instance Identifiers (MI IDs), based on [I-D.ietf-isis-mi],
    respectively, in the Intermediate System to Intermediate System. With these identifiers,
    an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 topology is maintained for both IPv6 unicast and multicast
    traffic. The purpose of running separate instances or topologies for IPv4-Embedded
    IPv6 traffic is to distinguish from the native IPv6 routing topology, and the
    topology that is used for routing IPv4- Embedded IPv6 datagrams only. Separate
    instances/topologies are also meant to prevent any overload of the native IPv6
    routing tables by IPv4-Embedded IPv6 routes.</p>"
