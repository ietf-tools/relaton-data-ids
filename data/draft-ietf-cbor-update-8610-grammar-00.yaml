abstract:
- content: "<p>At the time of writing, the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL)
    is defined by RFC 8610 and RFC 9165. The latter has used the extension point provided
    in RFC 8610, the _control operator_. As CDDL is being used in larger projects,
    the need for corrections and additional features has become known that cannot
    be easily mapped into this single extension point. Hence, there is a need for
    evolution of the base CDDL specification itself. The present document updates
    errata and makes other small fixes for the ABNF grammar defined for CDDL in RFC
    8610. // Previous versions of the changes in this document were part of // draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft
    and previously draft-bormann-cbor- // cddl-freezer. This submission extracts out
    those grammar changes // that are ready for publication.</p>"
