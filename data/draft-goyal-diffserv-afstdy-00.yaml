abstract:
- content: "<p>One desirable characteristics of any resource allocation (or differentiation)
    mechanism is that if many aggregates, each with its own reservation, are merged
    with other aggregates of the same class, each aggregate should get its reserved
    bandwidth and a fair share of the excess bandwidth. In particular, the performance
    of an aggregate should not be adversely affected by other aggregates and their
    congestion sensitivity. TCP flows are congestion sensitive while UDP flows are
    congestion insensitive in the sense that TCP flows reduce their traffic if any
    packets are lost. The goal of this study is to see if TCP flow aggregates will
    be punished for their good behavior in the presence of competing UDP flow aggregates
    in the same assured forwarding class. We identify several factors that affect
    the performance in the mixed environments and quantify their effects using a full
    factorial design of experiment methodology.</p>"
