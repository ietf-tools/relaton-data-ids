abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownership
    of a certain telephone number. Due to this, it is impossible to establish meaningful
    identity or to authenticate endpoints that use telephone number URIs and domain
    names in their From address. This document proposes a solution to this problem
    using a return routability test.</p>"
