abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem with
    multicast routing scalability - by co-operation between end-systems and the network.
    We introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to name arbitrary sized inter-meshed
    aggregations of multicast addresses. This is done in such a way that it is easy
    to calculate how to change the name to encompass many more related names. We describe
    how these aggregate names could be used anywhere in place of the set of addresses
    to which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple operations, but by a
    single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in session descriptions potentially
    including those for reservations. Initial aggregation in end-systems might only
    reduce the problem by an order of magnitude, but it is believed that this will
    provide sufficient structure for routers to be able to recognise further aggregation
    potential. To improve the chances of router aggregation, address set allocation
    schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down in this paper.</p>"
