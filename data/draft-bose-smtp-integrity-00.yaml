- content: "<p>This Internet Draft describes an extension to the SMTP Services which
    will enable an SMTP Server/Client to check the Integrity of Mails received by
    it and immediately request for the Mail to be resent if it is found to be corrupted
    during that particular transaction. This extension is meant to apply to both SMTP
    Clients and Servers as described in detail below.</p>"
