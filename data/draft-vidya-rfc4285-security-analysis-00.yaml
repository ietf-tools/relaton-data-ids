- content: "<p>RFC4285 [1] provides a means of using pre-shared key (PSK) based or
    AAA-based credentials for Mobile IPv6. It is intended to provide a light-weight
    security mechanism for MIP6 signaling. However, the protocol comes with a set
    of security issues that are worth looking at. This document presents a security
    analysis on the protocol.</p>"
