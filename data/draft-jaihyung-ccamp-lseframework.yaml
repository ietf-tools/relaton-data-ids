abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft we propose a framework for implementation of (G)MPLS
    technology in Ethernet based Customer Premise Network (ECPN). Major goals of this
    framework are improving QoS capability of Ethernet using (G)MPLS technology and
    facilitating secure access of commercial service, such as IP-TV or videophone,
    in local area network. Key solution to achieve the goal is MAC address swapping
    which uses 48bits of Ethernet address in MAC header as labels. Ethernet switches
    supporting this technique identify flows of different applications according to
    MAC addresses. ARP or ICMPv6 is used for terminal-to-terminal label negotiation
    and path establishment. Policy can be imposed in controlling user connection.
    Unauthorized user flows are filtered in MAC level. Compatibility with legacy Ethernet
    is provided best because it does not require modification in Ethernet format nor
    relies on VLAN tag. This architecture and technology will be aligned with architectural
    framework for Ethernet based Access Network and Core Network.</p>"
