abstract:
- content: "<p>Email servers have event information which is of interest to a wide
    variety of clients, devices and users, and this motivates an effort to tie Email
    servers into the existing Internet notifications architecture as described by
    the Common Profile for Presence (CPP). This document describes where Email servers
    fit into CPP and what pieces are missing. This is not purely a requirements document
    because it describes a specific architecture, but it makes some requirements on
    future documents that fill in pieces of the architecture.</p>"
