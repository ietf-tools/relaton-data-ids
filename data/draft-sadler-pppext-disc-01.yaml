abstract:
- content: "<p>Work has been progressing in the Common Control and Measurement Protocol
    (CCAMP) working group on the application of MPLS technology to non-packet switching
    networks. Development of the Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signaling draft [1] has
    allowed for Optical, SONET/SDH, and spatial switching systems to be controlled
    using IP protocols. In a GMPLS network, the path that a TDM connection will use
    is developed using constraint based routing. The developed route utilizes TDM
    link state information announced via OSPF or IS-IS by other nodes in the network.
    However, a node cannot advertise the existence of a link without first identifying
    the remote node connected to the link and the capabilities of the neighboring
    node. In a packet network, this function would typically be accomplished using
    OSPF or IS-IS Hello messages repeated every 10 or so seconds. However, the TDM
    link cannot transmit similar messages because the port terminating the link cannot
    be shared between a TDM service user and the OSPF/IS-IS termination function.</p>"
