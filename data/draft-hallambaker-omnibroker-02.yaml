abstract:
- content: "<p>An Omnibroker is an agent chosen and trusted by an Internet user to
    provide information such as name and certificate status information that are in
    general trusted even if they are not trustworthy. Rather than acting as a mere
    conduit for information provided by existing services, an Omnibroker is responsible
    for curating those sources to protect the user. The Omnibroker Protocol (OBP)
    provides an aggregated interface to trusted Internet services including DNS, OCSP
    and various forms of authentication service. Multiple transport bindings are supported
    to permit efficient access in virtually every common deployment scenario and ensure
    access in any deployment scenario in which access is not being purposely denied.</p>"
