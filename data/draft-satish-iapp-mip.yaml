abstract:
- content: "<p>With WLAN hotspots becoming more wide spread, there is growing interest
    among cellular service providers in WLAN-Cellular interworking/roaming architectures.
    Service providers are looking at deployment of interworking heterogeneous wireless
    access points. There is also a growing breed of terminals trying to build a capability
    to roam between 3G and 802.xx technologies. Working groups within IETF and IEEE
    802.21 are involved in defining seamless roaming standards. 802.21 is attempting
    to define roaming standards not just from one 802-based network to another, but
    also between 802-based networks and 3G cellular network. Support for handoff between
    heterogeneous wireless networks is becoming vital. Mobile IP has always been the
    macro network mobility protocol of choice where as the IAPP - Inter Access Point
    Protocol (802.11f) has been recommended as the roaming protocol between 802.11
    access points. This draft suggests a mechanism of supporting handoff between IAPP
    supported 802.xx devices and 3G packet core networks.</p>"
