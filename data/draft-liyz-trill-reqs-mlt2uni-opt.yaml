abstract:
- content: "<p>Instead of always blindly forwarding multicast/broadcast frames through
    a distribution tree in Trill, some optimizations can be done to convert multicast/broadcast
    to unicast for certain IP controlling packets. This draft shows the scenarios
    in which such optimizations are needed.</p>"
