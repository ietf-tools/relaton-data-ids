abstract:
- content: "<p>A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label
    Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs. Routing (OSPF
    and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) LSR TE
    mesh membership has been defined to automate the creation of mesh of TE LSPs.
    This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to the scenarios
    where full mesh TE LSPs is not necessary and TE LSPs setup depends on the roles
    of LSRs in a TE mesh-group. Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions
    for automatic discovery of role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.</p>"
