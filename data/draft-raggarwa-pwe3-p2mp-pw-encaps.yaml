abstract:
- content: "<p>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism that emulates
    the essential attributes of a P2MP Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM
    over a Packet Switched Network (PSN). This document describes the encapsulation
    and data plane procedures for a P2MP PW. These procedures are meant to be independent
    of the control plane used to signal a P2MP PW.</p>"
