abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain
    Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with '.homenet.', thereby
    defining this top-level domain as a special-use domain name [RFC6761]. The '.homenet'
    top-level domain intends to replace '.home' which was originally proposed in [RFC7788]
    as default domain-name for home networks.</p>"
