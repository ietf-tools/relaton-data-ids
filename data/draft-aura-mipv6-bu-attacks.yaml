abstract:
- content: "<p>This document overviews attacks against mobile and fixed IP nodes by
    exploiting features of the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization. Many of the attacks
    can be prevented by authenticating the Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates (BU) but some
    cannot, some depend on the details of the BU protocol, and some denial-of-service
    attacks specifically take advantage of authentication mechanisms.</p>"
