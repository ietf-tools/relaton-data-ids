abstract:
- content: "<p>The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the
    discovery and selection of network services. Using this protocol, computers using
    the Internet no longer need so much static configuration of network services for
    network based applications. This is especially important as computers become more
    portable, and users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system
    administration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
