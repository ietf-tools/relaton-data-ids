abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing advice
    that must be followed in order to maintain security. Specifically, this document
    describes the math behind the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must
    wait before signing exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs. It contains much
    math and complicated equations, but the summary is that the key rollover / revocation
    time is much longer than intuition would suggest. If you are not both publishing
    a DNSSEC trust anchor, and using RFC5011 to update that trust anchor, you probably
    don't need to read this document. This document also describes the minimum time-length
    that a DNS zone publisher must wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming
    that all active RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation- marked key
    and removed it from their list of trust anchors.</p>"
