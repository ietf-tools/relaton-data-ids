abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements for a proposed extension to
    the Session Initiation Protocol [1]. This extension would provide a general-purpose
    mechanism for uploading service related data. For instance, there is currently
    the need to upload or publish CPL to SIP Proxies and presence documents to SIP
    Presence Servers. This document does NOT outline an extension to SIP to handle
    these requirements. The author is attempting to follow the guidelines that requirements
    should be defined and agreed to before work on the an extension begins.</p>"
