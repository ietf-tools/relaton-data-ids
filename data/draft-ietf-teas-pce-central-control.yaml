abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
    a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic
    demands. PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs),
    which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
    Communication Protocol (PCEP). SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS
    traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in
    a range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function
    Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. It is, therefore,
    reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments
    to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller. This document briefly
    introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller, examines the motivations
    and applicability for PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces
    the implications for the protocol. A PCE-based central controller can simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of
    SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. This document does not describe
    use cases in detail and does not define protocol extensions: that work is left
    for other documents.</p>"
