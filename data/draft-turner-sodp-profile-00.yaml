abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the US NSA
    (United States National Security Agency) for NSS (National Security System) servers
    that provide public key certificates, CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists), and
    symmetric keys to NSS clients. Servers that support these interfaces are referred
    to as SODP (Secure Object Delivery Protocol) servers. The intended audience for
    this profile comprises developers of client devices that will obtain key management
    services from NSA-operated SODP servers. The profile indicates which options from
    the profiled base specifications are necessary to achieve interoperability with
    those servers. It also imposes requirements on client devices beyond those in
    the base specifications. Interfaces supported by SODP servers include: EST (Enrollment
    over Secure Transport) and its extensions as well as CMC (Certificate Management
    over CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax)). This profile applies to the capabilities,
    configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems
    (SP 800- 59). It is also appropriate for other US Government systems that process
    high-value information. It is made publicly available for use by developers and
    operators of these and any other system deployments. This profile conforms to
    the existing requirements of NSA's Commercial National Security Algorithms. As
    operational needs evolve over time, this profile will be updated to incorporate
    new commercial algorithms and protocols as they are developed and approved for
    use.</p>"
