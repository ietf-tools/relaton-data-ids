abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft consider Path MTU (PMTU) alogorithms and issues in QUIC
    applications. Fistly, a passive probing approach is adopted to discover the PMTU.
    The process of discovering the PMTU is not performed separately, but is performed
    simultaneously in the actual application data communication. A probe packet is
    defined newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application data as well
    as a short packet header and a PING_EXT frame. Until the optimal PMTU is discovered,
    the size of the probe packet is changed according to the size of the PMTU candidate.
    Secondly, a PMTU black hole problem in secure and reliable transport protocol
    is discussed and a possible solution can be suggested from existing researches.
    Thirdly, PMTU issues for media delivery over UDP, such as WebRTC and media over
    QUIC (MoQ) are discussed.</p>"
