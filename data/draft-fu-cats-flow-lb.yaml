abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a flow-level load balancing solution for CATS,
    and is designed to effectively manage CS-ID traffic by addressing issues like
    frequent control plane operations and uneven use of computing resources. The approach
    entails concurrently identifying multiple next-hop choices, factoring in both
    network pathways and service instances. Traffic is then distributed among these
    service instances using flow-based load balancing, which relies on the five- tuple
    characteristics of packets.</p>"
