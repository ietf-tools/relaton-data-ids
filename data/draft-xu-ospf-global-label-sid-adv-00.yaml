abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable
    router is required to advertise global MPLS labels or Segment IDs (SID) for its
    attached prefixes by using link-state IGPs, e.g., OSPF. One major challenge associated
    with such global MPLS label or SID advertisement mechanism is how to avoid a given
    global MPLS label or SID from being allocated by different routers to different
    prefixes. Although such global label or SID allocation collision problem can be
    addressed through manual allocation, it is error-prone and nonautomatic therefore
    may not be suitable in large-scale SR network environments. This document proposes
    an alternative approach for allocating and advertising global MPLS labels or SIDs
    via OSPF so as to eliminate the potential risk of label allocation collision.</p>"
