abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to enhance the policy provisioning and QoS guarantees, policy
    monitoring and context learning facilities are used. This document is focussed
    on facilities for monitoring and learning of context integrated in autonomous
    policy management system for enhanced user-centric Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees
    in heterogeneous Internet environment. The autonomous policy management includes
    components aimed at automation of QoS policy specification, provisioning and adaptation
    based on common policy repository. Integration of monitoring and context learning
    facilities allows to consider measurement and context data for more efficient
    policy provisioning and adaptation. The goal is to collect measurement and context
    information, in order to support automated policy decision and adaptation of actor's
    policies, when specific events (patterns) are detected in a given network context.</p>"
