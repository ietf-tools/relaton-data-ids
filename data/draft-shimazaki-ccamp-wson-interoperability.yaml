abstract:
- content: "<p>GMPLS protocol enabled network operator to setup optical path network
    rapidly and dynamically. Recently, WSON [8] is standardized to achieve WDM core
    network. However, it is difficult that all network equipment supports WSON protocol.
    Therefore, interoperability between WSON and non-WSON nodes is needed to construct
    path network. This document describes requirement for interoperability between
    WSON node and non-WSON nodes and functions that routing and signaling protocol
    should support.</p>"
