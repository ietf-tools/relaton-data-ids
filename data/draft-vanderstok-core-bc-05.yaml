abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an example use of the RESTful CoAP protocol for
    building automation and control (BAC) applications such as HVAC and lighting.
    A few basic design assumptions are stated first, then URI structure is utilized
    to define group as well as unicast scope for RESTful operations. This proposal
    supports the view that 1) service discovery is complementary to resource discovery
    and facilitates control network scaling, and 2) building control is likely to
    move in steps toward all-IP control networks based on the legacy efforts provided
    by DALI, LON, BACnet, ZigBee, and other standards. The authority portion of the
    URI is used to identify a device (group) and the resulting DNS name is bound to
    a unicast (multicast) address. Group addressing has consequence for the naming
    convention of the resources of a device. Naming of URI is building or organization
    dependent, must be flexible, and SHOULD conform to some local convention. Naming
    of resources MUST be standardised preferrable by a building control related organisation.
    It is shown that DNS-based service discovery can be used to locate URIs on the
    scale necessary in large commercial BAC deployments. The relation of DNS-SD and
    a Resource Directory is discussed. Finally, a method is proposed for mapping URIs
    onto legacy BAC resources, e.g., to discover application-layer gateways, proxies,
    and their dependent services.</p>"
