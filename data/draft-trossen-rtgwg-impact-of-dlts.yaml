abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the impact of distributed ledger technologies
    being realized over IP-based provider networks. The focus here lies on the impact
    that the DLT communication patterns have on efficiency of resource usage in the
    underlying networks. We provide initial insights into experimental results to
    quantify this impact in terms of inefficient and wasted communication, aligned
    along challenges that the DLT realization over IP networks faces. This document
    intends to outline this impact but also opportunities for network innovations
    to improve on the identified impact as well as the overall service quality. While
    this document does not promote specific solutions that capture those opportunities,
    it invites the wider community working on DLT and network solutions alike to contribute
    to the insights in this document to aid future research and development into possible
    solution concepts and technologies. The findings presented here have first been
    reported within the similarly titled whitepaper released by the Industry IoT Consortium
    (IIC) [IIC_whitepaper].</p>"
