abstract:
- content: "<p>From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to name things
    used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or referenced. It's common
    for protocol designers in this predicament to attempt to use domain names as the
    starting point for their systems of names, and the DNS as the starting point for
    name resolution. This is completely understandable-- domain names, and DNS resolution,
    are well-established in both the expectations of network users and developers,
    and well-supported by fielded software. It also has significant limitations. This
    document deals principally with the questions a protocol designer or software
    developer should ask themselves about what behavior they want from the names they
    use in the context of a new protocol or scope for names. Depending to the answers
    to these questions, the answer may be that domain names will not meet the constraints
    at hand. Future versions of this draft will provide some comments on alternatives.</p>"
