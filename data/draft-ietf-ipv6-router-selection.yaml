abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an optional extension to Router Advertisement
    messages for communicating default router preferences and more-specific routes
    from routers to hosts. This improves the ability of hosts to pick an appropriate
    router, especially when the host is multi-homed and the routers are on different
    links. The preference values and specific routes advertised to hosts require administrative
    configuration; they are not automatically derived from routing tables. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
