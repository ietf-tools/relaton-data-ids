abstract:
- content: "<p>The IS-IS routing protocol was originally defined with a two level
    hierarchical structure. This was adequate for the networks at the time. As we
    continue to expand the scale of our networks, it is apparent that additional hierarchy
    would be a welcome degree of flexibility in network design. This document defines
    IS-IS Levels 3 through 8.</p>"
