abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out in RFC 4655.
    The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with the introduction
    of the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM) in RFC 5623 and generalized to
    Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) in RFC 6805. These three architectural views of PCE deliberately
    leave some key questions unanswered, especially with respect to the interactions
    between architectural components. This document draws out those questions and
    discusses them in an architectural context with reference to other architectural
    components, existing protocols, and recent IETF efforts. This document does not
    update the architecture documents and does not define how protocols or components
    must be used. It does, however, suggest how the architectural components might
    be combined to provide advanced PCE function.</p>"
