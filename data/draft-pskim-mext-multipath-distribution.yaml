abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft considers a packet distribution scheme for bandwidth aggregation
    on the mobile network with a multi-interfaced mobile router (MMR). In the proposed
    scheme, the MMR with multiple heterogeneous wireless network interfaces effectively
    and fairly distributes packets over end-to-end multi-path through multiple network
    interfaces. Each network interface is considered to have a distribution counter
    associated with corresponding end-to-end path. This distribution counter varied
    by both weighted capacity and distributed packets is used to determine if a network
    interface has enough credits to distribute incoming packets on multiple paths.
    The capacity unit is shown to be a useful design parameter to make the performance
    of the proposed scheme as good as possible.</p>"
