abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a PIM routing problem owing to the reverse path
    forwarding (RPF) failure on routers having multiple addresses on a link. This
    memo also considers possible solutions with their pros and cons. The solutions
    include operational one which does not require any protocol change, and one which
    uses a new PIM Hello option. However, it is beyond the scope of this memo to discuss
    what is the most appropriate solution for this problem.</p>"
