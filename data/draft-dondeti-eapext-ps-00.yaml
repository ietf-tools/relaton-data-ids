abstract:
- content: "<p>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748
    [1] is a generic framework supporting multiple authentication methods. The EAP
    keying hierarchy specified in [2] has two top level keys: a master session key
    (MSK) and an extended MSK (EMSK). The MSK is used for access control enforcement,
    whereas the purpose of EMSK is to be defined. Several proposals for the use of
    the EMSK have been made, among them are support for efficient re-authentication
    of the EAP peer as it moves from one authenticator to another, bootstrapping preshared
    keys, visited domain key management. In this document, we explore the various
    proposed uses of the EMSK key hierarchy and the design considerations in specifying
    the EMSK key hierarchy.</p>"
