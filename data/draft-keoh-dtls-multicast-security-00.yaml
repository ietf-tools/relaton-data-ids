abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building control
    systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect with each other, forming
    low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). The CoAP/6LoWPAN standards are emerging as
    the de-facto protocols in this area for resource-constrained devices. Both multicast
    and security are key needs in these networks. This draft presents a method for
    securing multicast communication in LLNs based on the DTLS which is already present
    in CoAP devices. This draft deals with the adaptation of the DTLS record layer
    to protect multicast group communication, assuming that all member devices already
    have a group key in their own possession. The DTLS record layer implementation
    is used to encrypt a multicast message and to provide message authentication using
    the group key before sending the message via IP multicast to the group.</p>"
