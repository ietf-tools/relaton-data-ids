abstract:
- content: "<p>In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually provide
    general and limited security protection service for users during access (e.g.
    AKA in 3G/4G network). Now, with the development of network virtualization technology
    and data center, physical network devices can be replaced by network function
    softwares which are running on virtual machines and the network function can be
    flexible and elastic. Operators can provide users with more security services.
    So this interfaces between operator's network and users are highly desired. These
    interfaces will be used to request/achieve (Virtual) Network Security Functions
    from operator's network. This draft describes use cases for using the interface
    in operator's network environment.</p>"
