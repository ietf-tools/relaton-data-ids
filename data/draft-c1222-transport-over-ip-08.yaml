abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC provides a framework for transporting ANSI C12.22/IEEE 1703/MC12.22
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) Application Layer Messages on an IP network.
    This document is not an official submission on behalf of the ANSI C12.19 and C12.22
    working groups. It was created by participants in those groups, building on knowledge
    of several proprietary C12.22- over-IP implementations. The content of this document
    is an expression of a consensus aggregation of those implementations. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
