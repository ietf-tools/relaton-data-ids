abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses events occurring in a telephony network that
    could be useful for call related services created in an Internet environment.
    It also shows one possible implementation of a SPIRITS protocol based on Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2]. The SPIRITS working group has not yet done any
    protocol decisions, so this draft is written for informative purpose showing that
    the introduction of virtual SIP user agents (SIP UAs) in a SPIRITS client makes
    it possible to realize the services described in the pre-spirits implementations
    document [3].</p>"
