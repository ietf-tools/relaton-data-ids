abstract:
- content: "<p>Some implementations of Mobile IP home agents have been observed to
    supply zero authentication data when sending a Registration Reply to the mobile
    node that contains rejection code 131 (Mobile Node Failed Authentication). This
    creates a vulnerability whereby a mobile node could be denied service from its
    home agent, and thus lose connectivity to the Internet even though mobile node
    and home agent were otherwise functioning properly.</p>"
