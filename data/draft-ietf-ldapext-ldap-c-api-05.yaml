abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a C language application program interface (API)
    to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This document replaces the
    previous definition of this API, defined in RFC 1823, updating it to include support
    for features found in version 3 of the LDAP protocol. New extended operation functions
    were added to support LDAPv3 features such as controls. In addition, other LDAP
    API changes were made to support information hiding and thread safety. The C LDAP
    API is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It defines compatible synchronous
    and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit a wide variety of applications. This
    document gives a brief overview of the LDAP model, then an overview of how the
    API is used by an applica- tion program to obtain LDAP information. The API calls
    are described in detail, followed by appendices that provide example code demonstrating
    use of the API, the namespace consumed by the API, a summary of require- ments
    for API extensions, known incompatibilities with RFC 1823, and a list of changes
    made since the last revision of this document.</p>"
