abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an applicability analysis on the use of Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to satisfy the
    requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode. L1VPNs
    provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over layer 1 networks. The
    operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where
    the Enhanced Mode of operation features exchange of routing information between
    the layer 1 network and the customer domain. In addition, this document identifies
    areas where additional protocol extensions or procedures are needed to satisfy
    the requirements of the L1VPN Enhanced Mode, and provides guidelines for potential
    extensions.</p>"
