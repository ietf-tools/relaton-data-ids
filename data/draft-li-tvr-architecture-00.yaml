abstract:
- content: "<p>Satellite networks present some interesting challenges for packet networking.
    The entire topology is continually in motion, with links that are far less reliable
    than what is common in terrestrial networks. Some changes to link connectivity
    can be anticipated due to orbital mechanics. This document proposes a routing
    architecture for satellite networks based on existing routing protocols and mechanisms,
    enhanced with scheduled link connectivity change information. This document proposes
    no protocol changes.</p>"
