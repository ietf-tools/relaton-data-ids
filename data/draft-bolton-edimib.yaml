abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a MIB for use with managing EDI systems. The term
    EDI systems includes large scale systems providing translator functions such as
    the US federal government's Electronic Commerce Processing Node (ECPN) for which
    this MIB was specifically designed, as well as smaller Value Added Network (VAN)
    systems. Because of the desire for scalability variable names are deliberately
    vague, so that a channel may represent a single user, a group of users that use
    the same network entry point or that are defined by the implementor as functionally
    similar, or (as in the case of the ECPN) a connection to a third party network.
    This MIB does not address management of client systems which connect to the various
    EDI systems.</p>"
