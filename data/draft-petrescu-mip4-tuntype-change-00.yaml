abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol Mobile IPv4 may use a number of encapsulation methods
    between an MN and its HA. The UDP method is used to perform NAT Traversal (if
    a NAT sits between MN and HA) whereas IP-in-IP method may be used if there is
    no NAT (CoA is a publicly routable address). Although these methods are individually
    specified, a mechanism for changing between one to another is not, which may lead
    to incoherent implementations. This draft briefly presents the scenario of a MN
    performing a handover between private space (NAT) and public space (non-NAT),
    the implementation problem (type of tunnel can not be changed dynamically), and
    some potential solutions as textual modifications, better implementations, or
    protocol extensions.</p>"
