abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes TCP performance problems that arise because
    of asymmetric effects. These problems arise in several access networks, including
    bandwidth-asymmetric networks and packet radio subnetworks, for different underlying
    reasons. However, the end result on TCP performance is the same in both cases:
    performance often degrades significantly because of imperfection and variability
    in the ACK feedback from the receiver to the sender. The document details several
    mitigations to these effects, which have either been proposed or evaluated in
    the literature, or are currently deployed in networks. These solutions use a combination
    of local link- layer techniques, subnetwork, and end-to-end mechanisms, consisting
    of: (i) techniques to manage the channel used for the upstream bottleneck link
    carrying the ACKs, typically using header compression or reducing the frequency
    of TCP ACKs, (ii) techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the
    TCP sender's acknowledgment-triggered self- clocking and (iii) techniques to schedule
    the data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve performance in the
    presence of two-way traffic. Each technique is described, together with known
    issues, and recommendations for use. A summary of the recommendations is provided
    at the end of the document. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
