abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a standardized
    method for identifying users. This document defines the syntax for the Network
    Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the client during, for
    instance, PPP and wireless LAN authentication. 'Roaming' may be loosely defined
    as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet service providers (ISPs), while
    maintaining a formal, customer-vendor relationship with only one. Examples of
    where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP 'confederations' and
    ISP-provided corporate network access support. This document is a revised version
    of RFC 2486 which originally defined NAIs. Enhancements include international
    character set and privacy support, as well as a number of corrections to the original
    RFC.</p>"
