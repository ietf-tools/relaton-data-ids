abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an extension to the SDP Capability Negotiation
    framework for the setup of asymmetric sessions. One example of an asymmetric session
    is a conversational video session between a handset with a small screen (high-resolution
    camera) and a home- entertainment set-top box connected to a wide-screen TV. Another
    example is tightly coupled conferences with different number of in and outgoing
    streams for each client.</p>"
