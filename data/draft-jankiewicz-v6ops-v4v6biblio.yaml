abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet is in the early stages of what may be a protracted period
    of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6. Network operators are challenged with the task
    of activating IPv6 without negative impact on operating IPv4 networks and their
    customers. This draft is an informational "annotated bibliography" compiled to
    help in the analysis and development of basic guidelines and recommendations for
    network operators. The goal of this document is to survey the current state of
    RFCs, Internet-Drafts and external reference materials that define the use cases,
    problem statements, protocols, transition mechanisms and coexistence tools that
    will be of interest to a network operator planning to turn on IPv6.</p>
