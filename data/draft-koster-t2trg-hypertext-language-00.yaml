abstract:
- content: "<p>Interoperability for connected things is improving in a number of important
    areas, converging around Internet Protocol (IP) and internet design patterns.
    Hypermedia is becoming more common with web linking becoming part of a number
    of important standards. However, there is still an interoperability gap in how
    application semantics are defined and used. Many organizations and industry alliances
    are defining vocabulary and taxonomy for application domains, independent of each
    other. These vocabularies are often bound to particular conceptual models, and
    are often semantically incompatible with each other. While it may be possible
    to adapt protocols and convert representations, it is difficult to develop a common
    application framework that works across ecosystems and domains. This article proposes
    a method that can be reused across application domains and across ecosystems,
    to define a shared conceptual model and common vocabulary. A public resource is
    described which does for connected things what schema.org does for web commerce,
    to provide a community driven vocabulary and simple ontology that enables web
    scale interoperability between applications and connected things.</p>"
