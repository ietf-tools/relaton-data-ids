abstract:
- content: "<p>This document sets out some goals beyond those in 'Terminology and
    Goals for Internet Fax' [4] for a service to perform fax and high quality document
    transmission across the Internet. Internet fax [1,2] defines a way to send fax
    data over the Internet using e-mail. But there is a clear desire for an application
    that more closely emulates the operational characteristics of traditional fax
    [3].</p>"
