abstract:
- content: "<p>While the current GMPLS WSON formalism can deal with many types of
    wavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend this control plane to
    include other common optical or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches,
    regenerators, and wavelength converters. This document provides a WSON signal
    definition and characterization based on ITU-T interface and signal class standards
    and describes the signal compatibility constraints of this extended set of network
    elements. The signal characterization and network element compatibility constraints
    enable GMPLS routing and signaling to control these devices and PCE to compute
    optical light-paths subject to signal compatibility attributes.</p>"
