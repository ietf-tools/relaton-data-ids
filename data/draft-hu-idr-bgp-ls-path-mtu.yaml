abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Link State (BGP-LS) describes a mechanism by which link-state and
    TE information can be collected from networks and shared with external components
    using the BGP routing protocol. The centralized controller (PCE/SDN) completes
    the service path calculation based on the information transmitted by the BGP-LS
    and delivers the result to the Path Computation Client (PCC) through the PCEP
    protocol. Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm, which can
    be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change on the forwarding
    plane and applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header,
    called SRH. The SR uses the IGP protocol as the control protocol. Compared to
    the MPLS tunneling technology, the SR does not require signaling. Therefore, the
    SR does not support the negotiation of the Path MTU. Since Multiple labels or
    SRv6 SIDs are pushed in the packets, it is more likely that the MTU exceeds the
    limit in the SR tunneling technology. This document specify the extension to BGP
    Link State (BGP-LS) to carry maximum transmission unit (MTU) messages. The PCE/SDN
    calculates the Path MTU while completing the service path calculation based on
    the information transmitted by the BGP-LS.</p>"
