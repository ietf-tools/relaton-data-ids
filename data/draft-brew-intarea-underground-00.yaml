abstract:
- content: "<p>When users are at known undergroudn locations, such as tube stations
    they often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from the satellites required
    cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggests providing GPS locations over WiFI
    using remote IP detection for a server to respond with the correct name of clients
    location and the clients GPS location. Extending this to those without WifI access
    the standard goes one stage further, by offering a hidden wifi network with a
    standard name, such as.location. The principle being that mobile devices can look
    for this network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected. It is hoped that
    this will allow those using mapping services to know where they are when travelling
    on underground trains etc.</p>"
