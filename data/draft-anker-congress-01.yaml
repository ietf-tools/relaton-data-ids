abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an IP Multicast Shortcut Service (IMSS) over a
    large ATM cloud. The service enables cut-through routing between routers serving
    different Logical IP Subnets (LISs). The presented solution is complementary to
    MARS [2], adopted as the IETF standard solution for IP multicast over ATM. IMSS
    consists of two orthogonal components: CONnection-oriented Group address RESolution
    Service (CONGRESS) and IP multicast SErvice for Non-broadcast Access Networking
    TEchnology (IP-SENATE). An IP class D address is resolved into a set of addresses
    of multicast routers that should receive the multicast traffic targeted to this
    class D address. This task is accomplished using CONGRESS. The cut-through routing
    decisions and actual data transmission are performed by IP- SENATE. IMSS preserves
    the classical LIS model [8]. The scope of IMSS is to facilitate inter-LIS cut-through
    routing, while MARS provides tools for the intra-LIS IP multicast.</p>"
