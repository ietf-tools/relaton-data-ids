abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies a modification to RFC 3168 to allow TCP SYN/ACK
    packets to be ECN-Capable. For TCP, RFC 3168 only specified setting an ECN-Capable
    codepoint on data packets, and not on SYN and SYN/ACK packets. However, because
    of the high cost to the TCP transfer of having a SYN/ACK packet dropped, with
    the resulting retransmit timeout, this document is specifying the use of ECN for
    the SYN/ACK packet itself, when sent in response to a SYN packet with the two
    ECN flags set in the TCP header, indicating a willingness to use ECN. Setting
    TCP SYN/ACK packets as ECN-Capable can be of great benefit to the TCP connection,
    avoiding the severe penalty of a retransmit timeout for a connection that has
    not yet started placing a load on the network. The sender of the SYN/ACK packet
    must respond to an ECN mark by reducing its initial congestion window from two,
    three, or four segments to one segment, reducing the subsequent load from that
    connection on the network.</p>"
