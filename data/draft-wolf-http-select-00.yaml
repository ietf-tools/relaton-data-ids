abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet services need asynchronous notifications. At the same
    time there is an increasing number of protocols which use HTTP or HTTP-alike request-response
    transactions. This document proposes an extension to application protocols which
    enables asynchronous notifications from server to client through client initiated
    request-response transactions. The extension applies the Unix select() pattern
    to TCP connections of HTTP-alike protocols. Hence it is called HTTP-SELECT.</p>"
