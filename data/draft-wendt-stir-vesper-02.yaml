abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the STIR architecture by defining a Personal Assertion
    Token (PASSporT) with a type of "vesper" (VErifiable Sti PERsona) and specifies
    the use of PASSporTs as a JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT)
    for representing verifiable claims related to a persona (a person or business
    entity) associated with a Secure Telephone Identity (STI). This set of extensible
    claims can include verifiable information such as the assignment of a telephone
    number, the output of a Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) type
    of vetting process, Rich Call Data (RCD) or claims of consent provided to the
    telephone number holder. The architecture, dependencies, and process flow of Vesper
    includes logical roles that represent certain responsibilities for establishing
    a secure telephone identity. These roles represent the basis for trusted relationships
    to information that is being claimed and who is validating and taking responsibility
    for the accuracy of that information. These roles begin with a Subject Entity
    (SE) that is the end entity that intended to be represented by the STI telephone
    number identifier. A Vetting Claim Agent (VCA) establishes the Subject Entity
    as a vetted entity after performing the initial vetting and existence as a entity
    that fulfills the criteria and policies of the ecosystem to be associated with
    an STI. A Notary Agent (NA) is a neutral role that maintains a graph of relationships
    among all roles, claims, and identities, but importantly, for protecting privacy,
    doesn't hold any claim information other than the recording of claim events to
    the STI telephone number. The NA records these claim event transactions with a
    corresponding transparency log that generates verifiable receipts to "notarize"
    the recording of these relationships and claims being established. Privacy is
    enabled in this Notary role because the submitters have the option of submitting
    hashes of claims to protect information, or may usefully want to publicly declare
    their association to a claim to allow the public monitoring to avoid duplicate,
    mistaken or negligent claims which can be identified before illegitimate usage
    in the eco- system can occur. Other Claim Agents are defined producing claims
    in the form of SD-JWT + receipts from the NA. There are multiple claim agent types
    with corresponding extensible claim definitions with key value pairs that can
    be required or optionally included. These SD- JWT + receipt claim objects are
    then collected by the SE into a digital wallet that it can then use for selective
    disclosure presentation and incorporate into a "vesper" PASSporT signed by the
    a delegate certificate associated with STI telephone number to validate the SE
    is indeed the authorized holder of the telephone number and vesper token at the
    time the presentation is required and ties the SE to the STIR eco-system a STIR
    certificates policy for use in communications.</p>
