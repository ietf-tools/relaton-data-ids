abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational memo points out advantages of using three drop precedences
    (compared to two) in the Assured Forwarding (AF) Per- Hop-Behavior (PHB) when
    the traffic is composed of responsive TCP and non responsive UDP traffic. Our
    simulation results show that while two drop precedences can, in some cases, guarantee
    to an aggregate consisting of TCP traffic the full utilization of the reserved
    bandwidth, they cannot allow to access the unreserved bandwidth in the presence
    of high bit rate unresponsive UDP traffic. When three drop precedences are appropriately
    used TCP aggregates can fully use the minimum reserved bandwidth and share the
    unreserved one.</p>"
