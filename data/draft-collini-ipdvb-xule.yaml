abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension format for the Ultra-Lightweight
    Encapsulation (ULE) protocol. The proposed method allows ULE to carry both optional
    (with an explicit extension length) and mandatory (with an implicit extension
    length) header information to assist in network/Receiver processing of a SNDU.
    These functions modify the behaviour of ULE, and introduce header processing operations
    that will simplify the addition of new headers. This Internet Draft is presented
    as a separate document to allow ipdvb working group discussion of the design trade-offs
    involved. If accepted, the techniques will be incorporated within a future revision
    of ULE.</p>"
