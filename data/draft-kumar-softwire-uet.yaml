abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for encapsulatation of tunneled packets
    within UDP in order to provide per-flow entropy for load- balancing. The method
    is targeted for use with softwire mesh deployments that include routers which
    have support for load- balancing based on UDP ports and not fields in L2TPv3 or
    GRE.</p>"
