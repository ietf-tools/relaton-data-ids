abstract:
- content: "<p>This document suggests a method of encoding generic binary files so
    that they can be transmitted as MIME attachments between systems that use RFC
    1652-compliant message transfer agents (such as Sendmail 8.7 (now in beta)). This
    encoding method has a size increase of &lt; 2% in the vast majority of cases,
    whereas base-64 encoding increases file size by ~33%. This encoding method would
    use a new MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding type: 'binary-to-8bit-encoding'. Discussion
    and suggestions for improvement are requested.</p>"
