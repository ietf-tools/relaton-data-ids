abstract:
- content: "<p>This document formalizes a profile and a framework for the use of delegate
    certificates and authority tokens to strengthen the association between telephone
    number assignments and the entities that have the authoritative right to use them.
    It defines a model in which the TNAuthList Authority Token serves as a trusted
    representation of telephone number assignment and right-to-use (RTU), anchored
    by a Notary Agent that logs these associations through verifiable transparency
    mechanisms. The framework also extends the use of authority tokens to support
    other PASSporT claims like Rich Call Data (RCD) by defining a role for JWTClaimConstraints
    Authority Tokens. These tokens are issued by authoritative or recognized and vetted
    claim agents within the ecosystem to assert information associated with the entity
    assigned a telephone number. The Notary Agent plays a critical role in recording
    these claims and their provenance, enhancing transparency and accountability.
    Delegate certificates encapsulate and incorporate both the telephone number and
    associated information validated via authority tokens to the certification authority
    issuing them, binding them to the authenticated telephone number of the calling
    party. These certificates are published to a certificate transparency log, enabling
    relying parties to independently verify the integrity and legitimacy of number
    use and related claims. The VESPER (Verifiable STI PERsona) approach utilizes
    STIR protocols and the ACME authority token to formalizing a verifiable, auditable,
    and privacy-conscious foundation for associating telephone numbers with vetted
    entities and validated assertion of associated metadata.</p>"
