abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the OPAQUE protocol, a secure asymmetric password
    authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual authentication in a client-server
    setting without any reliance on PKI. OPAQUE is the first PKI-free aPAKE to accommodate
    secret salt and therefore is the first to be secure against pre-computation attacks
    upon server compromise. In contrast, prior aPAKE protocols did not use salt and
    if they did, the salt was transmitted in the clear from server to user allowing
    for the building of targeted pre- computed dictionaries. OPAQUE security has been
    proven by Jarecki et al. (Eurocrypt 2018) in a strong and universally composable
    formal model of aPAKE security. In addition, the protocol provides forward secrecy
    and the ability to hide the password from the server even during password registration.
    Strong security, good performance and an array of additional features make OPAQUE
    a natural candidate for practical use and for adoption as a standard. To this
    end, this draft presents several optimized instantiations of OPAQUE and ways of
    integrating OPAQUE with TLS.</p>"
