abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges provide the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple
    physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. The design allows for zero configuration
    of switches within a campus, optimal pair-wise routing, safe forwarding even during
    periods of temporary loops, and the ability to cut down on ARP/ND traffic. The
    design also supports VLANs, and allows forwarding tables to be based on RBridge
    destinations (rather than endnode destinations), which allows internal routing
    tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional bridge systems.</p>"
