abstract:
- content: '<p>This document introduces the "Packet Too Big"-"Packet Too Small" Internet
    Control Message Protocol (ICMP) based attack against IPsec gateways. We explain
    how an attacker having eavesdropping and packet injection capabilities, from the
    unsecure network where he only sees encrypted packets, can force a gateway to
    reduce the Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) of an IPsec tunnel to the minimum,
    which can trigger severe issues for the hosts behind this gateway: with a Linux
    host, depending on the PMTU discovery algorithm in use (i.e., PMTUd versus PLPMTUd)
    and protocol (TCP versus UDP), the attack either creates a Denial of Service or
    major performance penalties. This attack highlights two fundamental problems,
    namely: (1) the impossibility to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate ICMP
    packets coming from the untrusted network, and (2) the contradictions in the way
    Path MTU is managed by some end hosts when this Path MTU is below the minimum
    packet size any link should support because of the IPsec encapsulation.</p>'
