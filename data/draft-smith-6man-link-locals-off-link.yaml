abstract:
- content: <p>Certain link-layers limit reachability for one set of nodes, while permitting
    full reachability for a different set of nodes, for unicast, multicast and broadcast
    traffic. If IPv6 hosts are members of the first set of nodes, and IPv6 routers
    are members of the second, Link-Local traffic between IPv6 hosts will fail, due
    to the default on-link assumption for Link-Local destinations. This memo describes
    the use of a Link-Local Prefix Information Option to indicate to these hosts that
    Link-Local destinations are "off-link", and are reachable via their default router(s).</p>
