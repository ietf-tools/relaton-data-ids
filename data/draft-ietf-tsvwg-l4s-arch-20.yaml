abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet
    applications to achieve low queuing latency, low congestion loss, and scalable
    throughput control. L4S is based on the insight that the root cause of queuing
    delay is in the capacity-seeking congestion controllers of senders, not in the
    queue itself. With the L4S architecture, all Internet applications could (but
    do not have to) transition away from congestion control algorithms that cause
    substantial queuing delay and instead adopt a new class of congestion controls
    that can seek capacity with very little queuing. These are aided by a modified
    form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) from the network. With this new
    architecture, applications can have both low latency and high throughput. The
    architecture primarily concerns incremental deployment. It defines mechanisms
    that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls to coexist with 'Classic'
    congestion controls in a shared network. The aim is for L4S latency and throughput
    to be usually much better (and rarely worse) while typically not impacting Classic
    performance.</p>"
