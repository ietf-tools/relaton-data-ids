abstract:
- content: "<p>In the PIM Sparse Mode standard there is an Address List Hello option
    used to list secondary addresses of an interface. Usually the addresses would
    be of the same address family as the primary address. In this document we provide
    a use case for listing secondary addresses that are from a different family. In
    particular, Multi- Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) has support for distributing next-hop
    information for multiple address families using one AFI/SAFI Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI). When using this combined with PIM, the Address List Hello
    option can be used to determine which PIM neighbor to use as RPF neighbor.</p>"
