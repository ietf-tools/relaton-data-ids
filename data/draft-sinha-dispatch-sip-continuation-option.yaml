abstract:
- content: <p>Before placing a call, it is quite often useful for the Caller to know
    whether a Callee is in favorable state to receive a call or not. This document
    defines an optional tag "continue" and a header "Continue" to address the purpose.
    The "Continue" header field is to confirm the session continuity with the Callee
    from the Caller after an option for session continuity is placed by the Callee
    based on the unfavorable state of the Callee. This functionality is needed to
    resolve the unwillingness of the Callee to receive any call. An option is given
    to the Callee by the Service Provider or by the Handset Manufacturer or by the
    Carrier to establish this requirement.</p>
