abstract:
- content: "<p>Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers and
    user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to a particular
    mailing list. With the advent of list management headers, it has become even more
    important to provide a unique identifier for a mailing list regardless of the
    particular host that serves as the list processor at any given time. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
