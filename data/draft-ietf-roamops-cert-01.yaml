abstract:
- content: "<p>To date, roaming implementations have been based on the concept of
    proxy chaining, where packets are routed between the NAS and home server through
    a series of proxies. While commonly used, proxy chaining introduces difficult
    security problems that have prevented its implementation on a wide scale. This
    document describes a new approach to roaming based on certificates that eliminates
    the need for proxy chaining. As described, this approach provides improved security
    as well as scalability.</p>"
