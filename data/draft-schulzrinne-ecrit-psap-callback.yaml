abstract:
- content: "<p>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated
    by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible that the
    call-taker feels the need for further communication or for a clarification. For
    example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call-taker having
    sufficient information about the current situation of a wounded person. A call-taker
    may trigger a callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information
    provided with the initial emergency call. This callback could, under certain circumstances,
    then be treated like any other call and as a consequence, it may get blocked by
    authorization policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine. The IETF
    emergency services architecture addresses callbacks in a limited fashion and thereby
    covers a couple of scenarios. This document discusses some shortcomings and raises
    the question whether additional solution techniques are needed.</p>"
