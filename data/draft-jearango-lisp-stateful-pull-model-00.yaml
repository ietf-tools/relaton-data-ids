abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a stateful pull model for LISP where ITRs can
    subscribe with the mapping system to be notified whenever a particular EID mapping
    changes. The model uses a publish/subscribe mechanism that supports overlapping
    EID registrations without having to notify the ITR about every single prefix covered
    by a particular subscription. The pull model is stateful in the sense that it
    requires that the mapping system maintain subscription state.</p>"
