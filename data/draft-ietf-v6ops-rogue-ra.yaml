abstract:
- content: "<p>When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured
    to send IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey information to nodes that enable
    them to autoconfigure on the network. This information includes the implied default
    router address taken from the observed source address of the RA message, as well
    as on-link prefix information. However, unintended misconfigurations by users
    or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may lead to bogus
    RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems for hosts on the
    network. In this document, we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be
    observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem. We focus on
    the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text. The goal of this text is to be
    Informational, and as such to present a framework around which solutions can be
    proposed and discussed. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
