abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 6724 based on operational experience gained
    since its publication over ten years ago. In particular it updates the precedence
    of Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) in the default address selection policy table,
    which as originally defined by RFC 6724 has lower precedence than legacy IPv4
    addressing. The update places both IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs) and ULAs
    ahead of all IPv4 addresses on the policy table to better suit operational deployment
    and management of ULAs in production. In updating the RFC 6724 default policy
    table, this document also demotes the preference for 6to4 addresses. These changes
    to default behavior improve supportability of common use cases such as, but not
    limited to, automatic / unmanaged scenarios. It is recognized that some less common
    deployment scenarios may require explicit configuration or custom changes to achieve
    desired operational parameters.</p>"
