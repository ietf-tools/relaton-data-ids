abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Remote APDU Call Protocol Secure (RACS)
    protocol, dedicated to Grid of Secure Elements (GoSE). These servers host Secure
    Elements (SE), i.e. tamper resistant chips offering secure storage and cryptographic
    resources. Secure Elements are microcontrollers whose chip area is about 25mm2;
    they deliver trusted computing services in constrained environments. RACS supports
    commands for GoSE inventory and data exchange with secure elements. It is designed
    according to the representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. RACS resources
    are identified by dedicated URIs. An HTTP interface is also supported.</p>"
