abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working
    group document to IESG review that can be used for cases when a working group
    chair believes that there is open-source running code that implements a working
    group Internet-Draft. The basic idea is to do all of working group last call,
    IETF last call and area director review during the same two week period, and to
    impose a higher barrier for comments that might block progress. The motivation
    is to offer a reward for running code, consistent with the IETF's overall philosophy
    of running code and rough consensus. This version is an initial draft solely proposed
    by the author (and not the IESG) to attempt to ascertain if there is enough interest
    in this to warrant trying out the idea as an RFC 3933 process experiment.</p>"
