abstract:
- content: "<p>This document includes an analysis of multiple interfaces in a host
    and a description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with the respect of the
    relationship between layer 2 connection and layer 3 connection. The current TCP/IP
    mechanism and networking methods are suitable for single network interface. When
    a host has multiple interfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods
    cannot directly be used for them. A network interface establishes layer 2 connection
    to layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and it does not mean providing proper
    layer 3 connection. So every active network interfaces do not guarantee successful
    IP layer operations. In this document, we describe some problems for a host which
    has multiple interfaces as an aspect of host's operations and usage scenarios
    of multiple interfaces in a host.</p>"
