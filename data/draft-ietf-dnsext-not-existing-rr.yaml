abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft present an alternative to NXT records, used to achieve authenticated
    denial of existence of a domain name, class and type. Problems with NXT records,
    as specified in RFC 2535, are identified. One solution, the NO record, is presented.
    The NO record differ from the NXT record by using a cryptographic hash value instead
    of the domain name. This prevent an adversery from collecting information by 'chaining'
    through a zone. It also remove delegation point concerns in NXT records. The document
    also describe hash truncation and record merging that reduces storage/network
    load.</p>"
