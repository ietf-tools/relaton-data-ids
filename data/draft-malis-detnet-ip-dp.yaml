abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Deterministic Networking data plane operation
    over an IP network. It is primarily aimed at IPv4, but would work with IPv6 as
    well if a unified solution is desired. This document is a derivative work from
    draft-ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01, to augment or replace the text currently contained
    in section 5.2.2. Whether this is published as a stand-alone text, or serves as
    a focal point to refine the IP design and subsequently remerged with draft- ietf-detnet-dp-sol-01
    is a matter for the DETNET WG.</p>"
