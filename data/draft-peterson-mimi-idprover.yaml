abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a means for a third-party service to prove
    and attest the association of a communications platform with a particular user's
    telephone number. This capability supports secure enrollment for users of messaging
    platforms or similar real-time communication applications, for cases where users
    assert telephone numbers as communication identifiers, and interoperating platforms
    need to verify that identifiers are being properly attested. This general approach
    can potentially work with other forms of Service Independent Identifiers (SIIs)
    in the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) framework.</p>"
