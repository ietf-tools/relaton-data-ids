abstract:
- content: <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748, enables
    extensible network access authentication. This document specifies the EAP key
    hierarchy and provides a framework for the transport and usage of keying material
    and parameters generated by EAP authentication algorithms, known as "methods".
    It also provides a detailed system-level security analysis, describing the conditions
    under which the key management guidelines described in RFC 4962 can be satisfied.
