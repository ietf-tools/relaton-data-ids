abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers upgrade their brown field or green
    field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol BGP (MP- BGP)now plays
    an important role in the transition of their Provider (P) core network as well
    as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators must be able to
    continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge networks are IPv6-Only.
    This document details an important External BGP (eBGP) PE-CE Edge and Inter-AS
    IPv6-Only peering design that leverages the MP-BGP capability exchange by using
    IPv6 peering as pure transport, allowing both IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be
    carried over the same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session. The design change
    provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate
    IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today. With this design change from a control
    plane perspective a single IPv6 is required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates
    and from a data plane forwarindg perspective an IPv6 address need only be configured
    on the PE and CE interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding. This document
    provides a much needed solution for Internet Exchange Point (IXP) that are facing
    IPv4 address depletion at large peering points. With this design, IXP can now
    deploy PE-CE IPv6-Only eBGP Edge or Inter-AS peering design to eliminate IPv4
    provisioning at the Edge. This core and edge IPv6-Only peering design paradigm
    change can apply to any eBGP peering, public internet or private, which can be
    either Core networks, Data Center networks, Access networks or can be any eBGP
    peering scenario. This document provides vendor specific test cases for the IPv6-Only
    peering design as well as test results for the five major vendors stakeholders
    in the routing and switching indusrty, Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei.
    With the test results provided for the IPv6-Only Edge peering design, the goal
    is that all other vendors around the world that have not been tested will begin
    to adopt and implement this new Best Current Practice for eBGP IPv6-Only Edge
    peering. As this issue with IXP IPv4 address depletion is a critical issue around
    the world, it is imperative for an immediate solution that can be implemented
    quickly. This Best Current Practice IPv6-only eBGP peering design specification
    will help proliferate IPv6-Only deployments at the eBGP Edge network peering points
    to starting immediately at a minimum with operators around the world using Cisco,
    Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei. As other vendors start to implement this Best
    Current Practice, the IXP IPv4 address depletion gap will eventually be eliminated.</p>"
