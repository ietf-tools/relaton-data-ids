abstract:
- content: "<p>According to RFC7908 [RFC7908], Route leaks refer to the case that
    the delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected range. For many
    current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are
    focusing on finding ways to prevent the happening of BGP [RFC4271] route leaks.
    However, the real-time route leak detection if any occurs is important as well,
    and serves as the basis for leak mitigation. This document extends the BGP Monitoring
    Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to provide a routing security scheme suitable for ISPs
    to detect BGP route leaks at the prefix level.</p>"
