abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a proposal for a BGP Version 5 (BGP5) which
    has the ability to carry routing information for a variety of network protocols.
    The proposed BGP modifications are intended to be simple enough to be easily added
    to the existing BGP implementations and, at the same time, provide for a longer
    than 16-bit AS number space. This document only describes BGP5 support for IPv4
    and IPv6 networks.</p>"
