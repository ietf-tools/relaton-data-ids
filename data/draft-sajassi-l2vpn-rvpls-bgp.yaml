abstract:
- content: '<p>VPLS, as currently defined, has challenges pertaining to the areas
    of redundancy and multicast optimization. In particular, multi- homing with all-active
    forwarding cannot be supported and there''s no known solution to date for leveraging
    MP2MP MDTs for optimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames. This document
    defines an evolution of the current VPLS solution, referred to as Routed VPLS
    (R-VPLS), to address these shortcomings. In addition, this solution offers several
    benefits over current VPLS such as: ease of provisioning, per-flow load-balancing
    of traffic from/to multi-homed sites, optimum traffic forwarding to PEs with both
    single-homed and multi-homed sites, support for flexible multi-homing groups and
    fast convergence upon failures. Conventions The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119</p>'
