abstract:
- content: "<p>The operation of optical networks requires information on the physical
    characterization of optical network elements, subsystems, devices, and cabling.
    These physical characteristics may be important to consider when using a GMPLS
    control plane to support path setup and maintenance. This document discusses how
    the definition and characterization of optical fiber, devices, subsystems, and
    network elements contained in various ITU-T recommendations can be combined with
    GMPLS control plane protocols and mechanisms to support Impairment Aware Routing
    and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in optical networks.</p>"
