abstract:
- content: <p>This document captures the rationale for the changes introduced in RFC
    8714, "Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust". At
    the time RFC 8714 was published, the changes to the IETF Administrative Support
    Activity, Version 2.0 (IASA 2.0) had an impact on the IETF Trust because members
    of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), which was being phased
    out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. This document provides background
    on the past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding
    documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale
    for the update.</p>
