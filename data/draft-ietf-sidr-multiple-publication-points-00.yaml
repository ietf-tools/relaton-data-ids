abstract:
- content: <p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) depends on Relying Parties
    (RP) ability to access its Trust Anchors' certificate specified in the different
    "Trust Anchor Locator (TAL)" files and the Repository Objects located at the Certificate
    Authorities (CA) repositories hosted in its respective publication point. This
    document updates [RFC6490] by allowing multiple URI associated to a single public
    key in a TAL file and introduces the concept of multiple repository publication
    point operators for every CA in the RPKI. This document provides also recommendation
    for the RP behavior when analyzing signed objects that include multiple publications
    points.</p>
