abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DetNet use-cases (applications) require guaranteed bounds on packet
    delay-variation, not just on latency. This document gives a methodology to derive
    guaranteed packet delay-variation bounds in DetNet and apply it to a number of
    proposed mechanisms. When the required packet delay-variations is very low, clock
    non-idealities affect the bounds, even in a synchronized DetNet networks. This
    document also gives a methodology to account for such an effect.</p>"
