abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been broadly demonstrated that user experience improvements
    for time-critical applications have not increased at the same pace as network
    throughput (i.e., the increased bandwidth does not result in a corresponding increase
    in the user experience). Optimizing network latency rather than throughput can
    lead to a significantly improved user experience for time-critical applications.
    Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) technology, introduced in
    RFC 9330, uses Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits by marking packets
    suffering potential congestion in the network. L4S operates as a congestion-control
    mechanism, using markers within the data packets to detect and promptly respond
    to congestion conditions. This feedback loop enables devices (e.g., endpoints
    such as client devices and server devices) to adjust data flow in real-time, preventing
    bottlenecks and ensuring smoother transmission. RFC 5129 describes a mechanism
    for supporting ECN in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) data plane. That
    mechanism is based on the codepoints that take part in the Traffic Class (TC)
    field and, thus, prevent the use of TC field for traffic differentiation. This
    document defines how ECN can be supported in the MPLS data plane using the MPLS
    Network Actions technology.</p>"
