abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a dynamic trust security architecture based
    on Distributed Micro Service Communication (DMSC) to address the security risks
    in the communication of microservices. The DMSC architecture, by leveraging content
    semantic routing and decentralized control, transforms the traditional host-centric
    communication mode into a service-centric paradigm. Although DMSC enhances scalability
    and flexibility, its distributed nature introduces risks. To cope with these risks,
    it is necessary to consider security solutions for distributed large-scale microservice
    communication and ensure the security of services while minimizing the impact
    on the communication architecture.</p>"
