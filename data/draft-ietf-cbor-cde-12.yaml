abstract:
- content: <p>CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in
    its Section 4.2, providing some flexibility for application specific decisions.
    To facilitate Deterministic Encoding to be offered as a selectable feature of
    generic encoders, the present document documents the Best Current Practice for
    CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE), which can be shared by a large set of
    applications with potentially diverging detailed requirements. It also defines
    the term "Basic Serialization", which stops short of the potentially more onerous
    requirements that make CDE fully deterministic, while employing most of its reductions
    of the variability needing to be handled by decoders.</p>
