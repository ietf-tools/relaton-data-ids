abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model and a
    RESTCONF server configuration data model. These data models enable configuration
    of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves, including which transports are
    supported, what ports the servers listen on, call-home parameters, client authentication,
    and related parameters. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft
    contains many placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values
    at the time of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that
    are needed. Please note that no other RFC Editor instructions are specified anywhere
    else in this document. This document contains references to other drafts in progress,
    both in the Normative References section, as well as in body text throughout.
    Please update the following references to reflect their final RFC assignments:
    o draft-ietf-netconf-restconf o draft-ietf-netconf-call-home o draft-ietf-rtgwg-yang-key-chain
    Artwork in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in progress.
    Please apply the following replacements: o "VVVV" --&gt; the assigned RFC value
    for this draft o "XXXX" --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-restconf
    o "YYYY" --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-call-home Artwork
    in this document contains placeholder values for ports pending IANA assignment
    from "draft-ietf-netconf-call-home". Please apply the following replacements:
    o "7777" --&gt; the assigned port value for "netconf-ch-ssh" o "8888" --&gt; the
    assigned port value for "netconf-ch-tls" o "9999" --&gt; the assigned port value
    for "restconf-ch-tls" Artwork in this document contains placeholder values for

    need to be removed. o The "listening-ssh-server" container listed at the end of
    the artwork in Section 4.2.3 needs to be removed. Please remove the ten lines
    starting with "container listening-ssh-server {" and ending with "}". o The "listening-tls-server"
    container listed at the end of the artwork in Section 4.3.3 needs to be removed.
