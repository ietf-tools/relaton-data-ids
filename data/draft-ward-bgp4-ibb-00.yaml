abstract:
- content: "<p>Many recent router architectures decouple the routing engine from the
    forwarding engine, so that packet forwarding can continue even if routing software
    is not active. The current definition of the BGP protocol does not support this.
    We propose a new variety of CEASE NOTIFICATION message (IBB) which indicates to
    a peer that the router sending the notification expects to be able to continue
    forwarding traffic for a certain period of time without an established BGP peering
    session. We also propose a new OPEN message (ICB) that if received during the
    HOLDTIME period, does not require conventional reestablishment of the BGP peering
    session. These capabilities are useful for orderly and non-intrusive routing software
    updates, operating system updates, AS number migration, redundancy and catastrophic
    event handling.</p>"
