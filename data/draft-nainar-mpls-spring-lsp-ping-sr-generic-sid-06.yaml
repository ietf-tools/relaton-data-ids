abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8402 introduces Segment Routing architecture that leverages source
    routing and tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to the Multi Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) data plane. A node steers a packet through a controlled
    set of instructions called segments, by prepending the packet with Segment Routing
    header. SR architecture defines different types of segments with different forwarding
    semantics associated. SR can be applied to the MPLS directly and to IPv6 dataplane
    using a new routing header. RFC8287 defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and
    Traceroute for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifier
    (SIDs) with an MPLS data plane. Various SIDs are proposed as part of SR architecture
    with different associated instructions that raises a need to come up with new
    Target FEC Stack Sub-TLV for each such SIDs. This document defines a new Target
    FEC Stack Sub-TLV that is used to validate the instruction associated with any
    SID.</p>"
