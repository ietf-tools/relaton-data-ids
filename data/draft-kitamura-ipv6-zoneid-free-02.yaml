abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes "Zone-ID Free" functions that make end users
    free from using zone identifiers (Zone-ID) for IPv6 link- local addresses. When
    users deal with IPv6 link-local addresses, it is thought that it is mandatory
    thing to specify accompanied Zone-IDs. For end users, however, it is troublesome
    and nuisance thing to do it. Because it is very hard for normal end users to find
    appropriate Zone-IDs for this purpose. From another viewpoint, the usage of IPv6
    link-local addresses accompanied with Zone-IDs is quite different from the traditional
    usage of global addresses. Therefore many problems related with Zone-ID are caused
    and new specifications are required to fix these problems. This document explores
    and describes how "Zone-ID Free" functions work and how end users are released
    from using Zone-IDs when they deal with IPv6 link-local addresses. The "Zone-ID
    Free" functions are upper compatible with the current usages of dealing with IPv6
    link-local addresses and harmless to the existing communications. In order to
    obtain appropriate Zone-ID information, a new technology "Zone-ID Learning" that
    issues multiple probes is introduced.</p>
