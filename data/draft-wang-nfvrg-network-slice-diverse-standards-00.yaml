- content: "<p>As one of the significant technology in 5G, there are diverse industry
    communities and standard organizations dedicated in a research of Network Slicing,
    such as IETF, 3GPP, GSMA, ETSI, etc.. These organizations and communities not
    only standardize network slicing architecture, management, requirements and so
    on, but also individually focus on specifying network slicing in their own ways,
    offering diverse specifications of it. Aiming at research on a overall review
    of network slicing standard, this document discuss diverse standards in various
    organizations and communities, furthermore, analyzing the emphasis and difference
    between them.</p>"
