abstract:
- content: <p>In order to generate a unique address, IPv6 nodes perform the Duplicate
    Address Detection (DAD) procedure. Payload packets can not be sent or received
    before this procedure is complete. In an environment where frequent movements
    are expected, this delay can be problematic. As the reduction or removal of the
    delay would be useful, an optimized version of DAD has been proposed. This document
    suggests the requirements for such "Optimized DAD" protocol as well as considerable
    solutions.</p>
