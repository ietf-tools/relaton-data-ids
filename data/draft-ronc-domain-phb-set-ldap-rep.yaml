abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain PHB Sets are defined in [PHBSET]. A Domain PHB set allows the
    network administrator to control and tune PHB parameters within its DS domain
    in an abstract form. This memo defines the mapping of the [PHBSET] information
    model classes to a directory that uses LDAPv3 as its access protocol. This memo
    fits into the overall framework for representing, deploying, and managing QoS
    policies being developed by the Policy Framework Working Group. The memo complements
    the framework built by the core policy schema [PCORE] and the QoS policy schema
    [PQoS].</p>"
