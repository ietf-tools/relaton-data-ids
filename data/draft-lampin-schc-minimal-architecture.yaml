abstract:
- content: "<p>This document investigates the requirements of a minimal architecture
    for the Static Context Header Compression (and fragmentation) protocol (SCHC).
    The intent is to identify the essential components their relationships and interfaces.
    To do so, the document considers scenarios of increasing complexity involving
    the use of SCHC, from a simple point-to-point communication to a more complex
    deployment involving multiple SCHC Instances communicating with each other. In
    this process, the authors hope to identify the essential components of a SCHC
    architecture and their relationships.</p>"
