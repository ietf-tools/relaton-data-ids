abstract:
- content: "<p>There are 3 major functions that must be performed to achieve multicast
    Label Switching. 1) Label Allocation, which requires each multicast Label Switching
    Router (LSR) to have a label value range that it uses. 2) Label Binding, using
    the labels allocated, a LSR must assign them to multicast routes. 3) Label Binding
    Distribution, after binding label values to routes, they must be distributed to
    other LSRs so they all forward on a common and consistent distribution tree. In
    this document we present how labels are allocated uniquely across multicast capable
    LSRs on a LAN and point-to-point IP subnets.</p>"
