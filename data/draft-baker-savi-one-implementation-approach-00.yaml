abstract:
- content: <p>This note is intended to flesh out a comment made on a mailing list.
    It describes one of many possible implementation approaches to SAVI systems, and
    is intended as much as anything to be an existence proof that there is at least
    one that would work. Requirements The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
