abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo refers to a metric for variation in delay of packets across
    Internet paths. The metric is based on the difference in the One-Way- Delay of
    selected packets. This difference in delay is called 'IP Packet Delay variation.'
    The metric is valid for measurements between two hosts both in the case that they
    have synchronized clocks and in the case that they are not synchronized. We discuss
    both in this draft.</p>"
