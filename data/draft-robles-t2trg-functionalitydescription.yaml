- content: "<p>This document defines firstly functionality levels for IoT devices
    that describe the device capabilities at the granularity of devices, objects and
    resources. It additionally presents a metric to measure the functional similarity
    between the manageable properties of any two IoT devices, called Functionality
    Distance (FD), which is defined as the indication of the extent to which one device
    can be substituted for the other.</p>"
