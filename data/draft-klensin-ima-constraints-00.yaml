abstract:
- content: "<p>The discussions of internationalized email addresses in the IETF have
    led to a number of stated requirements. This document identifies some of those
    requirements in the context of general issues of internationalization of Internet
    name spaces, demonstrates that the combination of all of the requirements that
    appear reasonable on first glance adds up to a null solution space, and then suggests
    a different model for proceeding.</p>"
