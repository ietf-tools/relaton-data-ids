abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as pieces
    of information or server processes, which are available in several equivalent
    replicas on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer
    file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
    (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several
    hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired resource. This
    memo proposes the Simple ALTO (H12) protocol.</p>"
