abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent LAN Service
    and Virtual Private Switched Network service, is a useful Service Provider offering.
    The service offers a Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (VPN); however, in the case
    of VPLS, the customers in the VPN are connected by a multipoint Ethernet LAN,
    in contrast to the usual Layer 2 VPNs, which are point-to-point in nature. This
    document describes the functions required to offer VPLS, a mechanism for signaling
    a VPLS, and rules for forwarding VPLS frames across a packet switched network.
