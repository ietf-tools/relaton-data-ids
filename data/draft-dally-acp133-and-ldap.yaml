abstract:
- content: "<p>In Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 133 [1], an X.500 directory
    user schema, called Common Content, is specified for the Allied Directory. In
    order to enable Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) access to the Allied
    Directory and to enable the general use by others of elements from the Common
    Content, this document specifies the encoding of the Common Content using the
    LDAP notation from Request for Comments (RFC) 2252 [2].</p>"
