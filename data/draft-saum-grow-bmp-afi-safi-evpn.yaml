abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines EVPN-specific BMP statistics types that extend
    the generic BMP RIB statistics defined in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-bgp- rib-stats.
    It includes counters for EVPN multihoming for both layer-2 and layer-3 (IP aliasing),
    dynamic IVRL, route-map application on routes, and EVPN route-type visibility
    for all route- types from 1 to 8. The Border Gateway Protocol Monitoring Protocol
    (BMP) provides a convenient interface for obtaining BGP-related data. This document
    extends BMP RIB statistics to include EVPN-specific counters and metrics, enabling
    enhanced visibility into EVPN route processing and behavior. This document registers
    new EVPN BMP statistic type identifiers in the BMP Statistics Type registry. These
    identifiers are used to represent EVPN-specific counters in BMP messages.</p>"
