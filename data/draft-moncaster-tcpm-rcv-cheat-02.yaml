abstract:
- content: '<p>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timely feedback
    to the sender. Currently the sender has no means to verify that a receiver is
    correctly sending this feedback according to the protocol. A receiver that is
    non-compliant has the potential to disrupt a sender''s resource allocation, increasing
    its transmission rate on that connection which in turn could adversely affect
    the network itself. This document presents a two stage test process that can be
    used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant. The tests enshrine the principle
    that one shouldn''t attribute to malice that which may be accidental. The first
    stage test causes minimum impact to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance.
    The second stage test can then be used to verify that the receiver is non-compliant.
    This specification does not modify the core TCP protocol - the tests can either
    be implemented as a test suite or as a stand-alone test through a simple modification
    to the sender implementation. Status By submitting this Internet-Draft, each author
    represents that any applicable patent or other IPR claims of which he or she is
    aware have been or will be disclosed, and any of which he or she becomes aware
    will be disclosed, in accordance with Section 6 of BCP 79. Internet-Drafts are
    working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and
    its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents
    as Internet- Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of
    six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
    time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite
    them other than as "work in progress." The list of current Internet-Drafts can
    be accessed at http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt. The list of Internet-
    Draft Shadow Directories can be accessed at http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html. Changes
    from previous drafts (to be removed by the RFC Editor) From -01 to -02: A number
    of changes made following an extensive review from Alfred Hoenes. These were largely
    to better comply with the stated aims of the previous version but also included
    some tidying up of the protocol details and a new section on a possible unwanted
    interaction. From -00 to -01: Draft rewritten to emphasise testing for non-compliance.
    Some changes to protocol to remove possible unwanted interactions with other TCP
    variants. Sections added on comparison of solutions and alternative uses of test.</p>'
