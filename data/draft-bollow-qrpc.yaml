abstract:
- content: <p>The QRPC (Queueable Remote Procedure Calls) protocol is a fast and versatile
    general-purpose webservice protocol. QRPC can be used as a faster replacement
    for XML-RPC or SOAP, or it can be used for more general kinds of webservices which
    integrate technical and business processes across trusted or untrusted networks.
    QRPC brings the flexibility of the UNIX inter-process communication mechanism
    with pipes, signals and redirection of "standard input", "standard output" and
    "standard error" to the realm of webservices.</p>
