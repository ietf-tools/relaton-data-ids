abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes the goals and requirements for protocols
    and data structures for use with services that provide additional means for users
    to ensure and prove the validity of data, especially digitally signed data, in
    a common and reproducible way. The data being validated may correspond to assertions
    about real-world facts or events. This document establishes the need for components
    to be used in addition to or in conjunction with long-term archive services. It
    provides some use cases and scenarios, and establishes technical requirements
    for protocols and data structures to support them.</p>"
