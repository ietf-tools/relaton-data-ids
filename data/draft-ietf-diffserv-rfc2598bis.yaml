abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a PHB (per-hop behavior) called Expedited Forwarding
    (EF). The PHB is a basic building block in the Differentiated Services architecture.
    EF is intended to provide a building block for low delay, low jitter and low loss
    services by ensuring that the EF aggregate is served at a certain configured rate.
    This document obsoletes RFC 2598. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
