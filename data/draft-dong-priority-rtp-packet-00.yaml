abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates that significance difference or discarding
    priority might exist among RTP packets which encapsulate video streaming data
    with the existing modern video codecs, i.e., H.264/ AVC, SVC, H.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC.
    The document overviews the RTP NALU header format for the existing modern video
    codecs. Each contains at least one field that indicates the RTP packet's relative
    significance within the video stream. With the dominance of video traffic in the
    Internet, selectively dropping RTP packets from competing video streams according
    to their significances or discarding priorities could be a complementary mechanism
    when dealing with network congestion. The document proposes the Differentiated
    Services Code Point (DSCP) value mapping to the RTP packet discarding priority
    carried in the RTP NALU header. The document also proposes a new Hop-by-Hop Extension
    Header (HbH-EH) with a value that is copied from the discarding priority of the
    RTP packet, if the 6-bit DSCP value is not long enough for the mapping.</p>"
