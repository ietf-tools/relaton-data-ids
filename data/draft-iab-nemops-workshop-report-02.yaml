abstract:
- content: <p>The "Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)" workshop was
    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from December 3-5, 2024 as a
    three-day online meeting. It builds on a previous 2002 workshop, the outcome of
    which was documented in RFC 3535 identifying 14 operator requirements for consideration
    in future network management protocol design and related data models, along with
    some recommendations for the IETF. Much has changed in the Internetâ€™s operation
    and technological foundations since then. The NEMOPS workshop reviewed the past
    outcomes and discussed any operational barriers that prevented these technologies
    from being widely implemented. With the industry, network operators and protocol
    engineers working in collaboration, the workshop developed a suggested plan of
    action and network management recommendations for the IETF and IRTF. Note that
    this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and positions
    documented in this report were expressed during the workshop by participants and
    do not necessarily reflect IAB's views and positions.</p>
