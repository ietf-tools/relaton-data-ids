abstract:
- content: "<p>Many applications in todayâ€™s networks rely on reliable and timely flooding
    of link-state information, such as, but not limited to Traffic Engineered networks.
    If such link-state information is delayed it can be difficult for those applications
    to adequately fulfill their intended functionality. This document describes extensions
    to ISIS supporting distribution of fragment origination time. The origination
    time can be used to aid troubleshooting and/or by the applications themselves
    to improve their behavior.</p>"
