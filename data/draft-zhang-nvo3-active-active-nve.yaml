abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-homing of NVEs is a desirable feature to NVO3 since it provides
    Tenant Systems with reliable connection, load-balance, etc. The major issue of
    the multi-homing of NVEs is that it introduces one-to-many mapping from Tenant
    System (inner) addresses to NVE (outer) addresses. This document identifies the
    requirements for multi-homing of NVEs and specifies corresponding solutions to
    meet these requirements. The key is to let remote NVEs be aware of the group of
    NVEs that are offering multi-homing to Tenant Systems, therefore the remote NVE
    can cope with the one-to-many mapping correctly.</p>"
