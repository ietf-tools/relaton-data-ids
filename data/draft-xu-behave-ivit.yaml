abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism, IVIT (IVI+Tunnel), to support non-IVI
    IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 hosts, and vice versa. IVIT combines IVI translation
    and Tunnel methods with the IVI translation at the core and the tunnel at the
    edge. In this document, IVIT provides two modes. One is the dual-stack host mode,
    which supports the communication between a dual-stack host in an IPv4 network
    and a non-IVI IPv6 host, especially the communication scenario between a dual-stack
    server in an IPv4 network and a non-IVI IPv6 host. The other is the CPE mode,
    which supports the communication between an IPv4-only host and a non-IVI IPv6
    host, especially the bidirectional communication scenario between a private IPv4
    network and a non-IVI IPv6 network. Combined with IVI, IVIT can support the communication
    between IPv4 networks and IPv6 networks statelessly at the core.</p>"
