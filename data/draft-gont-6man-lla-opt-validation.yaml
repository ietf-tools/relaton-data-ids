abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents two scenarios in which an on-link attacker emits
    a crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packet that poisons its victim's neighbor
    cache. In the first scenario, the attacker causes a victim to map a local IPv6
    address to a local router's own link- layer address. In the second scenario, the
    attacker causes the victim to map a unicast IP address to a link layer broadcast
    address. In both scenarios, the attacker can exploit the poisoned neighbor cache
    to perform a subsequent forwording-loop attack, thus potentially causing a Denial
    of Service. Finally, this memo specifies simple validations that the recipient
    of an ND message can execute in order to protect itself against the above-mentioned
    threats.</p>"
