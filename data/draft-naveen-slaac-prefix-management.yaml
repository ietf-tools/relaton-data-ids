abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) provides
    a provision for the hosts to request for a specific IPv6 address and manage the
    same, whereas the StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) doesn't have such
    a provision. Also, unavailability of DHCPv6 across all OS platforms has limited
    the IPv6 nodes to not use features like soliciting a prefix of desired length
    and lifetime, renewing, releasing / declining a prefix, etc. This document proposes
    IPv6ND extensions for enabling SLAAC devices to solicit prefix information as
    a hint PIO in RS and other methods like renewing or releasing or declining a prefix
    without introducing any new ICMPv6 message or option types.</p>"
