abstract:
- content: "<p>An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service
    using the described technique. This identification information can be used by
    the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server
    to a single entity. An application server is further able include additional information
    the operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application
    server.</p>"
