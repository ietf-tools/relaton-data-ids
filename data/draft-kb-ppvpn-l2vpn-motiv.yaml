abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM circuits
    have been around a long time. While these VPNs work well, the costs of maintaining
    separate networks for Internet traffic and VPNs and the administrative burden
    of provisioning these VPNs have led Service Providers to look for alternative
    solutions. In this document, we review the good and bad of Layer 2 VPNs, and what
    it would take to make them viable to a Service Provider.</p>"
