abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new parameter for delivering geographic location
    in Host Identity Protocol (HIP). For mobile users using HIP, one generic mechanism
    is proposed to share or update their geo- location information with either rendezvous
    servers or their peers. In addition, geo-location privacy is also protected with
    the help of the ENCRYPTED parameter.</p>"
