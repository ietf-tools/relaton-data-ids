- content: "<p>The Dublin Core is a simple resource description format which arose
    out of a loose grouping of 'librarians, archivists, humanities scholars and geographers,
    as well as standards makers in the Internet, Z39.50 and Standard Generalized Markup
    Language (SGML) communities' [1]. This document describes a mapping from the abstract
    model of the Dublin Core to the X.500 [2], LDAP [3], and CLDAP [4] directory service
    protocols.</p>"
