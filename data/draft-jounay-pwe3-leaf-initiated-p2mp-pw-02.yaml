abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a solution to extend LDP signaling to set up
    and maintain Point-to-Multipoint MultiSegment Pseudowire (P2MP MS- PW). The P2MP
    PW described in this draft is constructed by multiple unidirectional PW segments.
    Such an extension of existing point to point Pseudowire is made necessary by new
    applications. The document only deals with the leaf-initiated P2MP PW setup and
    maintenance. The processing for setting up a P2MP MS-PW is based on the same as
    MLDP for P2MP LSP setup.</p>"
