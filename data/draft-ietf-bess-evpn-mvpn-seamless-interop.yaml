abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data center (DC) networks
    and as the next generation VPN services in service provider (SP) networks. As
    service providers transform their networks in their Central Offices (COs) towards
    the next generation data center with Software Defined Networking (SDN) based fabric
    and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), they want to be able to maintain their
    offered services including Multicast VPN (MVPN) service between their existing
    network and their new Service Provider Data Center (SPDC) network seamlessly without
    the use of gateway devices. They want to have such seamless interoperability between
    their new SPDCs and their existing networks for a) reducing cost, b) having optimum
    forwarding, and c) reducing provisioning. This document describes a unified solution
    based on RFCs 6513 &amp; 6514 for seamless interoperability of Multicast VPN between
    EVPN and MVPN PEs. Furthermore, it describes how the proposed solution can be
    used as a routed multicast solution in data centers with only EVPN PEs.</p>"
