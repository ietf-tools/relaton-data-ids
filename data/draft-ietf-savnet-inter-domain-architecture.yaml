abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an inter-domain SAVNET architecture for performing
    AS-level SAV and provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the design of
    inter-domain SAV mechanisms. The proposed architecture empowers ASes to generate
    SAV rules by sharing SAV- specific information between themselves, which can be
    used to generate more accurate and trustworthy SAV rules in a timely manner compared
    to the general information. During the incremental or partial deployment of SAV-specific
    information, it can utilize general information to generate SAV rules, if an AS's
    SAV-specific information is unavailable. Rather than delving into protocol extensions
    or implementations, this document primarily concentrates on proposing SAV-specific
    and general information and guiding how to utilize them to generate SAV rules.
    To this end, it also defines some architectural components and their relations.</p>"
