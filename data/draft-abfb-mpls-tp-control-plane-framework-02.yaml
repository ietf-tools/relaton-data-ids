abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports static provisioning of
    transport paths via a Network Management System (NMS), and dynamic provisioning
    of transport paths via a control plane. This document provides the framework for
    MPLS-TP dynamic provisioning, and covers control plane addressing, routing, path
    computation, signaling, traffic engineering,, and path recovery. MPLS-TP uses
    GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs and provides for compatibility with
    MPLS. The control plane for Pseudowires (PWs) is also covered by this document.
    Management plane functions such as manual configuration and the initiation of
    LSP setup are out of scope of this document.</p>"
