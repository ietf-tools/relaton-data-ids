abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new generation of PIM family of multicast
    routing protocols called Protocol Independent Multicast-Next Generation (PIM-NG)
    which is faster in source discover and provides many features suitable for Different
    type of networks. PIM-NG uses the underlying unicast routing information, but
    unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily need to build unidirectional shared trees
    rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group. It achieves this due to the fact
    that the processes through which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point
    and a host finds the source of the multicast destination groups it needs are done
    in a whole new way and hence, the source of multicast group (G) is discovered
    faster at the cost of additional memory. So at some points PIM-NG works faster
    than its predecessor. Also the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along the
    RPF check method used in PIM-NG specifications provides many features along a
    robust and flexible control and administration over multicast networks.</p>"
