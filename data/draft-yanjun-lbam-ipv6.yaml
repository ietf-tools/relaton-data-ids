abstract:
- content: "<p>Load balancing is a method, by which IP packet can be distributed across
    a pool of servers, instead of directing to a single server. There are many applications
    needing load balancing such as Web service, FTP service and NAT gateway. However,
    current load balancing software and implementations have problems such as poor
    scalability, inability to balance session flow, long latency time and topological
    constraint on server pool. This document describes a method using pseudo-anycast
    and pseudo- mobility based on Mobile IPv6 to implement load balancing in session
    level in Ipv6 network, by which those problems above can be solved. Futhermore,
    this method only need little modification to Mobile IPv6 in the servers' and agent's
    side; as for the general users, it need not any modification.</p>"
