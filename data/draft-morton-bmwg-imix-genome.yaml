abstract:
- content: <p>Benchmarking Methodologies have always relied on test conditions with
    constant packet sizes, with the goal of understanding what network device capability
    has been tested. Tests with constant packet size reveal device capabilities but
    differ significantly from the conditions encountered in operational deployment,
    and so additional tests are sometimes conducted with a mixture of packet sizes,
    or "IMIX". The mixture of sizes a networking device will encounter is highly variable
    and depends on many factors. An IMIX suited for one networking device and deployment
    will not be appropriate for another. However, the mix of sizes may be known and
    the tester may be asked to augment the fixed size tests. To address this need,
    and the perpetual goal of specifying repeatable test conditions, this draft defines
    a way to specify the exact repeating sequence of packet sizes from the usual set
    of fixed sizes, and other forms of mixed size specification.</p>
