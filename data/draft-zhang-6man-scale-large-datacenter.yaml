abstract:
- content: "<p>Server virtualization has been overwhelmingly accepted especially in
    cloud-based data centers. Accompanied with expansion of services and technology
    advancements, the size of a data center has increased significantly. There could
    be hundreds or thousands of physical servers installed in a single large data
    center which implies that the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) could be in the
    order of millions. Effectively supporting millions of VMs with limited hardware
    resources, becomes a real challenge to networking vendors. This document describes
    a method to scale a switching system with limited hardware resources using IPv6
    in large data center environments.</p>"
