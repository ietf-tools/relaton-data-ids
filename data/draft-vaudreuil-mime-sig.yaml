abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo defines a MIME content type for the exchange of sender contact
    information and user agent capability information beyond what is feasable in the
    RFC822 header. This exchange is generally accomplished by use of a signature trailer
    appended to the message. These signatures commonly contain address, phone, and
    email addressing. This document outlines a formalization and extension of the
    signature concept to provide a machine readable, internationally friendly form
    to exchange this information.</p>"
