abstract:
- content: "<p>Forwarding adjacencies (FA) as described in [2] are a useful tool for
    improving the scalability of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE).
    Through the aggregation of TE LSPs this concept enables the creation of a TE-LSP
    Hierarchy. Forwarding adjacency LSPs (FA-LSP or simply FA) may be advertised as
    TE link into the same instance of ISIS/OSPF as the one that was used to create
    the LSP, allowing other LSRs to use FAs as TE-links for their path computation.
    As such, forwarding adjacency LSP have characteristics of both links and LSPs.
    This document list a number of topics for further study regarding forwarding adjacencies
    in an attempt to identify what future work may result in the MPLS WG (or other)
    from the link/LSP duality.</p>"
