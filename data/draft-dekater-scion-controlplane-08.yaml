abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Control Plane of the path-aware, inter-
    domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
    networks). A fundamental characteristic of SCION is that it gives path control
    to SCION-capable endpoints that can choose between multiple path options, thereby
    enabling the optimization of network paths. The Control Plane is responsible for
    discovering these paths and making them available to the endpoints. The SCION
    Control Plane creates and securely disseminates path segments between SCION Autonomous
    Systems (AS) which can then be combined into forwarding paths to transmit packets
    in the data plane. This document describes mechanisms of path exploration through
    beaconing and path registration. In addition, it describes how Endpoints construct
    end-to-end paths from a set of possible path segments through a path lookup process.
    This document contains new approaches to secure path aware networking. It is not
    an Internet Standard, has not received any formal review of the IETF, nor was
    the work developed through the rough consensus process. The approaches offered
    in this work are offered to the community for its consideration in the further
    evolution of the Internet.</p>"
