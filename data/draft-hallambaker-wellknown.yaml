abstract:
- content: "<p>Under the current system of registration, separate requests are required
    to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery via DNS mechanisms
    such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix. This proposal encourages Web Services
    to adopt a consistent approach to configuration through a 'one stop' registration
    system whereby assignment of a .well-known identifier automatically assigns DNS
    and URI prefixes.</p>"
