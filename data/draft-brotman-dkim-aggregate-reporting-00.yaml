abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a mechanism enabling DKIM-signing domain owners
    to solicit comprehensive aggregate reports from email receivers. Presented in
    an XML format, these reports possess adaptable elements conducive for integration
    with current and future drafts and standards like DMARCbis. They capture the evaluation
    outcomes of DKIM signatures, such as 'pass' or 'fail', alongside other potential
    data attributes. Receivers can relay these aggregate reports to destinations designated
    by the DKIM-signing domain holder, contingent upon their support capabilities.</p>"
