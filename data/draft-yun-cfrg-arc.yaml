abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC)
    protocol, a specialization of keyed-verification anonymous credentials with support
    for rate limiting. ARC credentials can be presented from client to server up to
    some fixed number of times, where each presentation is cryptographically bound
    to client secrets and application-specific public information, such that each
    presentation is unlinkable from the others as well as the original credential
    creation. ARC is useful in applications where a server needs to throttle or rate-limit
    access from anonymous clients.</p>"
