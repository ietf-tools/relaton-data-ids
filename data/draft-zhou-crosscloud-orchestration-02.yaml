abstract:
- content: "<p>The Distributed Resource Orchestration and Dynamic Scheduling (DRO-
    DS) standard in cross-domain cloud-native environments aims to address the challenges
    of resource management and scheduling in multi-cloud architectures, providing
    a unified framework for efficient, flexible, and reliable resource allocation.
    As enterprise applications scale, the limitations of single Kubernetes clusters
    become increasingly apparent, particularly in terms of high availability, disaster
    recovery, and resource optimization. To address these challenges, DRO-DS introduces
    several innovative technologies, including dynamic weight-based scheduling, storage-
    transmission-compute integration mechanisms, follow-up scheduling, real-time monitoring
    and automated operations, as well as global views and predictive algorithms.</p>"
