abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines how RTP multimedia sessions are synchronised, and
    discusses how rapidly such synchronisation can occur. We show that most RTP sessions
    can be synchronised immediately, but that the use of video switching multipoint
    conference units (MCUs) or large source specific multicast (SSM) groups can greatly
    increase the initial synchronisation delay. This increase in delay can be unacceptable
    to some applications that use layered and/or multi-description codecs. This memo
    updates the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) timing rules to reduce the initial synchronisation
    delay for SSM sessions. A new feedback packet is defined for use with the Extended
    RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback (RTP/AVPF), allowing video switching MCUs
    to rapidly request resynchronisation. Two new RTP header extensions are defined
    to allow rapid synchronisation of late joiners, and guarantee correct timestamp
    based decoding order recovery for layered codecs in the presence of clock skew.</p>"
