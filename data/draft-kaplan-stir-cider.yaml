abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal for providing a database service
    for authentication information for Caller-ID E.164 numbers, nationally-specific
    number codes, and email-style names used in communication requests (such as call
    setup, instant messages). The model proposed uses a DNS service as a Registry
    for cryptographic public-keys. The database service solution is called CIDER.</p>"
