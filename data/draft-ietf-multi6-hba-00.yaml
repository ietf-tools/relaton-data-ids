abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism to provide a secure binding between
    the multiple addresses with different prefixes available to a host within a multihomed
    site. The main idea is that information about the multiple prefixes is included
    within the addresses themselves. This is achieved by generating the interface
    identifiers of the addresses of a host as hashes of the available prefixes and
    a random number. Then, the multiple addresses are generated by prepending the
    different prefixes to the generated interface identifiers. The result is a set
    of addresses, called Hash Based Addresses (HBAs), that are inherently bound.</p>"
