abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the weakness of current fast rerouting mechanisms
    in IP network[1] and MPLS enabled network [2]describes a simple fast rerouting
    mechanism for IP/MPLS network, and with these points in mind, proposes the simple
    fast reroute mechanisms based on the intrinsic characteristics of IP network and
    MPLS network, and illustrates the principles of these mechanisms in node protection
    and link/path protection.</p>"
