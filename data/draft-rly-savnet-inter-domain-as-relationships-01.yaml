abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces an inter-domain source address validation scheme
    based on relationships between interconnected ASes. This scheme is mainly described
    from four aspects, namely the research background in fields of source address
    validation and AS relationships, introduction to the classification and acquisition
    methods of AS relationships, the specific architecture of our inter- domain source
    address validation system based on AS relationships, and the considerations on
    deployability.</p>"
