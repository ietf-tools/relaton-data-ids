abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit multicast(Xcast)[1] is a new kind of Internet multicast, and
    encodes the list of destinations within its packet. This document specifies tunneling
    scheme of Xcast packets. Since a single Xcast tunnel has multiple egress-nodes,
    the original Xcast packet can be encapsulated either within a Xcast packet or
    within a unicast packet. When tunneled by Xcast-in-Xcast encapsulation, the bitmap
    of the original Xcast packet is overwritten by the bitmap of the tunnel Xcast
    packet at tunnel egress-nodes, in order to control the active destination set.</p>"
