abstract:
- content: "<p>A case against IP layer fragmentation has been made, and various methods
    for avoiding it proposed. This memo revisits the effect of fragmentation on network
    performance, and recounts the present methods of avoidance. A protocol is presented
    which adapts to the varying circumstances encountered, sending large datagrams
    whenever possible, and reducing fragmentation when necessary to avoid retransmission
    problems. A hybrid approach to MTU discovery, it utilizes one new IP header option
    and four new ICMP messages. It is a simple mechanism that discovers path MTUs
    without wasting resources and that works well before all hosts and routers are
    modified.</p>"
