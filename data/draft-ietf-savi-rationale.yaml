abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF working group on Source Address Validation Improvements, SAVI,
    is chartered to design methods for IP source address validation that complement
    ingress filtering with finer-grained protection. This document summarizes the
    discussion in the SAVI working group and design-related conclusions. The purpose
    of this is two-fold: First, to guide the design process in the working group with
    written documentation of decisions and their rationale. Second, to provide a measure
    for assessing the IP source address validation methods that the working group
    will eventually deliver.</p>"
