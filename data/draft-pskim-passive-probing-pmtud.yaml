abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft consider a Path MTU Discovery(PMTUD) for QUIC. First, why
    it is important to determine the best PMTU for QUIC is explained, and the active
    probing approach for discovering the best PMTU is briefly introduced. Then, as
    an alternative to discover the best PMTU, the passive probing approach is adopted.
    The process of discovering the best PMTU is not carried out separately, but is
    carried out simultaneously in the actual application data communication. A probe
    packet is defined newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application data
    as well as a short packet header and a PING_EXT frame. The PING_EXT frame is also
    defined newly. Until the best PMTU is discovered, the size of the probe packet
    is changed according to the size of the PMTU candidate. A simple discovery algorithm
    using only the PMTU candidate sequence with linear upward is described in this
    draft.</p>"
