abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an informational document intended to outline what is known
    about routing stability of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), traffic engineering
    techniques (TE) used in MPLS, and load balancing techniques. Known stable and
    unstable conditions provide bounds of known behavior. Network operators and equipment
    suppliers have relied heavily on operational experience as existence proof of
    instability or evidence of apparent stability. Between the bounds of known stable
    and unstable behavior there may be conditionally stable protocols and deployment
    scenarios. There is some discussion of the difficulty of mathematical stability
    proof for some techniques and a challenge to the research community.</p>"
