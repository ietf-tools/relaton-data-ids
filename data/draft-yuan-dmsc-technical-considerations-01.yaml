abstract:
- content: "<p>With the maturity of cloud native application development, applications
    can be decomposed into finer grained atomic services. On the other hand, as a
    distributed computing paradigm, fine grained micro-services could be deployed
    and implemented in a distributive way among edges to make computing, storage and
    run-time processing capabilities as close to users as possible to provide satisfied
    QoE. Under the circumstances analyzed, updated framework and architecture would
    be required and designed, aiming to wisely allocate and schedule resources and
    services in order to provide consistent end- to-end service provisioning with
    Distributed Micro Service Communication (DMSC).</p>"
