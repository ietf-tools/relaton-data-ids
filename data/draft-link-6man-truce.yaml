abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 routers employ Router Advertisements (RAs) to disseminate essential
    network configuration data to hosts. RAs play a vital role in Stateless address
    autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and providing IPv6 connectivity. Timely updates via
    RAs become paramount as network configurations change to prevent service outages.
    This document modifies RFC4861, recommending immediate propagation of configuration
    information changes by routers.</p>"
