abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request information
    about DHCPv6 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for individual bindings.
    In some situations individual binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.
    This document specifies extensions to the Leasequery protocol that add new query
    types and allow for bulk DHCPv6 binding data transfer.</p>"
