abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo describes the requirements for securing IANA code point assignments
    before RFC publication. In particular, it describes the "early allocation" process
    that allows for temporary but renewable allocations from registries that would
    ordinarily require an IESG- approved Internet-Draft: namely, registries maintained
    in accordance with the "Standards Action," "IETF Review," "RFC Required," and,
    in some cases, "Specification Required" policies. This process can be used when
    code point allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation
    and deployment experience prior to publication. The procedures in this document
    are intended to apply only to IETF Stream documents. This document obsoletes RFC
    7120.</p>'
