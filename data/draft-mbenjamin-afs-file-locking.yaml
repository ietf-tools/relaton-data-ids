abstract:
- content: "<p>The AFS-3 protocol supports file locks, but only on whole files, only
    in advisory mode. Efficient support for byte-range file locking, together with
    the stronger semantics with which they are associated, are required to improve
    the suitability of AFS as a LAN file-sharing protocol for both Unix and Windows
    clients. Applications on the Windows platform, in particular (e.g., Microsoft
    Office), actually require byte-range locking to function correctly. Emulation
    in the client has alleviated most serious problems, albeit, with reduced semantics.
    We propose protocol enhancements facilitating server-coordinated byte-range locks,
    atomic lock up/down-grade support, improved semantics for files under byte-range
    lock control, protocol support for wait-on-lock with fairness, and mandatory lock
    enforcement for clients on request. The delegation proposal, included within this
    document in previous drafts, has been split out into a separate proposal, based
    on feedback from reviewers.</p>"
