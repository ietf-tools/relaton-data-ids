abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a set of operational procedures, a UDP encapsulation
    for configured tunnels, and one implementation mechanism to provide a very simple
    and straightforward way to easily manage IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnels between
    an ISP and a customer. The configured tunnels work even if the IPv4 addresses
    change dynamically, or are private addresses; the procedure provides at least
    a /64 prefix per customer and requires no administrative set-up. NAT traversal
    is also supported.</p>"
