abstract:
- content: <p>Like other internet activities, multicast is affected by the fact that
    the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is occurring over a period of years, via multiple
    transition paths. As a result, mechanisms need to be added to the basic multicast
    architecture to assist in specific transition scenarios. This document describes
    detailed use cases so that the requirements for the multicast transition mechanisms
    can be better understood. The considered opinion in discussions to date on multicast
    transition requirements has been that the two most important transition scenarios
    in the near future will be the "4-6-4" and "6-4" network scenarios. These scenarios
    are described in detail below, in their several possible variants, showing the
    new issues that IPv6 transition raises for multicast operation. There is further
    general agreement that Any-Source Multicast (ASM) (the service, not necessarily
    the technology) is no longer an important use case. As a result, this document
    restricts itself to scenarios where the set of multicast sources is separate from
    the set of multicast receivers. As a final restriction, it assumes a single administrative
    provider domain.</p>
