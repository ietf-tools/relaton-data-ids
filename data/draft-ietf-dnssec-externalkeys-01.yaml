abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several mechanisms for distributing public keys and certificates
    today. These distribution services publish certificates which contain cryptographic
    public keys. Clients that use any of these distribution services to retrieve certificates,
    require additional software for the retrieval, parsing and verification of these
    certificates. In this draft, we propose an alternate scheme that takes advantage
    of the Secure DNS infrastructure to distribute verified public keys obtained from
    other distribution services.</p>"
