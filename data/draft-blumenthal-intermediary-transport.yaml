abstract:
- content: "<p>The growth of the Internet has witnessed an emergence of transport
    services that rely on or can benefit from assistance of network intermediaries
    between communicating end-points. Such services, for example, include TCP performance
    enhancements, multimedia packet filtering, header compression, and prevention
    of Denial-of-Service. In this draft, we describe some of the important aspects
    of the problem of securely enabling intermediary-based services. We also present
    several scenarios where this problem is manifested.</p>"
