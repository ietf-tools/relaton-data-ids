abstract:
- content: "<p>Low delay feedback in RTP has gained a lot of interest recently in
    order to enhance the performance in RTP sessions with two or only a small number
    of participants. A recent document describes rules that enhance the functionality
    of the existing RTP timing and allow low delay feedback. While that document describes
    when it is allowed to send data, we describe here what kind of low delay feedback
    may be sent. Therefore we define three general RTCP feedback message types as
    well as some recommendations how the sender SHOULD react to certain feedback.
    The message types can either be used as is or they can be extended in payload
    or application specific ways.</p>"
