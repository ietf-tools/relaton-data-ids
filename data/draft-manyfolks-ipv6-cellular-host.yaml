abstract:
- content: "<p>As an increasing number of cellular hosts are being connected to the
    Internet, IPv6 becomes necessary. Examples of such hosts are GPRS, UMTS, and CDMA2000
    terminals. Standardization organizations are also making IPv6 mandatory in their
    newest specifications, such as the IP multimedia terminals specified for UMTS.
    However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects, numerous RFCs, a number of different
    situations, and is also partly still evolving.</p>"
