abstract:
- content: "<p>Support for EDNS0 (Extension Mechanisms for DNS) is mandated in this
    document for DNS entities querying for or serving NAPTR records. In general those
    entities will be supporting ENUM resolution. This requirement is needed because
    DNS responses to ENUM-related queries generally return large RRSets. Without EDNS0
    support these lookups would result in truncated responses and repeated queries
    over TCP transport. That has a severe impact on DNS server load and on the latency
    of those queries. This document updates RFC3761 only in adding this requirement.</p>"
