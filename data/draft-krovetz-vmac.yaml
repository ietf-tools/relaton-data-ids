abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes how to generate an authentication tag
    using the VMAC message authentication algorithm. VMAC is designed to have exceptional
    performance in software on 64-bit CPU architectures while still performing well
    on 32-bit architectures. Measured speeds are as fast as one-half CPU cycle per
    byte (cpb) on 64-bit architectures, under five cpb on desktop 32-bit processors,
    and around ten cpb on embedded 32-bit architectures.</p>"
