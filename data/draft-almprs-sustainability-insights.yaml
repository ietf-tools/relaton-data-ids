- content: "<p>This document motivates the collection and aggregation of sustainability
    environmental related metrics. It describes the motivation and requirements to
    collect asset centric metrics including but not limited to power consumption and
    energy efficiency, circular economy properties, and more general metrics useful
    in environmental impact analysis. It provides foundations for building an industry-wide,
    open-source framework for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, enabling
    measurement and optimization of the overall impact on the environment of networking
    devices, software applications, services, and solutions across the lifecycle journey.</p>"
