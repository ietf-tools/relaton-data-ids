abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a new approach, called NGISec, for end-to-end
    secure communication system that is compatible with other networking protocols.
    Such a solution is needed because IPSec is incompatible with network address translation
    (NAT), ICMP, and QoS protocols such as differentiated services, RSVP, RED, and
    ECN. Most of the proposed solutions to mitigate or remove the incompatibility
    problems of IPSec only address a small sub-section of the problems, and proposed
    solutions have severe drawbacks. By using our proposed approach, one can achieve
    end-to-end secure communication in LANs, VPNs, and network-to-network connections.
    This approach can be viewed as an alternative to IPSec that solves the severe
    problems faced by IPSec and paves the way for simultaneous use of security and
    QoS services. While it is aimed to be an alternative to IPSec, it re-uses critical
    components of the IPSec infrastructure such as the Internet key exchange (IKE).
    An interesting aspect of the proposed protocol is that it also allows the use
    of SSL/TLS to build VPNs.</p>"
