abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines media types for representing the future
    price of energy in JSON. It also defines a way for a client device, such as a
    car, refrigerator, air conditioner, water heater, or display to discover a web
    server that can provide the future price for local electrical energy. This will
    allow the client device to make intelligent decisions about when to use energy,
    and enable price distribution when the building is off-grid. It enables obtaining
    price from a local or non-local price server. This draft is an early skeleton
    of a draft to start discussion around this idea.</p>"
