abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the different requirements that mapping to support
    mobility has versus mapping to support routing scalability. In mobility solutions,
    packets are forwarded to the location where mapping information is stored so that
    they can be encapsulated to the final destination. In routing scalability solutions,
    mapping information needs to be available at packet entry points to the network.
    Attempts to use one mapping system for both purposes can lead to high overhead
    in either mapping information distribution or otherwise mapping information discovery,
    as well as stale mapping information being used for data forwarding.</p>"
