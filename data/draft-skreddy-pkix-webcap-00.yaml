abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) Certificate Access Protocols. Protocol messages are defined for all relevant
    aspects of certificate creation and management. Note that 'certificate' in this
    document refers to an X.509v3 Certificate as defined in [COR95, X509-AM]. This
    document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1
    to publish, retrieve X.509 certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists. This
    protocol also facilitates determining current status of a digital certificate
    without the use of CRLs. This protocol defines new methods, request and response
    bodies, error codes to HTTP/1.1 protocol for securely publishing, retrieving,
    and validation certificates across a firewalls. A various certificate related
    information that includes certificates, CLs, and certification authority (CA)
    policy are retrieved from an integrated single authority access point specified
    in X.509 version 3 extensions.</p>"
