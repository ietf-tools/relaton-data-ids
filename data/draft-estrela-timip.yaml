abstract:
- content: "<p>All IP mobility protocols currently proposed on the IETF assume that
    the mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is still a scenario
    that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, including the laptops and PDAs
    which most would benefit of the mobility support, still use legacy IP stacks,
    limiting their use to layer-2 mobility within a single IP subnet. This document
    presents Terminal Independent Mobile IP (TIMIP), which supports IP micro-mobility
    of all possible existing legacy IP terminals, while fully interoperating with
    Mobile IP to provide macromobility across IP subnets for all terminals.</p>"
