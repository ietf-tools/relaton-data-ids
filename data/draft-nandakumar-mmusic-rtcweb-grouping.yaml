    corresponding to a media source with in independent RTP media streams. This is
    called Simulcast. This document discusses a framework for describing simulcast
    media streams in SDP and also defines semantics to express relationship amongst
    them. The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the source specific
    grouping framework defined in the [RFC5576]</p>"
