abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Persistent
    Document Identifier (PDI) namespace within the URN framework defined by RFC 2141
    [17]. PDIs provide a means to refer to digital objects and fragments that does
    not depend their storage location or the protocol used to access them. Since 1994,
    several large-scale applications with these requirements have used PDIs [12] [21].
    PDIs are intended primarily as permanent identifiers for archival reference to
    long-lived documents. PDIs have a fragment syntax to allow permanent references
    to parts of documents (within specific formats) as well as a citation syntax to
    allow references to appearances of such fragments in composite documents. PDIs
    are most useful for any document series that is distributed via multiple protocols,
    is available from multiple sources, migrates to new locations, needs fragment
    references, or participates in distributed assertion semantics related to collaboration
    or access control.</p>"
