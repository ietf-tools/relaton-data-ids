abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to make use of remotely available
    application logic and data processing by sending explicit procedure calls encoded
    in simple and plattform-independent XML messages over a HTTP connection. Despite
    other RPC (Remote Procedure Call) implementations it is not encoded as binary
    data, and concentrates on the most basic functionality. Therefore it is easier
    to implement and compatible with various programming languages and data representation
    systems.</p>"
