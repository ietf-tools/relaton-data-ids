abstract:
- content: "<p>The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling for resources
    for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The requirements for such signaling
    are being developed in [2] and a framework in [3]. The framework describes a 2-layer
    protocol architecture, with a common lower NSIS 'transport' layer protocol (NTLP)
    supporting a variety of upper layer NSIS signaling layer protocols (NSLPs). It
    is an open issue where within this architecture to place the responsibility for
    handling overload conditions. These conditions relate both to overload of the
    IP layer itself, as well as overload of buffer/processing resources within the
    NTLP/NSLPs. This note discusses the requirements and the implications of various
    approaches, and proposes a way forwards.</p>"
