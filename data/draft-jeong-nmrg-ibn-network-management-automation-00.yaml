abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Network Management Automation (NMA) of cellular
    network services in 5G core networks. For NMA, it proposes a framework empowered
    with Intent-Based Networking (IBN). The NMA in this document deals with closed-loop
    network control, network policy translation, and network management audit. To
    support these three features in NMA, it specifies an architectural framework with
    system components and interfaces. Also, this framework can support the use cases
    of NMA in 5G core networks such as the data aggregation of Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices, network slicing, and the Quality of Service (QoS) in Vehicle-to-Everything
    (V2X).</p>"
