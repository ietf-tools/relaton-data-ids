abstract:
- content: "<p>In SRv6 network, the SRv6 packets usually use loopback address as source
    address. However, when there is symmetric traffic requirement for bidirectional
    flow, or there is requirement for traffic source validation, using loopback address
    as source address is not sufficient. This document proposes using SID as source
    address for SRv6 traffic, also identifies solution for several use cases.</p>"
