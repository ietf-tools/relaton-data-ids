abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is derived from the intelligent artificial intelligent
    (AI) network and autonomous security, network management intend-based technology
    to ensure constant security quality in B5G. SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation
    and Response) is needed by autonomous security and network management to optimize
    an adaptive B5G network. The purpose of this document is to confirm whether the
    requirements are reflected to future users and to develop and identify user provided
    by useful decision how to develop the system. This document also covers the user
    requirements for autonomous security and intend-based network management to ensure
    constant security quality on B5G.</p>"
