abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements which individual pNFS layout
    types need to meet in order to work within the parallel NFS (pNFS) framework as
    defined in RFC5661. In so doing, it aims to clearly distinguish between requirements
    for pNFS as a whole and those specifically directed to the pNFS File Layout. The
    lack of a clear separation between the two set of requirements has been troublesome
    for those specifying and evaluating new Layout Types. In this regard, this document
    updates RFC5661.</p>"
