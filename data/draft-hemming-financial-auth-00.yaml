abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism where by the use of public key cryptography
    and message digest algorithms can authenticate financial transactions such that
    the digital key can replace the need for a paper signature or other authorisations
    process. This mechanism can be used, therefore, to generate digital cheques and
    other instructional transactions such as the purchase or sale of financial instruments
    and the commitment to accept risks.</p>"
