abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a technique for upgrading a DNS TCP connection
    to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) over standard ports. Encryption provided
    by DNS-over-TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping of DNS queries in the
    network. The proposed mechanism is backwards compatible with clients and servers
    that are not aware of DNS-over-TLS.</p>"
