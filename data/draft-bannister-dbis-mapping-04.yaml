abstract:
- content: "<p>This is one of several documents that describe the components within
    Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS). DBIS provides a framework for the
    representation of data relating to TCP/IP and the UNIX system within [X.500] entries
    that have previously been stored in the Network Information Service [NIS]; so
    that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510].
    The intention of DBIS is to extend, and thereby replace both NIS and the experimental
    protocol for using LDAP as a Network Information Service (RFC2307), which have
    both achieved widespread adoption. DBIS consists of an LDAP schema, naming conventions
    and protocols to describe its use by DUAs requiring network service information.
    Client/server communication and server-side operations are entirely contained
    within the domain of LDAP. Key aspects of DBIS and improvements over RFC2307 are:
    - Schema is backwards compatible with NIS, including case sensitivity of key names.
    - Standardisation of mapping information to increase portability of DUA implementations
    and to reduce duplication of client configuration data. - Features added to increase
    flexibility in large complex environments: o Maps may be joined from data located
    in different areas of the Directory Information Tree (DIT). o Groups of DUAs may
    have variances in their data depending upon their host netgroup membership. -
    Modular design to allow separate parts of the system to be replaced, improved
    or augmented separately in the future. - Support added for automounter maps [draft-bannister-dbis-
    automounter-00]. This document describes mapping objects used by DBIS to locate
    and transform service information stored within the DIT.</p>"
