abstract:
- content: "<p>In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized Multi-Protocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs to employ restoration
    Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for the working and/or restoration
    LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs. This document reviews how
    the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of GMPLS end- to-end recovery when
    using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down. This document compliments
    existing standards by explaining the missing pieces of information during the
    RSVP-TE signaling procedure in support of resource sharing-based LSP setup/teardown
    in GMPLS-controlled circuit networks. No new procedures or mechanisms are defined
    by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.</p>"
