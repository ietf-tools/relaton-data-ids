abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution for providing inter-AS MPLS-based
    Quality of Service (QoS) tunnels. This solution makes use of Path Computation
    Elements (PCE) as a means to compute inter-domain constraint-based paths. Service
    considerations and agreements between two IP Network Providers (INP) implementing
    this solution are also described.</p>"
