abstract:
- content: "<p>The architecture described in this document aims at giving as many
    unicast-only end-users access to IP multicast content, this without the need for
    their ISPs to upgrade their network infrastructure to IP multicast. It further
    does not require any change to the unicast only infrastructure nor to the end-user
    operating systems. The access that is provided, is from a user's perspective as
    good as a real IP multicast connection. It can be used to send and receive ASM
    content and allows the receptions of SSM content. It further allows applying Authentication,
    Authorization and Accounting (AAA) to IP Multicast.</p>"
