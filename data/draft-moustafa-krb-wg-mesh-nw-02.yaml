abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the problem of authentication and authorization
    in wireless mesh networks constituted by several users communicating with application
    servers and communicating with each other in a single or multi-hop fashion. Each
    user in this environment can also play the role of an application provider. Imagine
    a large music event where the provided network infrastructure is enhanced with
    network storage equipment to allow visitors to access content relating to the
    bands playing at the events, such as recorded video of previous performances,
    supplementary audio and video material relevant to the bands playing, etc. Certain
    content is, however, not necessarily available to everyone under the same conditions.
    Instead access control is applied before the full range of audio, and video material
    can be accessed. Other content, such as previews, might be offered for free. How
    can such authentication, and authorization infrastructure be made available with
    minimal configuration complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?
    This document lists the requirements for a potentially needed Kerberos extension
    and presents a solution proposal based on the attempt to use a Kerberos extension
    for mutual authentication in wireless mesh networks.</p>"
