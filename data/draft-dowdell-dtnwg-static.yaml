abstract:
- content: "<p>Static Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks cannot make full use of standard
    IPv4 or IPv6 static routing as defined in section 7.4 of [RFC1812], due to the
    DTN feature of Late Binding where the IP address or addresses associated with
    an Endpoint Identifier may not be known when a packet is originated. This draft
    presents a specification for static routing in the DTN environment.</p>"
