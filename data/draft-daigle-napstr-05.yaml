abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [3]
    Application for domain name based discovery of application services. Essentially,
    this uses DNS NAPTR resource records [4] to provide one more layer of redirection
    for service lookup than is feasible with SRV ([2]) records. It is proposed because
    real-life use is demonstrating a need for something slightly more substantial
    than SRV, and alternatively SRV usage may become twisted out of its intended shape.</p>"
