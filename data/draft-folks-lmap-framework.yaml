abstract:
- content: "<p>Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation
    of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols that coordinate
    interactions between the components. The document presents an overall framework
    for large-scale measurements. It also defines terminology for LMAP (large-scale
    measurement platforms). The document is a contribution towards the LMAP working
    group's milestone.</p>"
