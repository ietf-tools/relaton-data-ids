abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture, which
    makes the combination of P2P and SIP practical. In this architecture, heterogeneous
    overlays are inter-connected via a decentralized manner provided by the hierarchical
    P2P-SIP architecture. The overhead of the session control process is reduced since
    the P2P overlay is used by SIP as the underlying peer locating approach. Some
    nodes in the overlay are proposed to be stateful to improve the reliability of
    the overlay. Finally, a session initial example is presented to illustrate this
    architecture.This work is being discussed on the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing
    list.</p>"
