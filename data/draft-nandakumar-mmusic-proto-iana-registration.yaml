abstract:
- content: "<p>RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications
    transmitting real-time data such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast
    or unicast network services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol
    (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large
    multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.
    The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes a registry of profile names for use
    by higher-level control protocols, such as the SDP, to refer to the transport
    methods. This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol
    identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP',
    'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP',
    'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.</p>"
