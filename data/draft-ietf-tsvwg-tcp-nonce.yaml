abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)-nonce,
    an optional addition to ECN that protects against accidental or malicious concealment
    of marked packets from the TCP sender. It improves the robustness of congestion
    control by preventing receivers from exploiting ECN to gain an unfair share of
    network bandwidth. The ECN-nonce uses the two ECN-Capable Transport (ECT)codepoints
    in the ECN field of the IP header, and requires a flag in the TCP header. It is
    computationally efficient for both routers and hosts. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
