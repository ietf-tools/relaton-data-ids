abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a YANG model for TCP on devices that are configured
    by network management protocols. The YANG model defines a container for all TCP
    connections and groupings of some of the parameters that can be imported and used
    in TCP implementations or by other models that need to configure TCP parameters.
    The model includes definitions from YANG Groupings for TCP Client and TCP Servers
    (I-D.ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server). The model is NMDA (RFC 8342) compliant.</p>"
