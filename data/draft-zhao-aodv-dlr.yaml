abstract:
- content: <p>The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector and Dynamic Local Repair (AODV-DLR)
    routing protocol is intended for use by mobile nodes in an ad hoc network. It
    offers quick adaptation to dynamic link conditions, low processing and memory
    overhead, low network utilization, and determines unicast routes to destinations
    within the ad hoc network. It adopts dynamic local repair in which a route repair
    message is used to not only attempt to discovery a route to destination, but also
    try to set up a route to downstream node (next hop or next two hop). It uses destination
    sequence numbers to ensure loop freedom at all times (even in the face of anomalous
    delivery of routing control messages), avoiding problems (such as "counting to
    infinity") associated with classical distance vector protocols.</p>
