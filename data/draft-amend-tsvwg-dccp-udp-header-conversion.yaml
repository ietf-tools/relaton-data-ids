abstract:
- content: "<p>The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport-layer
    protocol that provides upper layers with the ability to use non- reliable congestion-controlled
    flows. DCCP is not widely deployed in the Internet, and the reason for that can
    be defined as a typical example of a chicken-egg problem. Even if an application
    developer decided to use DCCP, the middle-boxes like firewalls and NATs would
    prevent DCCP end-to-end since they lack support for DCCP. Moreover, as long as
    the protocol penetration of DCCP does not increase, the middle-boxes will not
    handle DCCP properly. To overcome this challenge, NAT/NATP traversal and UDP encapsulation
    for DCCP is already defined. However, the former requires special middle-box support
    and the latter introduces overhead. The recent proposal of a multipath extension
    for DCCP further underlines the challenge of efficient middle-box passing as its
    main goal is to be applied over the Internet, traversing numerous uncontrolled
    middle-boxes. This document introduces a new solution which disguises DCCP during
    transmission as UDP without requiring middle-box modification or introducing any
    overhead.</p>"
