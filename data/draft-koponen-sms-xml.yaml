abstract:
- content: "<p>Short Message Service (SMS) messages have become very popular among
    mobile phone users. However, the service providing is still relatively awkward.
    This draft presents an encoding and a simple protocol for describing and submitting
    SMS messages over the Internet. The protocol is aimed to be used between service
    providers and SMS gateways. The SMS messages are encoded in XML and the corresponding
    Document Type Definition (DTD) for the message structure is described</p>"
