abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the protocol specification of LIN6. LIN6 supports
    both macro and micro mobility in IPv6[RFC2460]. LIN6 has several advantages in
    comparison with Mobile IPv6[MIPv6] as follows: o LIN6 has no header overhead because
    it does not use any extension headers of IPv6 while Mobile IPv6 uses the Destination
    Options Header for the Home Address Option and the Routing Header. o LIN6 is more
    fault tolerant than Mobile IPv6. In Mobile IPv6, the Home Agent cannot be replicated
    to the subnet other than the home link of the mobile node. LIN6 introduces the
    Mapping Agent which can be replicated anywhere in the Internet. o LIN6 keeps end-to-end
    communication model, that is, LIN6 does not use any packet intercepter/forwarder
    such as the Home Agent of Mobile IPv6. There is no tunneling in LIN6.</p>"
