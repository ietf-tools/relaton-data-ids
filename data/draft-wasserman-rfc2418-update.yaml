abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains several updates to RFC 2418 designed to give
    more responsibility and authority to IETF Working Group Chairs. In particular,
    Working Group Chairs are given the responsibility of ensuring the technical quality,
    completeness and suitability of work produced by their Working Groups, and the
    authority to refuse to advance any work that does not meet the acceptance criteria
    for its proposed publication level. The importance of meeting minutes is emphasized,
    and Working Group chairs are also given more responsibility and authority for
    the management of working group mailing list discussions.</p>"
