abstract:
- content: "<p>An RFC 9543 network slice customer may utilize intent-based topologies
    to express resource reservation intentions within the provider's network. These
    customer-defined intent topologies allow customers to request shared resources
    for future connections that can be flexibly allocated and customized. Additionally,
    they provide an extensive level of control over underlay service paths within
    the network slice. This document describes a YANG data model for expressing customer
    intent topologies which can be used to enhance the RFC 9543 Network Slice Services
    in specific use cases, such as Network wholesale scenarios, where both topology
    and connectivity intents need to be expressed.</p>"
