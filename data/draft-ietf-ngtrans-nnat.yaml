abstract:
- content: "<p>The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of
    IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4. Nodes will be able
    to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need to communicate with IPv4
    nodes that do not have a dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. This specification
    defines a mechanism called No Network Address Translation (NNAT), which will assign
    an IPv6 node a temporary IPv4 address, which can be used to communicate with a
    node that supports only IPv4.</p>"
