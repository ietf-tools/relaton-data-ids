abstract:
- content: "<p>MIPv6 defines the concept of Home Network for a MN, in opposition to
    the foreign network where this entity may find itself. A ``Home Link Detection''
    mechanism is also specified to allow the MN to detect when it is at home. MIPv6
    specification mandates the use of IPsec for protecting main signaling traffic
    and also defines how IPsec can be used to protect data traffic between the MN
    and its HA. Even if optional, it is expected that many deployments of MIPv6 will
    use it by default for MN which may roam outside a trusted infrastructure (e.g.
    outside a mobile operator network). When a MN detects it is at home, it is expected
    to stop IPsec protection for data traffic exchanged with its Home Agent. That
    event is the result of the Home Return procedure, triggered by the Home Link Detection
    mechanism. This document discusses the possible threats and security impacts associated
    with the use of this insecure NDP-based mechanism as a trigger to drop IPsec protection
    of data traffic for the MN. It also provides some results on the implementation
    of the attacks against an existing MIPv6 module. Possible solutions are suggested.</p>"
