abstract:
- content: "<p>This document makes a survey of the way to adapt the RoHC mechanisms
    to the LPWAN networks. It aims to show that RoHC header compression is not adapted
    for the constrained LPWAN networks. RoHC was defined to reduce the overhead over
    point-to-point connections for multimedia flows, which does not correspond to
    the LPWAN traffic description. RoHC is not able to reduce the use of battery and
    optimize the energy lifetime. If RoHC is used it will need a big effort to be
    adapted, there would be some problems to preserve a good transmission and packet
    lost will cause a context desynchronisation which implies a transmission of a
    complete header. LP-WAN's are different technologies covering different applications
    based on long range, low bandwidth and low power operation.</p>"
