abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) allows nomadic users to access
    their mail store from any client, but it does not support storage of personal
    addressbooks. Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) provides a mechanism
    for storage of personal addressbooks. While ACAP permits the definition of vendor
    specific solutions to this problem, having a documented addressbook dataset class
    permits clients from different vendors to interoperably share the same personal
    addressbooks. This specification defines an ACAP dataset class for personal addressbooks.</p>"
