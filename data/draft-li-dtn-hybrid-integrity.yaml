abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe
    environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works as an overlay
    network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some convergence layer protocols
    like Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP). However, there is no mechanism in
    both BP and LTP Protocol to ensure integrity of a packet with the granularity
    of bit. Since the integrity is crucial for packet transmission and necessary metadata
    consumes extra costs, there should be a strategy to decide which packets and how
    the packets are required to conduct integrity assurance based on network resources
    and user requirements. Hence, in this document, a hybrid integrity assurance strategy
    is proposed to ensure the different levels of integrity of bundles based on the
    status of network resources and the need of users.</p>"
