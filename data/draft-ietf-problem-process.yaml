abstract:
- content: "<p>This Informational document records the history of discussions in the
    Problem WG during 2003 of how to resolve the problems described in the IETF Problem
    Statement. It decomposes each of the problems described into a few areas for improvement
    and categorizes them as either problems affecting the routine processes used to
    create standards or problems affecting the fundamental structure and practices
    of the IETF. Expeditious and non-disruptive solutions are proposed for the problems
    affecting routine processes. The document also lists suggested ways to handle
    the development of solutions for the structure and practices problems proposed
    in IETF discussions. Neither the working group nor the wider IETF has reached
    consensus on a recommendation for any of the proposals. This document therefore
    has no alternative but to suggest that the search for structure and practices
    solutions be handed back to the control of the IESG. While there was working group
    consensus on the processes for short-term and medium term improvements, there
    was no working group consensus on the proposals for longer-term improvements.
    This document therefore includes longer-term improvement proposals only as a matter
    of record; they must not be regarded as recommendations from the working group.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
