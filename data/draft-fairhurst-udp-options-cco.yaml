abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a robust method for calculating checksums for
    use with UDP Options. The new method proposes an alternative checksum calculation
    for coverage of the option space. This is based on the IP checksum calculation,
    but uses an updated pseudoheader. The new method only checks the option portion
    of a UDP packet, but creates a checksum that compensates for the range of IP and
    UDP chekcsum validation methods that have been deployed, in this way the new method
    enhances the proability of NAPT traversal for packets that carry UDP-Options.</p>"
