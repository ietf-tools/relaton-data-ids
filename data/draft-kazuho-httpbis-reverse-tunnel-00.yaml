abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an HTTP extension to establish bi-directional
    byte streams in the direction from servers to their clients, utilizing HTTP as
    a tunneling mechanism. This approach not only facilitates communication between
    servers located behind firewalls and their known clients but also introduces the
    potential for these known clients to serve as relays. In such configurations,
    clients can forward application protocol messages or relay TCP connections, allowing
    servers to interact with any client on the Internet without direct exposure.</p>"
