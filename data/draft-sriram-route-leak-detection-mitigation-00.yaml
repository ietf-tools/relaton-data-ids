abstract:
- content: "<p>In [I-D.ietf-sriram-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have
    provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated several types
    of route leaks. In this document, we first examine which of those route-leak types
    are detected and mitigated by the existing BGPSEC protocol [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-09].
    Where the current BGPSEC protocol doesn't offer a solution, this document suggests
    an enhancement that would extend the route-leak detection and mitigation capability
    of BGPSEC. The solution can be implemented in BGP without necessarily tying it
    to BGPSEC. Incorporating the solution in BGPSEC is one way of implementing it
    in a secure way. We do not claim to have provided a solution for all possible
    types of route leaks, but the solution covers several, especially considering
    some significant route-leak attacks or occurrences that have been observed in
    recent years. The document also includes a stopgap method for detection and mitigation
    of route leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation) is not yet deployed
    but only origin validation is deployed.</p>"
