abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for extending pseudo wire emulation
    across multiple packet switched network segments. Scenarios are discussed where
    each segment of a given edge-to-edge emulated service spans a different provider's
    PSN, and where the emulated service originates and terminates on the same providers
    PSN, but may pass through several PSN tunnel segments in that PSN. It presents
    an architectural framework for such multi-segment pseudo wires, defines terminology,
    and specifies the various protocol elements and their functions.</p>"
