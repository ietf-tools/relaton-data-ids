    and management), the monitoring of control plane protocols is a fundamental necessity.

    by collecting the IGP monitoring data and reporting it to the network monitoring
    server in real-time. In this document, the operations of network monitoring for
    ISIS are described, and the corresponding network monitoring message types and
    message formats are defined.</p>"
