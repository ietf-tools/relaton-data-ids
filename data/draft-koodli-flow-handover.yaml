abstract:
- content: "<p>With interface multihoming, Mobile Nodes are capable of simultaneous
    attachment to multiple radio access networks. This enables a network node such
    as the Local Mobility Anchor to distribute the application traffic to interfaces
    that can best serve them. This document specifies a network-controlled protocol
    to handover application flows from one interface to another. Such control could
    provide better experience for end users and better traffic management for network
    operators.</p>"
