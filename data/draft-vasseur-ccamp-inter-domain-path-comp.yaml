abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies two path computation methods for computing
    inter-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched (LSP) paths. In this document a domain
    is referred to as a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address
    management or path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous
    Systems. The first path computation method is also called per-domain path computation
    whereby each entry boundary LSR is responsible for computing the path to the next
    exit boundary LSR (where for instance a boundary LSR is either an ARB or an ASBR)
    whereas in the second method a Path Computation Element (PCE)is used to compute
    an end to end partial or complete path across multiple domains.</p>"
