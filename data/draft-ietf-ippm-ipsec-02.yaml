abstract:
- content: "<p>The O/TWAMP security mechanism requires that endpoints (i.e. both the
    client and the server) possess a shared secret. Since the currently- standardized
    O/TWAMP security mechanism only supports a pre-shared key mode, large scale deployment
    of O/TWAMP is hindered significantly. At the same time, recent trends point to
    wider IKEv2 deployment, which in turn calls for mechanisms and methods that enable
    tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and two-way network
    performance in a standardized manner. This document discusses the use of keys
    derived from an IKE SA as the shared key in O/TWAMP. If the shared key can be
    derived from the IKE SA, O/TWAMP can support cert-based key exchange, which would
    allow for more flexibility and efficiency. Such key derivation can also facilitate
    automatic key management.</p>"
