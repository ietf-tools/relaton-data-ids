abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase of network threats, the Service Function Chain (SFC)
    is vulnerable to various attacks, and as a key component of the entire SFC, the
    security of the service function (SF) is more critical. This document proposes
    a mimic SF security architecture based on the dynamic heterogeneous redundancy
    model, which can effectively protect the normal execution function of SF in SFC.
    The security architecture adopts an active defense method to defend against network
    attacks, and it can effectively defend against most SF attacks.</p>"
