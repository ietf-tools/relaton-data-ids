abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF transport protocols such as TCP, SCTP and QUIC are designed to
    function correctly over any network path. This includes networks paths that utilise
    a satellite link or network. While transport protocols function, the characteristics
    of satellite networks can impact performance when using the defaults in standard
    mechanisms, due to the specific characteristics of these paths. RFC 2488 and RFC
    3135 describe mechanisms that enable TCP to more effectively utilize the available
    capacity of a network path that includes a satellite system. Since publication,
    both application and transport layers and satellite systems have evolved. Indeed,
    the development of encrypted protocols such as QUIC challenges currently deployed
    solutions, for satellite systems the capacity has increased and commercial systems
    are now available that use a range of satellite orbital positions. This document
    describes the current characterises of common satellite paths and describes considerations
    when implementing and deploying reliable transport protocols that are intended
    to work efficiently over paths that include a satellite system. It discusses available
    network mitigations and offers advice to designers of protocols and operators
    of satellite networks.</p>"
