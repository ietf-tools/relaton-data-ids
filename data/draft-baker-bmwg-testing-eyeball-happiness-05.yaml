abstract:
- content: "<p>The amount of time it takes to establish a session using common transport
    APIs in dual-stack networks and networks with filtering such as proposed in BCP
    38 is a barrier to IPv6 deployment. This note describes a test that can be used
    to determine whether an application can reliably establish sessions quickly in
    a complex environment such as dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) deployment or IPv6 deployment
    with multiple prefixes and upstream ingress filtering. This test is not a test
    of a specific algorithm, but of the external behavior of the system as a black
    box. Any algorithm that has the intended external behavior will be accepted by
    it. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
