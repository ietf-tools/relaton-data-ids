- content: "<p>Recent progress of virtual machine technology made it possible to host
    various Internet service nodes in a so called cloud environment. The virtual machine
    hosting technology provides a method to migrate a virtual machine from one hypervisor
    to another. However, such a technology is mainly focusing on a migration between
    hypervisors attached to the same link, and tend not to consider migration over
    the Internet. This document mentions the purpose of that type of operation and
    describe several possible operation methods to provide network portability in
    cloud systems.</p>"
