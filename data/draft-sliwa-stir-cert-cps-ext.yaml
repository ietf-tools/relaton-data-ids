abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a non-critical X.509 v3 certificate extension
    that conveys the HTTPS URI of a Call Placement Service (CPS) associated with the
    telephone numbers authorized in a STIR Delegate Certificate. The extension enables
    originators and verifiers of STIR PASSporTs to discover, with a single certificate
    lookup, where Out- of-Band (OOB) PASSporTs can be retrieved. The mechanism removes
    bilateral CPS provisioning, allows ecosystem-scale discovery backed by STI Certificate
    Transparency (STI-CT), and is fully backward compatible with existing STIR certificates
    and OOB APIs.</p>"
