abstract:
- content: <p>Draft-ietf-pwe3-congestion-frmwk-00.txt [2] describes requirements for
    a PE providing a PWE3 service to take action if congestion is detected in the
    underlying PSN. This draft provides a control plane mechanism to enable a downstream
    PE detecting congestion to signal that congestion state to an upstream PE so that
    it may take appropriate action on its PWs. Conventions used in this document The
    key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC-2119 [1].</p>
