abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 8226 specifies the use of certificates for Secure Telephone Identity
    Credentials, and these certificates are often called "STIR Certificates". RFC
    8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JSON Web Token (JWT) claims
    that can be included in the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) as defined in
    RFC 8225. If the PASSporT signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries,
    then the PASSporT recipient will reject the entire PASSporT. This document updates
    RFC 8226; it provides all of the capabilities available in the original certificate
    extension as well as an additional way to constrain the allowable JWT claims.
    The enhanced extension can also provide a list of claims that are not allowed
    to be included in the PASSporT.</p>
