abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes three media types -- application/xml, application/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    and application/xml-dtd -- for use in exchanging network entities that are related
    to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) while deprecating text/xml and text/ xml-external-parsed-entity.
    This document also standardizes a convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming
    media types outside of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME
    entities. XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via the HyperText Transfer
    Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol for
    remote web authoring, and are expected to have utility in many domains. Major
    differences from [RFC3023] are deprecation of text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
    the addition of XPointer and XML Base as fragment identifiers and base URIs, respectively,
    mention of the XPointer Registry, and updating of many references.</p>"
