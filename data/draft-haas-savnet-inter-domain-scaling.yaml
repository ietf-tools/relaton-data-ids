abstract:
- content: <p>Source address validation (SAV) covers the general techniques to prevent
    IP source address spoofing, which is often used in networking attacks. Two primary
    problem spaces addressed in work on SAV include building the "source of truth"
    for what IP networks should be permitted to source IP traffic behind a set of
    network interfaces, and implementing the data plane enforcement for the validation.
    Implementing data plane enforcement, especially for inter-domain networking for
    the Internet carried by BGP-4 [RFC 4271] has a number of scaling considerations.
    One consideration is the potentially large and often asymmetric sizes of the per-interface
    SAV tables vs. the Forwarding Information Base (FIB). A second consideration is
    synchronization issues between SAV enforcement mechanisms and the forwarding state
    for the FIB where a lack of coordination may result in dropped or mis-forwarded
    traffic. This draft explores these two considerations under the title, "The asymmetric
    contract, and the broken promise."</p>
