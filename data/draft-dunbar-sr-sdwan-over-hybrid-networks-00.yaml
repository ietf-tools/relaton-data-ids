abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN paths
    (most likely encrypted) to traverse specific list of network segments, some of
    which may be legacy networks that do not support SR, to achieve the desired optimal
    E2E quality. The method described in this draft uses the principle of segment
    routing to enforce the SD-WAN paths' head ends selecting paths traversing through
    a list of specific nodes of multiple network segments without requiring the nodes
    in each network segments to have the intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting
    next hop or next domain. Those networks over which the SD-WAN path traverse may
    have different data planes (some maybe IPv4, others maybe IPv6 or MPLS) and can
    be owned &amp; managed by different network service providers (SP).</p>"
