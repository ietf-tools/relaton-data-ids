abstract:
- content: "<p>This document present how the Flow Label can be used inside a RPL domain
    as a replacement to the RPL option and provides rules for the root to set and
    reset the Flow Label when forwarding between the inside of RPL domain and the
    larger Internet, in both direction. This new operation saves 44 bits in each frame,
    and an eventual IP- in-IP encapsulation within the RPL domain that is required
    for all packets that reach outside of the RPL domain.</p>"
