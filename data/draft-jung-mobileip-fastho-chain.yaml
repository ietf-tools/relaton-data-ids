abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP allows a mobile node to send and receive packets regardless
    of the IP address of its current point of attachment in the Internet. Several
    handover protocol using Layer 2 information has proposed for fast handover. We
    propose a modification of the fast handover protocol with simple Layer 2 triggers.
    For successive handovers of a Mobile Node on real-time service, a chain tunneling
    handover is proposed. For effective operation of the chain, the chain length threshold
    is adopted to prevent packet delay due to the successive handovers. Tunnel negotiation
    is employed to adopt the local resource and security conditions and management
    policies.</p>"
