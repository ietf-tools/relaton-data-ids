abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies 4rd technology's multicast component so that IPv4
    hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4 servers over an IPv6 network. In 4rd
    Translation Multicast solution, IGMP messages are translated into MLD messages
    at the CE router which is IGMP/MLD Proxy and sent to the network in IPv6. 4rd
    Border Relay does the reverse translation and joins IPv4 multicast group for 4rd
    hosts. Border Relay as multicast router receives IPv4 multicast data and translates
    the packet into IPv6 multicast data using 4rd-U and sends downstream on the multicast
    tree. Member CEs receive multicast data, translate it back to IPv4 and transmit
    to the hosts. In AMT based solution, AMT Gateway at the 4rd Customer Edge router
    uses AMT protocol to establish a tunnel interface with AMT Relay at the 4rd Border
    Relay and this tunnel is used to exchange IGMP messages to establish multicast
    state at AMT Relay so that AMT Relay can tunnel IPv4 multicast data to IPv4 hosts
    connected to AMT Gateway.</p>"
