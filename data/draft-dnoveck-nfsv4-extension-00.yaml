abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the rules relating to the extension of the
    NFSv4 family of protocols. It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition
    of optional features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in
    features already published as Proposed Standards. The rules relating to the construction
    of minor versions and the interaction of minor version implementations that appear
    in this document supersede the minor versioning rules in RFC5661.</p>"
