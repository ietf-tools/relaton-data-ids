abstract:
- content: "<p>Path MTU discovery (rfc1191) is a standard technique to determine the
    supported MTU between two Internet Protocol (IP) hosts to avoid any fragmentation.
    In a multicast distribution tree, source will not know where the receivers are
    located. So the technique used to compute the path MTU for a unicast stream does
    not work in a multicast network. This document describes a method to discover
    multicast path MTU with the goal to avoid traffic loss. This solution also aims
    to solve the problem of traffic loss in for multicast streams because of incorrect
    MTU setting and no path MTU support for multicast networks.</p>"
