abstract:
- content: "<p>Forward Secrecy for the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for
    Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA' FS) is specified in [RFC9678], providing
    updates to [RFC9048] with an optional extension that offers ephemeral key exchange
    using the traditional Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) key agreement
    algorithm for achieving perfect forward secrecy (PFS). However, it is susceptible
    to future threats from Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers, which could
    potentially compromise a traditional ephemeral public key. If the adversary has
    also obtained knowledge of the long-term key and ephemeral public key, it could
    compromise session keys generated as part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'.
    This draft aims to enhance the security of EAP-AKA' FS protocol by leveraging
    PQ/T Hybrid [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology] algorithms to make it quantum-safe.</p>"
