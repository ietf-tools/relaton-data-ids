abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has produced a considerable number of data modules in the
    YANG modelling language. The majority of these modules are used to construct data
    models to model devices or monolithic functions and they allow access for configuration
    and to read operational status. A small number of YANG modules have been defined
    to model services (for example, the Layer Three Virtual Private Network Service
    Model produced by the L3SM working group and documented in RFC 8049). This document
    briefly sets out the scope of and purpose of an IETF service model, and it also
    shows where a service model might fit into a Software Defined Networking architecture.
    Note that service models do not make any assumption of how a service is actually
    engineered and delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and
    devices are engineered to deliver a service are captured in other models that
    are not exposed through the Customer-Provider Interface.</p>"
