abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a flexible solution for MPLS to support Differentiated
    Services (Diff-Serv) over PPP links. This solution allows the service provider
    to flexibly define how Diff-Serv Behavior Aggregates (BAs) are mapped onto LSPs
    so that he/she can best match the Diff-Serv and Traffic Engineering objectives
    within his/her particular network. For instance, this solution allows the service
    provider to decide whether sets of BAs are to be mapped onto the same LSP or mapped
    onto separate LSPs.</p>"
