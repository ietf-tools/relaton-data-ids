abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a framework and a new protocol used to automatically
    discover the topology of a network based on IP connections and across any vendor
    that implements this protocol. With the information gathered from the network
    elements, a server will be able to create a database of connections between any
    two physical interfaces and display it in any format suitable by the vendor and
    which will be updated automatically if any changes are made.</p>"
