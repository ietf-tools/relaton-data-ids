abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol defined in [RFC9420] is
    an asynchronous secure group messaging protocol, which allows group members to
    propose their own removal from a group. However, in some cases MLS clients can't
    reliably use regular Remove or SelfRemove proposals to leave a group because they
    don't have an up-to-date group state. This document specifies a LeafOperationIntent,
    which does not need an up-to-date group state but which retains sufficient binding
    to the client's current state to avoid replay attacks.</p>"
