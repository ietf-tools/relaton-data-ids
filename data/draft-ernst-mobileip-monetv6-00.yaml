abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft addresses the problems of routing datagrams to nodes located
    in an IPv6 mobile network. A mobile network is one or more IP-subnets attached
    to a mobile router and mobile as a unit. The mobile router dynamically changes
    its point of attachment. Applications of mobile networks include networks attached
    to people (PANs) and networks of sensors deployed in an aircraft, a boat, or a
    car.</p>"
