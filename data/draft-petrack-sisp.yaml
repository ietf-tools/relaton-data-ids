abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Internet Signalling Protocol (SISP) performs one function: signalling
    of realtime data streams over IP networks. SISP has several distinguishing features:
    it is a tiny extension of RTCP, running over UDP or TCP, it can integrate very
    well with PSTN signalling, and it can run in very low bandwidth situations without
    disturbing the real time stream. It is completely scalable with respect to number
    of participants and also with respect to 'tightness' of control, and can work
    with an extremely wide variety of conference models, policies, and standards.
    SISP differs from other conferencing protocols in that it performs a single essential
    task completely. It is argued that other protocols solve only parts of several
    overlapping problems. SISP can serve as the lowest common denominator for signalling
    of real-time streams. The requirements that SISP fulfills, the features it offers,
    the fact that it uses RTCP as an encapsulation scheme, and its generally minimalist
    approach of solving one problem only are more important than the actual state
    machine it implements or particular format of its messages.</p>"
