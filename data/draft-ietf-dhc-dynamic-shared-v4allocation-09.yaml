abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the dynamic allocation of shared IPv4 addresses
    to clients using DHCPv4. Address sharing allows a single IPv4 address to be allocated
    to multiple active clients simultaneously, with each client being differentiated
    by a unique set of transport- layer source port numbers. The necessary changes
    to existing DHCPv4 client and server behavior are described, and a new DHCPv4
    option for provisioning clients with shared IPv4 addresses is included. Due to
    the nature of IP address sharing, some limitations to its applicability are necessary.
    This memo describes these limitations and recommends suitable architectures and
    technologies where address sharing may be utilized.</p>"
