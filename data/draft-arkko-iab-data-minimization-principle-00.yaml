abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. This memo suggests that this is no longer
    alone sufficient to cater for the security and privacy issues seen on the Internet
    today. For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against endpoints that
    are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests
    of users. While such protection is difficult, there are some measures that can
    be taken. It is particularly important that new technology and new deployments
    consider the role of data passed to various parties -- including the primary protocol
    participants -- and balance the information given to them considering their roles
    and possible compromise of the information.</p>"
