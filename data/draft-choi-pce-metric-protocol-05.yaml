abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we propose an analysis of a Path Computation Element
    Metric Protocol (PCEMP) that acts as a generic computation model for path based
    metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer networks. The mechanism that is described
    in this draft is generic and can serve as an application path computation framework
    for any Path Computation Element (PCE). We describe a protocol message format
    for PCE-PCC and PCE-PCE communications derived from this computation model. This
    draft proposes to elucidate protocol independent metrics defining path quality
    measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability criteria related to
    path computation techniques through the PCEMP along with a PCE peer communication
    protocol and is in line with the PCE WG Charter.</p>"
