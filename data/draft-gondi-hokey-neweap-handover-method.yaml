abstract:
- content: "<p>The increase in the use of different access networks which involves
    different mechanisms for authentication and access authorizations, demands the
    new mechanisms to roam at any time anywhere with low latency. To overcome this
    process we need new mechanisms where a user terminal roams in different access
    networks with low latency and efficiently. There is a need for unified signaling
    mechanisms for choosing and accessing networks. In this draft we have discussed
    some of the processes involved in network selection, mobility management, security
    management in detailed to perform handover. The Handover information is passed
    to home server using the new handover method using EAP proposed vice versa in
    this draft. Even though there are different mechanisms provide this support such
    as IAPP context transfer mechanisms for seamless mobility some of the instances
    like supporting different access networks, roaming in access networks etc is not
    considered. The proposed mechanism is interoperable with the existing procedures
    involving security authentication and mobility during roaming.</p>"
