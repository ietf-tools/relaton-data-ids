abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a syntax for addressing time intervals within
    time-based Web resources through URI queries and fragments. This scheme is particularly
    used for Annodex [1] and CMML [2] Web resources, though it could be picked up
    by any other time-based Web resource format. Temporal addressing enables, e.g.,
    direct access to a clip inside a video stored on a Web Server, or direct jumps
    to a specific event within a piece of music. The syntax is not restricted to audio
    or video Web resources though, but covers all kinds of Web resources that contain
    time-continuous information.</p>"
