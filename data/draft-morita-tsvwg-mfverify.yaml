abstract:
- content: "<p>The Priority Promotion Scheme (PPS) is a new scheme for traffic control;
    specifically, the PPS achieves end-to-end QoS for interactive multimedia services
    by exercising admission control for series of packets on a packet-based network.
    The scheme is based on the end-to-end measurement of network resources by end
    systems. The destination end system notifies the conditions of receipt for a limited
    set of packets sent from the source end. If this is acceptable, the source end
    system then promotes the priority of the succeeding IP packets to firmly establish
    the session. The network is only assumed to support a per-class form of priority
    control, since this allows the end systems to measure remaining resources without
    affecting the existing streams. If all end systems behave in the above way, we
    can achieve specific levels of end-to-end QoS without maintaining per-flow states
    in each item of network equipment. The PPS is based on a new per-hop forwarding
    behavior, called measurable forwarding (MF-PHB), which will use the DiffServ architecture.
    In this document, we propose a way to verify whether MF-PHB is realizable by elaborating
    configurations of existing equipment.</p>"
