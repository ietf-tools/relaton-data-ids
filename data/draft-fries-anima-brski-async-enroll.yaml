abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses enhancements of bootstrapping of a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains featuring no or only timely
    limited connectivity to backend services offering enrollment functionality, specifically
    a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The enhancements proposed to enable this are
    also applied to further set of use cases in which a pledge may not have a direct
    connection to the registrar and is served by for instance by a commissioning tool
    as an agent providing registrar connectivity. In the context of deploying new
    devices the design of BRSKI allows for online (synchronous object exchange) and
    offline interactions (asynchronous object exchange) with a manufacturer's authorization
    service. For this it utilizes an authenticated self- contained voucher to transport
    the domain credentials as a signed object to establish an initial trust between
    a pledge and the target deployment domain. The currently supported enrollment
    protocol for request and distribution of deployment domain specific device certificates
    provides only limited support for asynchronous PKI interactions. This memo motivates
    the enhancement of supporting authenticated self-contained objects for certificate
    management by using an abstract notation. The enhancement allows on one hand off-
    site operation of PKI services outside the deployment domain of the pledge. This
    addresses specifically scenarios, in which the final authorization of a certification
    request of a pledge cannot be made in the deployment domain and is therefore delegated
    to a operator backend. On the other hand, this enhancement also facilitates the
    exchange of certificate management information via a pledge agent. The goal is
    to enable the usage of existing and potentially new PKI protocols supporting authenticated
    self-containment for certificate management exchanges.</p>"
