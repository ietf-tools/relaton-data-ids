abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives a short high-level overview of several practical
    experiments performed with mobile networks using Mobile IPv6-based NEMO extensions
    in the context of the IST OverDRiVE project. Laboratory experiments include simple
    and nested mobile networks in a pure IPv6 environment while 'field' experiments
    demonstrated continuous IPv6 vehicular connectivity over two publicly deployed
    IPv4 networks: 2.5G (GPRS) and Wireless LAN 802.11b deployed around and inside
    a metropolitan area.</p>"
