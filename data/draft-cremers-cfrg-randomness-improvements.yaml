abstract:
- content: <p>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related security protocols.
    Weak or predictable "cryptographically-strong" pseudorandom number generators
    (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes. The Dual EC random
    number backdoor and Debian bugs are relevant examples of this problem. This document
    describes a way for security protocol participants to mix their long- term private
    key into the entropy pool(s) from which random values are derived. This augments
    and improves randomness from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.</p>
