abstract:
- content: <p>Multi-Factor Authentication has rapidly become a driving requirement
    for any internet based technology that requires authentication. While a large
    number of initiatives are active for providing solutions to this requirement for
    Web Browser based applications that can generally support real time human interaction
    for providing a secondary method of identification, legacy protocols such as [IMAP]
    have not yet been revised to provide such support despite being a high-risk target
    for business email compromise, possibly as a result of [IMAP] activity generally
    expecting to be non-interactive in nature outside of Webmail logins. This document
    defines an extension to the [IMAP] service protocol called "CLIENTID" that an
    [IMAP] client can provide an additional unique identification token prior to standard
    credentials authentication that the server may then apply as an identity verification
    method in a similar manner to other Multi-Factor authentication techniques.</p>
