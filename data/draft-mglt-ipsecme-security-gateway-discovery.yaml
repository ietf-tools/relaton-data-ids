abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern Virtual Private Network (VPN) services are typically deployed
    using several security gateways and are frequently accessed over a wireless network.
    There are several reasons for such a deployment ranging from enhancing system
    resilience to improving performance. For example, in order to handle traffic efficiently
    and reduce the burden in the core network, the VPN service may be implemented
    in a distributed manner using multiple Security Gateways. A mobile VPN End User
    is attached to one of them using a WLAN interface and over time is likely to change
    its Security Gateway of attachment. In this case, in order to optimize the overall
    user Quality of Experience (QoE), a VPN End User should select the next most appropriate
    Security Gateway based on the characteristics of the available Security Gateways.
    This draft specifies how a VPN End User can securely collect information about
    Security Gateways in its network neighborhood in order to optimize its VPN experience.</p>"
