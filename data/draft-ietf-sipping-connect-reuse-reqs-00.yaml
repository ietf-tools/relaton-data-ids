abstract:
- content: "<p>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a request,
    they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral port. The SIP protocol
    includes mechanisms which insure that responses to a request, and new requests
    sent in the original direction reuse an existing connection. However, new requests
    sent in the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing connection.
    This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one connection for requests
    sent in each direction, and can result in potential scaling and performance problems.
    This document presents requirements for addressing this shortcoming, and separately
    proposes an example mechanism which addresses this deficiency.</p>"
