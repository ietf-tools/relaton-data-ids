abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating protocol packets. However,
    there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), where IPsec
    is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism cannot be used. This
    draft proposes an alternative mechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not
    depend upon IPsec for authentication.</p>"
