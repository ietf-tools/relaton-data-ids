- content: "<p>This document specifies the protocol used by IPv6 nodes comprising
    stateful packet filters to discover the transport addresses of listening applications
    (that is, application endpoints for which incoming traffic may be administratively
    prohibited). Comments are solicited and should be sent to the author and the V6OPS
    Residential CPE Design Team mailing list at &lt;v6ops-residential-cpe-design-team@external.cisco.com&gt;.</p>"
