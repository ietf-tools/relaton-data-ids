abstract:
- content: <p>The MVPN (Multicast Virtual Private Network) architecture is divided
    into a number of functional "layers". At each layer, multiple options are allowed.
    It is necessary to allow multiple options at each layer because "one size doesn't
    fit all." However, it is not expected that any particular implementation will
    support all the possible combinations of options. To ensure multi-vendor interoperability,
    it is useful to specify "profiles", where each profile is a particular combination
    of options. The number of specified profiles will be much less than the total
    number of possible combination, and a given implementation can be characterized
    by saying which profiles it supports. This document describes two profiles that
    use a PIM control plane.</p>
