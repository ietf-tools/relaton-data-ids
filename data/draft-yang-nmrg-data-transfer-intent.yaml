abstract:
- content: "<p>With the advent of the digital era, there are more and more scenarios
    such as data off-site AI training, data off-site cloud, and the demand for big
    data transmission in the WAN is increasing. WAN data transmission involves throughput,
    delay, packet loss, security and other performance indicators, as well as cost
    investment. Users have been exploring how to achieve the best performance of data
    transmission at the lowest cost. This paper implements high quality WAN data transmission
    based on IBNS.</p>"
