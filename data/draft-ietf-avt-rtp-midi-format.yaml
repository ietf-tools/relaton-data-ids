abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format
    for the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) command language. The format
    encodes all commands that may legally appear on a MIDI 1.0 DIN cable. The format
    is suitable for interactive applications (such as network musical performance)
    and content-delivery applications (such as file streaming). The format may be
    used over unicast and multicast UDP and TCP, and it defines tools for graceful
    recovery from packet loss. Stream behavior, including the MIDI rendering method,
    may be customized during session setup. The format also serves as a mode for the
    mpeg4-generic format, to support the MPEG 4 Audio Object Types for General MIDI,
    Downloadable Sounds Level 2, and Structured Audio. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
