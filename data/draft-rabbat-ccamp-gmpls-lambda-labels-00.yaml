abstract:
- content: <p>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a consequence
    new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed and is
    currently being deployed. RFC 3471 [RFC3471] has defined that a wavelength label
    (section 3.2.1.1) "only has significance between two neighbors". However, in a
    network composed of a new generation of lambda switch-capable equipment, this
    document explains new models that require standardization of the label. It highlights
    new operator requirements and describes signaling extensions to satisfy those
    requirements. This document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (GMPLS) signaling. It defines the Label Switching Capable (LSC) technology
    specific information needed when using GMPLS.</p>
