abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol described in this document is a member of the IP Device
    Control (IPDC) family of protocols. The IPDC protocols are proposed as a protocol
    suite, components of which can be used individually or together to perform connection
    control, media control, and signaling transport for environments where the service
    control logic is separated from the network access server. Please see the references
    section for other IPDC documents. The protocol specification presented here is
    intended for use between a media gateway controller and a media gateway. The media
    gateway may be capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice over ATM gateway,
    dialup modem media gateway, circuit switch, or cross- connect. Using the IP Connection
    Control protocol presented here, the media gateway controller can setup, modify
    and teardown connections within or between media gateways.</p>"
