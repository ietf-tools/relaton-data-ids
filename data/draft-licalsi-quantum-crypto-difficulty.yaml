abstract:
- content: "<p>In the communication viewpoint, quantum state, i.e., qubit is different
    from classical bit. Qubit may be transmitted directly but it can’t be cloned or
    measured without altercation, so existing copy and resend scheme can’t be used
    to handle a transmission failure. Moreover, in some cases, a sender, even none,
    knows the state of qubit, so qubit loss may cause irrevocable damage. This draft
    presents the causes of transmission failures and, analyses the vulnerabilities
    of several crypto protocols, such defects may bring forth. Thus, quantum teleportation
    is highly recommended for certain applications.</p>"
