abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing protocols are subject to attacks that can harm individual users
    or the network operations as a whole. The lack of a common set of security requirements
    has led to the use in existing routing protocol of a variety of different security
    solutions, which provide various levels of security coverage. The RPSEC working
    group intends to deliver in a separate document a set of security requirements
    for consideration of routing protocol designers. The first step in developing
    the security requirements is to analyze the threats that face routing protocols.
    This document describes the threats, including threat sources and capabilities,
    threat actions, and threat consequences as well as a breakdown of routing functions
    that might be separately attacked.</p>"
