abstract:
- content: "<p>As the connected car and autonomous car technologies grows, many car
    manufacturers are interested in in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) services. In addition,
    car-sharing services are expected to attract attention in the future automotive
    industry. The devices and contents in the car are frequently used not only by
    the car owner but also by others. Automobile manufacturers are currently researching
    on developing their own IVI service platforms. Contrary to these trends, however,
    IVI services present a risk that anyone can access the IVI services and lack scalability
    with other manufacturers. In this document, we introduce the system which provide
    the basic function that can be commonly used in IVI services growing very rapidly.
    This system is consisting of master, device and user. This system Users are categorized
    into different types, and services provided by devices have different levels.
    These are registered and managed by master. So, users are delivered different
    services according to user type. In addition, devices can be dynamically registered
    and deregistered to the master.</p>"
