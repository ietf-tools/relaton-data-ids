abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC5648 extends MIPv6 with the ability for a Mobile Node to register
    Multiple Care-of Addresses with its Home Agent and Correspondent Node(s). RFC
    5648 also introduces the notion of a Home Binding that is essentially a binding
    on the Home Link, where the Care-of Address is set to the Home Address of the
    Mobile Node. A Mobile Node uses such a Home Binding together with one or more
    Multiple Care-of Address binding(s) to be able to use simultaneously both the
    Home Link and one or more visited link(s). The description of the Home Binding
    in a section of RFC 5846 entitled "Returning Home: Simultaneous Home and Visited
    Link Operation" seems to imply that a Home Binding can only be legitimately created
    while returning home and maintaining simultaneous bindings on one or more visited
    link(s). There is however no specific reason to prevent creation of such a Home
    Binding when the Mobile Node is only attached to the Home Link and does not have
    any interface attached to a visited link. Moreover, there is a specific use case
    for the creation of such a Lone Home Binding. This specification explicits the
    use case for creation of a Lone Home Binding, and clarifies the protocol behavior
    of Mobile IPv6 nodes (Mobile Node, Home Agent, Correspondent Node) involved with
    its creation.</p>'
