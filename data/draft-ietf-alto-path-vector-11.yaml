abstract:
- content: <p>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization protocol [RFC7285]. The current ALTO Cost Services only allow applications
    to obtain cost values on an end-to-end path defined by its source and destination.
    The present extension provides abstracted information on particular network components
    or elements traversed by a path between its source and destination. Examples of
    such abstracted components are networks, data centers or links. This is useful
    for applications whose performance is impacted by particular network components
    they traverse or by their properties. Applications having the choice among several
    connection paths may use this information to select paths accordingly and improve
    their performance. In particular, they may infer that several paths share common
    links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths. This document introduces
    a new cost type called Path Vector. A Path Vector is an array of entities that
    each identifies an abstracted representation of a network part and that are called
    Abstract Network Element (ANE). Each ANE is defined by a set of properties. ANE
    properties are conveyed by an ALTO information resource called "Property Map",
    that can be packed together with the Path Vectors in a multipart response. They
    can also be obtained via a separate ALTO request to a Property Map. An ALTO Property
    Map is an extension to the ALTO protocol, that is specified in another document
    entitled "Unified Properties for the ALTO Protocol" [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new].</p>
