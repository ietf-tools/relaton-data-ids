abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new option to the IP Control Protocol (IPCP)
    which can be used by mobile nodes to allow more efficient use of PPP along with
    the mobile-IP protocol. The new option allows the mobile IP peers to negotiate
    the use of mobile IP protocol over a PPP link. This option allows a requesting
    peer to determine if the responding peer is capable of and willing to perform
    either home or foreign agent functions of mobile IP. As part of this transaction,
    the requesting peer provides its own IP address to the responding peer and requests
    a care-of address from the responding peer.</p>"
