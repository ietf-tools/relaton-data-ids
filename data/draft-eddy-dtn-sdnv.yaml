abstract:
- content: "<p>Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced
    as a field type within proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols. The basic
    goal of an SDNV is to hold a non-negative integer value of arbitrary magnitude,
    without consuming much more space than necessary. The primary motivation is to
    conserve the bits sent across low-capacity or energy-intensive links typical of
    NASA deep- space missions, with a secondary goal of allowing the protocol to automatically
    adjust to unforseen usage scenarios. This can be desirable in that it allows protocol
    designers to avoid making difficult and potentially erroneous engineering decisions
    that may have to be hacked around in the future. This document describes formats
    and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, and discusses implementation and
    usage of SDNVs.</p>"
