abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a user
    agent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a remote host
    that has opted-in to communications from that code. The security model used for
    this is the Origin-based security model commonly used by Web browsers. The protocol
    consists of an initial handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over
    TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications
    that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple
    HTTP connections (e.g. using XMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).
    Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
