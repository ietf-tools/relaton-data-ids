abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec and SRTP use out-of-band key management. Synchronization of group
    security associations is an issue when out-of-band key management protocols are
    used. In case of rapid or unplanned rekeying, some members may not receive the
    key updates in time to decrypt the IPsec or SRTP traffic. To address that problem,
    this document describes a strawman proposal to carry group key updates as part
    of IPsec and SRTP.</p>"
