abstract:
- content: "<p>Many traditional, centrally-managed blacklists and whitelists describe
    Internet end-points by characteristics such as connectivity type or network function,
    and these characteristics are often used to infer behavior from which authorization
    is derived. However, it is often the case that connectivity type or network function
    are not related to good or bad behavior. This document describes a means of creating
    blacklists and whitelists representative of Internet end-points based on observed
    behavior by many participants in a distributed monitoring network. The authors
    hope that distributed lists will mitigate some of the problems associated with
    existing centrally managed lists. While the concept, architecture, and data model
    are general enough to be applied to any type of network service, the authors of
    this document are specifically addressing the problem of spam in blogs.</p>"
