abstract:
- content: "<p>The NSIS working group is considering protocol developments in signaling
    for resources for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The requirements
    for such signaling are being developed in a separate document [2]; This Internet
    Draft proposes a framework for such signaling. This initial version provides a
    model for describing the entities that take part in the signaling and the ways
    in which they can be used in different modes of operation. It also discusses the
    overall structure of such a signaling protocol. Finally, it considers the possible
    interactions of NSIS signaling with other protocols and functions, including security
    issues.</p>"
