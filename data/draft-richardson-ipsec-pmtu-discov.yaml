abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the problem of getting accurate Path MTU infor-
    mation in the presence of untrusted routers. Typical Path MTU discovery is done
    by sending packets with the don't fragment bit set, and listen- ing for ICMP messages
    from routers that want to fragment the packets. Unfortunately, these messages
    could be forged, and IPsec based security system(s) can not pass make direct use
    of these messages. An alternate, backwards compatible algorithm is suggested.</p>"
