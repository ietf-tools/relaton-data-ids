abstract:
- content: "<p>[This version of the document is a draft version for an RFC6044bis
    that will describe the mapping between the Diversion header defined in RFC5806
    and the new History-Info header defined in RFC7044.] Although the SIP History-Info
    header is the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless
    already implemented and used for conveying call diversion related information
    in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. This document describes a
    recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header and the History-Info
    header to handle call diversion information. In addition, an interworking policy
    is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence. The non-standard Diversion header
    is described, as Historic, in [RFC5806]. The History-Info header is described
    in [RFC7044] that obsoletes [RFC4244] initially describing the History-Info header.
    [RFC7044] defines an optional SIP header field, History-Info, for capturing the
    history information in requests and SIP header field parameters for the History-Info
    and Contact header fields to tag the method by which the target of a request is
    determined. RFC7044 also defines a value for the Privacy header field that directs
    the anonymization of values in the History-Info header field. Since the Diversion
    header is used in existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion
    information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution
    is needed. This work is intended to enable the migration from non- standard implementations
    and deployment toward IETF specification- based implementations and deployment.
    This document obsoletes [RFC6044].</p>"
