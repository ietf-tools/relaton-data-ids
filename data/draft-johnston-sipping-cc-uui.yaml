abstract:
- content: "<p>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information
    Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed. As networks move to SIP it is
    important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP
    networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-
    end transparency. This document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirements
    defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document. A new SIP header
    field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.</p>"
