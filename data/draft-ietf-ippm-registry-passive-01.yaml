abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry
    of the Performance Metric Registry. This sub-registry contains Passive Performance
    Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly applicable to other IETF metrics.
    This document specifies a way to organize registry entries into columns that are
    well-defined, permitting consistent development of entries over time (a column
    may be marked NA if it is not applicable for that metric). The design is intended
    to foster development of registry entries based on existing reference RFCs, whilst
    each column serves as a check-list item to avoid omissions during the registration
    process. Every entry in the registry, before IANA action, requires Expert review
    as defined by concurrent IETF work in progress "Registry for Performance Metrics"
    (draft-ietf-ippm-metric- registry). The document contains example entries for
    the Passive Performance Metrics sub-registry: a registry entry for a passive metric
    based on octetTotalCount as defined in RFC5102 and a protocol specific passive
    metric based on RTP packets lost as defined in RFC3550. The examples are for Informational
    purposes and do not create any entry in the IANA registry.</p>'
