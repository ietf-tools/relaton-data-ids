abstract:
- content: "<p>The centralized traffic engineering technology adopts centralized calculation,
    PCE/SDN performs centralized calculation based on the collected link-status and
    TE information collected by BGP-LS/IGP, so that the traffic in the network is
    optimized to the optimization goal. The distributed traffic engineering technology
    uses IGP to calculate the shortest path. Each node in the network calculates the
    next hop to a destination address based on the same algorithm and network topology.
    Each algorithm can calculate a shortest path tree in the entire network, which
    can reduce the amount of calculation, so that the hard convergence time of TE
    can be close to the convergence time of IGP. The distributed computing and management
    methods can not co-ordinate management of network bandwidth resources. As a result,
    network bandwidth resources can not be planned in an integrated manner, bandwidth
    resources are wasted, and even tunnels cannot be established. This document attempts
    to discuss a automatic network optimization function of the distributed traffic
    engineering technology by the method of dynamically adjusting the link Metric.</p>"
