abstract:
- content: <p>The link quality mechanism of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood
    Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables "ignoring" some 1-hop neighbors if the measured
    link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold while still
    retaining the corresponding link information as acquired from the HELLO message
    exchange. This allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link
    quality later improves sufficiently. NHDP also collects information about symmetric
    2-hop neighbors. However, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor
    ceases being symmetric, including while "ignored" (as described above), then corresponding
    symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed. This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood
    information being permanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received)
    if the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold,
    even if only for a moment. This specification updates RFC 6130 "Mobile Ad Hoc
    Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)" and RFC 7181 "The Optimized
    Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2)" to permit, as an option, retaining,
    but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality from the corresponding
    1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold. This allows immediate reinstatement
    of the symmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently,
    thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more "robust".</p>
