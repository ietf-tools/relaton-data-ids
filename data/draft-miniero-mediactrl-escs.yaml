- content: "<p>This document provides with a list of more or less detailed Media Control
    Channel Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework] call flows. It aims
    at being a simple guide throughout the use of the interface between Application
    Servers and MEDIACTRL-based Media Servers, as well as a hopefully helpful base
    reference documentation for both implementors and protocol researchers.</p>"
