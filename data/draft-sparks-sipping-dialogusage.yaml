abstract:
- content: "<p>Several methods in the Session Initiation Protocol can create an association
    between endpoints known as a dialog. Some of these methods can also create a new
    association within an existing dialog. These multiple associations, or dialog
    usages, require carefully coordinated processing as they have independent life-cycles,
    but share common dialog state. This memo argues that multiple dialog usages should
    be avoided. It discusses alternatives to their use and clarifies essential behavior
    for elements that cannot currently avoid them.</p>"
