abstract:
- content: "<p>CASP is a modular potocol for establishing network control state along
    a data path between two nodes communicating on the Internet. The signalling problem
    addressed by CASP is the same as the overall problem being addressed by the NSIS
    activities. The CASP framework is defined as a modular protocol, which includes
    a general purpose messaging layer (M-layer), which supports a number of client
    layers for particular signalling applications (e.g. QoS, MIDCOM). In addition
    there is distinct, special purpose client component for next-peer discovery.</p>"
