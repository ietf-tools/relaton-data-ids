abstract:
- content: "<p>Most pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
    the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to the emulation,
    to inhibit Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior, and to discriminate Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) from Pseudowire (PW) packets. However, some
    encapsulations treat the Control Word as optional. As a result, implementations
    of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer,
    equipment model and service provider network. Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity
    Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity
    Verification (CV) Types. This flexibility has led to reports of interoperability
    issues within deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the
    situation. This survey of the PW/ VCCV user community was conducted to determine
    implementation trends. The survey and results is presented herein.</p>"
