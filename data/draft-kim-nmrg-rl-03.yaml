abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes intelligent network management system to autonomously
    manage and monitor using machine learning techniques. Reinforcement learning is
    one of the machine learning techniques that can provide autonomously management
    with multi-agent path-planning over a communication network. According to intelligent
    distributed multi-agent system, the main centralized node called by the global
    environment should not only manage all agents workflow in a hybrid peer-to-peer
    networking architecture and, but transfer and share information in distributed
    nodes. All agents in distributed nodes are able to be provided with a cumulative
    reward for each action that a given agent takes with respect to an optimized knowledge
    based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning process. The optimized and trained
    knowledge would be involved with a large state information by the control action
    over a network. A reward from the global environment is reflected to the next
    optimized control action autonomously for network management in distributed networking
    nodes. The Reinforcement Learning(RL) Process have developed and expanded to Deep
    Reinforcement Learning(DRL) with model-driven or data-driven technical approaches
    for learning process. The trendy technique has been widely to attempt and apply
    to networking fields since Deep Reinforcement Learning can be used in practical
    networking areas beyond dynamics and heterogeneous environment disturbances, so
    that in the technique can be intelligently learned in the effective strategy.</p>"
