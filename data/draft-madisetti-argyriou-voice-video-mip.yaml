abstract:
- content: "<p>Transmission of voice, video and other real-time multimedia data over
    IP networks is gaining much importance, and Quality of Service (QoS) issues are
    further compromised when wireless and mobility issues are also included into the
    picture. A unified approach, VoMo, to addressing QoS through consideration of
    appropriate signaling, control and data transmission is presented, that has the
    additional benefits of compliance with current IP network infrastructure through
    recently proposed IETF protocols, such as Stream Control Tranmission Protocol
    (SCTP)[RFC2960] and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)[RFC2543].</p>"
