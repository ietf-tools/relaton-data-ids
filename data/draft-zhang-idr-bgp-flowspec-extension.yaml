abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional QoS technology can not achieve fine adjustment in the traffic
    scheduling, and has a large amount of configuration and poor maintainability.
    BGP FlowSpec technology provides a wealth of filtering conditions and processing
    actions, using BGP network layer reachable information (NLRI) to transmit traffic
    filtering information, which can achieve a more fine-grained control of the traffic
    and improve maintainability. This document defines the extension of BGP FlowSpec,
    adding new traffic filtering actions for extended community: minimum bandwidth
    guarantee and congestion management, to enable better management and scheduling
    of traffic, further improving the scalability and applicability of FlowSpec.</p>"
