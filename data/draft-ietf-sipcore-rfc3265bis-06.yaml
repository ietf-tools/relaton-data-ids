abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible framework by
    which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain
    events have occurred. Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein
    are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event
    subscription and notification. This document represents a backwards-compatible
    improvement on the original mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account
    several years of implementation experience. Accordingly, this document obsoletes
    RFC 3265. This document also updates RFC 4660 slightly to accommodate some small
    changes to the mechanism that were discussed in that document.</p>"
