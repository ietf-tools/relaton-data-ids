abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Generic Tunnel Tracing Protocol (GTTP).
    GTTP supports enhanced route-tracing applications. Network operators use enhanced
    route-tracing applications to trace the path between any two points on an IP network.
    Enhanced route-tracing applications can trace through a network's forwarding plane,
    its control plane or both. Furthermore, enhanced route-tracing applications can
    reveal details concerning tunnels that support the traced path. Tunnel details
    can be revealed regardless of tunneling technology. For example, enhanced route-tracing
    applications can trace through an MPLS LSP as well as they can trace through an
    IP-in-IP tunnel.</p>"
