abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IPv4 addressing dependencies in an attempt
    to clarify the necessary steps in re-designing and re-implementing specifications
    to become network address independent, or at least, to dually support IPv4 and
    IPv6. This transition requires several interim steps, one of them being the evolution
    of current IPv4 dependent specifications to a format independent of the type of
    IP addressing schema used. Hence, it is hoped that specifications will be re-designed
    and re-implemented to become network address independent, or at least to dually
    support IPv4 and IPv6. To achieve that step, it is necessary to survey and document
    all IPv4 dependencies experienced by current standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed)
    as well as Experimental RFCs. Hence, this document describes IPv4 addressing dependencies
    that deployed IETF Application Area documented Standards may experience. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
