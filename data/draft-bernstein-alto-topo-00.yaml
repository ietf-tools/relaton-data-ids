abstract:
- content: "<p>Exposing additional topology information of networks to applications
    and users beyond that of the current ALTO protocol can enable many important existing
    and emerging use cases, and many network providers already provide additional
    information about their networks. At the same time, there is no standard for exposing
    network topology in a manner that provides simplification via abstraction to the
    application layer and information hiding via abstraction to the network provider.
    In this document, we provide a survey of use-cases for extended network topology
    information, present some initial requirements for such services, and then give
    a framework of how to integrate such an extended ALTO topology service with network
    control infrastructure.</p>"
