abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non- Queue-Building
    Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB). The NQB PHB provides a shallow-buffered, best-effort
    service as a complement to a Default deep-buffered best-effort service for Internet
    services. The purpose of this NQB PHB is to provide a separate queue that enables
    smooth (i.e. non-bursty), low-data-rate, application-limited traffic flows, which
    would ordinarily share a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking traffic, to avoid
    the latency, latency variation and loss caused by such traffic. This PHB is implemented
    without prioritization and can be implemented without rate policing, making it
    suitable for environments where the use of these features is restricted. The NQB
    PHB has been developed primarily for use by access network segments, where queuing
    delays and queuing loss caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested, but
    its use is not limited to such segments. In particular, applications to cable
    broadband links, Wi- Fi links, and mobile network radio and core segments are
    discussed. This document recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code Point
    (DSCP) to identify Non-Queue-Building flows. [NOTE (to be removed by RFC-Editor):
    This document references an ISE submission draft (I-D.briscoe-docsis-q-protection)
    that is approved for publication as an RFC. This draft should be held for publication
    until the queue protection RFC can be referenced.]</p>"
