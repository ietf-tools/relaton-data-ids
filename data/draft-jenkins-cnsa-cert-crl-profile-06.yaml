abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and
    X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use with the United States National
    Security Agency's Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite. The profile
    applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of
    US National Security Systems that employ such X.509 certificates. US National
    Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also
    appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information.
    It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and
    any other system deployments.</p>"
