abstract:
- content: "<p>The need to support L2VPN services with disparate Attachment Circuits
    (heterogeneous transport) is becoming as important as the support of L2VPN services
    with the same type of Attachment Circuits (homogenous transport). To support L2VPN
    services with heterogeneous transport, some means of interworking is needed. The
    requirement to support L2VPN interworking is stated in [PPVPN-L2FRWK]. This document
    describes different approaches and mechanisms that can be used to provide L2VPN
    interworking among disparate interfaces.</p>"
