abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used by a network
    operator to configure a VPN service at one layer interconnecting VPN service at
    another layer and manage how a hybrid VPN service is engineered in the network
    [RFC8309]. This model is intended to be instantiated at the management system
    to deliver the overall service. It is not a configuration model to be used directly
    on network elements. This model provides an abstracted view of VPN service configuration
    components at different layer. It is up to a management system to take this as
    an input and generate specific configurations models to configure the different
    network elements to deliver the service. How configuration of network elements
    is done is out of scope of the document.</p>"
