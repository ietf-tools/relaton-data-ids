abstract:
- content: "<p>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with
    the NETCONF protocol requires a structured data modeling environment which promotes
    human usability, multi-vendor interoperability, and reuse of existing IETF data
    models written in SMIv2. The Network Configuration Extensions (NCX) are a set
    of specifications intended to address NETCONF data modeling issues. This document
    defines a Structure of Management Information (SMI) suitable for use with the
    NETCONF protocol, intended to promote a more consistent, manageable, and interoperable
    infra-structure for ongoing development of NETCONF- based management interfaces.</p>"
