abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a generic OpenPGP certificate store that can
    be shared between implementations. It also defines a way to root trust, and a
    way to associate petnames with certificates. Sharing certificates and trust decisions
    increases security by enabling more applications to take advantage of OpenPGP.
    It also improves privacy by reducing the required certificate discoveries that
    go out to the network.</p>"
