abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines procedures for fast reroute protection of Point-To-MultiPoint
    (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE-LSP) in MultiProtocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) networks, based upon Point-To-MultiPoint Bypass Tunnels. The
    motivation for using P2MP Bypass Tunnels is to avoid potentially expensive data
    duplication along the backup path that could occur if Point-To-Point Bypass Tunnels
    were used, i.e., to optimize the bandwidth usage, during fast reroute protection
    of a link or a node. During link or node failure the traffic carried onto a protected
    P2MP TE-LSP is tunnelled within one or several P2MP Bypass Tunnels towards a set
    of Merge Points. To avoid data duplication, backup labels (i.e., inner labels)
    are assigned by the Point of Local Repair (PLR) according to the RSVP-TE upstream
    label assignment procedure.</p>"
