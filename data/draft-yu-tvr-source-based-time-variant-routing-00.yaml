abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a source-based time variant routing methodology
    that can be used in a network with predicted variations. By using source-based
    time variant routing, the source node uses stable information (e.g. orbit of satellite)
    to calculate the forwarding path between source and destination nodes. The intermediate
    node does not need to maintain routing information, such that in case of neighbor
    variations (restoration, activation, change of quality, or loss), there are no
    routing information changes. The routing decision is done by the source node.
    This makes building a highly scalable network with predicted variations possible
    (e.g. tens of thousands of satellites).</p>"
