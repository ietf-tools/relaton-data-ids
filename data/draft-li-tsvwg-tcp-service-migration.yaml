abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new transport protocol TSMP, which seeks to
    support data transfer for the emerging usage paradigm of "single user, multiple
    device" in a TCP compatible manner. Through its novel proxy-based design, TSMP
    is able to retain the current client and server protocol operations of the legacy
    TCP protocol and TCP-based applications while placing new functions at the proxy.</p>
