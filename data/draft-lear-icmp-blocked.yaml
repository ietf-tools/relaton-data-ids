abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the introduction of private addresses[1] the use of NATs and
    firewalls has introduced not only inability to communicate using certain mechanisms,
    such as AH[2], ESP[3], and H.323[4], but also difficulty in determining the reason
    for the failed communication. This document specifies methods an intermediate
    device such as a router, a firewall, or a NAT may use to inform end hosts that
    a particular type of communication is not possible. It also recommends practices
    for both the frequency of transmission of such error notices, and their consumption
    by the end hosts. This document is an outgrowth of the 'foglamps' discussion that
    occurred within the IETF between late 1999 and 2000, and is not the product of
    a working group.</p>"
