abstract:
- content: "<p>The IAB charset workshop [IAB-CHARSET] concluded that for human readable
    text there should always be a way to specify the natural language. Many protocols
    are designed with an attribute-value model (including RFC 822, HTTP, LDAP, SNMP,
    DHCP, and ACAP) which stores many small human readable text strings. The primary
    function of an attribute-value model is to simplify both extensibility and searchability.
    A solution is needed to provide language tags in these small human readable text
    strings, which does not interfere with these primary functions. This specification
    defines MLSF (Multi-Lingual String Format) which applies another layer of encoding
    on top of UTF-8 [UTF-8] to permit the addition of language tags anywhere within
    a text string. In addition, it defines an alternate form which can be used to
    include alternative representations of the same text in different character sets.
    MLSF has the property that UTF-8 is a proper subset of MLSF. This preserves the
    searchability requirement of the attribute-value model. Appendix F of this document
    includes a brief discussion of the background behind MLSF and why some other potential
    solutions were rejected for this purpose.</p>"
