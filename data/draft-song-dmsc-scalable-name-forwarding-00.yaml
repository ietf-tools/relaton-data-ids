abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a scalable approach to name-based packet forwarding,
    a fundamental component of content semantic network architectures. Unlike IP-based
    forwarding, name-based forwarding must address the challenges of handling variable-length,
    unbounded keys and significantly larger namespaces. The proposed approach leverages
    two key insights to enable scalable forwarding for billions of prefixes. First,
    by representing names as binary strings, forwarding tables with millions of entries
    can be effectively compressed using Patricia tries to fit within contemporary
    line card memory. Second, the data structure is designed and optimized to ensure
    its size is dependent only on the number of rules, not the length of the rules
    themselves.</p>"
