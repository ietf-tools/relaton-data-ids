abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP's intertwined error and congestion control is not robust against
    spurious timeouts nor is it robust against packet re-orderings. A packet that
    is delayed in the network beyond the expiration of TCP's retransmission timer,
    is mistaken for a packet loss by a TCP sender. Also, a packet that is re-ordered
    in the network beyond TCP's duplicate acknowledgment threshold, is eventually
    mistaken for a packet loss by a TCP sender. Both situations lead to a spurious
    retransmit of the oldest outstanding segment, and an unnecessary reduction of
    the congestion window at the sender. Moreover, a spurious timeout forces the sender
    into a go-back-N retransmission mode leading to spurious retransmits of all outstanding
    segments.</p>"
