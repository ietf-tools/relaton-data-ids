abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS protocol provides authentication and data protection for communication
    between two entities. However, missing from the protocol is a way to perform non-repudiation
    service. This document defines extensions to the TLS protocol to allow it to perform
    non-repudiation service. It is based on [TLSSIGN] and it provides the client and
    the server the ability to sign by TLS, handshake and applications data using certificates
    such as X.509.</p>"
