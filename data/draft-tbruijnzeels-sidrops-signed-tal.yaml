abstract:
- content: "<p>Trust Anchor Locators (TALs) [RFC7730] are used by Relying Parties
    in the RPKI to locate and validate Trust Anchor certificates used in RPKI validation.
    This document defines an RPKI signed object [RFC6488] for a Trust Anchor Locator
    (TAL) that can be published by Trust Anchor to communicate a new TAL to already
    deployed Relying Parties. The two primary use cases for this are that 1) a Trust
    Anchor may wish to change the locations where its TA certificate may be found,
    and 2) a Trust Anchor may wish to perform a planned migration to a new key. Note
    that unplanned key rolls are considered out of scope for this document.</p>"
