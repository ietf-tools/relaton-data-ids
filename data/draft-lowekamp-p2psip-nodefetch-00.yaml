abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of methods for Node-specific operations
    as part of the REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol. This document
    defines NodeFetch, NodeStore, and NodeRemove methods that allows manipuation of
    Node specific usage data. These methods will be useful for multiple diagnostic,
    administrative, and discovery usages. Because of their usefulness for a variety
    of expected usages, these methods are advanced for inclusion in the base RELOAD
    protocol.</p>"
