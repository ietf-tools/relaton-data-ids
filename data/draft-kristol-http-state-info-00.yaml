abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP, the protocol that underpins the World-Wide Web (WWW), is stateless.
    That is, each request stands on its own; origin servers don't need to remember
    what happened with previous requests to service a new one. Statelessness is a
    mixed blessing, because there are potential WWW applications, like ``shopping
    baskets'' and library browsing, for which the history of a user's actions is useful
    or essential. This proposal outlines a way to introduce state into HTTP. A new
    request/response header, State-Info, carries the state back and forth, thus relieving
    the origin server from needing to keep an extensive per-user or per-connection
    database. The changes required to user agents, origin servers, and proxy servers
    to support State-Info are very modest.</p>"
