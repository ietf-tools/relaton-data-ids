abstract:
- content: "<p>The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of
    IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4. Nodes will be able
    to be deployed with IPv6 addresses, but will still need to communicate with IPv4
    nodes that do not have a dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. This specification
    defines a mechanism called Assignment of IPv4 Global Addresses to IPv6 Hosts (AIIH),
    which will assign an IPv6 Host a temporary IPv4 Global Address, which can be used
    to communicate with a Host that supports IPv4 or IPv4/IPv6. An objective of this
    specification is to avoid the use of address translation for the deployment of
    IPv6 in a network. Another objective is to demonstrate that IPv6 Addresses can
    be deployed now instead of non-Global IPv4 Addresses within an Intranet.</p>"
