abstract:
- content: <p>In certain models of inter-provider Multi- Protocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) spoofing attack against VPN sites
    is a key concern. For example, MPLS-based VPN inter- provider model "C" for VPLS,
    or any L2 VPN purpose is not favoured, owing to security concerns in the dataplane,
    even though it can scale with respect to maintenance of routing state. Since the
    inner labels associated with VPN sites are not encrypted during transmission,
    a man-in-the-middle attacker can spoof packets to a specific L2 VPN site. In this
    paper, we propose a label-hopping technique which uses a set of randomized labels
    and a method for hopping amongst these labels using the time instant the packet
    leaves the port from a sending Provider Edge Router. To prevent the attacker from
    identifying the labels in polynomial time, we also use an additional label. The
    proposed technique can be applied to other variants of inter-provider MPLS based
    VPNs where Multi-Protocol exterior-BGP (MP- eBGP) multi-hop is used. As we address
    a key security concern, we can make a case for the deployment of MPLS based L2
    VPN inter-provider model "C". Specifically we use the TicToc based Precision Time
    Protocol LSP to provide the timing for determining the time instant at which the
    packet is sent from the remote end Provider Edge Router and hence calculating
    when it must have left that peer at the Provider Edge Router in the near / receiving
    end. This version of the document suggests a better method for gaining more finely
    granular time slices. This is done by running the PTP LSP between the ASBRs in
    the ASes that are providing the inter-AS L2VPN service.</p>
