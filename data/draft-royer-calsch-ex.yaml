abstract:
- content: "<p>A proposal to specify booked persistent data in calendar stores to
    track 'SEQUENCE' and 'DTSTAMP' property values for CUAs with direct access to
    calendar stores. With iMIP the iCalendar CUA's do not see the others stored CS
    data. With WebDAV, HTTP, or FTP access, the CUA can see into the public data of
    other calendars. The storage of persistent data mandated by [iTIP] has not been
    standardized yet. This memo proposes a way to standardize on those persistent
    items. Also included are ways to make the various ways of using the [iCAL] and
    [iTIP] 'RECURRENCE-ID' property work between vendors and to document the procedures
    to work with 'RECURRENCE-ID's. Comments about this proposed standard should be
    sent to the 'calsch@ietf.org' mailing list.</p>"
