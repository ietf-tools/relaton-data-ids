abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Provider requirements for support of DiffServ aware MPLS Traffic
    Engineering (MPLS-DS-TE) are presented in [MPLS-DS-TE-REQ]. This initiative includes
    the definition of MPLS-DiffServ-TE class types (CTs), wherein CTs are defined
    as aggregations of individual service classes. Instead of having per-class parameters
    being configured and propagated on each LSR interface, classes are aggregated
    into CTs having common per-CT parameters (e.g., minimum bandwidth) to satisfy
    required performance levels, however, no bandwidth requirements are enforced for
    classes within a CT. The main motivation for grouping a set of classes into a
    CT is to improve the scalability of IGP LSAs by propagating information on a per-CT
    basis instead of on a per-class basis, and also to allow better bandwidth sharing
    between classes in the same CT. In order to further improve scalability through
    the introduction of CTs, we propose to a) limit the number of CTs to 6, and b)
    to generalize the notion of CTs and consider them to be a combination of i) DiffServ/queuing
    priority per-hop-behaviors (PHBs), ii) QoS classes (e.g., as specified in [Y.1541]),
    iii) admission-control priority classes, and iv) restoration priority classes
    at both the MPLS-LSP and transport link level.</p>"
