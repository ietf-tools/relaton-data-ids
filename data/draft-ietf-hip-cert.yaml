abstract:
- content: "<p>The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital certificates.
    It is used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP) control
    packets. This document specifies the CERT parameter and the error signaling in
    case of a failed verification. Additionally, this document specifies the representations
    of Host Identity Tags in X.509 version 3 (v3) and Simple Public Key Infrastructure
    (SPKI) certificates. The concrete use of certificates, including how certificates
    are obtained, requested, and which actions are taken upon successful or failed
    verification, is specific to the scenario in which the certificates are used.
    Hence, the definition of these scenario- specific aspects is left to the documents
    that use the CERT parameter. This document updates RFC 5201. This document defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
