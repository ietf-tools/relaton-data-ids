abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement for non-realtime communication
    between systems that are generally disconnected, requiring multiple network hops
    between source and destination, that may never be fully connected end-to-end at
    any given time. This document describes a number of use cases that motivate having
    a standard method to communicate between such systems, as multi- organization
    and multi-vendor support and interoperability is highly desirable. These include
    dismounted soldiers, sensorwebs, medical devices, animal tracking, low-earth-orbiting
    satellites and data mule scenarios. To avoid confusion in terminology when trying
    to focus on the problem and requirements without bias towards particular technical
    solutions, at this time, we refer to the protocol instances that would support
    such communications as Store, Carry, and Forwarding (SCF) agents, and refer to
    their activity as SCF networking. The concepts involved in SCF networking are
    not entirely new and several facets of the problem have been solved in multiple
    incompatible ways in existing or historic systems. This document describes the
    core SCF problem and gives an assessment of the ability to use existing technologies
    as solutions.</p>"
