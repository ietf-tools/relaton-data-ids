abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to address an approach for the reorganization of
    the entire network in a large address space. It describes how a three-tier mesh
    structured hierarchy can be established based on fragmenting the entire space
    into some regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It addresses issues
    which could be relevant to this architecture in the context of IPv6. This document
    also tries to come out with an approach how IP switch based network can perform
    as good as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.</p>"
