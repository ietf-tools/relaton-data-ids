abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Address Translators (NATs) are widely deployed to share scarce
    public IPv4 addresses among multiple end hosts. They overwrite IP addresses and
    ports in IP packets to do so. QUIC is a protocol on top of UDP that provides transport-like
    services. QUIC is better-behaved in the presence of NATs than older protocols,
    and existing UDP NATs should operate without incident if unmodified. QUIC offers
    additional features that may tempt NAT implementers as potential optimizations.
    However, in practice, leveraging these features will lead to new connection failure
    modes and security vulnerabilities.</p>"
