abstract:
- content: "<p>The Shim6 protocol provides for locator agility while satisfying the
    'first, do no harm' security requirements. This document outlines three rather
    orthogonal sets of extensions to Shim6. The first one is how to procide complete
    separation between identifiers and locators. The second one is how to allow routers
    to rewrite the locators in the shim6 packets as a way to provide traffic engineering
    information to the hosts. The third one is the outline of a simple extension to
    allow shim6, with a CGA upper-layer ID, to operate using IPv4 addresses as locators.
    The purpose of this outline is to stimulate discussions.</p>"
