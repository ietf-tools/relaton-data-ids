abstract:
- content: "<p>The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which use BIER
    natively in IPv6. This document is intended to help the WG with this effort by
    specifying requirements for transporting packets, with Bit Index Explicit Replication
    (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment. There will be a need to send IPv6 payloads,
    to multiple IPv6 destinations, using BIER. There have been several proposed solutions
    in this area. But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem and
    lists the requirements. The goal of this document is to describe the BIER IPv6
    requirements and summarize the pro's and con's of the proposed solutions.</p>"
