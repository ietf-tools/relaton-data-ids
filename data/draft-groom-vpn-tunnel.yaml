abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a proposed solution for measuring the performance
    of a VPN tunnel, in terms of latency, packet loss and availability, using a standards
    based methodology. Although various vendors have provided methods of measuring
    VPN performance, all of them use either proprietary protocols or bespoke software.
    This paper proposes a standards based solution that can be easily integrated into
    an NMS (Network Management System).</p>"
