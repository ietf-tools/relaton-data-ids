abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the potential of Information-Centric Networking
    (ICN) to enhance interoperability between metaverse platforms. ICN's content-centric
    approach, in-network caching, and inherent security features can address key challenges
    such as scalability, low-latency performance, data ownership, and standardization
    needs. It also identifies these challenges and proposes solutions to optimize
    data sharing, enable efficient content distribution, and enforce secure access
    controls.</p>"
