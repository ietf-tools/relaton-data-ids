abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet has been successful beyond even the most optimistic expectations
    and is intertwined with many aspects of our society. But although the world-wide
    communication system guarantees global reachability, the Internet has not primarily
    been built with security and high availability in mind. The next-generation inter-network
    architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next- generation networks)
    aims to address these issues. SCION was explicitly designed from the outset to
    offer security and availability by default. The architecture provides route control,
    failure isolation, and trust information for end-to-end communication. It also
    enables multi-path routing between hosts. This document discusses the motivations
    behind the SCION architecture and gives a high-level overview of its fundamental
    components, including its authentication model and the setup of the control- and
    data plane. As SCION is already in production use today, the document concludes
    with an overview of SCION deployments.</p>"
