abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a multicast routing algorithm for multicast
    groups that are densely distributed across an internet. The protocol is unicast
    routing protocol independent. It is based on ESL sparse-mode [Estrin93] and employs
    the same packet formats. This protocol is called dense-mode ESL. The design is
    based largely on foundational work by Deering [Deering91].</p>"
