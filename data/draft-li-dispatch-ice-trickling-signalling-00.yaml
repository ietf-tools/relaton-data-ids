abstract:
- content: "<p>Trickle ICE is a mechanism that allows ICE agents to send and receive
    candidates incrementally rather than exchanging complete lists. This document
    gives several solutions for trickle ICE with SIP protocol. Note Discussion and
    suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to dispatch@ietf.org.</p>"
