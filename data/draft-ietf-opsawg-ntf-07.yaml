abstract:
- content: "<p>Network telemetry is a technology for gaining network insight and facilitating
    efficient and automated network management. It encompasses various techniques
    for remote data generation, collection, correlation, and consumption. This document
    describes an architectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by challenges
    that are encountered as part of the operation of networks and by the requirements
    that ensue. Network telemetry, as necessitated by best industry practices, covers
    technologies and protocols that extend beyond conventional network Operations,
    Administration, and Management (OAM). The presented network telemetry framework
    promises flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and performance. In addition,
    it facilitates the implementation of automated control loops to address both today's
    and tomorrow's network operational needs. This document clarifies the terminologies
    and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry system from several
    different perspectives. The framework and taxonomy help to set a common ground
    for the collection of related work and provide guidance for related technique
    and standard developments.</p>"
