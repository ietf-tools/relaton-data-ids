abstract:
- content: <p>The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is tasked
    with standardizing protocols for real-time communications between Web browsers,
    generally called "WebRTC". The major use cases for WebRTC technology are real-time
    audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data transfer. Unlike most
    conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) WebRTC communications
    are directly controlled by a Web server, which poses new security challenges.
    For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows a server
    to place a video call. Unrestricted access to such an API would allow any site
    which a user visited to "bug" a user's computer, capturing any activity which
    passed in front of their camera. This document defines the WebRTC threat model
    and analyzes the security threats of WebRTC in that model.</p>
