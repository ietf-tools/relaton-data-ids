abstract:
- content: "<p>The original IPv6 conceptual sending algorithm does not do load sharing
    among equivalent IPv6 routers, and suggests schemes that can be problematic in
    practice. This document updates the conceptual sending algorithm in RFC 2461 so
    that traffic to different destinations can be distributed among routers in an
    efficient fashion. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
