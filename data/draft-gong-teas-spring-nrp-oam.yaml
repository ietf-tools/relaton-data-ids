abstract:
- content: "<p>A Network Resource Partition (NRP) represents a subset of network resources
    and associated policies within the underlay network. This document describes the
    implementation of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism
    for NRPs in Segment Routing (SR) networks. By extending existing OAM mechanisms
    such as ping, traceroute, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), and Simple
    Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), the proposed solution enables comprehensive
    NRP support in SR networks.</p>"
