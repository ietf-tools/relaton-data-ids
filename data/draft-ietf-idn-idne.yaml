abstract:
- content: "<p>The current DNS infrastructure does not provide a way to use internationalized
    domain names (IDN). This document describes an extension mechanism based on EDNS
    which enables the use of IDN without causing harm to the current DNS. IDNE enables
    IDN host names with a as many characters as current ASCII-only host names. It
    fully supports UTF-8 and conforms to the IDN requirements.</p>"
