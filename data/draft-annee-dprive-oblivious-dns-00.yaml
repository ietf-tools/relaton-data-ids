abstract:
- content: "<p>Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries,
    a number of standards have been developed and services deployed that that encrypt
    a user's DNS queries to the recursive resolver and thus obscure them from some
    network observers and from the user's Internet service provider. However, these
    systems merely transfer trust to a third party. We argue that no single party
    should be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those
    queries. To this end, this document specifies Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces
    an additional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To accomplish
    this, ODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for
    the ODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they receive,
    but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated these queries.
    The ODNS experimental protocol is compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.</p>"
