abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the motivation and requirements for a Peer-to-
    Peer (P2P) based approach for SIP registration and resource discovery using distributed
    hash tables and presents the architectural design for such a system. This design
    removes the need for central servers from SIP, while offering full backward compatibility
    with SIP, allowing reuse of existing clients, and allowing P2P enabled peers to
    communicate with conventional SIP entities. A basic introduction to the concepts
    of P2P is presented, backward compatibility issues addressed, and the security
    considerations are considered. This work is one possible implementation of the
    the protocol being discussed for creation in the proposed P2PSIP WG. In the context
    of the work being proposed, this draft would represent a concrete proposal for
    the P2PSIP Peer Protocol, using modified SIP as the underlying protocol. In this
    architecture, no P2PSIP Client Protocol is needed, rather unmodified SIP is used
    for access by non-peers. This is early work, and is less secure in many ways than
    the traditional approach to SIP, but has certain other interesting characteristics
    that may make it desirable in some situations. This work is being discussed on
    the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing list.</p>"
