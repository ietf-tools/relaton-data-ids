abstract:
- content: "<p>This document focuses on the critical challenge of migrating long-
    term security assertions with security requirements spanning over a decade, encompassing
    X.509 certificates, including those that serve as manufacturer issued certificates
    (IDevID), signed firmware/ software, and other electronic artifacts. We investigate
    a range of migration strategies, specifically hybrid cryptography and the feasibility
    of stateful Hash-Based Signatures (HBS) schemes, including its pros and cons.
    To offer a comprehensive context, we present a list of use cases centered around
    long-lived security assertions, categorize them, and evaluate them against the
    various migration strategies identified. We also aim at listing pros and cons
    associated with each method.</p>"
