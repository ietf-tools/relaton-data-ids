abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet connectivity and use of data services in 3GPP based mobile
    networks has increased rapidly as a result of smart phones, broadband service
    via HSPA and HSPA+ networks, competitive service offerings by operators and a
    large number of applications. Operators who have deployed networks based on 3GPP
    architectures are facing IPv4 address shortages. With the impending exhaustion
    of available IPv4 addresses from the registries there is an increased emphasis
    for operators to migrate to IPv6. This document describes the support for IPv6
    in 3GPP network architectures.</p>"
