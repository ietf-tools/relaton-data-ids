abstract:
- content: "<p>Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) play a critical role in securing cryptographic
    operations, including the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). This document
    examines the use of seed-based key generation in HSMs, which reduces storage requirements
    but increases computational overhead for key derivation. It explores trade-offs
    between storage efficiency and performance, addressing challenges in ephemeral
    key handling and optimization strategies for PQC signature algorithms. It also
    discusses PQC impacts to HSM firmware updates and backup.</p>"
