abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [VPLS] is used to interconnect
    systems across a wide-area or metropolitan-area network, making it appear to those
    systems as if they are interconnected on a private LAN. The systems which are
    interconnected in this way may themselves be LAN switches. If, however, the interconnected
    systems are NOT LAN switches, but rather are IP hosts or IP routers, certain simplifications
    are possible. We call this simplified type of virtual private LAN service an 'IP
    over LAN Service' (IPLS). In IPLS, as in VPLS, LAN interfaces are run in promiscuous
    mode, and frames are forwarded based on their MAC Destination Addresses. However,
    the maintenance of the MAC forwarded tables is done via signaling, rather than
    via the 'MAC Address Learning' procedures of IEEE 802.1D. Further, Address Resolution
    Protocol (ARP) messages are proxied, rather than being carried transparently.
    This draft specifies the protocols and procedures for support of the IPLS service.</p>"
