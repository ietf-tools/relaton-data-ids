abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained
    node networks (6lo) and use cases. It describes the practical deployment scenarios
    of 6lo technologies with the consideration of 6lo link layer technologies and
    identifies the requirements. In addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various link layer
    technologies such as ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave), BLE, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, LTE MTC,
    and IEEE 802.15.4e(6tisch) are widely used at constrained node networks for typical
    services. Based on these link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained
    nodes has various and practical use cases. To efficiently implement typical services,
    the applicability and consideration of several design space dimensions are described.</p>"
