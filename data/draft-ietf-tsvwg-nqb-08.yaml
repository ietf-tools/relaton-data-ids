abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies properties and characteristics of a Non- Queue-Building
    Per-Hop Behavior (NQB PHB). The purpose of this NQB PHB is to provide a separate
    queue that enables smooth, low-data- rate, application-limited traffic flows,
    which would ordinarily share a queue with bursty and capacity-seeking traffic,
    to avoid the latency, latency variation and loss caused by such traffic. This
    PHB is implemented without prioritization and without rate policing, making it
    suitable for environments where the use of either these features may be restricted.
    The NQB PHB has been developed primarily for use by access network segments, where
    queuing delays and queuing loss caused by Queue-Building protocols are manifested,
    but its use is not limited to such segments. In particular, applications to cable
    broadband links, Wi-Fi links, and mobile network radio and core segments are discussed.
    This document recommends a specific Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP)
    to identify Non-Queue- Building flows.</p>"
