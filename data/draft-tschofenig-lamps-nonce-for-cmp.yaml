abstract:
- content: "<p>Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) defines protocol messages for
    X.509v3 certificate creation and management. CMP provides interactions between
    client systems and PKI components, such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a
    Certification Authority (CA). CMP allows an RA/CA to inform an end entity about
    the information it has to provide in a certification request. When an end entity
    places attestation information in form of evidence in a certification signing
    request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the provided evidence. Attestation
    technology today often accomplishes this task via the help of nonces. This document
    specifies how nonces are provided by an RA/CA to the end entity for inclusion
    in evidence.</p>"
