abstract:
- content: "<p>At the time this document was written, numerous presence protocols
    were in use (largely as components of commercial instant messaging services),
    and little interoperability between services based on these protocols has been
    achieved. This specification defines common semantics and data formats for presence
    to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
