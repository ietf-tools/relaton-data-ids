abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a BGP speaker may verify that the Network
    Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of a prefix received from a peer is consistent
    with the allocation of IP address space as determined by the Internet Registry
    system. These verification procedures rely on the DNS to provide a repository
    of information about address space allocation provided by the Internet Registry
    system. Note that this is not a repository of announceable prefixes, but rather
    of allocation of delegated address space.</p>"
