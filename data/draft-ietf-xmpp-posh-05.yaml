abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates
    for TLS in multi-tenant environments. As a result, domains hosted in such environments
    often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service,
    not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept
    a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security. This
    document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper
    server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. While these methods
    were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
    as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other
    non-HTTP application protocols.</p>"
