abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol and architecture (HIP) proposes to add a
    cryptographic name space for network stack names. This draft observes that HIP
    can be viewed as an instance of a more general migration towards decoupling identity
    from location in the Internet architecture, and shows how other proposals (mobile
    IP, multi6, mobike, and i3) fit into this framework. We argue that if the HIP
    base protocol were to be slightly generalized, it might be useful to other related
    efforts and might allow more experimental flexibility. Specifically, an extensible
    identifier TLV, the ability to define usage profiles for the HIP handshake, and
    a relaxation of the requirements that specific HIP messages carry specific parameters
    are the three changes suggested.</p>"
