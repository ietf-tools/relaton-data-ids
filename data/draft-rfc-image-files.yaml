abstract:
- content: "<p>Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII characters
    and a fixed-width font. However, there is sometimes a need to supplement the ASCII
    text with images -- e.g., graphics, equations, or pictures. The historic solution
    to this requirement has allowed secondary PDF and/or Postscript files, but this
    approach has seldom been used because it is awkward for authors and publisher.
    This memo sugests a convenient scheme for logically including authoritative diagrams,
    illustrations, equations, or other graphics within RFCs.</p>"
