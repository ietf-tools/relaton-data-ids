abstract:
- content: "<p>JMAP (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable
    protocol that can be used for data of any type. This makes it a good fit for migrations
    or data portability use cases. However, due to its large set of features, it is
    also quite complex, which makes it difficult to explore new application domains
    in practice. The goal of this document is to provide guidelines on implementing
    essential parts of JMAP for a much lower entry barrier and more efficient implementation
    of the protocol.</p>"
