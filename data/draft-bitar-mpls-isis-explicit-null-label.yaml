abstract:
- content: "<p>There is need to support IP interfaces on the top of GMPLS packet Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs), and enable IP routing (e.g., OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE) and MPLS
    protocols on these interfaces. Traffic on an IP/MPLS interface can be user traffic
    or control traffic. In addition, it can be MPLS, IP or ISIS. Multiplexing IP and
    MPLS packets over the same LSP is supported in the current MPLS architecture.
    However, multiplexing IP, MPLS, and ISIS packets over the same LSP is not currently
    supported. This draft proposes the definition of an explicit ISIS NULL label to
    enable this type of multiplexing to take place.</p>"
