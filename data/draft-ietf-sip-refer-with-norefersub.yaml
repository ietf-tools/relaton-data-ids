abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER extension as defined in
    RFC 3515 automatically establishes a typically short-lived event subscription
    used to notify the party sending a REFER request about the receiver's status in
    executing the transaction requested by the REFER. These notifications are not
    needed in all cases. This specification provides a way to prevent the automatic
    establishment of an event subscription and subsequent notifications using a new
    SIP extension header field that may be included in a REFER request. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
