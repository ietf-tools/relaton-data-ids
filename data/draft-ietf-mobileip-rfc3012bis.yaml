abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP, as originally specified, defines an authentication extension
    (the Mobile-Foreign Authentication extension) by which a mobile node can authenticate
    itself to a foreign agent. Unfortunately, that extension does not provide the
    foreign agent any direct guarantee that the protocol is protected from replays,
    and does not allow for the use of CHAP for authenticating portable computer devices.
    In this specification, we define extensions for the Mobile IP Agent Advertisements
    and the Registration Request that allow a foreign agent to use a challenge/response
    mechanism to authenticate the mobile node. This document obsoletes RFC 3012.</p>"
