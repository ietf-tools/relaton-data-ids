abstract:
- content: "<p>LISP upgrades the architecture of the IPvN internetworking system by
    separating location and identity, current intermingled in IPvN addresses. This
    is a change which has been identified by the IRTF as a critically necessary evolutionary
    architectural step for the Internet. In LISP, nodes have both a 'locator' (a name
    which says _where_ in the network's connectivity structure the node is) and an
    'identifier' (a name which serves only to provide a persistent handle for the
    node). A node may have more than one locator, or its locator may change over time
    (e.g. if the node is mobile), but it keeps the same identifier. One of the chief
    novelties of LISP, compared to other proposals for the separation of location
    and identity, is its approach to deploying this upgrade. In general, it is comparatively
    easy to conceive of new network designs, but much harder to devise approaches
    which will actually get deployed throughout the global network. LISP aims to achieve
    the near-ubiquitous deployment necessary for maximum exploitation of an architectural
    upgrade by i) minimizing the amount of change needed (existing hosts and routers
    can operate unmodified); and ii) by providing significant benefits to early adopters.
    This document gives additional architectural insight into LISP, and analyzes a
    number of aspects of LISP from a long-term perspective. NOTE: This is an initial
    rough draft, a much better version will be out shortly.</p>"
