abstract:
- content: "<p>Mass deployment of SIP compliant devices requires a simple mechanism
    for configuring and maintaining them. For the economical success of SIP based
    devices on a large scale, a platform independent mechanism for finding and exchanging
    the required information is vital. The goal of this draft is to reduce the amount
    of effort required for administrators to provision devices. This draft focuses
    on defining a common data set to configure SIP end points. The mechanism for providing
    and maintaining the configuration data to the end point is defined elsewhere [7].</p>"
