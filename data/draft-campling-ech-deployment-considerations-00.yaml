abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to inform the development of the proposed
    Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) standard that encrypts Server Name Indication (SNI)
    and other data. Data encapsulated by ECH (ie data included in the encrypted ClientHelloInner)
    is of legitimate interest to on-path security actors including anti-virus software,
    parental controls and consumer and enterprise firewalls. The document includes
    observations on current use cases for SNI data in a variety of contexts. It highlights
    how the use of that data is important to the operators of private networks and
    shows how the loss of access to SNI data will cause difficulties in the provision
    of a range of services to many millions of end-users.</p>"
