abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a product of the Path Aware Networking Research Group
    (PANRG). At the first meeting of the PANRG, the Research Group agreed to catalog
    and analyze past efforts to develop and deploy Path Aware techniques, most of
    which were unsuccessful or at most partially successful, in order to extract insights
    and lessons for Path Aware networking researchers. This document contains that
    catalog and analysis.</p>"
