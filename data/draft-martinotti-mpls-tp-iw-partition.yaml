abstract:
- content: "<p>Purpose of this ID is to illustrate deployment scenarios between network
    supporting MPLS-TP and network supporting IP/MPLS, where there is a network partitioning
    relationship between them. Main interworking aspects, issues and open points are
    highlighted. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet
    transport network.</p>"
