abstract:
- content: "<p>Cyber-physical systems and the Industrial Internet of Things are characterized
    by diverse sets of requirements which can hardly be satisfied using standard networking
    technology. One example are latency-critical computations which become increasingly
    complex and are consequently outsourced to more powerful cloud platforms for feasibility
    reasons. The intrinsic physical propagation delay to these remote sites can, however,
    already be too high for given requirements. The challenge is to develop techniques
    that bring together these requirements. Utilizing available computational capabilities
    within the network can be a solution to this challenge which makes in-network
    computing concepts a promising starting point. This document discusses select
    industrial use cases to demonstrate how in-network computing concepts can be applied
    to the industrial domain and to point out essential requirements of industrial
    applications.</p>"
