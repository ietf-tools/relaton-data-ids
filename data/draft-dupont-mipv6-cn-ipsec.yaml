- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 [1] uses IPsec [2] to protect signaling between the mobile
    node and the home agent [3]. This document defines how IPsec could be used between
    the mobile node and correspondent nodes, including home address option validation
    (aka. triangular routing), protection of mobility signaling for routing optimization
    and suitable configurations.</p>"
