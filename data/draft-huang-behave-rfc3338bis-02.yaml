abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-API" (BIA) host based protocol
    translation mechanism that allows applications supporting only one IP address
    family to communicate with peers that are reachable or supporting only the other
    address family. This specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided
    dual stack or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack network case,
    single address family applications in the host sometime will communicate directly
    with other hosts using the different address family. In the case of IPv6 only
    network or IPv6 only destination, IPv4-originated communications have to be translated
    into IPv6. Technically, the BIA-enabled host resolves both A and AAAA addresses
    of the destination and behaves according to received responses. Acknowledgement
    of previous work This document is an update to and directly derivative from Seungyun
    Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's [RFC3338],
    which similarly provides a dual stack host means to communicate with other IPv6
    host using existing IPv4 appliations.The original document was a product of the
    NGTRANS working group. The changes in this document reflect four components 1.
    Supporting IPv6 only network connections 2. IPv4 address pool use private address
    3. Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently 4. Adding an alternative
    way to implement the ENR The goal of this mechanism is the same as that of the
    Bump-in-the- stack mechanism, but this mechanism provides the translation method
    between the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. Thus, the goal is simply achieved without
    IP header translation.</p>
