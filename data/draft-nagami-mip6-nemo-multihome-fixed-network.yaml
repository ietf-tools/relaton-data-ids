abstract:
- content: "<p>Multihoming technology improves the availability of host and network
    connectivity. Since the behaviors of fixed and mobile networks differ, distinct
    architectures for each have been discussed and proposed. This document proposes
    a common architecture for both mobile and fixed networking environments, using
    mobile IP (RFC 3775) and Network Mobility (NEMO; RFC 3963). The proposed architecture
    requires a modification of mobile IP and NEMO so that multiple Care-of Addresses
    (CoAs) can be used. In addition, multiple Home Agents (HAs) that are located in
    different places are required for redundancy. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
