abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. A limited form of statefulness is useful to
    improve PCE functionality in situations in which the local TED might not be up
    to date, or in the case of concurrent requests where most of the LSPs are computed
    before the end of the set-up of the LSPs when the TED is updated. The PCE can
    retain some context from the resources assigned to Path Requests during a certain
    period of time, so that it avoids suggesting the use of the same resources for
    subsequent TE LSPs. This document proposes an extension to the PCEP protocol to
    allow the PCC to request the PCE to block or reserve the resources computed in
    a path request of a TE LSP for subsequent requests for a certain time.</p>"
