abstract:
- content: "<p>When using IPv6 within a single L2 network segment it is neccesary
    to ensure that all routers advertising their services within it are valid. In
    cases where it is not convinient or possible to use SeND [1] a rogue Router Advertisement
    (RA) [2] could be sent by accident due to misconfiguraton or ill intended. Simple
    solutions for protecting against rogue RAs are beneficial in complementing SeND
    in securing the L2 domain for ceratin types of devices or in certain transitional
    situations. This document proposes a solution to reduce the threat of rogue RAs
    by enabling layer 2 devices to forward only RAs received over designated ports.</p>"
