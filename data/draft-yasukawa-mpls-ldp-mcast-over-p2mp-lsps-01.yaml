abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) includes the facility to provision
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
    which can be used to construct P2MP tunnels across MPLS networks. The Label Distribution
    Protocol (LDP) has also been extended to support label distribution for multicast
    traffic by forming multicast LSPs. When traffic for a user network is carried
    across a provider network, it is common practice for the traffic to be placed
    in tunnels. This document examines the requirements to carry multicast LDP traffic
    across a provider network within P2MP MPLS tunnels, and introduces solution models
    that meet those requirements. Note that the requirements and solutions discussed
    in this document are also applicable to the use of multicast LDP on multi-access
    networks.</p>"
