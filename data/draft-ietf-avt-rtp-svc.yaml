abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes an RTP payload format for Scalable Video Coding
    (SVC) as defined in Annex G of ITU-T Recommendation H.264, which is technically
    identical to Amendment 3 of ISO/IEC International Standard 14496-10. The RTP payload
    format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL)
    units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit in multiple
    RTP packets. Furthermore, it supports transmission of an SVC stream over a single
    as well as multiple RTP sessions. The payload format defines a new media subtype
    name "H264-SVC", but is still backward compatible to RFC 6184 since the base layer,
    when encapsulated in its own RTP stream, must use the H.264 media subtype name
    ("H264") and the packetization method specified in RFC 6184. The payload format
    has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate
    entertainment-quality video, among others. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
