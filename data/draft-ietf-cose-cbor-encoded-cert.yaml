abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates. The resulting
    certificates are called C509 Certificates. The CBOR encoding supports a large
    subset of RFC 5280 and all certificates compatible with the RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR
    (DevID), CNSA, RPKI, GSMA eUICC, and CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements profiles.
    When used to re-encode DER encoded X.509 certificates, the CBOR encoding can in
    many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates with over 50%. The
    CBOR encoded structure can alternatively be signed directly ("natively signed"),
    which does not require re- encoding for the signature to be verified. The document
    also specifies C509 COSE headers, a C509 TLS certificate type, and a C509 file
    format.</p>
