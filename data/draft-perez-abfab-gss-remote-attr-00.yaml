abstract:
- content: "<p>The GSS-API Naming Extensions define new APIs that extend the GSS-API
    naming model to support name attribute transfer between GSS-API peers. Historically,
    this set of functions has been used to obtain the authorization information contained
    in some sort of authorization token provided to the GSS acceptor during the context
    establishment process, such as a Kerberos ticket, a SAML assertion, or an X.509
    attribute certificate. However, some scenarios require to allow the GSS acceptor
    to request additional attributes after context establishment. If these attributes
    are not locally stored by the GSS mechanism they have to be retrieved from an
    external source (e.g. SQL database, LDAP directory, external IdP, etc.). This
    document describes how current GSS-API extensions are able to encompass such functionality
    without requiring of any change, neither on the existing calls nor on the way
    applications use the API.</p>"
