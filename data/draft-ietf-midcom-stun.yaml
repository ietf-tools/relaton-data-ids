abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) Through Network Address
    Translators (NATs) (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that allows applications to
    discover the presence and types of NATs and firewalls between them and the public
    Internet. It also provides the ability for applications to determine the public
    Internet Protocol (IP) addresses allocated to them by the NAT. STUN works with
    many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them. As a
    result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT
    infrastructure. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
