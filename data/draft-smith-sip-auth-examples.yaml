abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3261 [2] recommends that SIP requests be authenticated using HTTP
    Digest authentication as defined in RFC2617 [3], and many vendors have successfully
    added this function to their products. However implementation bugs are still being
    observed both at interoperability events and in the field. This document provides
    worked examples of Digest authentication usage in SIP. It is intended to help
    new SIP implementers, and to provide a common set of test authentication examples
    against which an implementation may be checked.</p>"
