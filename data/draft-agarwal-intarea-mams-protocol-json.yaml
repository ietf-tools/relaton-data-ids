abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication
    networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, DSL. In such multi- connectivity scenario, it is desirable to
    combine multiple access networks or select the best one to improve quality of
    experience for a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.
    This document presents the control plane message definitions and their presentations
    in JSON, for control plane procedures for configuring the user plane in a multi
    access management services (MAMS) framework that can be used to flexibly select
    the combination of uplink and downlink access and core network paths, and user
    plane treatment for improving network efficiency and enhanced application quality
    of experience.</p>"
