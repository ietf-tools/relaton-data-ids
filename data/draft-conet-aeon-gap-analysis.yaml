abstract:
- content: "<p>Identification and treatment of application flows have become more
    and more important for network operators. In order to efficiently distinguish
    ICPs' traffic, coordination between ISPs and ICPs is required. IP flow identification
    can be based on ICPs' traffic carrying some mutually agreed identifiers. This
    document analyzes the technical gap between the current network functions and
    required network capability to enable such functionality.</p>"
