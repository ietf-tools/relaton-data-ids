abstract:
- content: "<p>GMPLS-TE Graceful shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying the
    nodes in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the TE capability on
    a link or on an entire Label Switching Router (LSR) is going to be disabled. GMPLS-TE
    graceful shutdown mechanisms are tailored towards addressing the planned outage
    in the network. This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms so
    as to reduce/eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned shutdown of
    a network resource. These operations are equally applicable for both MPLS and
    its GMPLS extensions.</p>"
