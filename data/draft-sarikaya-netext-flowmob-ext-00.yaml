abstract:
- content: "<p>Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 multihoming support treats each active interface
    of the Mobile Node separately and creates a different binding cache entry for
    each interface. This is similar to Mobile IPv6 restricting only one care-of address
    to be registered with the home agent and this restriction which did not allow
    flow mobility between interfaces has been removed by allowing multiple care-of
    address registration. In this document we specify a similar solution for Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) to support flow mobility among simultaneously connected interfaces.
    Binding cache, binding update list and home network prefix option are slighlty
    extended to allow indicating the home interface and other interfaces.</p>"
