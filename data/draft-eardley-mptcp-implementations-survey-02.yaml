abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents results from the survey to gather information
    from people who have implemented MPTCP, in particular to help progress the protocol
    from Experimental to Standards track. The document currently includes answers
    from four teams: a Linux implementation from UCLouvain, a FreeBSD implementation
    from Swinburne, an anonymous implementation in a commercial OS, and a NetScalar
    Firmware implementation from Citrix Systems, Inc. Thank- you! In summary, we have
    four independent implementations of all the MPTCP signalling messages, with the
    exception of address management, and some interoperabiity testing has been done
    by the other three implementations with the 'reference' Linux implementation.
    So it appears that the RFC is (at least largely) clear and correct. On address
    management, we have only one implementation of ADD_ADDR with two teams choosing
    not to implement it. We have one implementation of the working group's coupled
    congestion control (RFC6356) and none of the MPTCP-aware API (RFC6897). The main
    suggested improvements are around o how MPTCP falls back (if the signalling is
    interrupted by a middlebox): (1) corner cases that are not handled properly, (2)
    at the IETF, the MPTCP community should work with middlebox vendors, either to
    reduce or eliminate the need for fallback or to understand the middlebox interactions
    better. o security: both better MPTCP security (perhaps building on SSL) and a
    lighter weight mechanism, preferably both in one mechanism. It is hoped that the
    next version can include information from any other implementations. If you are
    an implementer and want to contribute your answers, please see the -01 version
    of this document for a blank survey ready to be filled in.</p>"
