abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the implementation of password policy in Netscape
    LDAP directories, and introduces two new object classes, twenty-three new attribute
    types, and two new controls in support of password policy. Password policy is
    a set of rules that control how passwords are used in LDAP directories. In order
    to improve the security of LDAP directories and make it difficult for password
    cracking programs to break into directories, it is desirable to enforce a set
    of rules on password usage. These rules are made to ensure that the users change
    their pass- words periodically, the new password meets construction requirements,
    the re-use of the old password is restricted, and lock out the users after a certain
    number of bad password attempts.</p>"
