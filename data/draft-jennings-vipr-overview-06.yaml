abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment
    within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video communications.
    Though it was designed from the outset to support inter-domain federation over
    the public Internet, such federation has not materialized. The primary reasons
    for this are the complexities of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns
    over security. This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements,
    and then describes a model and technique for inter-domain federation with SIP
    involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), called Verification Involving
    PSTN Reachability (VIPR). VIPR addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domain
    federation over the Internet. It provides fully distributed inter-domain routing
    for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone numbers to domains, a new technique
    for automated SIP anti-spam, and privacy of number ownership, all while preserving
    the trapezoidal model of SIP.</p>"
