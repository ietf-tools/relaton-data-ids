abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP and other transport-layer protocols are vulnerable to spoofing
    attacks from off-path hosts. These attacks can be prevented through the use of
    cryptographic authentication. However, it is difficult to use cryptographic authentication
    in all circumstances. A variety of obfuscation techniques -- such as initial sequence
    number randomization and source port randomization -- increase the effort required
    of an attacker to successfully guess the packet header fields which uniquely identify
    a transport connection. This memo proposes the use of the IPv6 Flow Label field
    as a random, per- connection nonce value, to add entropy to the set of packet
    header fields used to identify a transport connection. This mechanism is easily
    implementable, allows for incremental deployment, and is fully compliant with
    the rules for Flow Label use defined in RFC 3697.</p>"
