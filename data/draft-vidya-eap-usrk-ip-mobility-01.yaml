abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication in various
    networks. Also, key generating EAP methods are being adopted in various systems
    for the purposes of cryptographic protection between an EAP peer and an enforcement
    point in the network. Key generating EAP methods produce an MSK and an EMSK in
    accordance with [1]. The MSK is meant for use by the EAP lower layer at the peer
    and the authenticator and is used differently by various lower layers. The EMSK
    hierarchy is defined in [2]. The EMSK hierarchy is meant to be extensible to derive
    keys for various usages. This document defines the key hierarchy and key derivations
    for using the EMSK hierarchy for keying in IP mobility protocols.</p>"
