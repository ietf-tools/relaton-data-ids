abstract:
- content: "<p>Our protocol embeds a destination-driven feature into the on-demand
    multicast structure building process of an existing multicast protocol ODMRP (On-Demand
    Multicast Routing Protocol), which is a mesh-based multicast scheme and uses a
    forwarding group concept. The design objective of destination-driven on-demand
    multicast routing protocol (D-ODMRP) is to improve the multicast forwarding efficiency
    for wireless Ad Hoc networks. To achieve this goal, the path to reach a multicast
    destination is biased towards those paths passing through another multicast destination.</p>"
