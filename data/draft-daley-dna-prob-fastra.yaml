abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Neighbour Discovery RFC provides for random delays of between
    0 to 500 milliseconds, in order to spread responses to solicitations when multiple
    routers exist on a link. This document describes an alternative scheme for responding
    to Router Solicitations which estimates the number of routers on the link, and
    aims to reduce the delay spread for responding Router Advertisements.</p>"
