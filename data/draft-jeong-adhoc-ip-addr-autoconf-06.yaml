abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the steps which a mobile node in the ad hoc
    network takes in deciding how to autoconfigure its IPv4 or IPv6 address in its
    network interface. Because the ad hoc IP address autoconfiguration in this document
    considers the ad hoc network's partition and mergence, the address duplication
    caused by the ad hoc network's mergence can be resolved through an address resolution
    protocol. Also, this document specifies how to resolve the address duplication
    in order to guarantee the maintenance of upper-layer sessions, such as TCP session.</p>"
