abstract:
- content: <p>This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path Computation
    Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical
    Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength
    assignment (RWA) process. From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment
    is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path
    and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light path computation.
    Requirements related to optical impairments will be addressed in a separate document.
    Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
