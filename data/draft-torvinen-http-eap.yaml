abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a HTTP authentication scheme using PPP Extensible
    Authentication Protocol (EAP). HTTP EAP authentication enables HTTP connections
    to be authenticated using any of the authentication schemes supported through
    EAP. EAP performs the authentication without sending the password in the clear
    text format (which is the biggest weakness of the Basic HTTP authentication scheme,
    for example). EAP is useful for HTTP protocol because it opens up several new
    authentication schemes without additional specification work. The same benefits
    can be reached by any other protocols, which apply HTTP authentication, such as
    Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).</p>"
