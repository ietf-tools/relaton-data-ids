abstract:
- content: "<p>Flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of
    traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications but the
    primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic filtering
    actions for DDoS mitigation. The flow-spec standard RFC5575 [2] defines a redirect-to-VRF
    action for policy-based forwarding but this mechanism is not always sufficient,
    particularly if the redirected traffic needs to be steered into an engineered
    path or into a service plane. This document defines a new extended community known
    as redirect-to- indirection-id (32-bit) flowspec action to provide advanced redirection
    capabilities on flowspec clients. When activated, the flowspec extended community
    is used by a flowspec client to find the correct next-hop entry within a localised
    indirection-id mapping table. The functionality present in this draft allows a
    network controller to decouple flowspec functionality from the creation and maintainance
    of the network's service plane itself including the setup of tunnels and other
    service constructs that could be managed by other network devices.</p>"
