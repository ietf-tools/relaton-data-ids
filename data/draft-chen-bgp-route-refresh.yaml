abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new BGP capability termed 'Route Refresh Capability',
    which would allow the dynamic exchange of route refresh request between BGP speakers
    and subsequent re-advertisement of the respective Adj-RIB-Out. One possible application
    of this capability is to facilitate non-disruptive routing policy changes.</p>"
