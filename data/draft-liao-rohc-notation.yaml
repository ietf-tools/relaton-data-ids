abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the framework of the generic header compression
    notation (ROHC-GN). The goal of Robust Header Compression (ROHC) is to develop
    generic header compression schemes that perform well over links with high error
    rates and long roundtrip times. ROHC will develop multiple compression schemes,
    for example, ROHC-RTP, ROHC-TCP [ROHC-TCP], ROHC-SCTP [ROHC-SCTP], etc. Our proposed
    generic header compression notation will describe the header fields that are to
    be compressed, and the information to be transmitted in the compressed header.
    Using this notation and the corresponding encoding methods, we can have a toolbox
    to standardize future ROHC profiles.</p>"
