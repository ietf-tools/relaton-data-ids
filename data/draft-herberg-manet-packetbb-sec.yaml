- content: "<p>This document describes a general and flexible TLV (type-length-value
    structure) for representing cryptographic signatures as well as timestamps, using
    the generalized MANET packet/message format [RFC5444]. It defines two Packet TLVs,
    two Message TLVs, and two Address Block TLVs, for affixing cryptographic signatures
    and timestamps to a packet, message and address, respectively.</p>"
