abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration
    management protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform sets of active
    tests (i.e., verification) against servers' running configuration over a period
    of time to afford the client and server a more robust and resilient configuration
    management capability. This is of value to commercial enterprise and public networks
    as well as wireless emergency and military networks. We accomplish this through
    the definition of the new verify.yang module. Servers supporting this module will
    advertise this capability according to the YANG specification. We also explore
    the future alternatives for developing these capabilities within the context of
    the existing NETCONF protocol, the YANG modeling language and existing related
    IETF, IEEE and ITU-T standards.</p>"
