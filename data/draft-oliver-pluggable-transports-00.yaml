abstract:
- content: "<p>Pluggable Transports (PTs) are a mechanism enabling the rapid development
    and deployment of network traffic obfuscation techniques used to circumvent surveillance
    and censorship. This specification does not define or limit the techniques themselves,
    but rather focuses on the startup, shutdown, and inter-process communication mechanisms
    required to make these technologies interoperable with applications. This document
    is based heavily on [PT2.1].</p>"
