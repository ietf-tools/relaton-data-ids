abstract:
- content: <p>A common approach to deal with unwanted communication attempts is to
    rely on some form of authorization policies, typically whitelists. In order to
    populate the entries in such an access control list it is helpful to have a way
    to challenge the entity willing to engage in a conversation (unless they are already
    pre-authorized). One reason why this is desired is to deal with robots that are
    aggressively distributing messages. This document describes how "Completely Automated
    Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart" (CAPTCHA) tests, which
    require human interaction, are applied to SIP.</p>
