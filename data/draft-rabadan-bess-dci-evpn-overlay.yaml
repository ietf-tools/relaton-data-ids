abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how Network Virtualization Overlay networks
    (NVO) can be connected to a Wide Area Network (WAN) in order to extend the layer-2
    connectivity required for some tenants. The solution analyzes the interaction
    between NVO networks running EVPN and other L2VPN technologies used in the WAN,
    such as VPLS/PBB-VPLS or EVPN/PBB-EVPN, and proposes a solution for the interworking
    between both.</p>"
