abstract:
- content: "<p>QoS NSLP is a recently proposed signaling protocol that allows to establish
    QoS reservations in the Internet. In order to enable large scale deployment, inter-domain
    aggregation should be considered as mechanism to allow for the necessary scalability
    in the control plane. This draft describes the major problems that must be solved
    and proposes also solutions to these problems, requiring only modest modifications
    and extensions to the currently defined GIST and QoS NSLP specifications.</p>"
