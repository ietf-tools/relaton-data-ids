abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the goals of the authors of Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS-Based
    Service Discovery (DNS-SD) was to retire AppleTalk and the AppleTalk Name Binding
    Protocol (NBP) and to replace them with an IP-based solution. This document presents
    a brief overview of the capabilities of AppleTalk NBP and outlines the properties
    required of an IP-based replacement.</p>"
