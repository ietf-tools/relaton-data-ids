abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes best current practices that community administrators
    should use when interconnecting two or more instant messaging and presence communities
    using SIP/SIMPLE. These best practices are intended to assist in the efficiency
    and scalability of interconnections between large communities, and to ensure that
    security and user privacy are maintained across the link between communities.
    The purpose of this document is to serve as the reference for the SIP/SIMPLE community
    towards inter-domain interoperability and also to identify new requirements specific
    to the inter-domain interface.</p>"
