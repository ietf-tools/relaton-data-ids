abstract:
- content: "<p>The computation of one or a series of Traffic Engineering Label Switched
    Paths (TE LSP) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
    networks, is subject to a set of one or more specific optimization criteria(s),
    referred to as an objective function (e.g. minimum cost path, widest path, etc.).
    A Path Computation Element (PCE) may support one or multiple objective functions,
    and it is desired for a Path Computation Client (PCC) to automatically discover
    the set of objective functions supported by a PCE. Furthermore, it may be useful
    for a PCC to specify in a path computation request the required objective function
    used by the PCE to compute a TE LSP or a set of TE LSPs. Thus the aim of this
    document is to define extensions to the PCE Discovery (PCED) TLV carried within
    the IS-IS Router Capability TLV and the OSPF Router Information LSA so as to allow
    a PCC to discover the set of objective functions supported by a PCE. Extensions
    to the PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) are also specified allowing a PCC to
    indicate in a path computation request the required objective function and a PCE
    to indicate in a path computation reply the objective function actually applied.</p>"
