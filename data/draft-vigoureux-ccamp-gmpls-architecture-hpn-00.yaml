abstract:
- content: "<p>Optical networks could have been reduced to point-to-point links but
    technology evolution led the way to an evolution trend. The concept of optical
    transparency first took shape through the development of photonic switching fabrics
    and is now being reinforced by the continuous efforts produced to increase transmission
    distances. Optical networking obviously can not be left aside of such evolutions
    and so it is for the (in particular, GMPLS-based) protocols that control these
    photonic networks. This document highlights the enhancements that seem to be necessary
    for GMPLS to cover these emerging trends (transparency, hybrid nodes) and fulfil
    its role of a generalized control plane.</p>"
