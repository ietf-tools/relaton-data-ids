abstract:
- content: "<p>The notion of a 'Human Friendly Naming scheme' (HFN) has been discussed
    in a variety of contexts, as an alternative to the use of URIs or URNs as a way
    of designating Internet resources (see [RFC 2276], for example). This document
    introduces the RealName system, and its use as a HFN. It provides a mapping for
    RealNames into a URN namespace ('rn') as well as a URL scheme ('vnd.rn'). This
    is a preliminary draft, intended to raise the discussion of HFNs and the uses
    of RealNames as an initial example in creating a standard for access and resolution.</p>"
