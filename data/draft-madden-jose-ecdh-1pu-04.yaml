abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the ECDH-1PU public key authenticated encryption
    algorithm for JWE. The algorithm is similar to the existing ECDH-ES encryption
    algorithm, but adds an additional ECDH key agreement between static keys of the
    sender and recipient. This additional step allows the recipient to be assured
    of sender authenticity without requiring a nested signed-then-encrypted message
    structure.</p>"
