abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCPv6
    servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers configuration flexibility.
    If not secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly spoofing
    attacks. This document analyzes the security issues of DHCPv6 and specifies a
    Secure DHCPv6 mechanism for communication between DHCPv6 client and server. This
    mechanism is based on public/private key pairs. The authority of the sender may
    depend on either pre-configuration mechanism or Public Key Infrastructure.</p>"
