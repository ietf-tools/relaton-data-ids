abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number portability
    (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN). There are three types of
    number portability: service provider number portability (SPNP), location portability,
    and service portability. Service provider portability, the focus of the present
    draft, is a regulatory imperative in many countries seeking to liberalize local
    telephony service competition, by enabling end-users to retain pre- existing telephone
    numbers while changing service providers. Implementation of NP within national
    GSTN entails potentially significant changes to numbering administration, network
    element signaling, call routing and processing, billing, service management, and
    other functions. NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialed E.164 number from
    a hierarchical physical routing address to a virtual address, thereby requiring
    the transparent translation of the later to the former. In addition, there are
    various regulatory constraints which establish relevant parameters for NP implementation,
    most of which are not network technology specific. Consequently, the implementation
    of NP behavior consistent with applicable regulatory constraints, as well as the
    need for interoperation with the existing GSTN NP implementations, are relevant
    topics for numerous areas of IP telephony work-in-progress at IETF.</p>"
