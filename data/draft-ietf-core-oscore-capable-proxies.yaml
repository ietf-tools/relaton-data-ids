abstract:
- content: "<p>Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) can be
    used to protect CoAP messages end-to-end between two endpoints at the application
    layer, also in the presence of intermediaries such as proxies. This document defines
    how to use OSCORE for protecting CoAP messages also between an origin application
    endpoint and an intermediary, or between two intermediaries. Also, it defines
    rules to escalate the protection of a CoAP option, in order to encrypt and integrity-protect
    it whenever possible. Finally, it defines how to secure a CoAP message by applying
    multiple, nested OSCORE protections, e.g., both end-to-end between origin application
    endpoints, and between an application endpoint and an intermediary or between
    two intermediaries. Therefore, this document updates RFC 8613. Furthermore, this
    document updates RFC 8768, by explicitly defining the processing with OSCORE for
    the CoAP option Hop-Limit. The approach defined in this document can be seamlessly
    used with Group OSCORE, for protecting CoAP messages when group communication
    is used in the presence of intermediaries.</p>"
