abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtualization provides Data Center with feasibility and improves the
    utilization of limited physical resource, e.g. switches/routers, servers and links.
    Virtual machines (VM) are allowed to migrate to any place in the Data Center.
    A variety of policies (e.g. ACL, firewalls, load balancers, IPS and QoS) are deployed
    in Data Center to guarantee the SLA the provider signed with their clients. Dynamic
    information, such as TCP Connection Table, dynamic ACLs and cumulated data, is
    generated on network devices. In order to keep running services uninterrupted
    while VM migrating, relevant policies and dynamic information, also need to migrate
    with VM. This document describes some examples of the policies and dynamic information
    that need to migrate with VM, the influence if they are not migrated with VM,
    the problems that need to consider when migrate polices and dynamic information.
    It also describes some existing network management protocols standardized by IETF
    and the advantages and disadvantages of them for operating policies and dynamic
    information migration respectively. The goal is to justify that it is necessary
    for IETF to make effort on policy and dynamic information migration for large
    virtualized Data Center.</p>"
