    Systems' NetFlow services, for use by implementations on the network elements

    to provide access to observations of IP packet flows in a flexible and extensible
    manner. A template defines a collection of fields, with corresponding descriptions
    of structure and semantics. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
