abstract:
- content: "<p>If Internet Telephony is to offer a full replacement for traditional
    telephone services, it needs to provide emergency call services. In the United
    States, emergency calls are known as 911 services, based on the number dialed.
    This note desccribes some options for providing enhanced emergency service, i.e.,
    emergency calls that allow emergency response centers to determine the address
    where the caller is located. This is made more difficult by the temporary nature
    of IP addresses, the large number of ISPs and their lack of legal responsibility
    for emergency services and the ability of many Internet terminals to be connected
    to the Internet at different locations. This note explores some of the requirements
    and design choices.</p>"
