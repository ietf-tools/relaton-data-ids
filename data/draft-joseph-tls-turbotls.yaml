abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a high level protocol description for handshaking
    over UDP in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (version independent).
    In parallel, a TCP session is established, and once this is done, the TLS session
    reverts to TCP. In the event that the UDP handshaking portion fails, TurboTLS
    falls back to TLS- over-TCP as is usually done, resulting in negligible latency
    cost in the case of failure. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on
    the TLS IETF mailing list tls@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains
    the draft: https://github.com/PhDJsandboxaq/draft-ietf-turbotls- design/.</p>"
