abstract:
- content: "<p>Adaptive RIFT (AD-RIFT for short) extends RIFT to carry additional
    link and node information, primarily traffic engineering related. This enables
    the southbound computation to optimally place traffic depending on available resources
    and usage. Additionally, a selective disaggregation, similar to negative disaggregation,
    is introduced that allows to balance northbound forwarding toward specific prefixes
    between nodes at the same level depending on resources available.</p>"
