abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes DNS iterative resolver behavior that results in
    a significant query volume sent to the root and top-level domain (TLD) name servers.
    We offer implementation advice to iterative resolver developers to alleviate these
    unnecessary queries. The recommendations made in this document are a direct byproduct
    of observation and analysis of abnormal query traffic patterns seen at two of
    the thirteen root name servers and all thirteen com/net TLD name servers. This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
