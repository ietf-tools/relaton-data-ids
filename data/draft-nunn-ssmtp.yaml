abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Mail Transport Protocol currently doesn't verify the authenticity
    of the message such that it allows spammers and scammers to exist without fear
    of retribution. This is due in part to the fact that almost all data contained
    within the DATA section of an SMTP mail transport can be spoofed. The SSMTP protocol
    would alleviate much of this concern.</p>"
