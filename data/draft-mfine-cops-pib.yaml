abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of policy rule classes for describing quality
    of service (QoS) policies. This document structures QoS policy information as
    instances of policy rule classes. A policy rule class (PRC) is an ordered set
    of scalar attributes. Policy rule classes are arranged in a hierarchical structure
    similar to tables in SNMP's SMIv2 [SNMP-SMI]. As with SNMP tables, they are identified
    by a sequence of integer identifiers (an Object Identifier).</p>"
