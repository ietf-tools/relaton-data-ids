abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to provision an optical connection through optical networks,
    a combination of path continuity, resource availability, and impairment constraints
    must be met to determine viable and optimal paths through the network. The determination
    of appropriate paths is known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment
    (IA-RWA) for WSON, while it is known as Impairment-Aware Routing and Spectrum
    Assigment (IA-RSA) for SSON. This document provides a YANG data model for the
    impairment-aware TE topology in optical networks.</p>"
