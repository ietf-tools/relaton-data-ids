abstract:
- content: "<p>In current Internet, HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 protocol has limited methods
    to control resource access. Usually it's achieved by modifying the configuration
    of the cache and proxy to enforce the access control rules. When original server's
    access control list (ACL) is updated, a reconfiguration of cache and proxy systems
    on the chain is required for the change to take effect, which always impacts the
    network stability. This document introduces a new access control mechanism, which
    introduces a new header field to dynamically control resource access.</p>"
