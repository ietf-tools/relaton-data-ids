abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC2622 and RFC4012 by specifying src-members,
    a new attribute on as-set and route-set objects in the Routing Policy Specification
    Language (RPSL). This attribute allows a specific registry to be defined for each
    member in a set, avoiding problematic ambiguity when resolving set members. A
    new validation rule allows gradual upgrades and backwards compatibility.</p>"
