abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more mobile nodes are being equipped with multiple radios,
    such as 3G and 802.11. This document specifies use of Bicasting with Buffering
    and Selective Delivery (BBSD) with Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (RFC 4068).
    The BBSD scheme takes advantage of the additional radio capabilities of Mobile
    Nodes. As in Simultaneous Bindings for Fast Handovers, the BBSD extension uses
    bicasting to allow a Mobile Node to continue receiving packets directly from the
    Previous Access Router during the handoff process. In addition, the selective
    delivery uses sequence numbers in the bicasted packets to enable the New Access
    Router to only deliver those packets from its buffer that the Mobile Node has
    not already received directly from the Previous Access Router. This reduces the
    overhead of bicasting and mitigates the negative impacts of packet duplication
    on the application performance in Mobile Node.</p>"
