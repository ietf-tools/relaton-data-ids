abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP [1] requires several security associations: the Mobile Node
    must share a security association with its Home agent and its Correspondent Nodes
    to send the binding update; these messages must be authenticated to prevent potential
    denial of service attacks [2]. The MN and the Home Agent can have a static security
    association, established at the configuration time, but the case of the Correspondent
    Node is more complex since it cannot be assumed that the MN and the CN have any
    pre-established security association.</p>"
