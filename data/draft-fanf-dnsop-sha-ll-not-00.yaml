abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC deployments have often used the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm
    to provide authentication of DNS data. This document explains why SHA-1 is no
    longer secure for this purpose, and deprecates its use in DNSSEC signatures. This
    document updates RFC 8624.</p>"
