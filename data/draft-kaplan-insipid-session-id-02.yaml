abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet Draft that
    was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is being published now
    as an Informational document to provide a reference for later RFCs. The mechanism
    defined in this document has been widely deployed, and is being followed in a
    backward- compatible fashion for a new Standards Track RFC in the INSIPID Working
    Group. The original Abstract follows. There is a need for having a globally unique
    session identifier for the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained
    across Proxies, B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of Troubleshooting.
    This draft proposes a new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.</p>"
