abstract:
- content: <p>The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol is intended
    for use by mobile nodes in an ad hoc network. It offers quick adaptation to dynamic
    link conditions, low processing and memory overhead, low network utilization,
    and determines unicast routes to destinations within the ad hoc network. It uses
    destination sequence numbers to ensure loop freedom at all times (even in the
    face of anomalous delivery of routing control messages), avoiding problems (such
    as "counting to infinity") associated with classical distance vector protocols.
    This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
