abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).
    The overall description of protocol and the underlying architectural thinking
    is available in the separate HIP architecture specification. The Host Identity
    Protocol is used to establish a rapid authentication between two hosts and to
    provide continuity of communications between those hosts independent of the networking
    layer. The various forms of the Host Identity (HI), Host Identity Tag (HIT), and
    Local Scope Identifier (LSI), are covered in detail. It is described how they
    are used to support authentication and the establishment of keying material, which
    is then used by IPsec Encapsulated Security payload (ESP) to establish a two-way
    secured communication channel between the hosts. The basic state machine for HIP
    provides a HIP compliant host with the resiliency to avoid many denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks. The basic HIP exchange for two public hosts shows the actual packet
    flow. Other HIP exchanges, including those that work across NATs are covered elsewhere.</p>"
