abstract:
- content: '<p>The specification defines the processes of token exchange and token
    translation for workloads. Token exchange is introduced in [RFC8693], allowing
    the exchange of access tokens, OpenID Connect ID Tokens, and SAML assertions for
    new OAuth access tokens. However, for workloads, there exist a broad array of
    input and output token types which must be considered beyond the input types supported
    by [RFC8693]. These token types include, but are not limited to, SPIFFE SVIDs,
    x.509 certificates, Kerberos service tickets, Amazon sigv4A, macaroons, &lt;...&gt;.
    Further, these tokens may be encoded in formats including JWT OAuth 2.0 Acesss
    Tokens [RFC9068], CWT [RFC8392], and protocol buffers (protobufs). Given the variety
    and complexity of input and output token types and encoding, a strict token exchange
    that maintains all of the contextual information from the input token to the output
    token may not be possible. We define these non-RFC8693 use cases with potentially
    lossy conversions as "token translation" (e.g. information may be lost in translation).
    In this document we describe a workload profile for token exchange, using the
    mechanisms in [RFC8693], and a new set of translations between arbitrary token
    types. Additionally, we define mechanisms to enrich tokens during translation
    to support the use cases defined in (todo: add link to use cases doc).</p>'
