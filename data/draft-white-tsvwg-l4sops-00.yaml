abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an early, work-in-progress draft - a start at getting some
    of the ideas from the mailing list and email exchanges on paper. This draft is
    intended to provide guidance to operators of end- systems, operators of networks,
    and researchers in order to ensure reasonable fairness between L4S and Classic
    flows sharing a single- queue RFC3168 bottleneck link. This draft identifies opportunites
    to prevent and/or detect and resolve fairness problems in such networks.</p>"
