abstract:
- content: "<p>In some cases a pair of Label Switching Routers (LSRs) may be connected
    by several (parallel) links. From the MPLS Traffic Engineering point of view for
    reasons of scalability it may be desirable to advertise all these links as a single
    link into OSPF and/or IS-IS. This document describes how to accomplish this. This
    document also defines corresponding signaling (RSVP-TE) support.</p>"
