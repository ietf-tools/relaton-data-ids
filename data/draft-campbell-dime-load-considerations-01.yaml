abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 7068 describes requirements for Overload Control in Diameter. This
    includes a requirement to allow Diameter nodes to send "load" information, even
    when the node is not overloaded. The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance
    (DOIC) solution describes a mechanism meeting most of the requirements, but does
    not currently include the ability to send load information. This document explores
    some architectural considerations for a mechanism to send Diameter load information.</p>
