abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a scheme to support Fast Handover over HMIPv6
    networks. The HMIPv6 was developed to reduce the signaling overhead and delay
    concerned with Binding Update in Mobile IPv6. Therefore HMIPv6 still need a further
    handover enhancement for supporting the real-time applications. Currently FMIPv6
    is the typical protocol to reduce the handover latency. Accordingly it may be
    straightforward to simply introduce FMIPv6 into HMIPv6 networks. However, it is
    noted that such simple approach may induce unnecessary processing overhead. F-HMIPv6,
    described in this document, considers how to integrate these two protocols and
    provides a scheme for effective integration.</p>"
