abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a cryptographically protected message format
    and transaction protocol for managing network-enabled devices. The message format
    consists of a header, content and trailers. The message header uniquely identifies
    the message type. The message content is afforded (i) authentication by means
    of a digital signature trailer and (ii) confidentiality by means of encryption
    trailer; and the whole message (header, content, trailers) is afforded integrity
    by means of a trusted time stamp trailer. All message structures are defined using
    ASN.1 and all cryptographic structures use CMS. The transaction protocol consists
    of request messages, response messages, acknowledgement messages, and notification
    messages.</p>"
