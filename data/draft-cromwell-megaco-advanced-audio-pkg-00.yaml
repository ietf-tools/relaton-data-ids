abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposal to add a new event/signal package to the
    Megaco protocol to control an ARF (Audio Resource Function) which may reside on
    a Media Gateway or specialized Audio Server. This event package provides support
    for the standard IVR operations of PlayAnnouncement, PlayCollect, and PlayRecord.
    It supports direct references to simple audio as well as indirect references to
    simple and complex audio. It provides audio variables, control of audio interruptibility,
    digit buffer control, special key sequences, and support for reprompting during
    data collection. It also provides an arbitrary number of user defined qualifiers
    to be used in resolving complex audio structures. For example, the user could
    define qualif- iers for any or all of the following: language, accent, audio file
    format, gender, speaker, or customer.</p>"
