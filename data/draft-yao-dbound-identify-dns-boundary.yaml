abstract:
- content: "<p>Two or more DNS names belonging to the same registrants may share the
    same DNS administrative boundaries. Currently, there are no good methods to identify
    such shared administrative boundaries in DNS. This document adds the function
    of lookup of domain name administrative boundary to domain name system, which
    describes a new method for using dbound resource record for determining domain
    name administrative boundaries.</p>"
