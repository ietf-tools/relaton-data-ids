abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1] to allow
    mobility management for the interface between a radio network and a packet data
    network in the third generation cdma2000 network. Mobile IP requires link layer
    connectivity between the Mobile Node and the Foreign Agent. This draft proposes
    a protocol for achieving this when the physical layer terminating at a point distant
    from the FA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks where the
    physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and the FA resides inside
    a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). The PDSN is responsible for establishing,
    maintaining, and terminating the link layer to the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible
    for relaying the link layer protocol between a Mobile Node and its corresponding
    PDSN. The interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called the RP interface. This
    interface requires mobility management for handling handoff from one RNN to another
    without interrupting end to end communication. It also requires the support of
    the link layer protocol encapsulation.</p>"
