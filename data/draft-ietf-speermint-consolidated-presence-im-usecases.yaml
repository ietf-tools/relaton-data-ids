abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several use cases of peering of non-VoIP (Voice
    over IP) services between two or more Service Providers. These Service Providers
    create a peering relationship between themselves, thus enabling their users to
    collaborate with users on the other Service Provider network. The target of this
    document is to drive requirements for peering between domains that provide the
    non-VoIP based collaboration services with presence and, in particular, Instant
    Messaging (IM). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
