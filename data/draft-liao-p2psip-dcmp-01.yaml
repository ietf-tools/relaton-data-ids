abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a RELOAD Usage for Distributed Conference Platform
    which can support a lot of meetings simultaneously. It designs a new distributed
    conference architecture. In this architecture the component called MCS is responsible
    for the process of media data including audio and video. Some conference UEs which
    have enough bandwidth or other conditions could also undertake parts of media
    data process. All the MCSs form the reload overlay. The capacity and state information
    of conference UEs is stored in the RELOAD overlay. One or several MCSs will be
    selected to provide media process for a meeting and these MCSs process all the
    transcoding and transmission of audio and video data, and decide which media process
    task could be assigned to Conference UEs.</p>"
