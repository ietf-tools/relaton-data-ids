abstract:
- content: "<p>The extension described in this document allows a pair of PEs connected
    via an Ethernet Pseudowire (PW) to signal via the use of the Control Word (CW)
    whether the Ethernet frame encapsulated is coming from a Root AC or a Leaf AC.
    This allows a PE receiving this frame to decide whether it can be forwarded to
    a Leaf AC or not. Such forward or drop decision is an additional filtering action
    after the MAC-based forwarding decision. This applies to both P2P PW and P2MP
    PW.</p>"
