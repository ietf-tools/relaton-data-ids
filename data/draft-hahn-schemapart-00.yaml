abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF RFC 2251 [RFC2251] provides a mechanism for indicating, given
    any particular entry in the directory tree, what entry in the directory tree holds
    the directory schema information for that particular entry. RFC 2251 does not,
    however, provide guidance on how different directory servers, each of which might
    have their own active directory schema, should “publicize” this directory schema
    such that the different active schemas are distinct from one another when viewing
    the entire directory name-space. This document describes a way to name sub-schema
    sub-entry entries such that different active schemas can be distinguished from
    one another across the entire directory name-space.</p>"
