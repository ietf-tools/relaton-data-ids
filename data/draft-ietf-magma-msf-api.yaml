abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMPv3) for IPv4 and the Multicast
    Listener Discovery (MLDv2) for IPv6 add the capability for applications to express
    source filters on multicast group memberships, which allows receiver applications
    to determine the set of senders (sources) from which to accept multicast traffic.
    This capability also simplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications.
    This document specifies new socket options and functions to manage source filters
    for IP Multicast group memberships. It also defines the socket structures to provide
    input and output arguments to these new application program interfaces (APIs).
    These extensions are designed to provide access to the source filtering features,
    while introducing a minimum of change into the system and providing complete compatibility
    for existing multicast applications.</p>"
