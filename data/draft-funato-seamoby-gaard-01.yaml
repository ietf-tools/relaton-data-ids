abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a scheme that allows a node to determine an
    IP address corresponding to a given link-layer id. The node performing the query
    doesn't need to be on the same link or subnet of the node associated with the
    link-layer id. This scheme was designed for the handoff candidate access router
    discovery in wireless networks, but may also be applied to other networks with
    similar behavior.</p>"
