abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, the IETF has developed protocols that classify packets in
    order to treat certain classes or flows of packets in a particular way compared
    to other classes or flows of packets. The successful wide-scale deployment of
    these protocols depends on the ability to administer and distribute consistent
    policy information to different types of network devices as well as hosts and
    servers that participate in policy decision making, administration, distribution
    and control. There is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy
    administration and distribution that will enable interoperability among multiple
    devices and device types that must work together to achieve a consistent implementation
    of policy. This document defines a language, called the Policy Framework Definition
    Language (PFDL), that maps requirements for services to be provided by the network
    as defined in a business specification (e.g., an SLA) to a common vendor- and
    device-independent intermediate form. This enables policy information and specifications
    to be shared among the heterogeneous components that comprise the policy framework,
    and allows multiple vendors to use multiple devices to implement that framework.
    The PFDL is the common 'currency' that is exchanged between these heterogeneous
    components to enable them all to perform their function in providing, securing,
    distributing, and administering policy. The PFDL becomes the way to ensure that
    multiple vendors interpret the policy the same way while enabling vendors to provide
    value-added services.</p>"
