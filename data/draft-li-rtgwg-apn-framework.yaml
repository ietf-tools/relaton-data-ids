abstract:
- content: "<p>A multitude of applications are carried over the network, which have
    varying needs for network bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss, etc. Some
    new emerging applications have very demanding performance requirements. However,
    in current networks, the network and applications are decoupled, that is, the
    network is not aware of the applications' requirements in a fine granularity.
    Therefore, it is difficult to provide truly fine-granularity traffic operations
    for the applications and guarantee their SLA requirements. This document proposes
    a new framework, named Application-aware Networking (APN), where application-aware
    information (i.e. APN attribute) including APN identification (ID) and/or APN
    parameters (e.g. network performance requirements) is encapsulated at network
    edge devices and carried in packets traversing an APN domain in order to facilitate
    service provisioning, perform fine-granularity traffic steering and network resource
    adjustment.</p>"
