abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents ETS: an Extensible TimeStamps option for TCP.
    It allows hosts to use microseconds as the unit for timestamps to improve the
    precision of timestamps, and advertise the maximum ACK delay for its own delayed
    ACK mechanism. Furthermore, it extends the information provided in the [RFC7323]
    TCP Timestamps Option by including the receiver delay in the TSecr echoing, so
    that the receiver of the ACK is able to more accurately estimate the portion of
    the RTT that resulted from time traveling through the network. The ETS option
    format is extensible, so that future extensions can add further information without
    the overhead of extra TCP option kind and length fields.</p>"
