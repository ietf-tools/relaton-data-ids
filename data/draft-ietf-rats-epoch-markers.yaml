abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Epoch Markers as a way to establish a notion of
    freshness among actors in a distributed system. Epoch Markers are similar to "time
    ticks" and are produced and distributed by a dedicated system, the Epoch Bell.
    Systems that receive Epoch Markers do not have to track freshness using their
    own understanding of time (e.g., via a local real-time clock). Instead, the reception
    of a certain Epoch Marker establishes a new epoch that is shared between all recipients.</p>
