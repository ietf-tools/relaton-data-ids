abstract:
- content: "<p>A route unmodified by the inbound policy on a monitored router is included
    both in Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-In as well as Post-Policy Adj- RIB-In Route-Monitoring
    messages when both the Pre-Policy and Post- Policy Route-Monitoring modes are
    enabled. Similarly, a route unmodified by the outbound policy is included in Pre-Policy
    Adj-RIB- Out as well as Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out Route-Monitoring messages. This
    document defines methods to avoid duplicate inclusion of routes unmodified by
    policy either in Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out.</p>"
