abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a NAT that allows IPv6-only hosts that are
    inside the NAT to operate with IPv4 hosts that are outside the NAT. It requires
    no modifications to the v4 hosts or applications, or to the operating system of
    v6 hosts, but it does require some changes to v6 applications. Typically this
    specification would be used to allow the hosts inside a NAT to connect to hosts
    outside it; but under some limitations, it can also allow hosts outside to connect
    to hosts inside. The goal of this draft is to consider what is the minimal feasible
    approach to this problem. The current intention is to merge this with the nat64
    draft. This draft is being discussed on the behave@ietf.org list.</p>"
