abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for IPv6 islands to communicate
    with each other over an IPv4 core network without explicit tunnel setup, requiring
    only one IPv4 address (and a derived IPv4-compatible IPv6 address) per IPv6 island
    or per set of IPv6 islands connected to the same edge router. The hosts in the
    IPv6 islands can use native IPv6 addresses. The method uses MP-BGP in the edge
    routers to exchange IPv6 reachability information between the IPv6 islands.</p>"
