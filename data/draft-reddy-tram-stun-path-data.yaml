abstract:
- content: "<p>A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface
    for communication. Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static configuration
    and does not consider the path characteristics, which may affect the user experience.
    This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to discover the path characteristics
    using Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) messages. The measurement information
    can then be used to influence the endpoint's Interactive Connectivity Establishment
    (ICE) candidate pair selection algorithm.</p>"
