abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the pre-SPIRITS Implementation of the SPIRITS-like
    services in the Lucent Technologies Online Communications Center (OCC). To this
    end, this document is a contribution to the future Informational RFC, which is
    to be published by the SPIRITS WG as indicated in its charter. On the PSTN side,
    the OCC platform systematically uses the Intelligent Network (IN) solutions, which
    were industry-proven to be reliable, scalable, and compatible with the existing
    PSTN infrastructure and services, yet easily adaptable to the Internet requirements.
    Other essential elements of the platform include the use of 1) Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) messaging services 2) Point-to-Point (PPP) Protocol 3) Interactions
    with the Voice-over-IP (VoIP) Gateway and Gatekeeper for establishing the combined
    voice path through PSTN and Internet 4) Microsoft NetMeeting (tm) software at
    the end-users' PCs (or Internet appliances) 5) Java (tm) Run-Time Environment
    (JRE), and 6) 1.2 Java Native Interface (JNI) for certain security capabilities</p>"
