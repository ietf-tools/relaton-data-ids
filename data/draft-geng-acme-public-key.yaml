abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the ACME protocol [RFC8555]
    that enables ACME servers to use the public key authentication protocol to verify
    the certificate applicant's control of the identity and to ensure strong consistency
    between the final certificate issued and the identity of the application order.
    A process extension for removing CSR at the certificate application phase is also
    proposed in this document.</p>"
