abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP Window Scale option modifies the interpretation of packets
    in a flow but is transmitted only at the start of the connection. As such there
    is a problem for observability and fault-finding, since a packet capture by a
    third party may miss the start of a relevant connection. This document describes
    the use of TCP options to provide the scale values during a connection.</p>"
