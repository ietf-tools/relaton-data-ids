abstract:
- content: '<p>RFC 5681 documents the following four intertwined TCP congestion control
    algorithms: slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery.
    RFC 5681 explicitly allows certain modifications of these algorithms, including
    modifications that use the TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) option (RFC 2883),
    and modifications that respond to "partial acknowledgments" (ACKs that cover new
    data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was detected) in the absence
    of SACK. This document describes a specific algorithm for responding to partial
    acknowledgments, referred to as "NewReno". This response to partial acknowledgments
    was first proposed by Janey Hoe. This document obsoletes RFC 3782. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
