abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce Enhanced Forwarding from the Previous Care-of Address
    (eFWD) for fast handovers in Mobile IPv6. eFWD enables a mobile node to create
    and directly control a bi-directional tunnel between the mobile node’s previous
    and new subnet’s access routers subsequent to a link layer handover. eFWD reduces
    handover latency by expediting the mobile node’s movement detection and new subnet’s
    access router discovery via proposed Candidate Access Router Information Discovery
    (CARID) method and by eliminating time to acquire a new care-of address. Main
    advantage of eFWD is complete removal of link layer pre-triggers that are extremely
    complex mechanisms to implement in wireless technologies other than cellular systems.</p>"
