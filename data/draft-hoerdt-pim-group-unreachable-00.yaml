abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing protocol
    in the Internet. However in IPv6 this multicast protocol lacks a simple connectivity
    debugging tool, making it difficult to identify multicast routing problems. When
    a host wants to receive a multicast group or channel, if the corresponding PIM-Join
    message cannot be propagated in the network, nothing exists to inform the receiver
    or the network about this failure. We propose a simple error notification message
    based on ICMP/ICMP6 which is able to indicate where and why the error happened
    in the network without using a multicast traceroute mechanism.</p>"
