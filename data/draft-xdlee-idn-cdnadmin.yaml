abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Chinese characters in common use have variants, which makes most
    of the Chinese Domain Names (CDNs) have at least two different forms. The equivalence
    between Simplified Chinese (SC) and Traditional Chinese (TC) characters is very
    important for CDN registration. This memo builds on the basic concepts, general
    guidelines, and framework of RFC 3743 to specify proposed registration and administration
    procedures for Chinese domain names. The document provides the information needed
    for understanding and using the tables defined in the IANA table registrations
    for Simplified and Traditional Chinese. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
