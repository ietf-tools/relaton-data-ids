abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet draft provides requirements and mechanisms for OAM (Operation
    and Maintenance) for the user-plane in MPLS networks. A connectivity verification
    'CV' OAM packet is defined, which is transmitted periodically from LSP source
    to LSP sink. The CV flow could be used to detect defects related to misrouting
    of LSPs as well as link and nodal failure, and if required to trigger protection
    switching to the protection path.</p>"
