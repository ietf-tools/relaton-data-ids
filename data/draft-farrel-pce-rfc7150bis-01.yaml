abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) is used
    to convey path computation requests and responses both between Path Computation
    Clients (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs) and between cooperating PCEs.
    In PCEP, the path computation requests carry details of the constraints and objective
    functions that the PCC wishes the PCE to apply in its computation. This document
    defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information in PCEP using a dedicated
    object and a new Type-Length-Variable that can be carried in any existing PCEP
    object. This document obsoletes RFC 7150. The only change from that document is
    the allocation of a different code point for the VENDOR-INFORMATION object.</p>"
