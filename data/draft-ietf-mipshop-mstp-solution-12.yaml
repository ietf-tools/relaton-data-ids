abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mobility services framework design (MSFD)
    for the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol that addresses identified
    issues associated with the transport of MIH messages. The document also describes
    mechanisms for Mobility Services (MoS) discovery and transport-layer mechanisms
    for the reliable delivery of MIH messages. This document does not provide mechanisms
    for securing the communication between a mobile node (MN) and the Mobility Server.
    Instead, it is assumed that either lower-layer (e.g., link-layer) security mechanisms
    or overall system-specific proprietary security solutions are used. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
