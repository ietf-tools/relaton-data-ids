abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a connectionless tunneling architecture that
    is applicable to layer 3 PE-based virtual private networks and specifies protocols
    for implementing it. This tunneling architecture is designed to facilitate scalability
    and reliability. A prominent feature of it is to provide VPN tunnels over a connectionless
    network. Since a connectionless network can provide full mesh connectivity without
    a connection establishment procedure, the architecture enables scalable operation
    of a VPN more efficiently than connection-oriented tunneling technologies.</p>"
