abstract:
- content: "<p>Context replication increases header compression gains by reducing
    the redundancy between flows via efficient replicate (IR-CR) packets. The optimum
    design of IR-CR packet formats requires elaborate understanding of the inter-flow
    redundancy. As context replication is most well-suited for TCP, this document
    presents a statistical analysis of TCP/IP inter-flow field behaviour. Based on
    the analysis, recommendations on ROHC-TCP packet format specifications for context
    replication are made. It is also shown that inter-flow field behaviour is inherently
    and significantly asymmetrical, and various ways of handling it are considered.
    Finally, based on the inter-flow behaviour of TCP Window field, it is noted that
    current encoding methods do not compress it efficiently.</p>"
