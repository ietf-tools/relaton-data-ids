abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to the Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols forming a
    horizontal unified, defragmented IoT platform. Such a platform will make objects
    accessible to applications across organizations and domains. Towards this goal,
    quite a few proposals have been made to build an application-layer based unified
    IoT platform on top of today's host-centric Internet. However, there is a fundamental
    mismatch between the host-centric nature of todays Internet and the information-centric
    nature of the IoT system. To address this mismatch, we propose to build a common
    set of protocols and services, which form an IoT platform, based on the Information
    Centric Network (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT. ICN-IoT leverages the
    salient features of ICN, and thus provides naming, security, seamless mobility
    support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery. This draft describes
    representative IoT requirements, ICN challenges and design considerations to realize
    a unified ICN-IoT framework. Towards this, we first motivate ICN for IoT using
    specific use case scenarios. Then taking a general IoT perspective, we discuss
    the IoT requirements generally applicable to many well known scenarios. We then
    discuss how the current application layer unified IoT architecture fails to meet
    these requirements, followed by discussion on suitability of ICN for IoT. Though
    we see most of the IoT requirements can be met by ICN, we discuss specific design
    challenges ICN has to address to satisfy them.</p>
