abstract:
- content: "<p>Network protocols other than TCP, such as UDP, are often blocked or
    suboptimally handled by network middleboxes. One strategy that applications can
    use to continue to send non-TCP traffic on such networks is to encapsulate datagrams
    or messages within in a TCP stream. However, encapsulating datagrams within TCP
    streams can lead to performance degradation. This document provides guidelines
    for how to use TCP for encapsulation, a summary of performance concerns, and some
    suggested mitigations for these concerns.</p>"
