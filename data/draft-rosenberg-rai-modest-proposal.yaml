abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become widely deployed on
    the Internet, covering a wide range of usages from toll bypass to instant messaging,
    from service provider to enterprise. However, its realization in actual deployments
    differs in important ways from the specifications. This has created a gulf between
    existing and ongoing standards work, and real live deployments. This document
    argues that the RAI area should focus on solving real world interoperability issues
    and address real world functional gaps.</p>"
