abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet grows, the importance of Uni-Directional Links such
    as satellite links has been increasing. However, most of existing routing protocols
    assume that datalinks are bi-directional. To incorporate UDLs into the Internet,
    an IP tunneling approach has been proposed, where tunnels are set up as a virtual
    back-channel of a UDL to carry routing information between Feeders and Receivers.
    Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol (DTCP) supports to setup tunnels dynamically
    between Feeders and Receivers in such environments.</p>"
