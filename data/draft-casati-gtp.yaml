abstract:
- content: "<p>Some discussion has been lately going on on the standardization of
    GRE within the IETF. GRE has an Impact on standard track protocols such as Mobile
    IP. A Generic Tunneling Protocol (GTP) sharing the same format and byte order
    of the 3GPP GTP protocol ( 3G TS 29.060) benefits from the commonality of the
    encapsulation format used in IP mobility support protocols in different families
    of 3G standards.</p>"
