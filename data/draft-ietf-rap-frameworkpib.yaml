abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of PRovisioning Classes (PRCs) and textual
    conventions that are common to all clients that provision policy using Common
    Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol for Provisioning. Structure of Policy Provisioning
    Information (SPPI) describes a structure for specifying policy information that
    can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of configuring policy
    at that device. The model underlying this structure is one of well-defined (PRCs)
    and instances of these classes (PRIs) residing in a virtual information store
    called the Policy Information Base (PIB). One way to provision policy is by means
    of the (COPS) protocol with the extensions for provisioning. This protocol supports
    multiple clients, each of which may provision policy for a specific policy domain
    such as QoS, virtual private networks, or security. As described in COPS usage
    for Policy Provisioning (COPS-PR), each client supports a non-overlapping and
    independent set of PIB modules. However, some PRovisioning Classes are common
    to all subject-categories (client-types) and need to be present in each.</p>"
