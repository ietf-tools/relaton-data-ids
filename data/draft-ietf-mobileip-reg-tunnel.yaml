abstract:
- content: "<p>Using Mobile IP, a mobile node registers with its home agent each time
    it changes care-of address. If the distance between the visited network and the
    home network of the mobile node is large, the signaling delay for these registrations
    may be long. This document describes a new kind of `regional' registrations, i.e.
    registrations local to the visited domain. The regional signaling is performed
    via a new network entity called a Gateway Foreign Agent and introduces a layer
    of hierarchy in the visited domain. Regional registrations reduce the number of
    signaling messages to the home network, and reduce the signaling delay when a
    mobile node moves from one foreign agent to another within the same visited domain.
    This document is an optional extension to the Mobile IPv4 protocol.</p>"
