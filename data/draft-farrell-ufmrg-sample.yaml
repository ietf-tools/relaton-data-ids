abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides reasoning as to why the Usable Formal Methods research
    group might benefit from having an IETF-relevant sample problem and describes
    one such (IMAP search). This is just an initial draft aiming to help move discussion
    forward so may be dropped or replaced by other drafts or the research group may
    prefer some non I-D format, or the research group may decide that sample problems
    aren't sufficiently useful. Early days, basically!</p>"
