abstract:
- content: "<p>As technologies for bidirectional communication over HTTP have become
    pervasive, interest has grown in (1) defining improved mechanisms for support
    of existing technologies (short-term solutions such as new HTTP headers) and (2)
    the development of new bidirectional protocols (long-term solutions such as WebSocket,
    Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol, and Reverse HTTP). In order to provide context
    for such work, this document provides a tentative map of the design space for
    bidirectional HTTP, with special attention to deployed infrastructure (e.g. web
    clients, intermediaries, firewalls, NATs, web servers) and programming environments.</p>"
