abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC was to large extent designed for off-line signing. A number
    of new opportunities arise when on-line signing is used. In negative answers case
    there is no real need for the wildcard proof and the server can just state that
    the queried name and type do not exist in a single NSEC/NSEC3 record. But such
    a minimally covering NSEC record that shares the name with the query name can
    not set the NXDOMAIN RCODE. Still, some applications want to explicitly know if
    the name does exist. This document allocates a new DNS RRtype that can be used
    to signal nonexistence of the owner names of NSEC/NSEC3 records.</p>"
