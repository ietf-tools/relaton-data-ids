abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related
    to environments of single switching capability devices e.g. one data plane layer,
    as such, the complexity raised by such control planes is similar to the one expected
    in classical IP/MPLS networks. The fundamental reason being that an IP-based control
    plane protocol suite for Label Switch Routers (LSR) or Optical Cross-Connects
    (OXC) has exactly the same Level (i.e. single data plane layer) complexity. The
    present document analyses the various GMPLS signaling and routing aspects when
    considering network environments consisting of multiple switching data layers
    e.g. supporting combined Packet/Layer-2 Switching - OXC devices. The examples
    provide an overview of the tradeoffs in using a GMPLS control plane for combined
    Ethernet MAC - opaque, service transparent, and/or fully transparent data planes.
    The intent of this memo is also to demonstrate that these aspects may not be as
    straightforward as they may first appear.</p>"
