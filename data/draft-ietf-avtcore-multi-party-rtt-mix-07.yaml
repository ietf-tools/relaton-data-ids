abstract:
- content: <p>Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the
    source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be presented by
    endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the same source. Regional
    regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time text in multi-party calls.
    RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use traditional RTP functions for source identification,
    but the mixer source switching performance is limited when using the default transmission
    with redundancy. Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided in
    this document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables source
    identification and source switching. The intended use is for real-time text mixers
    and multi-party-aware participant endpoints. Two mechanisms are provided. The
    mechanisms builds on use of the CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.
    One method makes use of the same "text/red" format as for two-party sessions,
    while the other makes use of an extended packet format "text/rex" for more efficient
    transmission. A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that
    a participant can handle the multi-party coded real-time text stream. The capability
    for one method is by use of a media attribute a=rtt- mix-rtp-mixer. The other
    method is indicated by the media subtype "text/rex". The document updates RFC
    4102[RFC4102] and RFC 4103[RFC4103] A brief description about how a mixer can
    format text for the case when the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.</p>
