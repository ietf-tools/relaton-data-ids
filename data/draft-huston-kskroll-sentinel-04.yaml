abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This
    document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user to determine the trusted
    key state of the resolvers that handle the user's DNS queries.</p>"
