abstract:
- content: "<p>The normal operation for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is
    for the submitting device to wait for all processing to complete and for the server
    to return a positive acknowledgement to the client. However, some devices have
    very intermittent connectivity, such as wireless mobile terminals. For such devices,
    a means to have processing continue in the case of a dropped connection is desirable.
    To this end, this SMTP service extension enables a client to submit a message
    and reliably detach from the session, indicating to the server to continue in
    the absence of a connection to the client.</p>"
