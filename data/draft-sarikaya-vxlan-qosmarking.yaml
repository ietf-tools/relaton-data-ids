abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network enables multiple tenants
    to operate in a data center. Each tenant needs to be assigned a priority group
    to prioritize their traffic. Cloud carriers wish to use quality of service to
    differentiate different applications. For these purposes, three bits are assigned
    in the eXtensible Local Area Network header. How these bits are assigned and are
    processed in the network are explained in detail.</p>"
