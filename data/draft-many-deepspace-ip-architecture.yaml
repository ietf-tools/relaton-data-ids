abstract:
- content: "<p>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars
    is 4-20 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital dynamics.
    The IP protocol stack used on Internet is based on assumptions of shorter delays
    and mostly uninterrupted communications. This document describes the architecture
    of the IP protocol stack tailored for its use in deep space. It involves buffering
    IP packets in IP forwarders facing intermittent links, signaling buffer storage
    near capacity, adjusting transport protocols configuration and application protocols
    timers. This architecture applies to Moon, Mars or in general interplanetary networking.</p>"
