abstract:
- content: "<p>NETCONF provides mechanism to install configuration of network devices.
    In many cases, it is required that the same configuration repeats on many interfaces.
    In the absence of protocol semantics for performing operations with group-specific
    scope, this results in either a significant amount of signaling traffic and configuration
    template applying on a periodic basis or large packet size between a given network
    management system and a network devices. This document defines optimizations to
    the NETCONF protocol operations for performing operations with group-specific
    scope with the use of a group identifier.</p>"
