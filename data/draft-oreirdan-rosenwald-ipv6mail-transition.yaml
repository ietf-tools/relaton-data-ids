abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a phased plan for how providers of email services
    can effect and manage the transition of email services from IPv4 to IPv6. It is
    expected that this will be effected over a period of years and it is unlikely
    that any transition will completely exclude the ongoing possibility of using IPv4
    as a transport mechanism for email. This provides one possible implementation
    plan for transitioning email services on the Internet from a predominantly IPv4-based
    connectivity model that suports IPv6.</p>"
