abstract:
- content: "<p>World Wide Web (WWW) intermediaries (such as proxy caches, gateways,
    and surrogate servers) are widely used by information providers, transport providers,
    and information consumers to enhance the characteristics of a web transaction.
    While there are firm models and protocols for the interactions between these devices
    when they are used, there is no common method used to discover what intermediaries
    are available. This document establishes a set of requirements for a system that
    would make discovery of application level intermediaries by web clients efficient
    and practical.</p>"
