abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] defines a framework for both authentication
    and authorization in constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. A constrained
    node in this framework may have constraints in computational capability, memory
    storage, lack of user interface, transmission bandwidth and/or power supply. Battery-
    powered devices are widely used in IoT deployments and they sleep most of their
    lifetime for battery saving. Hence, they are usually disconnected from other nodes.
    This draft provides an overview of the disconnection use cases and discusses offline
    authentication and authorization solutions.</p>"
