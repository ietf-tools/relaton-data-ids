abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. This memo suggests additions to the RFC
    3552 threat model to cater for the evolving security and privacy issues seen on
    the Internet today. For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against
    endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align
    with the interests of users. While such protection is difficult, there are some
    measures that can be taken and we argue that investigation of these issues is
    warranted.</p>"
