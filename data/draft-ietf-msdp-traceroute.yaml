abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to diagnose problems with the Peer-RPF-Flooding mechanisms
    in the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol [2], we introduce a method of tracing
    the path that an SA message should have taken, along with collecting statistics
    along that path. This occurs in a way similar to multicast traceroute [3], with
    each router appending information about this hop and forwarding the message towards
    the desired RP.</p>"
