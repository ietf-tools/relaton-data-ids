abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the Constrained GeneRic Autonomic Signaling
    Protocol (cGRASP), a constrained and lightweight variant of the GeneRic Autonomic
    Signaling Protocol (GRASP, or the standard GRASP). cGRASP reduces message overhead
    and replaces TCP with CoAP as the transport protocol. By leveraging CoAP's reliability
    features and deployment maturity, cGRASP can provide reliable signaling services
    without relying on TCP, making it suitable for IoT, where lightweight and resource-constrained
    devices dominate. Furthermore, this document also discusses the potential approaches
    to adapting the cGRASP to work on the network without IP connectivity.</p>"
