abstract:
- content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been
    in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document
    is Part 1 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to
    as "HTTP/1.1" and, taken together, updates RFC 2616 and RFC 2617. Part 1 provides
    an overview of HTTP and its associated terminology, defines the "http" and "https"
    Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the generic message syntax
    and parsing requirements for HTTP message frames, and describes general security
    concerns for implementations.</p>
