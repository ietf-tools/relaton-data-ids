abstract:
- content: "<p>A network slice offers connectivity services to a network slice customer
    with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs)
    over a common underlay network. RFC 9543 describes a framework for network slices
    built in networks that use IETF technologies. As part of that framework, the Network
    Resource Partition (NRP) is introduced as a collection of network resources that
    are allocated from the underlay network to carry a specific set of network slice
    service traffic and meet specific SLOs and SLEs. In some network scenarios, network
    slices using IETF technologies may span multiple network domains, and they may
    be composed hierarchically, which means a network slice itself may be further
    sliced. In the context of 5G, a 5G end-to-end network slice consists of three
    different types of network technology segments: Radio Access Network (RAN), Transport
    Network (TN) and Core Network (CN). The transport segments of the 5G end-to-end
    network slice can be provided using network slices described in RFC 9543. This
    document first describes the possible use cases of composite network slices built
    in networks that use IETF network technologies, then it provides considerations
    about the realization of composite network slices. For the multi-domain network
    slices, an Inter-Domain Network Resource Partition Identifier (Inter-domain NRP
    ID) may be introduced. For hierarchical network slices, the structure of the NRP
    ID is discussed. And for the interaction between IETF network slices with 5G network
    slices, the identifiers of the 5G network slices may be introduced into IETF networks.
    These network slice- related identifiers may be used in the data plane, control
    plane and management plane of the network for the instantiation and management
    of composite network slices. This document also describes the management considerations
    of composite network slices.</p>"
