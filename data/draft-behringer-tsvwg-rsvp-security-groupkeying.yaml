abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) allows hop-by-hop authentication
    of RSVP neighbors. This requires messages to be cryptographically signed using
    a shared secret between participating nodes. This document compares group keying
    for RSVP with per neighbor or per interface keying, and discusses the associated
    key provisioning methods as well as applicability and limitations of these approaches.
    Draft-weis-gdoi-for-rsvp specifies how the Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)
    can be used to distribute group keys to RSVP nodes. The present document also
    discusses applicability of such group keying to RSVP encryption.</p>"
