abstract:
- content: <p>The size of the published presence information document may be large.
    As specified in "Event State Publication Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP)" a presence user agent publishes a full event state of presence information
    in every publication operation which modifies the current event state. This is
    done regardless of which presence information has been changed compared to the
    earlier publications.</p>
