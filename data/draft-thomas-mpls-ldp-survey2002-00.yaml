abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwarding packets
    that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets, called labels, to determine
    packet nexthops [RFC3031]). A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching
    Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic
    between and through them. This common understanding is achieved by using a set
    of procedures, called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs
    another of label bindings it has made. One such protocol called LDP [RFC3036]
    is used by LSRs to distribute labels to support MPLS forwarding along normally
    routed paths. This document reports on a survey of LDP implementations conducted
    in August 2002 as part of the process of advancing LDP from proposed to draft
    standard.</p>"
