abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the
    DS resource record (RR) for authentication of zone delegations. This document
    introduces an alternative resource record, DS2, which similarly provides authentication
    of zone delegations. However, DS2 provides a canonical signer name, for zones
    whose content may be duplicated with multiple owner names. The zone is signed
    by the canonical signer, and the DS2 record allows for validation using this signer
    name. Author's Note</p>"
