- content: "<p>This document presents an example multipoint use case scenario for
    CLUE. This example uses the media switching variety of the Topo- Mixer RTP topology.
    This example is intended to promote discussion about how to implement it using
    the CLUE Framework, and whether or not the framework as currently defined is sufficient
    to enable this use case. This version is incomplete, and is intended to raise
    questions and prompt discussion.</p>"
