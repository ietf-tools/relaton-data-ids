abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the identity trust system, which is an open
    identity authentication system that does not require federation of authentication
    domains. It is based on a symmetric authentication protocol and a specific infrastructure
    to ensure trust in the identity providers (IdPs). Regarding the main components:
    1. Symmetric authentication protocol - Both entities MUST recognize each other
    and are authenticated by their identity provider according to a symmetric scheme.
    This protocol builds on and extends the OAuth Authorization Framework RFC6749.
    2. Trustees' network - A special network, dedicated to creating a protected environment
    for exchanging authentication messages between IdPs, constitutes the infrastructure
    to avoid domain federation. 3. Custodian concept - IdPs are divided into two typologies
    to better protect personal data. A generic IdP (called trustee) for pure digital
    authentication and a specific IdP (called custodian) under the control of the
    country's authority with legal right to the individual's real data to ensure physical
    identity.</p>"
