abstract:
- content: "<p>A Round Trip Time (RTT) estimate that decays performs badly in a bursty
    environment. A round trip time estimator that does not decay for a period of time
    is proposed. It does not require a minimum value to be configured. It works equally
    well when the typical RTT is 100uS as when it is 10 seconds.</p>"
