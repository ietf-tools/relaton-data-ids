abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the closed-loop framework for computing-aware
    traffic steering for attack detection (CATS-AD). The computing-aware traffic steering
    is determined by composing selected service instances and overlay links. The service
    instances are selected according to the computing power of service instances.
    This document describes the closed-loop framework for attacks detection and how
    to select and combine service instances to form a computing-aware service function
    chain (SFC).</p>"
