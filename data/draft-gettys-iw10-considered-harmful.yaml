abstract:
- content: "<p>The proposed change to the initial window to 10 indraft-ietf-tcpm-
    initcwnd must be considered deeply harmful; not because it is the proposed change
    is evil taken in isolation, but that other changes in web browsers and web sites
    that have occurred over the last decade, it makes the problem of transient congestion
    at a user's broadband connection two and a half times worse. This result has been
    hidden by the already widespread bufferbloat present in broadband connections.
    Packet loss in isolation is no longer a useful metric of a path's quality. The
    very drive to improve latency of web page rendering is already destroying other
    low latency applications, such as VOIP and gaming, and will prevent reliable rich
    web real time web applications such as those contemplated by the IETF rtcweb working
    group.</p>"
