abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize
    the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. An End-of-RIB marker is
    specified and can be used to convey routing convergence information. A new BGP
    capability, termed 'Graceful Restart Capability', is defined which would allow
    a BGP speaker to express its ability to preserve forwarding state during BGP restart.
    Finally, procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information
    across a TCP transport reset.</p>"
