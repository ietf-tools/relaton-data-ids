abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport Layer Security protocol or the
    Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol. The TLS and DTLS protocols
    provide authentication and privacy services for SNMP applications. This document
    describes how the TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of
    a SNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in an interoperable
    way. This Transport Model is designed to meet the security and operational needs
    of network administrators. It supports the sending of SNMP messages over TLS/TCP
    and DTLS/UDP. The TLS mode can make use of TCP's improved support for larger packet
    sizes and the DTLS mode provides potentially superior operation in environments
    where a connectionless (e.g., UDP) transport is preferred. Both TLS and DTLS integrate
    well into existing public keying infrastructures. This document also defines a
    portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management
    protocols. In particular, it defines objects for managing the TLS Transport Model
    for SNMP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
