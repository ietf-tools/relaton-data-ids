abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a revised version of the global HAHA protocol
    specification. Global HAHA allows the deployment of Home Agents over the Internet
    for reliability, scalability and performance purposes. This version clarifies
    several issues that were vague in the original specification. Global HAHA makes
    use of the signaling defined by the Home Agent Reliability protocol (HARP) although
    it is not designed to operate in conjunction with HARP.</p>"
