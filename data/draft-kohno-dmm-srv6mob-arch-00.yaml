abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer separation is a powerful concept in system architecture. In the
    area of mobility, by separating GTP-U that is the overlay tunnel, and the IP transport
    network that is the underlay, the operation of the mobile network and the transport
    network can be separated, allowing them to evolve independently. However, evolving
    individually at each layer promotes local optimization and may result in non-optimal
    solutions overall in the long run. When a drastic architectural transition is
    required, for example, in the 5G era where various SLAs and completely new data
    intensive services are assumed, it is necessary to reconsider the architecture
    holistically, rather than from the viewpoint of individual layer. One important
    value propositions of SRv6 mobile user plane is the possible optimization across
    the existing multiple layers. This document discusses the architectural implications
    of applying SRv6 mobile user plane, especially regarding the possible optimization
    of existing layers. Then it takes 5G requirements and use cases as an example,
    and describes how these use cases are simply and effectively realized with the
    inter-layer optimization capability of SRv6 mobile user plane. Thus it show that
    SRv6 mobile use plane is a right architectural choice for the 5G era.</p>"
