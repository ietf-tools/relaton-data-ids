abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) is a forwarding paradigm for use in MPLS and IPv6
    networks. It is intended to be deployed in discrete sites that may be data centers,
    access networks, or other networks that are under the control of a single operator
    and that can easily be upgraded to support this new technology. Traffic originating
    in one SR site often terminates in another SR site, but must transit a backbone
    network that provides interconnection between those sites. This document describes
    a mechanism for providing connectivity between SR sites to enable end-to-end or
    site-to-site traffic engineering. The approach described allows connectivity between
    SR sites, utilizes traffic engineering mechanisms (such as RSVP-TE or Segment
    Routing) across the backbone network, makes heavy use of pre-existing technologies,
    and requires the specification of very few additional mechanisms. This document
    provides some background and a problem statement, explains the solution mechanism,
    gives references to other documents that define protocol mechanisms, and provides
    examples. It does not define any new protocol mechanisms.</p>"
