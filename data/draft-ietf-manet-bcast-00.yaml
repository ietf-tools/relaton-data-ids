abstract:
- content: "<p>An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of which communicates
    over wireless channels and is capable of movement. Nodes participating in such
    an ad hoc network communicate on a peer-to-peer basis. Flooding is often a desired
    form of communication in these networks, as it can enable both the dissemination
    of control information and the delivery of data packets. This document describes
    a method for sending packets to every node in an d hoc networks.</p>"
