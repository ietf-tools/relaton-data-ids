abstract:
- content: "<p>When a service has been distributed over many locations in the network,
    providing service by utilizing computing resources hosted in various servers is
    required to consider supporting delay-sensitive service and optimizing network
    loads. For that reason, Computing- Aware Networking (CAN) is a new routing approach
    to balance services using service-specific metrics instead of simply dispatching
    the service request in a static way or optimizing solely connectivity metrics
    [draft-liu-can-ps-usecases]. Currently, CAN solutions are discussed with both
    existing technologies (e.g., DNS, L7 Load Balancer, etc.) and a new approach.
    In this document, it describes the LISP-based CAN approach and related standard
    works to meet requirements.</p>"
