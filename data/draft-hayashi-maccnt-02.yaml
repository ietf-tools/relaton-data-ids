abstract:
- content: "<p>This I-D describes problems on accounting issues in multicasting. General
    requirements for accounting capabilities including QoS related issues are listed.
    This I-D assumes that these capabilities can be realized by appropriate functions
    implemented at edges of a network based on IGMP or MLD. Such functions would log
    in a dedicated database information obtained from edge routers. Finally, a case
    for CDN services is described as an application example which could benefit from
    multicasting with accounting capabilities. It is proposed that this I-D be used
    as a starting point for further discussion on these issues.</p>"
