abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution for link protection, node protection,
    Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) protection and fast recovery of inter-AS packet
    based LSPs. These problems are highlighted in [ASREQ]. The proposed solution is
    based on RSVP-TE [RFC3209] as recommended by [ASREQ]. Only the protection of links
    between 2 ASs, the protection of their SRLGs and of the nodes at the border of
    an AS are in the scope of this document.</p>"
