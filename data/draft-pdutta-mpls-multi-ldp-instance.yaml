abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    [RFC5036] for implementation of multiple LDP instances in a network node, where
    all such instances share the common data plane. Multiple LDP instances provide
    a method for operators for fate separation of various LDP FEC Types as well as
    for network segmentation. The methods defined in this extension are backward compatible
    with procedures defined in [RFC5036]</p>"
