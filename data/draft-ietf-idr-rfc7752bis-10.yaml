abstract:
- content: "<p>In a number of environments, a component external to a network is called
    upon to perform computations based on the network topology and the current state
    of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information.
    This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the
    network. This document describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE information
    can be collected from networks and shared with external components using the BGP
    routing protocol. This is achieved using a new BGP Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) encoding format. The mechanism is applicable to physical and
    virtual IGP links. The mechanism described is subject to policy control. Applications
    of this technique include Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) servers
    and Path Computation Elements (PCEs). This document obsoletes RFC 7752 by completely
    replacing that document. It makes some small changes and clarifications to the
    previous specification. This document also obsoletes RFC 9029 by incorporating
    the updates which it made to RFC 7752.</p>"
