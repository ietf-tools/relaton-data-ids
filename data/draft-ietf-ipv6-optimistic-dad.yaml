abstract:
- content: "<p>Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection is an interoperable modification
    of the existing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 2461) and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
    (RFC 2462) processes. The intention is to minimize address configuration delays
    in the successful case, to reduce disruption as far as possible in the failure
    case, and to remain interoperable with unmodified hosts and routers. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
