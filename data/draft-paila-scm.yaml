abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditionally, multicast trees in the Internet are built bottom-up.
    The construction of multicast trees depends on the multicast receivers's ability
    to inform their next hop multicast routers about their multicast group memberships.
    There are cases, in which the traditional host-driven way of building the multicast
    trees is insufficient. To point out one, consider an access network with unidirectional
    links. In a mobile environment, this requires that the receiving interface of
    a mobile node must also have the capabilities to send out MLD or IGMP responses.
    This is not possible for broadcast networks (e.g DVB-T and DAB), that provide
    high downstream data rates, but no uplink connectivity. This document presents
    Source Controlled Multicast as a proposal solution to overcome the problems with
    unidirectional links. It presents a way to for source to control the multicast
    tree joining process on behalf of mobile nodes behind unidirectional links.</p>"
