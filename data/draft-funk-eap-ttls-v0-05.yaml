abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-TTLS is an EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) method that
    encapsulates a TLS (Transport Layer Security) session, consisting of a handshake
    phase and a data phase. During the handshake phase, the server is authenticated
    to the client (or client and server are mutually authenticated) using standard
    TLS procedures, and keying material is generated in order to create a cryptographically
    secure tunnel for information exchange in the subsequent data phase. During the
    data phase, the client is authenticated to the server (or client and server are
    mutually authenticated) using an arbitrary authentication mechanism encapsulated
    within the secure tunnel. The encapsulated authentication mechanism may itself
    be EAP, or it may be another authentication protocol such as PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP,
    or MS-CHAP-V2. Thus, EAP-TTLS allows legacy password-based authentication protocols
    to be used against existing authentication databases, while protecting the security
    of these legacy protocols against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and other
    attacks. The data phase may also be used for additional, arbitrary data exchange.
