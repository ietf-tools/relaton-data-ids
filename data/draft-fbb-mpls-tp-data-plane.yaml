abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
    is the set of MPLS protocol functions applicable to the construction and operation
    of packet-switched transport networks. This document specifies the subset of these
    functions that comprises the MPLS-TP data plane: the architectural layer concerned
    with the encapsulation and forwarding of packets within an MPLS-TP network. This
    document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International
    Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort
    to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures
    to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
