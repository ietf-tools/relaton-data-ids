abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax
    (CMS) to protect firmware packages, which provide object code for one or more
    hardware module components. CMS is specified in RFC 3852. A digital signature
    is used to protect the firmware package from undetected modification and to provide
    data origin authentication. Encryption is optionally used to protect the firmware
    package from disclosure, and compression is optionally used to reduce the size
    of the protected firmware package. A firmware package loading receipt can optionally
    be generated to acknowledge the successful loading of a firmware package. Similarly,
    a firmware package load error report can optionally be generated to convey the
    failure to load a firmware package. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
