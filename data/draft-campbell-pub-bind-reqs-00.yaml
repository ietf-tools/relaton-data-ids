abstract:
- content: "<p>A growing number of SIP based services depend on the idea that clients
    may publish service-related information to network elements. This information
    may then affect further processing of the service. Examples of such services include
    presence and CPL. Multiple protocols may exists for the actual publication of
    such data. But regardless of the protocol, a client must know where to send it.
    This document describes requirements for a mechanism to inform clients where and
    how to publish service related information.</p>"
