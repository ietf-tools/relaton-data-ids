abstract:
- content: '<p>The Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol is an efficient
    and extensible transport mechanism for IP over MPEG-2 networks. Such networks
    are often operated on broadcast wireless channels, and are thus specifically vulnerable
    to attacks. Passive attacks, such as eaves-dropping, are simple to perform and
    emphasize the importance of security support within ULE. This document defines
    a mandatory security extension for the ULE protocol that is designed with the
    aim of being conservative in bandwidth consumption and lightweight in the sense
    that it allows for implementation in low-cost, resource-scarce (mobile) receiver
    devices. The extension may be easily adapted to the Generic Stream Encapsulation
    (GSE) protocol, which uses the same extension header mechanism. The document describes
    the format of the security extension header, specifies default security algorithms
    to be used with this extension, and gives detailed processing descriptions for
    devices implementing the security extension. Conventions used in this document
    The following DVB specific terms are taken from [RFC4326] and recapitulated here
    for easy lookup: DVB: Digital Video Broadcast. A framework and set of associated
    standards published by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
    for the transmission of video, audio, and data using the ISO MPEG-2 standard [MPEG2].
    MPEG-2: A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG)
    and standardized by the International Standards Organization (ISO/IEC 13818-1)
    [MPEG2] and ITU-T [H222]. NPA: Network Point of Attachment. In this document,
    refers to a 48- bit destination address (resembling an IEEE MAC address) within
    the MPEG-2 transmission network that is used to identify individual receivers
    or groups of receivers. PDU: Protocol Data Unit. Examples of a PDU include Ethernet
    frames, IPv4 or IPv6 datagrams, and other network packets. PID: Packet Identifier
    [MPEG2]. A 13-bit field carried in the header of TS cells. This is used to identify
    the TS Logical Channel to which a TS cell belongs [MPEG2]. SNDU: SubNetwork Data
    Unit. An encapsulated PDU sent as an MPEG-2 payload unit. TS: Transport Stream
    [MPEG2]. A method of transmission at the MPEG-2 level using TS cells; it represents
    layer 2 of the ISO/OSI reference model. TS Logical Channel: Transport Stream Logical
    Channel. In this document, this term identifies a channel at the MPEG-2 level
    [MPEG2]. All packets sent over a TS Logical Channel carry the same PID value.
    ULE: Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation [RFC4326]. A protocol that encapsulates
    PDUs into SNDUs that are sent in a series of TS cells using a single TS Logical
    Channel. Terms and abbreviations from cryptography are explained when they first
    appear within this document. All numbers encoded in protocols are to be interpreted
    in network byte order. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL", when
    appearing within this document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>'
