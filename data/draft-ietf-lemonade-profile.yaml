abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a profile (a set of required extensions, restrictions,
    and usage modes) of the IMAP and mail submission protocols. This profile allows
    clients (especially those that are constrained in memory, bandwidth, processing
    power, or other areas) to efficiently use IMAP and Submission to access and submit
    mail. This includes the ability to forward received mail without needing to download
    and upload the mail, to optimize submission, and to efficiently resynchronize
    in case of loss of connectivity with the server. The Internet Email to Support
    Diverse Service Environments (Lemonade) profile relies upon extensions to IMAP
    and Mail Submission protocols; specifically, the URLAUTH and CATENATE IMAP protocol
    (RFC 3501) extensions and the BURL extension to the SUBMIT protocol (RFC 4409).
