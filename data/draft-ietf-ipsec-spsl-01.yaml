abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Security Policy Specification Language
    (SPSL), a language designed to express security policies, security domains, and
    the entities that manage the policies and domains. The syntax and semantics of
    the language are presented here. SPSL currently supports policies for packet filtering,
    IP Security (IPSec), and ISAKMP exchanges, however, it may easily be extended
    to express other types of policies.</p>"
