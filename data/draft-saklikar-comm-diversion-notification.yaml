abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification
    Framework-based mechanism for notifying Users about diversions (re-directions
    or forwarding) of their incoming communication sessions. A new event package is
    proposed for allowing users to subscribe for and receive such notifications. Users
    have further capability to define filters controlling the selection, rate and
    content of such notifications. The applicability of this event package includes
    3GPP IMS.</p>"
