abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with point-to-point
    MPLS LSPs the requirement to detect, handle and diagnose control and dataplane
    defects is critical. For operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs
    the detection and specification of how to handle those defects is important because
    such defects may not only affect the fundamental of an MPLS network, but also
    because they MAY impact service level specification commitments for customers
    of their network.</p>"
