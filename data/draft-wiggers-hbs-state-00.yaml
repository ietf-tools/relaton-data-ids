abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes (S-HBS) such as LMS, HSS, XMSS
    and XMSS^MT combine Merkle trees with One-Time Signatures (OTS) to provide signatures
    that are resistant against attacks using large- scale quantum computers. Unlike
    conventional stateless digital signature schemes, S-HBS have a state to keep track
    of which OTS keys have been used, as double-signing with the same OTS key allows
    forgeries. This document provides guidance and documents security considerations
    for the operational and technical aspects of deploying systems that rely on S-HBS.
    Management of the state of the S-HBS, including any handling of redundant key
    material, is a sensitive topic, and we discuss some approaches to handle the associated
    challenges. We also describe the challenges that need to be resolved before certain
    approaches should be considered.</p>"
