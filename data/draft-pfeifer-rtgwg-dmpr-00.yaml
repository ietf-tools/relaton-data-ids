abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector routing
    protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing. It has been
    designed from scratch to work at both low and high bandwidth networks - even with
    high packet loss. The objective was to keep routing overhead low and ensure a
    deterministic upper limit. DMPR can be used to manage huge networks with a similar
    feature set as BGPv4 except for the concept of autonomous systems.</p>"
