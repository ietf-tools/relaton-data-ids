abstract:
- content: <p>The WARC (Web ARChive) format specifies a method for combining multiple
    digital resources into an aggregate archival file together with related information.
    Resources are dated, identified by URIs, and preceded by simple text headers.
    By convention, files of this format are named with the extension ".warc" and have
    the MIME type application/warc. The WARC file format is a revision and generalization
    of the ARC format used by the Internet Archive to store information blocks harvested
    by web crawlers. This document specifies version 0.16 of the WARC format.</p>
