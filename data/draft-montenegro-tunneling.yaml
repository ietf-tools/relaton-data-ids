abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP specification uses tunneling from the home agent to the
    mobile node, but rarely in the reverse direction. Usually, a mobile node sends
    its packets through a router in the foreign net, and assumes that routing is independent
    of source address. When this assumption is not true, it is convenient to establish
    topologically correct bi-directional tunnels between the home agent and the mobile
    node's care-of address. This document proposes backwards-compatible extensions
    to Mobile IP in order to support topologically correct bi-directional tunnels.
    This document does not attempt to solve the problems posed by firewalls located
    between the home agent and the mobile node's care-of address.</p>"
