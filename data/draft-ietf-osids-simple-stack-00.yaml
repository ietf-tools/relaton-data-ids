abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mapping of protocols defined by the Abstract
    Service Description Conventions onto Connection Oriented Transport Service, Connectionless
    Transport Service, TCP, and UDP [MHS88b]. This mapping will support all ROS (Remote
    Operation Service) based protocols, such as directory, both with and without use
    of RTS (Reliable Transfer Service), and all of the X.400 services [ISO88, CCI88,
    MHS88a]. Four example applications of the Simple OSI Stack (SOS) are given in
    appendices. These are all ``real'' examples, which will are quite likely to evolve
    into formal specifications. They are intended to show that specification of SOS
    applications is very straightforward and useful. These examples will be dropped
    from future versions of this document, and perhaps be replaced by artificial examples.</p>"
