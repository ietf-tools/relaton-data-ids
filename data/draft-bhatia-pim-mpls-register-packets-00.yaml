abstract:
- content: "<p>In PIM-SM the designated router (DR) closest to the source keeps sending
    PIM register packets till it receives an explicit Register- Stop message from
    the rendezvous point (RP) router. The process of encapsulating multicast data
    traffic to the RP, and the decapsulation done by RP are relatively expensive operations
    for a router to perform, depending upon whether or not the router has appropriate
    hardware support for these tasks. Since the PIM register messages are native IP
    packets and routed based on IP forwarding tables no resource reservation mechanisms
    are available. All IP packets will follow common paths that are defined by the
    traditional IGP's algorithm and customizing the path for multicast applications
    is impossible. This document proposes using MPLS tunnel(s) to send traffic from
    the source to the RP till the shortest path tree (SPT) from the RP to the source
    is established. Processing MPLS packets is easy and is readily supported on most
    platforms.</p>"
