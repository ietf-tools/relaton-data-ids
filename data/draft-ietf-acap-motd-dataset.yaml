abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] is designed to
    support remote storage and access of common application option, configuration
    and preference information. Once such piece of information is the 'Message of
    the Day' greeting, used by system administrators to communicate important information
    to all users when they begin to use a system. This document describes a common
    format for storing MOTD information in ACAP, how site administrators may configure
    their ACAP MOTD service to allow multiple groups within the site to provide custom
    MOTD information, and how a client should access and use this information.</p>"
