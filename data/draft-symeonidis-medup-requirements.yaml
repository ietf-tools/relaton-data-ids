abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC8280] has identified and documented important principles, such
    as Data Minimization, End-to-End, and Interoperability in order to enable access
    to fundamental Human Rights. While (partial) implementations of these concepts
    are already available, many current applications lack Privacy support that the
    average user can easily navigate. This document covers analysis of threats to
    privacy and security and derives requirements from this threat analysis.</p>"
