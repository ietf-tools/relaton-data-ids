abstract:
- content: <p>The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX type
    devices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address of Records,
    using the GIN mechanism defined in [draft-gin]. Two other drafts, [draft-olive]
    and [draft-glass], propose the same for non-E.164-based AoRs. This document defines
    a means by which the IP-PBX can verify the resolution entries in the SSP for open-
    ended or full AoRs of any GIN-based mechanism, using a new Event- Package named
    "vermouth".</p>
