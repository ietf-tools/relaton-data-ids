abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to represent Sieve email filtering language
    scripts in XML. Representing Sieves in XML is intended not as an alternate storage
    format for Sieve but rather as a means to facilitate manipulation of scripts using
    XML tools. The XML representation also defines additional elements that have no
    counterparts in the regular Sieve language. These elements are intended for use
    by graphical user interfaces and provide facilities for labeling or grouping sections
    of a script so they can be displayed more conveniently. These elements are represented
    as specially structured comments in regular Sieve format. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
