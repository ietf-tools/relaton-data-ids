abstract:
- content: '<p>Web servers and the entities that operate them have long had the ability
    to track user agents as they access resources hosted across different web domains.
    Concern over the privacy implications of such tracking has prompted recent work
    on a number of solutions that aim to provide a universal opt-out mechanism for
    web tracking that can be effectuated through a simple binary choice presented
    to users. This document provides an overview of the following mechanisms: permanent
    opt-out cookies, cookie blocking, domain blocking, a "Do Not Track" (DNT) HTTP
    header, and a Do Not Track Document Object Model (DOM) property. The aim of this
    document is to describe each approach, the pros and cons of each, and areas where
    standardization may be necessary should each approach be further pursued, without
    making recommendations about which approach or approaches should be adopted.</p>'
