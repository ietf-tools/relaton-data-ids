abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label switched
    paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with bandwidth guarantees. The
    reliability of these LSPs can be increased by providing a backup LSP onto which
    traffic can be switched upon failure of an element in the path of the active LSP.
    Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth can be shared between backup
    links of more than one active path while still guaranteeing recoverability for
    a set of failures. This sharing greatly increases the network efficiency thereby
    increasing the number of LSPs that can be carried while maintaining guarantees.
    Algorithms which can route such recoverable LSPs while using only aggregate network
    usage information are being developed. Keeping these algorithms as the primary
    motivation this document describes a mechanism to signal shared backup LSPs using
    RSVP.</p>"
