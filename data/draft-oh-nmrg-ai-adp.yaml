abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of AI technology to automate the management
    of computer network resources distributed across different locations. AI-based
    network management by automating distributed processing involves utilizing deep
    learning algorithms to analyze network traffic, identify potential issues, and
    take proactive measures to prevent or mitigate those issues. Network administrators
    can efficiently manage and optimize their networks, thereby improving network
    performance and reliability. AI-based network management also aids in optimizing
    network performance by identifying bottlenecks in the network and automatically
    adjusting network settings to enhance throughput and reduce latency. By implementing
    AI-based network management through automated distributed processing, organizations
    can improve network performance, and reduce the need for manual network management
    tasks.</p>"
