abstract:
- content: "<p>The Differentiated Mail Transfer Protocol (DMTP) provides simple extensions
    to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that enable receivers to exercise
    greater control over the email delivery process. The current SMTP-based email
    delivery architecture is fundamentally sender-driven and distinctly lacks receiver
    control over the message delivery mechanisms. This document describes DMTP that
    enables receivers to classify senders into three categories -- allowed, denied,
    and unclassified -- and process the delivery of messages from each category independently.
    As is the current practice, receivers may directly accept messages from senders
    in the allowed category and decline senders in the denied category. In addition,
    DMTP receivers require senders in the unclassified category to store messages
    on the senders' own mail servers. Such messages are retrieved only if and when
    the end receivers wish to do so. By granting greater control over message delivery
    to receivers and imposing greater message storage and maintenance overhead on
    senders, DMTP provides significant advantages in controlling spam. DMTP also easily
    operates in conjunction with (but does not require) many currently deployed anti-spam
    techniques.</p>"
