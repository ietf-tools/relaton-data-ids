abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for security management in
    Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework. This security management
    architecture consists of I2NSF User, Security Management System (i.e., Security
    Controller and Developer's Management System), and Network Security Functions
    (NSFs) in the I2NSF framework. I2NSF User consists of Application Logic, Policy
    Updater, and Event Collector. Security Controller consists of Security Policy
    Manager and NSF Capability Manager. This document explains their missions and
    the processing of security management in a high level. It also describes representative
    use cases, such as security management for the list of malware domains, security
    management for VoIP-VoLTE and time-dependent access control.</p>"
