abstract:
- content: "<p>Since IPv6 connectivity is not yet broadly available, there is a need
    in NEMO for a simple technology that allows a MIPv6 based Mobile Router to roam
    over IPv4 networks. The Doors Protocol proposed in this memo allows an arbitrary
    Mobile Node to roam even within private IPv4 address spaces, across both Network
    Address Translations (NAT), reverse NAT, and even Port Address Translation (PAT),
    in order to cope with the reality of today's Internet.</p>"
