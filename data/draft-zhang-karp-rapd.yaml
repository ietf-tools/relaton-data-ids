abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a conceptual database, the Routing Authentication
    Policy Database (RAPD), which cooperates with the key table to provide the configuration
    information for the automated key management protocols in generating key materials
    for routing protocols. Additionally, the RAPD also provides authorization policies
    so as to guarantee that the keying material for securing routing protocol exchanges
    is distributed only to the appropriate peers.</p>"
