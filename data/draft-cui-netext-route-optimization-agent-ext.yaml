abstract:
- content: <p>Route Optimization is a very useful feature in Mobile IPv6. Mobile node
    can communicate with correspondent node without the involvement of the home agent
    in Route Optimization mode. But there are some limitations to this feature. One
    problem is that the mobile node and the correspondent node must be capable for
    Route Optimization. This document introduces a Route Optimization Agent function
    used for Route Optimization and this extension mechanism can enable Route Optimization
    mode to be used between mobile node and simple IP node. In the extension solution,
    the Route Optimization Agent function may be implemented in LMA or MAG and the
    Agent entity can reflect the RO-related signal messages and accomplish the Route
    Optimization procedure on behalf of the simple IP node. Conventions used in this
    document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
    interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
