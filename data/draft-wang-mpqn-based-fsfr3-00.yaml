abstract:
- content: "<p>Considering movement characteristics of mobile users, the authors have
    proposed a kind of soft-handoff-supporting motion-prediction- and-QoS-negotiation-based
    fan-shaped flexible resource reservation mechanism, which can provide QoS guarantees
    to mobile user effectively. The signaling overhead for handoff gets effective
    control by reverse rerouting mechanisms, being much advantageous than partial
    rerouting and complete rerouting. Combining the above two mechanisms, soft handoff
    can be guaranteed and high resource utilization can be attained in the mobile
    wireless Internet. Simulation has shown the proposed mechanisms are both efficient
    and effective.</p>"
