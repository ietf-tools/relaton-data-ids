abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes four cryptographic user interface suites ("UI
    suites") for IP Security (IPsec), similar to the two suites specified in RFC 4308.
    The four new suites provide compatibility with the United States National Security
    Agency's Suite B specifications. This document obsoletes RFC 4869, which presented
    earlier versions of these suites. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
