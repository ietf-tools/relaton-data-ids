abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the IPv7 proposal called EIPIP (Extended
    IP using PIP) meets the evaluation criteria established by the Internet Engineering
    Steering Group and described in 'RFC-1380 IESG Deliberations on Routing and Addressing'.
    EIPIP is currently developed to be both a transition mechanism for a new IP protocol
    (PIP), and the new IP protocol. This document also includes how EIPIP meets the
    criteria described by Partridge/Kastenholz in their Internet Draft 'Criteria for
    Choosing IP Version 7 (IPv7)'.</p>"
