abstract:
- content: "<p>Issuers of Digital Credentials enable dynamic state or status checks
    through the use of dereferenceable identifiers, that resolve to resources providing
    herd privacy. Privacy in such systems is determined not just from the size of
    the herd, and the cryptographic structure encoding it, but also from the observability
    of access to shared state. This document describes a privacy preserving state
    management system for digital credentials based on Oblivious HTTP that addresses
    both data model and protocol risks associated with digital credentials with dynamic
    state.</p>"
