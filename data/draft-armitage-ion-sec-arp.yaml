abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses some security issues associated with IP over
    ATM operation. RFC1577 defines the Classic IP model for sending IP traffic over
    ATM. However, security issues were not addressed in the standard. Since internet
    is an open architecture, security measures to protect network integrity are essential
    for normal operation. The security loopholes in the current RFC 1577 model are
    analyzed and discussed. Possible solutions are proposed.</p>"
