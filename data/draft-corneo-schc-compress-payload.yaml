abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several techniques to enable utilization of
    the same engine to compress and decompress headers from the existing SCHC framework
    [RFC8724], but used to compress payload of specific protocols. The first approach
    is to introduce new type of static rules that enable encoding application data.
    This extensions provides compact and generic variation on how data is organized.
    The second approach provides dynamic compression and decompression. Here, the
    system identifies parts of the payload that can be compressed, and enables a SCHC
    decompressor to restore the original packet.</p>"
