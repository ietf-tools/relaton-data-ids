abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) Resource Record TYPEs IANA registry reserves
    the range 128-255 for Q-TYPEs and Meta-TYPEs [RFC6895] - Resource Records that
    can only be queried for or contain transient data associated with a particular
    DNS message. This document reserves a range of RR TYPE numbers for Covert-TYPEs
    - types that are an integral part of the zone but cannot be accessed via a normal
    QUERY operation. Uses for such records could include zone comments that are transferrable
    with the zone, expiry times for dynamically updated records, or Zone Signing Keys
    for inline signing. This document, however, does not define any specific Covert
    RR types.</p>"
