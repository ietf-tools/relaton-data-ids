abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a Per Hop Behavior(PHB) in the context of diffserv.
    We first propose a labeling procedure for the ingress router that labels packets
    in a manner that implicitly conveys the packet arrival rate information of each
    flow to the core router. Coupled with a simple forwarding procedure, this provides
    a fair allocation of bandwidth. We then propose other labeling procedures that
    add little computational complexity, but provide weighted fair allocation, minimum
    bandwidth assurances and support for intra-flow priorities. By appropriately designing
    the labeling algorithms, this PHB can be used to optimize the performance of a
    variety of flows.</p>"
