abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism that allows consistent discovery
    of ROLIE repositories. This discovery is extremely important for automated tools
    that cannot use out-of-band Service Document discovery. Any human operators are
    also able to use this mechanism to avoid relying on inconsistent human to human
    communication. This document updates the ROLIE core specification.</p>"
