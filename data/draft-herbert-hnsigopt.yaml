abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes an option format for Hop-by-Hop and Destination
    Options for host-net signaling (host to network and network to host signaling).
    The format supports a uniform mechanism for sending signals and reflecting received
    signals back to an originating sender. While this document describes a format
    for IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options or Destination options, the base format for carrying
    signals is generic and could be the payload of other options mechanisms such as
    UDP Options or Geneve options.</p>"
