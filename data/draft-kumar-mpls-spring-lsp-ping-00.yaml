abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the source routing and tunneling
    paradigm and can be directly applied to MPLS dataplane. A node steers a packet
    through a controlled set of instructions called segments, by prepending the packet
    with Segment Routing header. The segment assignment and forwarding semantic nature
    of Segment Routing raises additional consideration for connectivity verification
    and fault isolation in LSP with SPRING architecture. This document illustrates
    the problem and describe a mechanism to perform LSP Ping and Traceroute on Segment
    Routing network over MPLS dataplane.</p>"
