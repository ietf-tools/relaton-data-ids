abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Protected Password-based Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) method. PP-EAP is an EAP method that enables secure exchange of
    password authentication mechanisms between a peer and an EAP server by using the
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a server-authenticated TLS tunnel.
    Within the tunnel, Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects are used to convey password-based
    authentication between the peer and the EAP server.</p>"
