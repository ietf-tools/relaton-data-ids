abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet protocols have as an essential element a mapping from
    a textual name to some resource. There is a technique, popular in some circles,
    of providing a default resource, which is returned in response to a lookup that
    does not match any known name, rather than returning an indication that there
    is no resource of that name. This technique is dangerous and is to be discouraged
    in all contexts. This memo discusses the issues.</p>"
