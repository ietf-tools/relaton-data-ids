abstract:
- content: "<p>TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses) is a solution for IPng. TUBA
    has two components: a replacement for the IPv4 network layer protocol and a transition
    strategy. The TUBA transition strategy is fully documented in another 'Transition
    Plan for TUBA/CLNP,' draft-tuba-transition-00.txt, by D. Piscitello. The TUBA
    concept for IPng was originally presented in RFC 1347 in June, 1992.</p>"
