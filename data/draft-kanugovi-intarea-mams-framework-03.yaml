abstract:
- content: "<p>In multiconnectivity scenarios, the end-user devices can simultaneously
    connect to multiple networks based on different access technologies and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. Both the quality of experience of the users
    and the overall network utilization and efficiency may be improved through the
    smart selection and combination of access and core network paths that can dynamically
    adapt to changing network conditions. This document presents a unified problem
    statement and introduces a solution for managing multiconnectivity. The solution
    has been developed by the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards
    bodies including the IETF and 3GPP, but is not an Internet Standard and does not
    represent the consensus opinion of the IETF. This document describes the requirements,
    solution principles, and an architectural framework that aims to provide best
    performance while being easy to implement in a wide variety of multiconnectivity
    deployments. It specifies the protocol multi-access management to: 1) flexibly
    select the best combination of access and core network paths for uplink and downlink;
    as well as 2) determine the user plane treatment and traffic distribution over
    the selected links ensuring network efficiency and application performance.</p>"
