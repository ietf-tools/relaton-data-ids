abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other
    secure network services over an insecure network. This document describes the
    SSH Connection Protocol. It provides interactive login sessions, remote execution
    of commands, forwarded TCP/IP connections, and forwarded X11 connections. All
    of these channels are multiplexed into a single encrypted tunnel. The SSH Connection
    Protocol has been designed to run on top of the SSH transport layer and user authentication
    protocols. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
