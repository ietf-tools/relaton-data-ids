abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an incremental, network-based method for deploying
    SHIM6 or HIP based identifier / locator separation, called Proxying Approach to
    SHIM6 and HIP (PASH). This mechanism requires no changes to host stacks and, when
    deployed with routable Endpoint IDentifiers (EID), no changes to existing database
    infrastructures. The proposed protocol can be implemented in a relatively small
    number of routers, and deployed independently by ISPs. At the same time, it allows
    the network to gradually evolve towards full, host-based SHIM6 and/or HIP support,
    thereby making possible the larger architectural benefits that the network-based
    "jack-up" approaches provide. This proposal has been on the mental roadmaps within
    the HIP community for a number of years, but is properly documented only now as
    a result of the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing
    Workshop (RAWS).</p>
