abstract:
- content: "<p>The word 'hypertext' was coined by Theodor Holm Nelson in his paper
    'A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminate', presented
    at the ACM 20th national conference in 1965. One of the key concepts in Nelson's
    vision of hypertext is 'transclusion' or virtual inclusion, which permits composite
    documents to be constructed by reference to the original components rather than
    by copying. The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to
    create hypertext documents that are platform independent. HTML currently permits
    the transclusion of various content types using tags which accept a 'SRC' attribute,
    such as the IMG, EMBED and APPLET tags, but does not provide a mechanism for transcluding
    textual content. This document proposes markup for text transclusions in HTML
    and explains its usage.</p>"
