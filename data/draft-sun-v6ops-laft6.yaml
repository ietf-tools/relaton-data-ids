abstract:
- content: "<p>With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scale
    ISPs are now facing the option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner. However, most
    existing IPv6 transition solutions have tradeoff between scalability and efficiency.
    This draft proposes a lightweight address family transition mechanism named LAFT6.
    It only needs to maintain per-subscriber state entries in core network and there
    is no specific address format requirement for users' IPv6 address. It is a lightweight
    solution in terms of state-management, addressing and routing. The experimental
    results have shown that LAFT6 is scalable and can be rapidly deployed in commercial
    ISP network.</p>"
