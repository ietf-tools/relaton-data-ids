abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a system of secret IV for ESP, based on the encryption
    of the sequence number. It doesn't add any space overhead in the packet and its
    generation can be parallelized and precomputed. Compared to the common explicit
    random IV (current MUST for ESP RFC2405.3 [5], or AES-CBC.3 [7]), it is more secure,
    saves bandwidth (e.g. 8 bytes with DES/3DES and 16 bytes with AES) but requires
    slightly more computation.</p>"
