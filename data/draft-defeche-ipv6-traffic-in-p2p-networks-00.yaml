abstract:
- content: "<p>This document summarizes a University thesis which aims to measure
    the evolution over time of IPv6 traffic, to analyze the geographical distribution
    of IPv6 nodes and to compare the two Internet Protocol versions on many different
    criteria (RTT, latency, MTU). The measurements were done during the Summer 2009
    using a specific- purpose program which connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer
    network. The study was made in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because they are responsible
    for most Internet traffic and because their structure and functioning permit a
    rapid discovery of a large number of nodes from all over the world. In addition,
    the P2P users are more likely to be interested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the
    same NAT problems as IPv4.</p>"
