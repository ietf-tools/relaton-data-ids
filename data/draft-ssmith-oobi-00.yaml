abstract:
- content: "<p>An Out-Of-Band Introduction (OOBI) provides a discovery mechanism that
    associates a given URI or URL with a given AID (Autonomic IDentifier) or SAID
    (Self-Addressing IDentifier) [KERI_ID][KERI][SAID_ID][OOBI_ID]. The URI provided
    by an OOBI acts as a service endpoint for the discovery of verifiable information
    about the AID or SAID. As such an OOBI itself is not trusted but must be verified.
    To clarify, any information obtained from the service endpoint provided in the
    OOBI must be verified by some other mechanism. An OOBI, however, enables any internet
    and web search infrastructure to act as an out-of-band infrastructure to discover
    information that is verified using an in-band mechanism or protocol. The primary
    in-band verification protocol is KERI [KERI_ID][KERI]. The OOBI protocol provides
    a web-based bootstrap and/or discovery mechanism for the KERI and the ACDC (Authentic
    Chained Data Container) protocols [KERI_ID][ACDC_ID][OOBI_ID]. Thus the security
    (or more correctly the lack of security) of an OOBI is out-of-band with respect
    to a KERI AID or an ACDC that uses KERI. To clarify, everything in KERI or that
    depends on KERI is end-verifiable, therefore it has no security dependency nor
    does it rely on security guarantees that may or may not be provided by web or
    internet infrastructure. OOBIs provide a bootstrap that enables what we call Percolated
    Information Discovery (PID) which is based on Invasion Percolation Theory [IPT][DOMIP][PT][FPP].
    This bootstrap may then be parlayed into a secure mechanism for accepting and
    updating data. The principal data acceptance and update policy is denoted BADA
    (Best-Available-Data-Acceptance).</p>"
