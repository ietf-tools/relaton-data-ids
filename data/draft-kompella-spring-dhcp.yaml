abstract:
- content: "<p>Node and ring segment identifiers (SIDs) assignements in a particular
    domain (such as an IGP area) must follow certain rules: they must be allocated
    from a configured set of SID blocks; they must be unique; and the values should
    be sticky, i.e., the same value(s) should be assigned to a node should its assignment
    expire (as might happen if the node resets). This memo suggests the use of the
    Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol to handle such assignments.</p>"
