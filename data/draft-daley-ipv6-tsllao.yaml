abstract:
- content: <p>The proposed IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Optimization "Optimistic
    DAD" defines a set of recoverable procedures which allow a node to make use of
    an address before DAD completes. Essentially, Optimistic DAD forbids usage of
    certain Neighbour Discovery options which could pollute active neighbour cache
    entries, while an address is tentative. This document defines a new option and
    procedures to replace cache polluting options, in a way which is useful to tentative
    nodes. These procedures are designed to be to backward compatible with existing
    devices which support IPv6 Neighbour Discovery.</p>
