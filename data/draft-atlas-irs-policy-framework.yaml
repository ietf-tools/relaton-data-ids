abstract:
- content: "<p>A key aspect of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) is what
    mechanisms it includes to carry policy information and to enable policy control.
    This applies both in the protocol itself and in the services associated with the
    different components of the routing system. Similarly, the data-models associated
    with the services must be capable of expressing the appropriate granularity for
    access and authorization-related policy. This document describes the policy framework
    for I2RS.</p>"
