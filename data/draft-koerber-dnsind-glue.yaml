abstract:
- content: "<p>The GLUE-type Resource records offer an alternative to the use of traditional
    address records (A, AAAA, A6) as glue in parent zones. The intention is that GLUE-type
    records are only ever returned in the additional section of referrals, rather
    than as reply to address queries to a parent nameserver which is not actually
    responsible for the delegated zone.</p>"
