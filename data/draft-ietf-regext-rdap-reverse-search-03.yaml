abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query
    capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities matching
    a given search pattern. Even if such capabilities, commonly referred as reverse
    search, respond to some needs not yet readily fulfilled by the current Whois protocol,
    they have raised concerns from two perspectives: server processing impact and
    data privacy. Anyway, the impact of the reverse queries on RDAP servers processing
    is the same as the standard searches and it can be reduced by implementing policies
    to deal with large result sets, while data privacy risks can be prevented by RDAP
    access control functionality. In the RDAP context, an entity can be associated
    to any defined object class. Therefore, a reverse search can be applied to other
    use cases than the classic domain-entity scenario. This document describes an
    RDAP search query extension that allows clients to request a reverse search based
    on the relationship between an object and the associated entities.</p>"
