abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of P-Charging-Function-Addresses
    and P-Charging-Vector headers. The former header is used to pass the addresses
    of entities that provide a charging function. The latter header is used to pass
    charging correlation information. The affected UAs and proxies associated with
    a dialog or standalone transaction need to know the identities or addresses of
    the appropriate charging entities. They also need to pass correlation information
    so that the records generated and sent to the charging entities may be properly
    associated for a coordinated billing effort.</p>"
