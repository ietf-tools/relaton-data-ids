abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a problem statement for simultaneous mobility
    in an infrastructure-based mobility environment. It considers what the simultaneous
    mobility problem is and describes the conditions under which it may occur. It
    also illustrates the occurrence of the simultaneous mobility problem in the context
    of different mobility protocols such as Mobile IPv6. The simultaneous mobility
    problem defined here is strictly applied to scenarios when the intermediary nodes
    in the core are not mobile.</p>"
