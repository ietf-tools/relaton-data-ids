abstract:
- content: "<p>Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create the sense of really
    being present. A number of techniques for handling audio and video streams are
    used to create this experience. When these techniques are not similar, interoperability
    between different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible. Conveying
    information about the relationships between multiple streams of media would allow
    senders and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork.
    This memo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending multiple
    streams in a telepresence conference.</p>"
