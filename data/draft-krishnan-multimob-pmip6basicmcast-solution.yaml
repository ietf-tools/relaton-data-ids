abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how multicast routing can be supported in Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 in a way similar to Mobile IPv6. The Mobile Access Gateway tunnels
    MLD messages from the mobile nodes to local mobility anchor. The Local Mobility
    Anchor joins the multicast group and starts forwarding the received multicast
    packets to the mobile access gateway. In case of a handover the tunnel end point
    changes but the operation remains anchored at the local mobility anchor.</p>"
