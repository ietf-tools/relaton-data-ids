abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    option with sub-options. One sub-option is passed from the DHCP Server to the
    DHCP Client to announce the presence of one or more Mobile IP Mobility Agents.
    For each announced Mobility Agent, information is provided which is the same as
    that of the Mobile IP Agent Advertisement extension to ICMP Router Advertisements.
    There is also one sub-option which may be used by a DHCP client to provide identity
    information to the DHCP server.</p>"
