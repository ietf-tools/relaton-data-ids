abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses strategies for supporting 'DNS searching' -- finding
    of names in the DNS, or references that will ultimately point to DNS names, by
    a mechanism layered above the DNS itself that permits fuzzy matching, selection
    that uses attributes or facets, and use of descriptive terms. Demand for these
    facilities appear to be increasing with growth in the Internet (and especially
    the web) and with requirements to move beyond the restricted subset of ASCII names
    that have been the traditional contents of DNS 'Class=IN'. This document proposes
    a three-level system for access to DNS names in which the upper two levels involve
    search, rather than lookup (exactly known target), functions. It also discusses
    some of the issues and challenges in completing the design of, and deploying,
    such a system.</p>"
