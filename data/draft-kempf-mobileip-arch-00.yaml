abstract:
- content: "<p>A natural architectural split exists in Mobile IP between the mechanisms
    involved in global routing change and the mechanisms involved in local link routing
    change. The global mechanisms modify the mapping between a Mobile Node's routing
    identifier (care of address) and its global node identifier (home address). The
    local mechanisms allow the Mobile Node to obtain IP connectivity on the subnet
    and provide measures to locally mitigate routing failure while the global routing
    change is occurring. This draft makes a case for keeping the mechanisms involved
    in these two architectural components distinct and separate in Mobile IPv6, and
    suggests that the Mobile IP group might want to think about a separate working
    group specifically focused on local link routing changes for mobility in Mobile
    IPv6.</p>"
