abstract:
- content: "<p>RObust Header Compression (ROHC), RFC 3095, defines a framework for
    header compression, along with a number of compression protocols (profiles). This
    document seeks to add support for two issues to basic RoHC profiles, (a) the ability
    to handle reordering and (b) avoid extra header overhead when IP-ID is a constant
    value. The first issue can be supported by making the value of p (which is part
    of the RoHC interpretation interval) configurable. The second issue is already
    supported in the IP Profile of RoHC (RFC 3843). The discussion of this IP-ID issue
    in the current document merely replicates the discussion in RFC 3843 regarding
    constant IP-ID.</p>"
