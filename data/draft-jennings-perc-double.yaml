abstract:
- content: <p>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary
    to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing strong end-to-end
    security guarantees. This document defines SRTP procedures that use two separate
    but related cryptographic contexts to provide "hop-by-hop" and "end-to-end" security
    guarantees. Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic transforms can utilize
    an authenticated encryption with associated data scheme or take advantage of future
    SRTP transforms with different properties.</p>
