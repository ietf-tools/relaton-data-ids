- content: "<p>Much current literature discusses queuing delays, and the effects of
    different queue disciplines, active queue management algorithms, and congestion
    control measures on these delays. This draft highlights an important distinction
    between different types of delay, which may be helpful to practitioners and theoreticians
    alike.</p>"
