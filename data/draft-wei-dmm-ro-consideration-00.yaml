abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) is designed to be a distributed
    and scalable mobility management solution, and providing optimal route for traffics
    is one of DMM's aims. There have been several proposals on DMM framework, and
    this document provides discussion on how to optimize traffic routes, and aims
    to provide suggestioins on how to avoid long route in DMM network.</p>"
