abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a simple revision to Confederation that allows
    a BGP speaker in a Confederation to send a route advertisement (instead of a route
    withdraw) in certain cases. The route advertisement helps narrow the gap between
    Confederation and IBGP full-mesh in terms of routing information. It has been
    shown that the proposed mechanism helps achieve stable route selection and eliminate
    a number of persistent route oscillations involving Confederation.</p>"
