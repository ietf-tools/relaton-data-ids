abstract:
- content: "<p>A power saving scheme for switching of TCAM banks of fine granularity
    is discussed in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This scheme switches of TCAM banks of fine
    granularity and their corresponding SRAM banks depending on the occupancy of routes
    and their rewrites within the TCAM of a intelligent router line card (where one
    or more such TCAM entities along with their SRAM banks may reside) by using an
    algorithm specified in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This takes care of switching off TCAM
    and SRAM banks within a router's line card and correspondingly saves power when
    the traffic matrix is not large with respect to the routes the packets lookup
    where the occupancy of such routes is low in the line card. This is with reference
    to both single and multi-chassis devices. The algorithm specified therein tends
    to switch off banks which are not in use. The aim of this draft is to use the
    device level characteristic in the form of a TCAM Power Ratio and disseminate
    it as a metric within an area or an Autonomous system (where multiple such areas
    exist within an AS) to compute power saving paths through the set of routers where
    the TCAM-POWER-RATIO is low. The TCAM-POWER-RATIO is arrived at by dividing the
    number of bits in the TCAM banks that are switched off by the Total Available
    TCAM bank space in bits. This ratio is then subjected to the CSPF algorithm as
    an additional constraint or the only constraint as the case may be in a link state
    protocol like OSPF or IS-IS with Traffic Engineering Extensions with available
    utilization on the links also being a factor. This way those routers that have
    more TCAM banks switched off are avoided and those with higher power consumption
    but with available bandwidth are used hence not increasing the total power consumed
    within the area and hence within the AS. This could be achieved by using a PCE
    like entity that calculates the power shortest paths using this TCAM-POWER-RATIO.</p>"
