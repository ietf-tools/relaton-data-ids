abstract:
- content: "<p>A wide range of traffic engineering and troubleshooting tasks rely
    on reliable, timely, and detailed traffic measurements. We describe a passive
    packet measurement framework that is (a) general enough to serve as the basis
    for a wide range of operational tasks, and (b) relies on a small set of primitives
    that facilitate uniform deployment in router interfaces or dedicated measurement
    devices, even at very high speeds. This document describes the motivation for
    such a framework through several operational examples, defines the measurement
    primitives (filtering, sampling, and hashing), and illustrates their use.</p>"
