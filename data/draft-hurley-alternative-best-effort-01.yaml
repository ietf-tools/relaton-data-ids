abstract:
- content: "<p>Alternative Best-Effort (ABE) is a novel service for IP networks. It
    offers applications the choice between receiving a lower end-to-end delay and
    receiving more overall throughput. Every best effort packet is tagged as either
    green or blue. Green packets receive a low, bounded queueing delay. To ensure
    blue packets do not suffer as a result, green flows receive less throughput during
    bouts of congestion.</p>"
