abstract:
- content: "<p>The NEMO Basic support protocol [1] specifies the operation of a Mobile
    Router. The Mobile Router has a bi-directional tunnel to its Home Agent through
    which it reverse tunnels all traffic. When the Mobile Router roams and connects
    to an access network that only implements IPv4, it needs to use IPv6 transition
    tunneling mechanisms to reach its Home Agent. This will result in a NEMO tunnel
    inside a transition tunnel. This document describes protocol extensions to the
    NEMO Basic support protocol to maintain IPv6 connectivity for the Mobile Router
    via its Home Agent with IPv6-over-IPv4 encapsulation with no special boxes to
    be deployed anywhere in the network.</p>"
