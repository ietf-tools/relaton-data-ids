abstract:
- content: <p>IEEE 802.15.7, "Short-Range Optical Wireless Communications" defines
    wireless communication using visible light. It defines how data is transmitted,
    modulated, and organized in order to enable reliable and efficient communication
    in various environments. The standard is designed to work alongside other wireless
    communication systems and supports both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight
    (NLOS) communications. However, ambient light interference from natural sunlight
    or artificial lighting sources can impact signal reliability. To mitigate this,
    advanced modulation techniques, optical filtering, and adaptive power control
    can be employed. This document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over short-range
    optical wireless communications (OWC) using IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
    Area Network (6LoWPAN) techniques.</p>
