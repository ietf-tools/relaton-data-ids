abstract:
- content: "<p>Minion uses TCP-format packets on-the-wire, to provide full compatibility
    with existing NATs, Firewalls, and similar middleboxes, but provides a richer
    set of facilities to the application. Minion's richer facilities include a message-oriented
    API rather than TCP's unstructured byte-stream service model, multiplexing of
    multiple messages (or message streams) on a single connection, interleaving of
    multiplexed messages (to eliminate head-of-line blocking), message cancellation,
    request/reply support, ordered and unordered messages, chained messages, multiple
    priority levels with byte-granularity preemption, and DTLS Security. Minion can
    be implemented entirely as a user-level library, without waiting for any special
    support from OS vendors, and provides immediate benefits to application developers.
    Additionally, Minion is able to take advantage of some simple kernel extensions
    to provide enhanced services that go beyond what is possible with traditional
    TCP. These kernel extensions are optional, and even without them, Minion offers
    worthwhile benefits to application developers.</p>"
