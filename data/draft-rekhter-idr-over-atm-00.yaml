abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider an ATM network and a set of IP routers connected to it. The
    set of routers is under control of different organizations, so that some of the
    routers participate in intra-domain routing protocol(s) of each organization,
    and some routers exchange routing information across organizational boundaries
    (by participating in inter-domain routing). We refer to to latter as 'exterior'
    routers. Moreover, we assume that the inter-domain routing protocols supported
    by these routers are either BGP-4 [BGP-4] or IDRP (for IP or IPv6) [IDRP].</p>"
