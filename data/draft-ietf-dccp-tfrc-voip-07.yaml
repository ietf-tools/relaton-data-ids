abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for further experimentation, but
    not for widespread deployment at this time in the global Internet. TCP-Friendly
    Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating
    in a best-effort Internet environment (RFC 3448). TFRC was intended for applications
    that use a fixed packet size, and was designed to be reasonably fair when competing
    for bandwidth with TCP connections using the same packet size. This document proposes
    TFRC-SP, a Small-Packet (SP) variant of TFRC, that is designed for applications
    that send small packets. The design goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve the same bandwidth
    in bps (bits per second) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes. TFRC-SP
    enforces a minimum interval of 10 ms between data packets to prevent a single
    flow from sending small packets arbitrarily frequently. Flows using TFRC-SP compete
    reasonably fairly with large-packet TCP and TFRC flows in environments where large-packet
    flows and small-packet flows experience similar packet drop rates. However, in
    environments where small-packet flows experience lower packet drop rates than
    large-packet flows (e.g., with Drop-Tail queues in units of bytes), TFRC-SP can
    receive considerably more than its share of the bandwidth. This memo defines an
    Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
