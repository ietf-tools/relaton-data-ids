abstract:
- content: <p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a widely used data interchange
    format, suitable for storing configuration data due to its simple syntax, machine-readable
    structure, and ease of parsing and generation. This document describes informational
    practices associated with JSON- Based Dynamic Configuration Management. It outlines
    a recommended naming convention for configuration files in the form of a structured
    filename pattern, such as "&lt;project&gt;@&lt;version&gt;.json", and specifies
    a configuration schema to support validation, traceability, and non- disruptive
    updates. The document also describes the rationale for standardization and presents
    real-world scenarios where these practices apply.</p>
