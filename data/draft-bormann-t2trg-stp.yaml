abstract:
- content: "<p>Many applications make use of Series of data items, i.e., an array
    of data items where new items can be added over time. Where such Series are to
    be made available using REST protocols such as CoAP or HTTP, the Series has to
    be mapped into a structure of one or more resources and a protocol for a client
    to obtain the Series and to learn about new items. Various protocols have been
    standardized that make Series-shaped data available, with rather different properties
    and objectives. The present document is an attempt to extract a common underlying
    pattern and to define media types and an access scheme that can be used right
    away for further protocols that provide Series-shaped data.</p>"
