abstract:
- content: "<p>The SPIRITS protocol defines the mechanisms and the semantics to subscribe
    to and convey certain PSTN events to interested Internet hosts for service execution
    [1]. This Internet-Draft describes our initial implementation of a SPIRITS framework
    based on the architecture and requirements outlined in [2] and [3], respectively.
    We have implemented two services based on such an architecture: a SPIRITS-based
    presence service which provides a coarse-grained presence status for a user represented
    by a device (phone), and a SPIRITS-based Instant Messaging (IM) service whereby
    the PSTN sends a SIP IM to a SPIRITS User Agent (UA). These services, the attendant
    architecture and the relevant call flows are described next. It is expected that
    the reader is conversant in the SPIRITS and SIP terminology. For those who are
    not, [5,6] provide a good reference for SIP and its event-based mechanism, and
    [1,2,3] provide a good reference for SPIRITS. It is important to point out that
    the SPIRITS protocol [1] is not a standard yet, it is still an Internet-Draft.
    Thus, what is described in this draft is an early implementation designed to validate
    the suitability of the protocol as well as provide some implementation experience
    that will be leveraged in further refining the protocol.</p>"
