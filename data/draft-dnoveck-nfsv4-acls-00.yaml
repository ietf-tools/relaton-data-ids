abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role
    in the NFSv4 security architecture. While their role in providing a more flexible
    approach to file access authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived
    authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of other security-related
    functionality is covered as well. While the goals of the description are similar
    to that used in previous specficaion, the approach taken is substantally different,
    in that a core set of functionality, derived form the the now- withdrawn POSIX
    draft ACLs is the conceptual base of the feature set while extensions to that
    functionality are made available as OPTIONAL extensions to that core. The current
    version of the document is intended, in large part, to result in working group
    discussion regarding existing NFSv4 security issues and to provide a framework
    for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary
    changes. When the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it will
    supersede the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics appearing in existing
    minor version specification documents such as RFCs 7530 and 8881, thereby updating
    RFC7530 and RFC8881.</p>"
