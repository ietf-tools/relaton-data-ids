abstract:
- content: <p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate
    routers to maintain any multicast related per- flow state. BIER also does not
    require any explicit tree-building protocol for its operation. A multicast data
    packet enters a BIER domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves
    the BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs). The BFIR
    router adds a BIER header to the packet. The BIER header contains a bitstring
    in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet to. The set
    of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be forwarded is expressed by setting
    the bits that correspond to those routers in the BIER header. This document specifies
    extensions to the BGP Link-state address- family in order to advertising BIER
    information.</p>
