abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides gap analysis for problem statement and use cases
    for Computing-Aware Traffic Steering(CATS) that are outlined in[I-D.ietf-cats-usecases-requirements].
    It identifies the key engineering investigation areas that require potential architecture
    improvements and protocol enhancements so as to reach the optimal balance between
    compute services, via the proper choice of servers, and network paths, with the
    holistic consideration of metrics that are comprised of network status, coupled
    with the compute capabilities and resources.</p>"
