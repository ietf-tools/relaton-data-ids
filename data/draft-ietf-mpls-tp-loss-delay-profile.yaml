abstract:
- content: "<p>Procedures and protocol mechanisms to enable efficient and accurate
    measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks are defined
    in RFC 6374. The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is the set of MPLS protocol
    functions applicable to the construction and operation of packet- switched transport
    networks. This document describes a profile of the general MPLS loss, delay, and
    throughput measurement techniques that suffices to meet the specific requirements
    of MPLS-TP. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization
    Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS
    and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
