abstract:
- content: "<p>According to RFC 6120, XMPP clients should use SRV records within the
    connection establishment process to servers. There are two purposes for using
    SRV records. The one is to advertise the FQDN of at least one server to clients
    to establish an initial TCP connection. The other purpose is to advertise at least
    two or more FQDN with priority and weight information to clients to accomplish
    load balancing, a redundant server environment and so on. However, most standard
    resolver libraries of recent client OSs don't support SRV record resolution. Furthermore,
    many DNS hosting services also don't support SRV records. This document proposes
    a solution that enables a server and client to achieve load balancing and a redundant
    server environment in case SRV records cannot be used. Moreover, the proposed
    IQ-result message can include minimum wait time to reconnect, allowing clients
    to reconnect after the most suitable wait time avoiding congestion.</p>"
