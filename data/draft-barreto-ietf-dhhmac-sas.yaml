abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a new transport mode to the Multimedia Internet
    KEYing (MIKE) protocol, the MIKEY-DHHMAC-SAS. The MIKEY has as its objective the
    negotiation of cryptography parameters necessaries to the establishment of a secure
    (SRTP/SRTCP) end-to-end multimedia channel, but all its operation modes have some
    kind of limitation that prevents it of being used to this purpose. The MIKEY-DHHMAC-SAS
    solves theses existing limitations in MIKEY-DH and MIKEY-DHHMAC modes by adding
    the features of key continuity and Short Authentication String (SAS), making possible
    its use in any end-to- end multimedia scenario.</p>"
