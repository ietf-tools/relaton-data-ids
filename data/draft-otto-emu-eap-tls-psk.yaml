abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    is a network access authentication framework which provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. One proposal is EAP-TLS, which relies on the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol and allows for certificate-based authentication.
    This document specifies EAP-TLS- PSK, which also relies on TLS, but allows for
    shared secret-based authentication. EAP-TLS-PSK supports the pre-shared key ciphersuites
    specified in RFC 4279. specified in RFC 4279.</p>"
