abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol described in this document is designed to allow one LDAP
    server to replicate its directory content to another LDAP server. The protocol
    is designed to be used in a replication configuration where multiple updateable
    servers are present. Provisions are made in the protocol to carry information
    that allows the server receiving updates to apply a total ordering to all updates
    in the replicated system. This total ordering allows all replicas to correctly
    resolve conflicts that arise when LDAP clients submit changes to different servers
    that later replicate to one another. All protocol elements described here are
    LDAPv3 extended operations and controls. LDAPv3 is described in RFC 2251 [LDAPv3].
    Some LDAPv3 extended operations and controls described here are LDAPv3 extended
    operations used to group related operations. The protocol elements used for grouping
    are described in LDAPv3: Grouping of Related Operations [GROUPING]. Certain terms
    used in this document are defined in the document 'LDAP Replication Architecture'
    [ARCHITECTURE].</p>"
