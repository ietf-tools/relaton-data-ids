abstract:
- content: "<p>Presence and Instant Messaging have recently emerged as a new medium
    of communications over the Internet. Presence is a means for finding, retrieving,
    and subscribing to changes in the presence information (e.g. 'online' or 'offline')
    of other users. Instant Messaging is a means for sending small, simple messages
    that are delivered immediately to online users. A goal of the Instant Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (IMPP) Working Group is to produce an Internet Standard
    for Presence and Instant Messaging.</p>"
