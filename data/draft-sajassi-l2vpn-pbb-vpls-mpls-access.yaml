abstract:
- content: "<p>Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) functionality, under standardization
    in IEEE 802.1ah, can be employed to enhance the scalability of H- VPLS with MPLS
    access. This document describes how PBB technology can be used in H-VPLS with
    MPLS access networks to improve the scalability of customer MAC addresses and
    number of service instances that can be supported. The document also describes
    the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which PBB functionality can be incorporated
    into H-VPLS with existing MPLS access.</p>"
