abstract:
- content: <p>Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS
    and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation. [RFC7344] automates this
    for DS records by having the child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold
    the prospective DS parameters. Similarly, CSYNC records indicate a desired update
    of the delegation's NS records [RFC7477]. Parent-side entities (e.g. Registries,
    Registrars) typically discover these records by periodically querying them from
    the child ("polling"), before using them to update the delegation's parameters.
    This document specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities MUST ensure
    that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC records are consistent across
    the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on these
    records.</p>
