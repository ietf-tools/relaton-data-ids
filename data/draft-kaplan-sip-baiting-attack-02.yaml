abstract:
- content: <p>This document identifies a potential SPIT and Phishing attack, which
    subverts the RFC 4474 SIP Identity and RFC 4916 Connected Identity mechanisms
    in a particular way. The attack is termed "Baiting", as it uses a RFC4474-signed
    call as the bait for malicious use.</p>
