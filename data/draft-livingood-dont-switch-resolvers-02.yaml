abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is beginning widespread deployment.
    However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable
    as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.
    As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur. When these failures do
    occur, end users SHOULD NOT change to a non-validating DNS resolver.</p>"
