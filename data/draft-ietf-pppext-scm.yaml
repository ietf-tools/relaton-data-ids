abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. This document
    introduces a new PPP feature called Semi Connected Mode. When both sides of a
    point-to-point link agree to use Semi Con- nected Mode, either side can transparently
    disconnect and re- establish a circuit-switched connection without having to reconfigure
    the point-to-point link each time.</p>"
