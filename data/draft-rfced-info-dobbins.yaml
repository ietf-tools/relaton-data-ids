abstract:
- content: "<p>The Address Resolution and Location Discovery (ARLD) protocol is part
    of the InterSwitch Message Protocol (ISMP). ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch
    communication within distributed connection-oriented switching networks. The ARLD
    protocol is used to resolve a packet destination address when the source and destination
    pair of a packet does not match a known connection. It is also used to provide
    end-station address mobility between switches.</p>"
