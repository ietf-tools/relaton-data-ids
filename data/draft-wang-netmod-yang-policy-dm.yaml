abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a YANG data model for network policies using
    Language Abstractions defined in RFC6095. The model intends to be applied to deliver
    various different network services by controlling the policies that enable features
    such as QoS, Security, etc. In future, the core data model could be augmented
    by additional YANG data modules modeling and configuring policy-related protocols
    and functions. The policy data model described in this document provides common
    building blocks for such extensions. Earlier revisions of this document were written
    to trigger discussion with operator community at IETF-92 in Dallas. This document
    has been updated to reflect the limited conclusions of those discussions and record
    them for archival purposes. There is no intent to advance this document any further
    toward publication.</p>"
