abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some issues related to performing encryption
    at layer-3. In particular, routing protocol problems may result if the time-to-live
    (TTL) field in IPv4 or the Hop Limit field in IPv6 is decremented once before
    encapsulation [1][2]. Also, special provisions may be necessary within the encryptor
    devices if broadcast messages are to transition the encryptor pairs. Maximum Transmission
    Unit (MTU) issues are also presented.</p>"
