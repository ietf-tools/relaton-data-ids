abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the FTP service whereby an FTP
    client may indicate an authentication mechanism to the server, perform an authentication
    protocol exchange, and optionally negotiate a protection mechanism for subsequent
    protocol interactions. This extension is a counterproposal to the extensions documented
    in the work-in-progress draft-ietf-cat-ftpsec-NN.txt and is offered to the IETF
    CAT working group for consideration as a replacement for that work-in-progress.
    The authentication and protection mechanisms used by this extension are those
    used by the IMAP4 protocol.</p>"
