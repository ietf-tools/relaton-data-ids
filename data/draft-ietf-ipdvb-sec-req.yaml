abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPEG-2 standard defined by ISO 13818-1 supports a range of transmission
    methods for a variety of services. This document provides a threat analysis and
    derives the security requirements when using the Transport Stream, TS, to support
    an Internet network-layer using Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE)
    defined in RFC 4326. The document also provides the motivation for link-layer
    security for a ULE Stream. A ULE Stream may be used to send IPv4 packets, IPv6
    packets, and other Protocol Data Units (PDUs) to an arbitrarily large number of
    Receivers supporting unicast and/or multicast transmission. The analysis also
    describes applicability to the Generic Stream Encapsulation (GSE) defined by the
    Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) Project. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
