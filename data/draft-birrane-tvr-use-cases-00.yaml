abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to the calculation of a path or subpath
    through a network where the time of message transmission (or receipt) is part
    of the overall route computation. This means that, all things being equal, a TVR
    computation might produce different results depending on the time that the computation
    is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other
    cost functions associated with the route. This document introduces use cases where
    TVR computations could improve message exchange in a network.</p>"
