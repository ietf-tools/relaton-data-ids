abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes base requirements for protecting control channels(CCs)
    for GMPLS. It provides guidelines needed in order to switchover an active CC to
    one of standby CCs when a failure occurs about the active CC. It defines terminology,
    base concepts, necessities, and considerations that should be noted primarily
    in order to complete the mechanism of CC protection. This document describes requirements
    for providing resilience capabilities of control plane in GMPLS whose control
    channel can be separated from the data channel. This contribution, as a document
    that proposes the necessity about resilience of control plane like that of transport
    plane, handles related terminologies, base concepts, possible configurations,
    necessities and requirements, additional considerations including the relationship
    with other protocol such as LMP.</p>"
