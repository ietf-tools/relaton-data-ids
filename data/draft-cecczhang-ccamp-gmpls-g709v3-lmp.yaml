abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent progress of the Optical Transport Network (OTN) has introduced
    new signal types (i.e., ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e and ODUflex) and new Tributary Slot
    granularity (1.25Gbps). Since equipments deployed prior to recently defined ITU-T
    recommendations only support 2.5 Gbps Tributary Slot granularity and ODU1, ODU2
    and ODU3 containers, the compatibility problem should be considered. In addition,
    a Higher Order ODU (HO ODU) link may not support all the types of Lower Order
    ODU (LO ODU) signals defined by the new OTN standard because of the limitation
    of the devices at the two ends of a link. In these cases, the control plane is
    required to run the capability discovering functions for the evolutive OTN. This
    document describes the extensions to the Link Management Protocol (LMP) needed
    to discover the capability of HO ODU link, including the granularity of Tributary
    Slot to be used and the LO ODU signal types that the link can support. Moreover,
    extensions of LMP test messages detailing the OTN technology specific information
    in order to cover also G.709v3 signal types and containers are also provided.</p>"
