abstract:
- content: "<p>To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
    (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution.
    Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the fact, but must not impact an operational
    production network. These metrics are defined in the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic
    Metrics Destination Option (PDM). The base metrics are: packet sequence number
    and packet timestamp. Other metrics may be derived from these for use in diagnostics.
    This document specifies such metrics, their calculation, and usage.</p>"
