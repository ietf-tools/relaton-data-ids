abstract:
- content: "<p>The MEGACO/H.GCP draft protocol has several structures that are not
    com- pletely defined, viz, how properties are described and grouped, the tem-
    plate concept, the package concept, etc. There is also an extended debate on the
    encoding of the protocol, and particularly, the encoding of the command parameters.
    This contribution proposes a unified approach to all of these issues. This Internet
    Draft was rushed to meet the Oslo deadline. As such, it was not thoroughly reviewed,
    especially to see that this ID conformed to its referenced fundamental ideas on
    capabilities.</p>"
