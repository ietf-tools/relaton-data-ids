abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 8919 and RFC 8920 define Application Specific Link Attributes (ASLA).
    Each ASLA includes an Application Identifier Bit Mask. The Application Identifier
    Bit Mask includes a Standard Application Bit Mask (SABM) and a User Defined Application
    Bit Mask (UDABM). The SABM and UDABM determine which applications can use the
    ASLA as an input. This document introduces a new bit to the Standard Application
    Identifier Bit Mask. This bit is called the Any Application Bit (i.e., the A-bit).
    If the A-bit is set, the link attribute can be used by any application. This includes
    currently defined applications as well as applications to be defined in the future.</p>"
