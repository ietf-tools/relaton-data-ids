abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an efficient way to ensure erasure- resilient
    transmission of progressively encoded multimedia sources via RTP using Reed-Solomon
    (RS) codes together with interleaving. The level of erasure protection can be
    explicitly adapted to the importance of the respective parts in the source stream,
    thus allowing a graceful degradation of application quality with increasing packet
    loss rate on the network. Hence, this type of unequal erasure protection (UXP)
    schemes is intended to cope with the rapidly varying channel conditions on wireless
    access links to the Internet backbone. Furthermore, protection of non-progressive
    multimedia streams is ensured, since equal erasure protection (EXP) represents
    a subset of generic UXP. By applying interleaving and RS codes a payload format
    is defined, which can be easily integrated into the existing framework for RTP.</p>"
