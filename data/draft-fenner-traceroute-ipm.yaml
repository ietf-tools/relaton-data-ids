abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the IGMP multicast traceroute facility. Unlike
    unicast traceroute, multicast traceroute requires a special packet type and implementation
    on the part of routers. This speci- fication describes the required functionality
    in multicast routers, as well as how management applications can use the new router
    func- tionality.</p>"
