abstract:
- content: "<p>Since IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are represented by different resource
    records in the DNS, operating systems capable of running both IPv4 and IPv6 need
    to make two queries when resolving a host name. This document discusses conditions,
    under which the stub resolver can optimize the process by not sending one of the
    queries if the host is connected to a single-stack network.</p>"
