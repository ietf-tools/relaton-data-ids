abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual private networks are becoming a common offering of many service
    providers. There are many technologies with which to implement a VPN service,
    ranging from MPLS to GRE to IPSEC. A common requirement of all VPN technologies
    is the need to discover all of the sites, or at least all the provider equipment
    associated with the sites, that are in a particular VPN. DNS provides a simple
    and commonly available mechanism for site discovery that is independent of any
    signaling or tunneling protocol. This draft proposes the use of DNS as a discovery
    mechanism for VPN maintenance and control.</p>"
