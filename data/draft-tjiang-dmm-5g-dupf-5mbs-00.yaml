abstract:
- content: "<p>The companion draft [I-D.zzhang-dmm-5g-distributed-upf] has described
    the 5G mobile user plane (MUP) via the refinement of distributed UPFs, along with
    various user plane implementations that some vendors and operators are exploring,
    with the requirement of not introducing changes to 3GPP architecture &amp; signaling.
    The document 3GPP TS 23.247 [_3GPP-23.247] for 5G multicast and broadcast services,
    or 5MBS, specifies the 5GS architecture to support MBS communication. Thanks to
    the addition of new 5GS network functions (NFs) and MB- interfaces on 5G CP &amp;
    UP, this might post additional provisioning &amp; implementation challenges to
    the underlay transport infrastructure. This document is not an attempt to do 3GPP
    SDO work in IETF. Instead, it discusses how to potentially integrate distributed
    UPFs with the delivery of 5MBS communication, as well as the benefits of using
    distributed UPFs to handle 5MBS traffic delivery.</p>"
