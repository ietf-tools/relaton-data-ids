abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, most route computing algorithms only compute a shortest
    or an optimal path.The results of this computation just refer to link level, without
    consideration of fibers. But, in real networks, the link between two adjacent
    nodes always has multi-fibers. This condition above happens more frequently especially
    for the gateway nodes in the multi-domain network. Moreover, the number of links
    between two adjacent domains is always more than one. From the view of parent
    PCE, the two conditions above will be regarded as the problem of multi-fibers
    between adjacent nodes. However, most route computing algorithms always can not
    solve the problem of multi-fiber between adjacent nodes. As a result, parent PCE
    can not compute the route sequence with specific fibers. It brings distress and
    problems when parent PCE computing the loose route sequence. In order to solve
    the problems existing in real networks, an efficient solution will be proposed
    for parent PCE facing the multi- fiber between adjacent nodes. Some interface
    and structure will be expanded in this proposal.</p>"
