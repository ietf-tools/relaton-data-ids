abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses client implementation issues relating to RFC
    9537, “Redacted Fields in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Response”.
    The considerations in this document have arisen from problems raised by two separate
    teams attempting to implement RFC 9537 in both an RDAP web client and an RDAP
    command line client. Some of these problems may be insurmountable, leaving portions
    of RFC 9537 non-interoperable between clients and servers, while other problems
    place a high degree of complexity upon clients.</p>"
