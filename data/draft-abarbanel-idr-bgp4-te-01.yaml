abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, constraint routing (CR) and traffic engineering (TE) models
    do not take into consideration the big picture view of IP traffic traversing multiple
    autonomous systems (AS). Most of the traffic and constraint routing is based on
    IGP protocols such as OSPF/ISIS, etc. The resulting view of the Internet is limited
    to one autonomous system and areas or systems within it. Hence, the routing/forwarding
    functions do not select the optimum path for packets that need to traverse several
    autonomous systems. The proposal in this draft is that the BGP protocol can be
    utilized to choose the best BGP routes based on traffic engineered (TE) constraint
    weights. This information can be propagated between all BGP peers and calculated
    by the BGP AS border routers before it is deployed to their forwarding tables.</p>"
