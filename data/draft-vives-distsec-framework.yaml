abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the years, it has been noticed that network firewalls are an inadequeate
    mechanism in most cases for protecting the hosts, especially from internal attacks.
    This document analyzes two security paradigms, the network-based and the host-based
    (distributed), and in consequence outlines a problem statement and framework for
    distributed security.</p>"
