abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo contains tables of commonly occurring header fields in headings
    of e-mail messages. The document compiles information from other RFCs such as
    RFC 822, RFC 1036, RFC 1123, RFC 2156, RFC 1496, RFC 1766, RFC 2183, RFC 1864,
    RFC 2421 and RFC 2045. A few commonly occurring header fields which are not defined
    in RFCs are also included. For each header field, the memo gives a short description
    and a reference to the RFC in which the header field is defined. The latest, revised
    version of this document can be found at URL http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/ietf/mail-headers/.
    The version at that URL may be more recent than the version published as an RFC.
    Another list of headers can be found at URL http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/headers.html
