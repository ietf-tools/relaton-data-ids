abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes extensions to the DNS protocols to provide for an
    incremental zone transfer (IXFR) procedure. A companion mechanism, the NOTIFY
    procedure, is also proposed to allow secondaries to learn of changes to the primary
    database in a timely manner. A new DNS Opcode (NEWQUERY) is proposed that will
    provide the necessary upgrades to the DNS packet structure to provide for both
    these mechanisms. Further, it allows for easy upgradability, in the future. Two
    new RR types (CARRIER and ISOA) are proposed. This memo provides only a first
    cut at an attempt to document the ideas about these protocols and we invite extensive
    comments, maybe to revamp the entire stream of thought.</p>"
