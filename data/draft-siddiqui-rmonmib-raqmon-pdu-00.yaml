abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a common protocol data unit (PDU) used between RAQMON
    Data Source (RDS) and RAQMON Report Collector (RRC) to report a QOS statistics
    using RTCP and SNMP as Transport Protocol. The original RAQMON draft [SIDDIQUI3]
    was split into 3 parts to identify the RAQMON Framework, RAQMON QOS PDU and RAQMON
    MIB. This memo defined RAQMON QOS Protocol Data Unit (PDU). This memo also outlines
    mechanisms to use Real Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) and Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP) to transport these PDUs between RAQMON Data Source
    (RDS) and RAQMON Report Collector (RRC) as outlined in RAQMON Charter of the RMON
    Workgroup. The memo [SIDDIQUI2] defines a Real-Time Application QOS Monitoring
    (RAQMON) Framework that extends the RMON Framework to allow Real-time Application
    QoS information as outlined by RAQMON Charter of the RMON Workgroup. The memo
    [SIDDIQUI1] defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use
    with network management protocols in the Internet community. The document proposes
    an extension to the Remote Monitoring MIB [RFC2819] to accommodate RAQMON solution.
    Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
