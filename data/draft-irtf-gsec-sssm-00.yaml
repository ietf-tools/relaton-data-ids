abstract:
- content: "<p>The SSM model is appeared in order to overcome the problems of deployment
    of IP multicast. However, a real commercial deployment of SSM have to offer some
    security services. Our work proposes an architecture, called S-SSM, for securing
    the SSM model. S-SSM defines two mechanisms for access control and content protection.
    The first one is carried out through subscriber authentication and access permission.
    As for the second, it is realized through the management of a unique key, called
    the channel key, k_ch, shared among the sender and subscribers.</p>"
