abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the behavior of the Ethernet emulation on top
    of IEEE 802.16 to efficiently support the transmission of IPv4 as well as IPv6
    packets over IEEE 802.16 radio links. Due to resource constraints of radio transmission
    systems and the limitations of the IEEE 802.16 MAC layer for the emulation of
    Ethernet, the transmission of IP over an emulated LAN on top of IEEE 802.16 may
    considerably benefit by adding IP specific support functions within the Ethernet
    emulation on top of IEEE 802.16.</p>"
