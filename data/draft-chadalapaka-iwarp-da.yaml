abstract:
- content: "<p>iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of application
    protocols onto TCP/IP. The Datamover Architecture for iSCSI (DA) defines an abstract
    model in which the movement of data between iSCSI end nodes is logically separated
    from the rest of the iSCSI protocol in order to allow iSCSI to adapt to innovations
    available in new IP transports. The new Datamover protocol provides a reliable
    transport for all iSCSI PDUs, but actually moves the data required for certain
    iSCSI PDUs without involving the remote iSCSI layer itself. This document begins
    with an introduction of a few new abstractions, defines a layered architecture
    for iSCSI and Datamover protocols, and then models the interactions within an
    iSCSI end node between the iSCSI layer and the Datamover layer that happen in
    order to transparently perform remote data movement within an IP fabric. It is
    intended that this definition would help map iSCSI to generic RDMA-capable IP
    fabrics in the future comprising TCP, SCTP, and possibly other underlying network
    transport layers.</p>"
