abstract:
- content: "<p>Security systems are built on strong cryptographic algorithms that
    foil pattern analysis attempts. However, the security of these systems is dependent
    on generating secret quantities for passwords, cryptographic keys, and similar
    quantities. The use of pseudo-random processes to generate secret quantities can
    result in pseudo-security. A sophisticated attacker may find it easier to reproduce
    the environment that produced the secret quantities and to search the resulting
    small set of possibilities than to locate the quantities in the whole of the potential
    number space. Choosing random quantities to foil a resourceful and motivated adversary
    is surprisingly difficult. This document points out many pitfalls in using poor
    entropy sources or traditional pseudo-random number generation techniques for
    generating such quantities. It recommends the use of truly random hardware techniques
    and shows that the existing hardware on many systems can be used for this purpose.
    It provides suggestions to ameliorate the problem when a hardware solution is
    not available, and it gives examples of how large such quantities need to be for
    some applications. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
