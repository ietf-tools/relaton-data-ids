abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a common transport choice
    for interactive multimedia communication applications. The performance of these
    applications typically depends on a well-functioning congestion control algorithm.
    To ensure a seamless and robust user experience, a well-designed RTP-based congestion
    control algorithm should work well across all access network types. This document
    describes test cases for evaluating performances of candidate congestion control
    algorithms over cellular and Wi-Fi networks.</p>"
