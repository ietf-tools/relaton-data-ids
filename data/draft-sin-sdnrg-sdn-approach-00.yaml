abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz words
    of the networking industry for the past couple of years. And yet, no clear definition
    of what SDN actually covers has been broadly admitted so far. This document aims
    at contributing to the clarification of the SDN landscape. It is not meant to
    endlessly discuss what SDN truly means, but rather to suggest a functional taxonomy
    of the techniques that can be used under a SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the
    various pending issues the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises.
    As such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of clarification.</p>"
