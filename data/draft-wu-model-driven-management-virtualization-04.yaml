abstract:
- content: "<p>Model-driven service and network management provides a programmatic
    and standard-based approach for representing (virtual) services or networks and
    configuration to the network device that are used to build and deliver the service.
    Models can be used at various phases of service and network management life cycle
    such as service instantiation, service provisionning, optimization, monitoring,
    and diagnostic. Also, models can be designed to automate network management and
    provide closed-loop control for the sake of adaptive and deterministic service
    creation, delivery, and maintenance. This document provides a framework that describes
    and discusses an architecture for service and network management automation with
    YANG modeling technologies. An applicability of YANG data models to automation
    of virtualized network service is also investigated. The document aims to exemplify
    an approach to illustrate the journey from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific
    actions.</p>"
