abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the use of the DES-MAC algorithm [Kaufman95] as
    an authentication mechanism within the revised IPSEC Encapsulating Security Payload
    [ESP] and the revised IPSEC Authentication Header [AH]. DES-MAC[Kaufman95] is
    based on the DES encryption algorithm [FIPS-46, FIPS-46-1, FIPS-74, FIPS-81].
    Further information on the other components necessary for ESP and AH implementations
    is provided by [Thayer97a].</p>"
