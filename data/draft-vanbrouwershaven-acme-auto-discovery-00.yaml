abstract:
- content: '<p>A significant impediment to the widespread adoption of the Automated
    Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] is that ACME clients need
    to be pre-configured with the URL of the ACME server to be used. This often leaves
    domain owners at the mercy of their hosting provider as to which Certification
    Authorities (CAs) can be used. This specification provides a mechanism to bootstrap
    ACME client configuration from a domain''s DNS CAA Resource Record [RFC8659],
    thus giving control of which CA(s) to use back to the domain owner. Specifically,
    this document specifies two new extensions to the DNS CAA Resource Record: the
    "discovery" and "priority" parameters. Additionally, it registers the URI "/.well-known/acme"
    at which all compliant ACME servers will host their ACME directory object. By
    retrieving instructions for the ACME client from the authorized CA(s), this mechanism
    allows for the domain owner to configure multiple CAs in either load-balanced
    or fallback prioritizations which improves user preferences and increases diversity
    in certificate issuers.</p>'
