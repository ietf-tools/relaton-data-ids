abstract:
- content: '<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping industries and daily
    life, driven by advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude,
    Grok, and DeepSeek. These models have demonstrated the transformative potential
    of AI across diverse applications, from productivity tools to complex decision-making
    systems. However, the effectiveness and reliability of AI hinge on two foundational
    processes: training and inference. Each presents unique challenges related to
    data management, computation, connectivity, privacy, trust, security, and governance.
    This document introduces the Data Aware-Inference and Training Network (DA-ITN)—a
    unified, intelligent, multi-plane network architecture designed to address the
    full spectrum of AI system requirements. DA- ITN provides a scalable and adaptive
    infrastructure that connects AI clients, data providers, service facilitators,
    and computational resources to support end-to-end AI lifecycle operations. The
    architecture features dedicated control, data, and operations &amp; management
    (OAM) planes to orchestrate training and inference while ensuring reliability,
    transparency, and accountability. By outlining the key requirements of AI systems
    and demonstrating how DA-ITN fulfills them, this document presents a vision for
    the future of AI- native networking—an "AI internet"—optimized for continuous
    learning, scalable deployment, and seamless agent-to-agent collaboration.</p>'
