abstract:
- content: "<p>The physical location of a network device plays a crucial role in various
    applications, particularly in emergency calling, where precise caller location
    information is essential for prompt and effective emergency response. RFC 4676
    has standardized DHCP options for delivering the Civic Location of the client,
    while RFC 6225 has defined DHCP options for delivering the Geospatial coordinates
    of the client. However, these corresponding options are missing in IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery protocols. This proposal aims to address this gap by introducing the
    necessary options for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to provide accurate location information.</p>"
