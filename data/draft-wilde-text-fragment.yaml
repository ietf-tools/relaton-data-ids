- content: "<p>This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/plain MIME entities.
    These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to parts of a text/plain
    MIME entity, either identified by character position or range, or by line position
    or range. Fragment identifiers may also contain information for integrity checks
    to make them more robust. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
