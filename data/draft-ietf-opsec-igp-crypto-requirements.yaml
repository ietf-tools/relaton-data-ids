abstract:
- content: "<p>The routing protocols Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2),
    Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS), and Routing Information Protocol
    (RIP) currently define cleartext and MD5 (Message Digest 5) methods for authenticating
    protocol packets. Recently, effort has been made to add support for the SHA (Secure
    Hash Algorithm) family of hash functions for the purpose of authenticating routing
    protocol packets for RIP, IS-IS, and OSPF. To encourage interoperability between
    disparate implementations, it is imperative that we specify the expected minimal
    set of algorithms, thereby ensuring that there is at least one algorithm that
    all implementations will have in common. Similarly, RIP for IPv6 (RIPng) and OSPFv3
    support IPsec algorithms for authenticating their protocol packets. This document
    examines the current set of available algorithms, with interoperability and effective
    cryptographic authentication protection being the principal considerations. Cryptographic
    authentication of these routing protocols requires the availability of the same
    algorithms in disparate implementations. It is desirable that newly specified
    algorithms should be implemented and available in routing protocol implementations
    because they may be promoted to requirements at some future time. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
