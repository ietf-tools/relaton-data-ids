abstract:
- content: "<p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple interface for running
    external programs, software or gateways under an information server in a platform-independent
    manner. Currently, the supported information servers are HTTP servers. The interface
    has been in use by the World-Wide Web since 1993. This specification defines the
    interface known as 'CGI/1.2', which is an extension of the 'CGI/1.1' interface
    developed and documented at the U.S. National Centre for Supercomputing Applications
    [NCSA-CGI]. This document also defines the use of the CGI/1.2 interface on the
    Unix(R) and AmigaDOS(tm) systems.</p>"
