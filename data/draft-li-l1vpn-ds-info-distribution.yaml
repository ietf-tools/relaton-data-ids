abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Directory Server based VPN membership information
    distribution mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The mechanism enables PEs to discover
    which other PEs have ports attached to CEs that are members of the same VPN, and
    allows PEs to discover attributes of currently configured CE-PE links and their
    associations with layer-1 VPNs. This document builds on the Layer One VPN Framework
    and provides an auto-discovery mechanism as discussed in the Layer One VPN Basic
    Mode document. This mechanism may be applied to the layer-1 VPN basic mode.</p>"
