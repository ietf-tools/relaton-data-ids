abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Multicast Synchronization Protocol (MSP) designed
    to avoid traditional problems related to the use of unicast (pt-to-pt) synchronization
    protocols (such as those encountered with OSPF, P-NNI, SCSP, epidemic protocols,...).
    These protocols imply the establishment and maintenance of a topology of servers
    (tree, star, line, mesh,...). It is not obvious to find neither the best topology
    for a given synchronization protocol nor the best algorithm which allows to create
    this topology. An attempt to study the influence of the spatial distribution (topology)
    has been made, for instance, in Epidemic algorithms by Xerox Parc, which showed
    interesting results. Moreover, traditional synchronization protocols notably imply
    a convergence time and traffic which is proportional to the size of the topology.
    We believe that reducing the topology to a set of members of a single multicast
    group could reduce both convergence time and traffic. Note that in that case,
    no configuration algorithm is required.</p>"
