abstract:
- content: "<p>This I-D presents all known attack vectors into or using BGP. The data
    is presented in 'Attack Tree' format as published by Schneier [1] and detailed
    by the CERT in 'Attack Modeling for Information Security and Survivability' [2].
    Future security improvements to BGP (whether best practices or enhancements to
    the protocol) should consider the attacks outlined here when determining the relative
    security improvements such changes provide.</p>"
