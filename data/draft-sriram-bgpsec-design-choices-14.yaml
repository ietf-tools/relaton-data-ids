abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is written to capture the design rationale primarily
    for the individual draft-00 version of BGPsec protocol specification [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00].
    However, where appropriate, the document also provides a brief rationale and/or
    pointer for design decisions that are reflected in the finalized BGPsec protocol
    specification [RFC8205]. It lists the decisions that were made in favor of or
    against each design choice, and presents brief summaries of the arguments that
    aided the decision process.</p>"
