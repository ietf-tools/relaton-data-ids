abstract:
- content: "<p>A network slice offers connectivity services to a network slice customer
    with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs)
    over a common underlay network. RFC XXXX describes a framework for network slices
    built using networks that use IETF technologies. As part of that framework, the
    Network Resource Partition (NRP) is introduced as a set of network resources that
    are allocated from the underlay network to carry a specific set of network slice
    service traffic and meet specific SLOs and SLEs. As the demand for network slices
    increases, scalability becomes an important factor. Although the scalability of
    network slices can be improved by mapping a group of network slices to a single
    NRP, that design may not be suitable or possible for all deployments, thus there
    are concerns about the scalability of NRPs themselves. This document discusses
    some considerations for NRP scalability in the control and data planes. It also
    investigates a set of optimization mechanisms.</p>"
