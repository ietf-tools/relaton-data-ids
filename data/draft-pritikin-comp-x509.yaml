abstract:
- content: "<p>This note defines the Compressed X.509 Format (CXF), a compact format
    for X.509 certificates and CRLs, and a way to translate between the compact format
    and standard X.509 encoding. The translation consists of the lossless compression
    algorithm DEFLATE with a particular predefined dictionary. Protocol bindings for
    TLS and IKE are designated. This format is useful in a constrained environment,
    where bandwidth and/or storage is low, and it preserves interoperability with
    standards-compliant X.509 certificates and the systems for certificate processing,
    issuance, and management.</p>"
