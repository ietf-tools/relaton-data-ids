    deployed on the Internet. This document briefly describes those protocols and
    references their specifications. This memo also reclassifies several older RFCs
    to Historic. These RFCs describe multicast routing protocols that were never widely
    deployed or have fallen into disuse. This memo provides information for the Internet
