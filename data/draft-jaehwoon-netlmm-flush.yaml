abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to solve the inefficient route problem of PMIPv6, a mechanism
    to optimize the route between two mobile nodes within the same PMIPv6 domain has
    been proposed. However, this route optimization mechanism may result in the out-of-order
    packet delivery problem. In this draft, we propose a mechanism that can resolve
    the out-of- order packet delivery problem by introducing the Flush message that
    notifies the change of the tunnel endpoint and allows the in-order delivery of
    packets even in the case of the route optimization.</p>"
