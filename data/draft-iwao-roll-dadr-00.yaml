abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposal of the distributed autonomous depth-first
    routing (DADR) protocol which is quite different from conventional algorithms
    such as AODV and OLSR. It proposes a traversable algorithm which can determine
    a direct path between the global source and the global destination in a low power
    and lossy network (LLN). We propose the DADR algorithm whose characteristics work
    well in LLNs with more than 10^4 nodes. This algorithm selects a direct path between
    the global source and the global destination based on a routing-cost- function
    which identifies path-candidates with good communication quality between each
    pair of nodes on the path. This protocol does not need to configure the equipment
    such as setting IP addresses, and thisresults in saving cost and time in deploying,
    establishing and operating a large scale network. Iwao, et al. Expires January
