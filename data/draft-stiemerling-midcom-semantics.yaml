abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies semantics for a Middlebox Communication (MIDCOM)
    protocol to be used by MIDCOM agents for interacting with middleboxes, such as
    firewalls and NATs. The semantics discussion does not include any specification
    of a concrete syntax or a transport protocol. However, a concrete protocol is
    expected to implement the specified semantics or a superset of it. The MIDCOM
    protocol semantics is derived from the MIDCOM requirements, from the MIDCOM framework,
    and from working group decisions.</p>"
