abstract:
- content: "<p>In Inter-AS scenario, as usual, multiple Path Computation Elements
    (PCEs) will take part in path computation. [PCE-DISCO-OSPF], [PCE- DISCO-ISIS],PCE-DISCO-BGP]
    or some other means can be used to discover all underling PCEs, but there is lack
    of solutions to find out those PCEs and their sequence which are engaged in computing
    an end-to-end inter-AS TE LSP. This document proposes a solution to identify these
    PCEs and their sequence which can be used to compute a TE LSP across multiple
    ASes.</p>"
