abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies new File Transfer Protocol (FTP) commands to
    allow for a distributed FTP server to operate correctly. The purpose is to address
    an issue in the FTP Protocol which causes a truely distributed FTP server from
    being possible. Truely distributed meaning that data-connections do not need to
    be routed through the FTP server, itself, to be transferred to the client, and
    allowing data to be stored completely separately from the FTP Server. Copyright
