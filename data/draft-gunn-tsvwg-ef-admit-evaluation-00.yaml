abstract:
- content: "<p>A new Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), EF-ADMIT, has been
    recommended for a class of real-time traffic conforming to the Expedited Forwarding
    (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB) and admitted using a strong Call Admission Control
    (CAC) procedure incorporating capacity assurance, as compared to a class of real-time
    traffic conforming to the EF PHB but not subject to strong CAC. This document
    presents modeling results demonstrating that EF-ADMIT traffic will experience
    low packet drop rates even when lack of strong CAC results in EF traffic experiencing
    high packet drop rates. The modeling shows the performance benefit is material
    at low to medium network access speeds (e.g., 256 Kb/s to 1.5 Mb/s), but relatively
    inconsequential at high access speeds (e.g., 45 Mb/s) and, by inference, backbone
    speeds (100Mb/s and higher) where more bandwidth headroom is assumed. Furthermore,
    mixing relatively long packets (e.g., 1500 byte video packets) with relatively
    short packets (e.g., 200 byte voice packets) in EF PHB causes significant degradation
    to short packet performance at low to medium access speeds. Finally, the results
    show that implementation can be effective utilizing either one queue with combined
    EF and EF-ADMIT flows, or two queues with one forEF-ADMIT flows and one for EF
    flows, with the choice of approach mostly a matter of policy.</p>"
