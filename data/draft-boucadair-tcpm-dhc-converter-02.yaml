abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of the lack of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) support at the server
    side, some service providers now consider a network-assisted model that relies
    upon the activation of a dedicated function called Converters. Network-assisted
    MPTCP deployment models are designed to facilitate the adoption of MPTCP for the
    establishment of multi-path communications without making any assumption about
    the support of MPTCP by the communicating peers. Converters located in the network
    are responsible for establishing multi-path communications on behalf of endpoints,
    thereby taking advantage of MPTCP capabilities to achieve different goals that
    include (but are not limited to) optimization of resource usage (e.g., bandwidth
    aggregation), of resiliency (e.g., primary/backup communication paths), and traffic
    offload management. This document focuses on the explicit deployment scheme where
    the identity of the Converters is explicitly configured on connected hosts. This
    document specifies DHCP (IPv4 and IPv6) options to configure hosts with Converters
    parameters.</p>"
