abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for application deployment where
    the application logic and media processing are distributed. The framework uses
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish an application-level control
    mechanism between Application Servers and Media Servers. The motivation for this
    protocol is to provide an interface suitable to meet the requirements of a distributed,
    centralized conference system, as defined by the XCON work group of the IETF.</p>"
