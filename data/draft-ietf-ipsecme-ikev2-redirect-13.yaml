abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a protocol
    for setting up Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnels from a remote location to
    a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in the network behind the
    gateway. This document defines an IKEv2 extension that allows an overloaded VPN
    gateway or a VPN gateway that is being shut down for maintenance to redirect the
    VPN client to attach to another gateway. The proposed mechanism can also be used
    in Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to redirect the mobile node to another
    home agent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
