abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to the Service Location Protocol
    verson 2 (SLPv2) which allow applications residing in Mobile IPv6 nodes to interact
    with SLPv2 agents in fixed networks. Each mobile node contains a Visiting Agent
    which communicates with Access Agents residing in fixed networks. In networks
    already deployed with SLPv2- based service infrastructure, this allows applications
    in visiting mobile nodes to use SLPv2 and provide site-local services without
    needing prior knowledge or static configuration of the networks they visit. By
    monitoring changes in Access Agent Advertisements, Visiting Agents can decide
    if the mobile node has moved to a new network, and if it is necessary to rediscover
    and reregister site- local services. This document extends SLPv2 and the SLP API
    with new message types, error codes and function calls. Both C and Java API bindings
    are provided.</p>"
