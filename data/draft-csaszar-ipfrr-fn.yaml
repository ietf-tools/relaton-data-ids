abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the benefits and main applications of sending
    explicit fast notification (FN) packets to routers in an area. FN packets are
    generated and processed in the dataplane, and a single FN service can substitute
    existing OAM methods for remote failure detection, such as a full mesh of multi-hop
    BFD session. The FN service, therefore, decreases network overhead considerable.
    The main application is fast reroute in pure IP and in IP/LDP-MPLS networks called
    IPFRR-FN. The detour paths used when IPFRR-FN is active are in most cases identical
    to those used after Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) convergence. The proposed
    mechanism can address all single link, node, and SRLG failures in an area; moreover
    it is an efficient solution to protect against BGP ASBR failures as well as VPN
    PE router failures. IPFRR-FN can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR when LFA
    cannot repair a failure case, while it can be a replacement of existing ASBR/PE
    protection mechanisms by overcoming their scalability and complexity issues.</p>"
