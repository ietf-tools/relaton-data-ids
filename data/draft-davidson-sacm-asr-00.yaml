abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting (ASR), a data
    model for expressing the data exchange format of summary information relative
    to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the bandwidth requirement to report information
    about assets in the aggregate since it allows for reporting aggregates relative
    to metrics, as opposed to reporting data about each individual asset, which can
    lead to a bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor neutral and leverages widely adopted,
    open specifications; it is flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting
    applications.</p>"
