abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexible grid is regarded as an efficient way to improve the network
    capacity utilization. Mixed bit rate transmission systems can allocate their channel
    with different spectral bandwidths so that they can be optimized for the bandwidth
    requirements of the particular bit rate and modulation scheme of the individual
    channels. To support the flexible grid technique, this document extends the wavelength
    label to accommodate this new specification. It is demonstrated that the extended
    label format is compatible to the rigid one and can be used in the routing and
    signaling procedure in the Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON).</p>"
