abstract:
- content: <p>From time to time, networking protocols need to be able to name things
    used within the protocol, and resolve the names created or referenced. It's common
    for protocol designers to attempt to use domain names as the starting point for
    their systems of names, and the DNS protocol as the starting point for name resolution.
    Such re- use of DNS naming and resolution conventions can cause issues if not
    carefully defined and handled, as applications and infrastructure in the modern
    Internet tend to assume that a "domain name" is an identifier that follows certain
    composition and allocation rules and is to be resolved by DNS protocol in the
    global default scope. This document acknowledges this class of extensions to the
    shared domain namespace and considers a framework for the properties a naming
    and resolution convention should have in the internet protocol environment, including
    the avoidance of collision with other uses of the namespace. Depending to the
    answers to the suggested questions, the answer may be that domain names will not
    meet the constraints at hand.</p>
