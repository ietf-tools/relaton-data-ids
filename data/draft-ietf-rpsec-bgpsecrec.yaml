abstract:
- content: "<p>The security of BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol, is critical to the
    proper operation of large-scale internetworks, both public and private. While
    securing the information transmitted between two BGP speakers is a relatively
    easy technical matter, securing BGP, as a routing system, is more complex. This
    document describes a set of requirements for securing BGP and the routing information
    carried within BGP.</p>"
