abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC2960] provides transparent
    multi-homing to its upper layer users. This multi-homing is accomplished through
    the passing of address parameters in the initial setup message used by SCTP. In
    an IPv4 network all addresses are passed with no consideration for their scope
    and routeablility. In a IPv6 network special considerations MUST be made to properly
    bring up associations between SCTP endpoints that have IPv6 [RFC2460] addresses
    bound within their association. This document defines those considerations and
    enumerates general rules that an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the
    INIT and INIT-ACK chunks.</p>"
