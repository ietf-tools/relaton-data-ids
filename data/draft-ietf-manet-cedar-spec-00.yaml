abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents CEDAR, a Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing
    algorithm for QoS routing in ad hoc network environments. CEDAR has three key
    components: (a) the establishment and maintenance of a self-organizing routing
    infrastructure, called the 'core', for performing route computations, (b) the
    propagation of the link-state of stable high-bandwidth links in the core through
    'increase/decrease' waves, and (c) a QoS route computation algorithm that is executed
    at the core nodes using only locally available state.</p>"
