abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantum communication modules connected via a link, either via fiber
    or free-space communications, have been used since a while to distribute random
    numbers as secure keys, but there are other use cases, such as time synchronization.
    By today, a number of research and industrial efforts are underway to built complete
    networks, primary for secure key distribution, i.e., so-called Quantum Key Distribution
    Networks (QKDN). This memo briefly explores the space of QKDNs and identifies
    spots of potentials interest to develop standardized protocols specific for such
    networks.</p>"
