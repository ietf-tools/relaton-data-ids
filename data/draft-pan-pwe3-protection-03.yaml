abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism that helps to protect and recover
    user traffic when carried over pseudo-wires. The mechanism requires some minor
    modification to the existing pseudo-wire setup procedure, and is fully backward
    compatible. The proposed mechanism allows the network operators to setup one or
    multiple backup pseudo-wires to protect a working pseudo-wire. Upon network failure,
    user traffic can be switched over to the next "best" pseudo-wire base on preference
    levels. This document first describes the motivation of the work base on the discussions
    with a number of carriers. Then we define the protocol extension itself.</p>
