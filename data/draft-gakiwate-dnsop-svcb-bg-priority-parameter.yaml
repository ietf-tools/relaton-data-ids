abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new SvcParamKey for use in Service Binding (SVCB)
    and HTTPS DNS resource records which enables authoritative DNS servers to indicate
    that a client can use an alternative endpoint for "background" requests. By providing
    this information, clients can make informed decisions about which service endpoints
    to use based on their specific applications needs at the time of making connections.</p>
