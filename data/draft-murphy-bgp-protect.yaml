abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed before
    the Internet environment became perilous, is designed with little consideration
    for protection of the information it carries. There are no mechanisms in BGP to
    protect against attacks that modify, delete, forge, or replay data, any of which
    has the potential to disrupt overall network routing behavior. This internet draft
    discusses some of the security issues with BGP routing data dissemination, and
    possible security solutions and the costs of those solutions. This internet draft
    does not discuss security issues with forwarding of packets.</p>"
