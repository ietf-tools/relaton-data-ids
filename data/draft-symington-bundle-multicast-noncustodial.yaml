abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the requirements and constraints that must be
    imposed when using the Bundle Protocol [2] in order to support the best-effort
    multicast delivery of bundles within a Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN). The capabilities
    described herein enable a source node to transmit a bundle to multiple destination
    nodes without having to originate a separate bundle for each destination node.
    These capabilities do not support custody transfer of bundles that are being delivered
    via multicast.</p>"
