abstract:
- content: <p>This glossary is intended to help with the understanding of terms used
    in the Ivip core-edge separation architecture and of some non- Ivip terms which
    are pertinent to scalable routing. These are not "official" definitions of terms
    as used in scalable routing, but I hope they will help newcomers to the field.
    Please suggest corrections, additions and improvements.</p>
