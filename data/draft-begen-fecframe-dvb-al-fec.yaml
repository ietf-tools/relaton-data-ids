abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Application-layer Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) protocol that was developed by the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) consortium
    for the protection of media streams over IP networks. The DVB AL-FEC protocol
    uses two layers for FEC protection. The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D
    interleaved parity code. The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptor
    code. Since both of these codes have already been specified in separate documents,
    the current document does not define the details of these codes but provides the
    references to the respective specifications. By offering a layered approach, the
    DVB AL-FEC offers a good protection against both bursty and random packet losses
    at a cost of decent complexity.</p>"
