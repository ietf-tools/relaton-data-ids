abstract:
- content: "<p>As the internet becomes increasingly critical to the world's social
    and economic infrastructure, attention has rightly focused on the correct, safe,
    reliable, and secure operation of the internet infrastructure itself. The root
    domain name servers are seen as a crucial part of that technical infrastructure.
    This document attempts to provide guidelines for operation of the root servers.
    These guidelines are intended to meet the perceived societal needs without overly
    prescribing technical details.</p>"
