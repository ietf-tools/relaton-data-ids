abstract:
- content: <p>Section 4.3.5.1 of [RFC6781] "DNSSEC Operational Practices, version
    2" describes a procedure for transitioning a DNSSEC signed zone from one (cooperative)
    operator to another. The procedure works well in many situations, but makes the
    assumption that it is feasible for the two operators to simultaneously publish
    slightly different versions of the zone being transferred. In some cases, such
    as with TLD registries, operational considerations require both operators to publish
    identical versions of the zone for the duration of the transition. This document
    describes a modified transition procedure which can be used in these cases.</p>
