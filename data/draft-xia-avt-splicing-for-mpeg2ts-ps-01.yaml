abstract:
- content: "<p>The base MPEG2-TS splicing related protocols, i.e., Digital Program
    Insertion Splicing API [SCTE30] and Digital Program Insertion Cueing Message for
    Cable [SCTE35], only take into account how to insert the content (e.g., spot advertisements
    of various lengths, program substitution, public service announcements, etc) into
    any MPEG2-TS output multiplex on the splicer, as well as how to carry notification
    of upcoming splicing and other timing information in the transport stream, but
    not give enough mechanisms to direct the underlying transport protocol such as
    RTP how to compatibly work with the MPEG2-TS splicing. This memo highlights the
    issues of what's the impact on RTP and RTCP when performing splicing between the
    primary channel and the insertion channel.</p>"
