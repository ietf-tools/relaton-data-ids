abstract:
- content: "<p>The VIEW extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
    permits a subset of messages in the mailbox to be processed separately from the
    entire set of messages in the mailbox. This allows a client to restrict its view
    to only the messages appearing in this set. The subset of messages also need not
    be returned in order of their sequence numbers, allowing clients to access messages
    in a particular sort order. The subsetting and sorting of messages is handled
    by existing [IMAP4] commands that return a set of messages as their result. This
    extension takes the set returned from such a command and applies the VIEW methodology
    to it.</p>"
