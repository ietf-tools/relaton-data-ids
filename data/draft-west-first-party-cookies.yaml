abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates RFC6265 by defining a "SameSite" attribute which
    allows servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site
    requests. This assertion allows user agents to mitigate the risk of cross-origin
    information leakage, and provides some protection against cross-site request forgery
    attacks.</p>
