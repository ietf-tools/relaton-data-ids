abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework and methodology for performing performance
    test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and controllers, including
    systems comprising groups of controllers and WTPs. This document defines and discusses
    a number of tests and associated test conditions that may be used to characterize
    the performance of such systems, and also supplies the methods used to calculate
    the expected results of these tests. Specific formats for reporting the results
    of the tests are also provided, where applicable. The tests described in this
    document extend the methodology defined for benchmarking network interconnect
    devices in RFC 2544, and LAN switches in RFC 2889, to WLAN switch controller systems.
    The methodology herein is to be used together with the companion terminology document.</p>"
