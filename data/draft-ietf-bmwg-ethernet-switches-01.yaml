abstract:
- content: "<p>This initial draft sets out to define a methodology designed specifically
    for Ethernet switches. Although the roots of these devices are clearly to be found
    in bridging, switches have matured enough in the last few years to deserve some
    special attention. The test methodology described here concentrates on four areas:
    throughput, address handling, latency and behavior in abnormal conditions. This
    draft will attempt to make clear why switch specific tests are needed in each
    of these four areas and will define a number of tests in each area. In addition
    to defining the tests this document also describes specific formats for reporting
    the results of the tests. Appendix A lists the tests and conditions that we believe
    should be included for specific cases and gives additional information about testing
    practices. Appendix B is a reference listing of maximum frame rates to be used
    with specific frame sizes on Ethernet.</p>"
