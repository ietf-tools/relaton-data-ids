abstract:
- content: "<p>H-VPLS is an architecture that follows hub-and-spoke connectivity model
    among VPLS aware devices and is proposed in [VPLS-LDP] for creating scalable VPLS
    implementations. To protect from failure of the spoke PW or the failure of host
    PE-rs, MTU-s may be dual homed to two PE-rs devices for a VPLS instance through
    primary spoke PW and secondary(standby) spoke PW. The respective PE-rs devices(s)
    are unaware of the primary or secondary status of spoke PWs. So Broadcast, Unlearned
    unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic received from full mesh core by a PE-rs is
    replicated to MTU-s over secondary spoke PW to get dropped at MTU-s. In such scenerios
    it may be desirable to block the standby spoke PW at PE-rs end with minimal compromise
    on traffic disruption when MTU-s performs a switchover to secondary spoke PW.
    This document proposes an extension to PW status TLV defined in [RFC 4447] to
    signal Standby or Active state of PW by MTU-s to PE-rs in a scalable manner.</p>"
