abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol which provides
    IP mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile node without the involvement of the IPv6
    host. Whenever a mobile node is attached to a PMIPv6 domain via a mobility access
    gateway, MAG, it appears to the mobile node as if it is attached to the same home
    link and thus the mobile node may think that it is not roaming away from home.
    An issue has been raised with respect to the base PMIPv6 protocol support of a
    mobile node with multiple physical interfaces. This issue has been referenced
    as PMIPv6 support for multihoming mobile node. This document describes the multihoming
    issue as it relates to PMIPv6 and provides an analysis to all scenarios that have
    been identified thus far.</p>"
