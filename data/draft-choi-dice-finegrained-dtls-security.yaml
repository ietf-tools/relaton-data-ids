abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method that can selectively apply application
    data encryption to the DTLS record layer. The CoAP used for resource-constrained
    devices defines the use of DTLS as a basic security mechanism, and CoAP standard
    specifies the use of AES_CCM that provides data integrity and confidentiality
    as a cipher suite for DTLS. However, not all CoAP messages require both data integrity
    and confidentiality. For example, in case of CoAP messages that include information
    for turning a light off at home or in a building, or simple ACK information, encryption
    might not be necessary because such information might not be useful to attackers.
    Furthermore, from the perspective of effective resource use of resource-constrained
    devices, reducing the computation load required to perform data encryption every
    time is necessary. This document describes the methods for CoAP nodes to establish
    DTLS security channels using the AES_CCM cipher suite, and to selectively apply
    the encryption function in the DTLS record layer by considering sensitivity to
    application data leakage.</p>"
