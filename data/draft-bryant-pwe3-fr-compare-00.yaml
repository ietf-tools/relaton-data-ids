abstract:
- content: "<p>This document compares and contrasts four approaches to Frame Relay
    encapsulation over a pseudo-wire that have been proposed in the Pseudo-Wire Edge-to-Edge
    (PWE3) IETF working group. This document then shows that the general-purpose encapsulation
    previously proposed for HDLC, Ethernet and VLAN is also the most efficient approach
    for Frame Relay.</p>"
