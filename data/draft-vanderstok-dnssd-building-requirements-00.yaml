abstract:
- content: "<p>The draft describes an interface to the discovery of services on a
    bounded network segment from a building control perspective. Building control
    has special boundary conditions related to: (1) management of devices and services,
    (2) an installation involving stand-alone networks (3) (dis)connecting network
    (from) to Internet without renaming services and devices. Roaming devices are
    not considered in this version. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement
    are requested, and should be sent to dnssd@ietf.org.</p>"
