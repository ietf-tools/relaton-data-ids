abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS technology
    for use in transport network deployments. That is, MPLS-TP is a set of functions
    and features selected from the wider MPLS toolset and applied in a consistent
    way to meet the needs and requirements of operators of packet transport networks.
    During the process of development of the profile, additions to the MPLS toolset
    have been made to ensure that the tools available met the requirements. These
    additions were motivated by MPLS-TP, but form part of the wider MPLS toolset such
    that any of them could be used in any MPLS deployment. One major set of additions
    provides enhanced support for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).
    This enables fault management and performance monitoring to the level needed in
    a transport network. Many solutions and protocol extensions have been proposed
    to address these OAM requirements, and this document sets out the reasons for
    selecting a single, coherent set of solutions for standardization.</p>"
