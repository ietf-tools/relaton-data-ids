abstract:
- content: "<p>When the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing
    protocol is adopted by a highly symmetric network such as the Leaf- Spine or Fat-Tree
    network, the Leaf nodes (e.g., Top of Rack switches in datacenters) are recommended
    to be prevented from receiving other nodes' explicit routes in order to achieve
    scalability. However, such a setup would cause traffic black-holes or suboptimal
    routing if link failure happens in the network. This document extends IS-IS to
    solve this problem.</p>"
