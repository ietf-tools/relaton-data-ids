abstract:
- content: "<p>The Connection-less Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (CLDAP) technical
    specification, RFC 1798, was published in 1995 as a Proposed Standard. This document
    discusses the reasons why the CLDAP technical specification has not been furthered
    on the Standard Track. This document recommends that RFC 1798 be moved to Historic
    status.</p>"
