abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple method that allows a mobile node to
    use a home agent situated inside a protected intranet, while also allowing the
    mobile to roam between the public internet and the intranet without losing active
    sessions. Whenever the mobile is outside the intranet, it connects to the intranet
    using an IPsec tunnel and registers the IPsec-assigned inner tunnel address as
    its co-located care-of address to the internal home agent. If desired, handover
    performance while outside the intranet can be enhanced by employing another Mobile
    IP layer underneath IPsec. The solution does not require any new protocols, only
    a profile for using existing protocols. Only the mobile node needs to be modified
    in order to use this profile.</p>"
