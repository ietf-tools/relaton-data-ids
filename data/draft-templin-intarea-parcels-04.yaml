abstract:
- content: <p>IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of
    data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Upper layer protocols
    such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) prepare data units known as "segments",
    with traditional arrangements including a single segment per packet. This document
    presents a new construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet
    to carry multiple segments, essentially creating a "packet-of-packets". Parcels
    can be broken into smaller parcels by a middlebox on the path if necessary, then
    rejoined into one or more repackaged parcels to be forwarded further toward the
    final destination. While not desirable, reordering of segments within parcels
    and individual segment loss are possible. But, what matters is that the number
    of parcels delivered to the final destination should be kept to a minimum, and
    that loss or receipt of individual segments (and not parcel size) determines the
    retransmission unit.</p>
