abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an informative overview of possible use cases
    where ECN marking can be used for inelastic traffic. It outlines benefits of preserving
    the ECN support in a PCN domain. As ECN provides with a simple mechanism for network
    nodes to inform the end points about possible upcoming congestion and resulting
    packet losses and delay increase, the scheme can be useful for adaptive real-time
    media applications, thus enabling them to adjust the transmission rate to avoid
    quality degradation due to congestion. By showing the benefits of ECN this memo
    asks the working group to consider end to end ECN support in PCN domain.</p>"
