abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF requires English for technical discussion in working groups,
    in working group documents and in anything considered for publication. Use of
    English simplifies overhead and makes for clear discussion of a single document
    in a single language, but disadvantages those who lack fluency and comfort in
    English. This document proposes setting up talk mailing lists for languages other
    than English, where technical matters can be discussed in comfort, and perhaps
    even be written up in internet-draft form in a language other than English. Once
    technical ideas are in place, a draft can move forward to a working group in English.
    Exposing non-English speakers to the IETF will, in the interests of diversity,
    allow them to gain familiarity with IETF processes while discussing with other
    fluent speakers of their language. This benefits the IETF by attracting a broader
    constituency while meeting its diversity goals.</p>"
