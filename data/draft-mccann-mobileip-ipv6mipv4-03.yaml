abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Mobile IPv4 extension that may be used by
    dual stack mobile nodes to obtain IPv6 service with the use of a Mobile IPv4 registration.
    This extension allows for immediate deployment of IPv6 on dual stack mobile devices,
    without the need for a full IPv6 infrastructure. It is believed that providing
    IPv6 services to mobile devices in the short term will spur the growth of IPv6
    networks. This extension makes use of the existing Mobile IPv4 security model,
    including the interface to the AAA infrastructure, but does not provide the route
    optimization capabilities included in the Mobile IPv6 protocol. Further, this
    specification requires that the mobile node and Home Agent have dual IPv4 and
    IPv6 stacks. There are no changes to the FA nor does it need to be dual stack.</p>"
