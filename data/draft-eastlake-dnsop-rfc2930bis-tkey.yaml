abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 8945 provides a means of efficiently authenticating Domain Name
    System (DNS) protocol messages using shared secret keys via the TSIG resource
    record (RR). However, it provides no mechanism for setting up such keys other
    than manual configuration. This document describes a TKEY RR that can be used
    in a number of different modes to establish shared secret keys between a DNS resolver
    and server. This document obsoletes RFC 2930.</p>"
