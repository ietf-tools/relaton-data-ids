abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to
    monitor, control, and (sometimes also) configure network elements. Even though
    the SNMP technology is well documented, it remains relatively unclear how SNMP
    is used in practice and what typical SNMP usage patterns are. This document describes
    an approach to carrying out large-scale SNMP traffic measurements in order to
    develop a better understanding of how SNMP is used in real-world production networks.
    It describes the motivation, the measurement approach, and the tools and data
    formats needed to carry out such a study. This document was produced within the
    IRTF's Network Management Research Group (NMRG), and it represents the consensus
    of all of the active contributors to this group. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
