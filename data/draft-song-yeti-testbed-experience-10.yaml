abstract:
- content: "<p>Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production root server testbed that
    provides an environment where technical and operational experiments can safely
    be performed without risk to production root server infrastructure. This document
    aims solely to document the technical and operational experience of deploying
    a system that is similar to but different from the Root Server system (on which
    the Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built).</p>"
