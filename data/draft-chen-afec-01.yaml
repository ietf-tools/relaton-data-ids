abstract:
- content: "<p>This document generally describes how to use an Adaptive Forward Error
    Correction (AFEC) algorithm to efficiently protect the compressed header vital
    data as well as UDP-Liteâ€™s vital data for data transport in the radio-link layer
    of an error-prone wireless connection. Augmented with RoHC and UDP-Lite, for video
    transmissions over wireless channels in a heterogeneous wired- wireless environment,
    the erroneous packet payloads can be useful and the applications better able to
    cope with lost packets (native UDP case), by adopting some of the erasure and
    error resilient modes in the latest video codecs, such as H.264. The context transfer
    in the inter/intra handover is also covered.</p>"
