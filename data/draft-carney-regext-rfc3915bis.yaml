abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730]
    extension mapping for the management of Domain Name System (DNS) domain names
    subject to "grace period" policies. Grace period policies exist to allow protocol
    actions to be reversed or otherwise revoked during a short period of time after
    the protocol action has been performed. This mapping extends the EPP domain name
    mapping [RFC5731] to provide additional features required for grace period processing.
    This document replaces the extension mapping for grace periods described in [RFC3915],
    rendering that document obsolete.</p>
