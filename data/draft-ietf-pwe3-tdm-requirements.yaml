abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the specific requirements for edge-to-edge emulation
    of circuits carrying Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals of the Plesiochronous
    Digital Hierarchy as well as the Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital
    Hierarchy over packet-switched networks. It is aligned to the common architecture
    for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3). It makes references to the generic
    requirements for PWE3 where applicable and complements them by defining requirements
    originating from specifics of TDM circuits. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>"
