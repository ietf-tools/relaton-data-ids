abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC 8956,
    and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters
    and actions) distributed via BGP. During the deployment of BGP FSv1 a number of
    issues were detected, so version 2 of the BGP flow specification (FSv2) protocol
    addresses these features. In order to provide a clear demarcation between FSv1
    and FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2. The IDR WG requires two implementation
    Implementers feedback on FSv2 was that FSv2 has a correct design, but that breaking
    FSv2 into a progression of documents would aid deployment of the draft. The IDR
    WG requires two implementation so This document is the first of the series of
    documents indicating the basic FSv2 with user ordering of filters added to FSv1
    IP Filters and IP actions.</p>"
