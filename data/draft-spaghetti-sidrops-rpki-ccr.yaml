- content: "<p>This document specifies a Canonical Cache Representation (CCR) content
    type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). CCR is a DER-encoded
    data interchange format which can be used to represent various aspects of the
    state of a validated cache at a particular point in time. The CCR profile is a
    compact and versatile format well-suited for a diverse set of applications such
    as audit trail keeping, validated payload dissemination, and analytics pipelines.</p>"
