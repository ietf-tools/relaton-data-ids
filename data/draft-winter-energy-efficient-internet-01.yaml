abstract:
- content: "<p>Climate change and cost drives all sectors of industry and society
    as a whole towards more energy-efficient technology, products and life styles.
    The collection of Internet infrastructure and the attached devices are a large
    user of electrical energy and therefore of course are no exception regarding this
    trend. This memo attempts to identify obstacles and more importantly technology
    options for an energy-efficient Internet with a focus on the protocols that are
    the product of the IETF.</p>"
