abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a configuration interface advertisement method
    for NETCONF device developers. In the proposal, the developers take a configuration
    interface definition information of target NETCONF devices. On their development
    environment, they generate stab classes to control the devices. The NETCONF device
    advertises their configuration interface by a WSDL file. The WSDL file describes
    message type of each NETCONF operation of the device. The WSDL file contains XML
    Schema in its types element and describes definition of the types definition used
    to configuration data. By this configuration interface advertisement, Network
    management System (NMS) developers can improve their development efficiency of
    the NMS.</p>"
