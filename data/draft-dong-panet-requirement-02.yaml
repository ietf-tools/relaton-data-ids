abstract:
- content: "<p>Energy consumption of networks is rising fast, which results in the
    increase of network operational costs. There are emerging demands from operators
    for power-aware networking (PANET) which could adaptively reduce the network energy
    consumption when possible. This document presents the requirements which should
    be considered in building a power aware network.</p>"
