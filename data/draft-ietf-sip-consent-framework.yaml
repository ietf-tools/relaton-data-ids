abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP supports communications for several services, including real-time
    audio, video, text, instant messaging, and presence. In its current form, it allows
    session invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered from
    one party to another without requiring explicit consent of the recipient. Without
    such consent, it is possible for SIP to be used for malicious purposes, including
    amplification and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. This document identifies a
    framework for consent-based communications in SIP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
