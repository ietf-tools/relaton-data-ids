abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a method of protecting TCP connections against
    off-path, third party spoofing attacks, by making use of the TCP Timestamps option
    specified in RFC1323. The original basis of the idea was proposed by Kacheong
    Poon. This memo discusses its issues to add complementary ideas to his original
    approach. Viable ideas in this memo will be incorporated into his upcoming draft.</p>"
