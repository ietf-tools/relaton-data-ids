abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension of OSPF-MDR which allows the option
    of using multipoint relays (MPRs) to select the MANET Designated Routers (MDRs),
    which form a CDS used for flooding LSAs. This extension allows each router to
    decide independently whether or not to select MPRs, so it provides additional
    flexibility without having to specify OSPF-MDR so that it either requires or prohibits
    MPRs. The use of MPRs in OSPF-MDR may provide some advantages (e.g., a CDS with
    a smaller stretch factor), although this may come with some costs in terms of
    overhead and/or response time. Simulations are planned to compare the performance
    of OSPF-MDR with and without MPRs.</p>"
