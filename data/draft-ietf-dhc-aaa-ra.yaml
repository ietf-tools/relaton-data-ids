abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently there has been interest in using DHCP for configuring clients
    accessing the Internet through some form of high-speed access technology such
    as cable or ADSL [DHC-AGENT]. In addition, although DHCP was initially designed
    for configuring fixed hosts, proposals are being made to enhance DHCP to support
    roaming/mobile clients [DHC-ENHANCE]. These two trends have put in evidence the
    need for a coupling between AAA and DHCP. Some initial requirements for DHCP/AAA
    have been proposed in [DHC-AAA]. This document proposes a different model in which
    AAA procedures are invoked not from a DHCP server but from a DHCP relay agent
    to make sure that ALL the Internet Access features supported by the PPP model
    can be replicated in a DHCP based Internet Access environment.</p>"
