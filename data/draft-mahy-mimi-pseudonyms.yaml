abstract:
- content: "<p>The MIMI protocol has a baseline level of metadata privacy, which can
    be made more private through the optional use of per-room pseudonyms. This document
    describes three of many possible flows that use pseudonyms for enhanced privacy.
    It also discusses some ways that spam and abuse prevention mechanisms can work
    in conjunction with pseudonyms.</p>"
