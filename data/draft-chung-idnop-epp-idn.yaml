abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) mapping
    for the provisioning and management of Internationalized Internet domain names
    (that includes English alphanumeric domain names) stored in a shared central repository.
    Specified in XML, the mapping defines EPP command syntax and semantics as applied
    to domain names. More specifically, EPP-IDN intends to provide a mechanism for
    explicitly managing and provisioning Reserved Variants and Zone Variants created
    for a Primary Domain Name.</p>"
