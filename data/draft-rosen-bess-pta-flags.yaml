abstract:
- content: <p>RFC6514 defines the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel)
    attribute". This attribute contains an octet of "flags". Only one flag is defined
    in that RFC, but there is now a need to define additional flags. Since the RFC
    did not create a registry for the assignment of flag bits, this document updates
    the RFC by creating a registry for that purpose.</p>
