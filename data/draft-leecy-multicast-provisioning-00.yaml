abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes methods to provision resources for multicast
    groups. It proposes mechanisms that allow multicast delivery paths to be constructed
    along paths that have been statically provisioned for multicast traffic. In addition
    to static provisioning, it allows resources to be provisioned dynamically to overcome
    the difficulties in predicting and provisioning a priori, the amount of resources
    required for dynamic multicast groups. To prevent the problem of data being multicasted
    on a path which has not been provisioned for the service level that data is being
    transmitted : i) when resources are dynamically provisioned they are provisioned
    at the same time as the distribution path is setup, otherwise ii) multicast delivery
    paths are only constructed on paths already provisioned statically.</p>"
