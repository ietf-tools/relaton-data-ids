abstract:
- content: "<p>CATS (Computing Aware Traffic Steering) is designed to enable the routing
    network to be aware of computing status thus deliver the service flow accordingly.
    Nevertheless, computing and networking is quite different in terms of resource
    granularity as well as its status stability. It would gain significant benefits
    to accommodate the computing status to that of networking by employing a hierarchical
    computing routing segment scheme. The network- accommodated computing status could
    be maintained at remote CATS nodes while the rest could reside at local CATS nodes.
    By enabling the network to schedule and route computing services in a compatible
    way with the current IP routing network, CATS would bring benefits to the industry
    by both efficiently pooling the computing resources and rendering services through
    perspective of converged networking and computing.</p>"
