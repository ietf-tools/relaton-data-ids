abstract:
- content: "<p>Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed MPLS
    protection mechanism that can protect against link and node failure. It provides
    a fast protection switch mechanism to minimize traffic loss (typically sub 50msec)
    if the node that detects the failure locally, does the repair by re-routing the
    protected traffic to go over the backup tunnel. A direct application of this mechanism
    to a ring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth that could
    also result in degraded service. This document describes a mechanism to do it
    without such problems.</p>"
