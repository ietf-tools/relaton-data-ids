abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes PNG (Portable Network Graphics), an extensible
    file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images.
    PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common
    uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are supported, plus
    an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. PNG is designed
    to work well in online viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it
    is fully streamable with a progressive display option. PNG is robust, providing
    both full file integrity checking and simple detection of common transmission
    errors. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching
    on heterogeneous platforms. This specification defines the Internet Media Type
    'image/png'.</p>"
