abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is\n
    \  available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal\n   network.
    \ However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges.  RFC\n   4942 describes
    the security issues in the protocol, but network\n   managers also need a more
    practical, operations-minded document to\n   enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages
    of certain choices.\n\n   This document analyzes the operational security issues
    associated\n   with several types of network (enterprises, service providers,
    and\n   residential users) and proposes technical and procedural mitigation\n
    \  techniques.  The residential users case assumes a managed ISP CPE\n   device.
    \ Some very specific types of networks such as the Internet of\n   Things (IoT)
    and unmanaged home networks are not discussed in this\n   document.\n\n\t </p>\n
