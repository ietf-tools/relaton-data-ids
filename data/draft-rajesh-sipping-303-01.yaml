abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for sessions to be redirected
    by the use of the 3xx response code. This response code allows redirect servers
    and proxies to redirect the session or for the message to be sent all the way
    back to the initiating client to recurse. There is no way to direct the domain
    responsible for the Request-URI to perform the redirection. This document defines
    a new response code that clients and redirect servers could use to ensure that
    recursion take place within the domain responsible for the Request-URI rather
    than allowing the initiating client do perform the redirect.</p>"
