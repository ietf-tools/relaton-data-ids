abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper provides the Mathematics for the New Paradigm Defining the
    Binary System. Furthermore, while the Mathematical foundation and Logical justification,
    which established the New Structure for the BINARY SYSTEM, were derived from The
    Mathematics of Quantification. The Mathematics itself, which is used in the New
    Binary System however, while providing the viable justification and the logical
    reasons that supports the change for the New Binary Model, is not quite so new.
    In fact, it can be said that the Mathematics of Quantification sustains a Cascading
    Effect, Producing a Profound Change in the Mathematics for the Entire Mathematical
    Field. But, the Mathematics for the New Binary System has a Historical Foundation,
    which dates to the beginnings of Mathematics itself.</p>"
