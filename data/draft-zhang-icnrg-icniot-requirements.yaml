abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to the Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols forming a
    horizontal unified, defragmented IoT platform. Such a platform will make objects
    accessible to applications across organizations and domains. Towards this goal,
    quite a few proposals have been made to build a unified host-centric IoT platform
    as an overlay on top of today's host-centric Internet. However, there is a fundamental
    mismatch between the host-centric nature of todays Internet and the information-centric
    nature of the IoT system. To address this mismatch, we propose to build a common
    set of protocols and services, which form an IoT platform, based on the Information
    Centric Network (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT. ICN-IoT leverages the
    salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless mobility support, security,
    scalability, and efficient content and service delivery. This draft describes
    representative IoT requirements and ICN challenges to realize a unified ICN-IoT
    framework. Towards this, we first identify a list of important requirements which
    a unified IoT architecture should have to support tens of billions of objects,
    then we discuss how the current IP-IoT overlay fails to meet these requirements,
    followed by discussion on suitability of ICN for IoT. Though we see most of the
    IoT requirements can be met by ICN, we discuss specific challenges ICN has to
    address to satisfy them. Then we provide discussion of popular IoT scenarios including
    the "smart" home, campus, grid, transportation infrastructure, healthcare, Education,
    and Entertainment for completeness, as specific scenarios requires appropriate
    design choices and architectural considerations towards developing an ICN-IoT
    solution.</p>
