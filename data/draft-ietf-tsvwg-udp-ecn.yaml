abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) applies to all transport protocols
    in principle. However, it had limited deployment for UDP until QUIC became widely
    adopted. As a result, documentation of UDP socket APIs for ECN on various platforms
    is sparse. This document records the results of experimenting with these APIs
    in order to get ECN working on UDP for Chromium on Apple, Linux, and Windows platforms.</p>"
