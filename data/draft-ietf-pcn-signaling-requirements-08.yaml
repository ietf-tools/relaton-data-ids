abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality
    of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN
    architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo describes the requirements for
    the signaling applied within the PCN-domain: (1) PCN-feedback-information is carried
    from the PCN-egress-node to the Decision Point; (2) the Decision Point may ask
    the PCN-ingress-node to measure, and report back, the rate of sent PCN-traffic
    between that PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-node. The Decision Point may be either
    collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node (in the first case,
    (2) is not required). The signaling requirements pertain in particular to two
    edge behaviors, Controlled Load (CL) and Single Marking (SM). This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
