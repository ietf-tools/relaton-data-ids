abstract:
- content: "<p>There are times when an LDAP search would return a DN-valued attribute
    with multiple values. As the number of values in a multi- value attribute increases,
    it becomes apparent that a way to query the multi-valued attribute is increasingly
    valuable. This document describes an LDAP extended search control that returns
    DN-valued attributes as objects and their respective attributes in the searchResultEntry
    and also allows filters to be applied to the values in a large multi-valued attribute.
    Using this control to search multi-valued attributes reduces the number of client
    round trips.</p>"
