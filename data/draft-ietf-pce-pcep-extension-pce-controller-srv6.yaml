abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE is a core component of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) systems.
    A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed
    control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely
    replacing it. This document specifies the procedures and Path Computation Element
    Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions when a PCE-based controller is also responsible
    for configuring the forwarding actions on the routers, in addition to computing
    the paths for packet flows in the for Segment Routing (SR) in IPv6 (SRv6) network
    and telling the edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter
    the network. PCECC is further enhanced for SRv6 SID (Segment Identifier) allocation
    and distribution.</p>"
