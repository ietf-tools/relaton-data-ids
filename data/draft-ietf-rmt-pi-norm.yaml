abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative-acknowledgment
    (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol. This protocol is designed
    to provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over
    generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services. NORM uses a selective, negative
    acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol
    mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal "a priori" coordination among senders
    and receivers. A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol
    to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such
    as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It is capable of operating with both reciprocal
    multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity
    (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers. The protocol
    offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly
    other higher level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways.
    The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable multicast
    transport (RMT) building blocks in its design. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>
