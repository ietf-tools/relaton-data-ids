abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the application of lossless compression technology
    to the IP Security Architecture [IPSecArch]. Over the last few several months,
    a number of lively debates on this topic have been held on IPSec mailing list.
    This memo discusses the issues raised, the alternatives available to resolve them
    and provides a set of recommendations to bring resolution to the issue. The goals
    of the draft are to: (1) define the problem solved by the use of compression in
    the context of IPSec, (2) review the use of compression and security technologies
    as they have been applied in other layers of the protocol stack, (3) outline a
    set of requirements for applying compression to IPSec, (4) discuss alternative
    methods which can be implemented to meet the requirements, and (4) propose a set
    of recommendations for consideration by the working group.</p>"
