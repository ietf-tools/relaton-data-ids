abstract:
- content: "<p>Using localized mobility management based on IPv6, all packets destined
    to a mobile node are routed through the local mobility agent in the mobile node's
    local mobility domain, which then tunnels the packets to the mobile node's current
    location. Such packet routing mechanism is similar to the triangle routing in
    Mobile IPv4, which may leave the local mobility agent overloaded and take a longer
    route thus increasing the network traffic in the local mobility domain. This document
    specifies a route optimization scheme for localized mobility management based
    on IPv6 with the help of L2 trigger. Using this, correspondent nodes can cache
    LCoA of a mobile node if it is actively communicating with the mobile node, and
    then send their packets for the mobile node directly to the LCoA, bypassing the
    local mobility agent. This route optimization scheme will result in more efficient
    localized mobility management. It alleviates the local mobility agent's loads
    and takes the nearly same handoff delay time as the one in localized mobility
    management based on IPv6.</p>"
