abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Domain Name System (DNS) specifications lack some clarity
    in their description of the process by which individual sections of a DNS message
    are constructed. This document updates RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 to provide a clearer
    specification, consistent with deployed implementations.</p>"
