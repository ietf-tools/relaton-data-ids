abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI), called as the MCAST-6PE NLRI. The MCAST-6PE NLRI is used to interconnect
    IPv6 C-Multicast islands over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-enabled IPv4
    cloud. This approach relies on IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE), which can exchange
    the IPv6 C-Multicast reachability information transparently over the core using
    the Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4. This document describes
    the BGP encodings and procedures for exchanging the information elements required
    by IPv6 Multicast in 6PE. MPLS- based Service Providers may use the 6PE Multicast
    mechanism to provide IPv6 Multicast service for customers.</p>"
