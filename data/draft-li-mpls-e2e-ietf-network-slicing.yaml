abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance
    requirement of different services or customers in a shared network. An IETF network
    slice may span multiple network domains. And in the context of 5G, the 5G end-to-end
    network slices consist of three major types of network segments: Radio Access
    Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core Network (CN). In order to facilitate
    the mapping between network slices in different network segments and network domains,
    it is beneficial to carry the identifiers of the 5G end-to-end network slice,
    the multi- domain IETF network slice together with the intra-domain network slice
    identifier in the data packet. This document defines the mechanism of encapsulating
    the end-to-end network slice related identifiers in MPLS data plane.</p>"
