abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML format
    for presence information. The optional contact element in PIDF contains a URI
    that ultimately resolves to a network interface on some device. Currently, the
    ways of expressing features related to that interface are limited. PIDFConn defines
    an extension to PIDF for describing features of connectivities and the cost of
    using services.</p>"
