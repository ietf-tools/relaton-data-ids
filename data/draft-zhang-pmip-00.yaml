abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number of Mobile IP users grow so will the signaling overhead
    on the core IP network in support of mobility management. In cellular networks
    registration and paging techniques are used to minimize the signaling overhead
    and optimize the mobility management performance. Currently, Mobile IP supports
    registration but not paging. We believe that Mobile IP support for paging is important
    to improve the scalability of Mobile IP networks. Recently, a number of micro-
    mobility protocols [8] have been proposed that have built-in paging functions.
    These micro-mobility protocols are independent of the base Mobile IP protocol
    and interwork with Mobile IP [2] through mobile gateways. We take a different
    approach and propose a minimal set of paging extensions to the base Mobile IP
    called P-MIP. P-MIP is designed to reduce signaling load in the core Internet
    and power consumption of mobile nodes. In this draft, P-MIP, which assumes the
    use of foreign agents, is described and the construction of paging areas, movement
    detection, registration, paging and data handling are presented.</p>"
