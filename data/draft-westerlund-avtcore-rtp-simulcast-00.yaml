abstract:
- content: "<p>In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media streams
    derived from the same media source. This is called Simulcast. This document discusses
    the best way of accomplishing this in RTP. It is concluded that a session based
    solution provides best support for simulcast, and a solution for that is defined.
    There are two necessary extensions. The first extension is how to group RTP sessions
    belonging to the same simulcast source using the grouping framework, and the second
    is how to identify which SSRCs that are the same media source by using a new RTCP
    SDES item SRCNAME.</p>"
