abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution is becoming pervasive
    for Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) services in data center (DC) networks
    and as the next generation VPN services in service provider (SP) networks. As
    service providers transform their networks in their COs toward next generation
    data center with Software Defined Networking (SDN) based fabric and Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV), they want to be able to maintain their offered services
    including multicast VPN (MVPN) service between their existing network and their
    new SPDC network seamlessly without the use of gateway devices. They want to have
    such seamless interoperability between their new SPDCs and their existing networks
    for a) reducing cost, b) having optimum forwarding, and c) reducing provisioning.
    This document describes a unified solution based on RFC 6513 for seamless interoperability
    of multicast VPN between EVPN and MVPN PEs. Furthermore, it describes how the
    proposed solution can be used as a routed multicast solution in data centers with
    EVPN-IRB PEs per [EVPN-IRB].</p>"
