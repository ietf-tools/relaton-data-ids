abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP [DHCP] can be used to automate the process of configuring TCP/IP
    host computers. However, some of the DHCP options carry IP addresses rather than
    Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN). Use of IP addresses constrains the DHCP client
    to use the addresses that were in use at the time the client received its configuration
    information; these addresses may change over time, (e.g., a server may be assigned
    a new IP address), so that the IP addresses used by the client may become invalid.
    An alternative to passing IP addresses is to pass FQDNs instead of (numeric) IP
    addresses. Doing this allows a client to defer binding between a particular network
    entity (e.g., a server) and its IP address until run time. As stated in [Carpenter:96],
    'Deferring the binding avoids the risk of changed mapping between IP addresses
    and specific network entities (due to changing addressing information). Moreover,
    reliance on FQDNs (rather than IP addresses) also localizes to the DNS the changes
    needed to deal with changing addressing information due to renumbering.' This
    document defines a new DHCP option that allows the use of FQDNs instead of IP
    addresses in DHCP options.</p>"
