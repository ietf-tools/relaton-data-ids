abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lays out a set of requirements related to integrity protection
    over the headers for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). While mechanism such
    as SIP-Identity and S/MIME may be used to provide integrity protection between
    the end-points, it can not provide integrity protections over some of the headers
    which may benefit from having an integrity protection.</p>"
