abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of document metadata, RFCs can reference existing RFC that
    they update or obsolete. While obsoleting is well-understood (replace the obsoleted
    RFC in its entirety), updating has more nuances because the updated RFC remains
    valid. This document contains some clarifications about how to handle updating
    in a way that makes it easier for readers to understand how the original and the
    updating RFC relate. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed on the wgchairs
    mailing list [1]. Online access to all versions and files is available on github
    [2].</p>"
