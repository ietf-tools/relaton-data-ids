abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enumerates different types of route leaks based on observed
    events on the Internet. It illustrates how BGPSEC in its current form (as described
    in draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol-09) already provides protection against all
    but one of these route-leaks scenarios. The document further discusses a design
    enhancement to the BGPSEC protocol that will extend protection against this one
    remaining type of route-leak attack as well. With the inclusion of this enhancement,
    BGPSEC is expected to provide protection against all types of route-leaks. The
    document also includes a stopgap method for detection and mitigation of route
    leaks for the phase when BGPSEC (path validation) is not yet deployed but only
    origin validation is deployed.</p>"
