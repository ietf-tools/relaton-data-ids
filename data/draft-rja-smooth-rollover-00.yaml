abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some existing deployed operational practices
    that are in use to provide smooth key rollover for IETF interior routing protocols
    (e.g. IS-IS, OSPFv2, RIPv2). This is intended for eventual publication as an Informational
    RFC on the Independent Submission track, not via the IETF track.</p>"
