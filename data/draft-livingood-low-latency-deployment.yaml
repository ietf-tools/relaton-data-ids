abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's Transport and Services Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized
    experimental RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and new
    Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior. These documents describe a new architecture
    and protocol for deploying low latency networking. Since deployment decisions
    are left to implementers, this document explores the potential implications of
    those decisions and makes recommendations that can help drive adoption and acceptance
    of L4S and NQB.</p>"
