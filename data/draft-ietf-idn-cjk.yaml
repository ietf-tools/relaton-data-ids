abstract:
- content: "<p>During the development of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), it is
    discovered that there is a substantial lack of information and misunderstanding
    on Han ideographs and its folding mechanism. This document attempts to address
    some of the issues on doing han folding with respect to IDN. Hopefully, this will
    dispel some of the common misunderstanding of this problem and to discuss some
    of the issues with han ideograph and its folding mechanism. This document addresses
    very specific problem to IDN and thus is not meant as a reference for generic
    Han folding. Generic Han folding are much more complicated and certainly beyond
    this document. However, the use of this document may be applicable to other areas
    that are related with names, e.g. Common Name Resolution Protocol [CNRP].</p>"
