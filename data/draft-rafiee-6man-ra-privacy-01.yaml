abstract:
- content: "<p>Privacy is an important issue for many governments [eurolaw] and users
    where its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes might change their
    IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked by attackers and which
    also results in the prevention of information being leaked from their nodes. In
    IPv6 networks there is currently one solution for maintaining privacy for nodes
    when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4662) is used. Unfortunately
    this solution, i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC 4941), has some problems, such as
    not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix. The
    RFC also gives no explanation as to how to use CGA in its randomizing solution.
    The purpose of this document is to address these issues and to update the current
    RFC.</p>"
