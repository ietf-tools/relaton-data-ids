abstract:
- content: "<p>Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on environments
    covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.). There is minimal documentation
    on GMPLS support of Layer-2 Label Switched Paths (L2 LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet
    LSPs, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. This document
    details GMPLS capabilities for supporting L2 LSPs in several network environments
    including overlays. As such, it provides a reference detailing the applicability
    of GMPLS for Layer- 2 switching environments in support of various deployment
    scenarios, including the integrated (e.g. multi LSP-region networks), the augmented/peer
    and the overlay model (e.g. Generalized VPN (GVPN) and user-network interfaces
    (GMPLS UNI)).</p>"
