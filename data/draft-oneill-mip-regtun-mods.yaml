abstract:
- content: "<p>Regional Registration modifies the normal MIP Registration signalling
    back to the HA so that the signalling can traverse an intermediate Gateway Foreign
    Agent (GFA). The registered binding is between the Home Address (HoA) and the
    GFA Care-of Address (GFA-CoA) in the Home Agent (HA), and between the GFA-CoA
    and the Foreign Agent (FA-CoA) in the GFA. Two extensions are defined to support
    this new Registration processing these being the Hierarchical Foreign Agent extension
    (HFAext) and the GFA IP address extension (GFAIPext). The former is used to carry
    the FA CoA to the GFA and the latter is used by the FA to allocate a GFA to the
    MN, and by the FA, GFA, HA to securely return the GFA IP address to the MN. The
    present processing rules for the HA registration enable the FA to advertise the
    GFA to the MN in a Foreign Agent Advertisement (FAA) and for the MN to include
    that GFA address into the CoA field of the MIP me Registration. This however assumes
    a number of things about the GFA address in the FAA and the addressing realms
    between the FA-GFA and GFA- HA.. Specifically, the GFA CoA and the GFA IP address
    must potentially be from two different addressing plans and hence cannot be in
    the same FAA. This draft describes the issues and suggests a solution that requires
    slight modifications to the required extensions, that generalises the Home Registration
    signalling for arbitrary intermediate MIP nodes, and only slightly modifies the
    processing rules for the MIP Home Registration. This draft also describes a way
    to support dynamic HA allocation along-side Regional Registrations.</p>"
