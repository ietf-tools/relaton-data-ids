abstract:
- content: "<p>When an OSPF router undergoes restart, previous instances of LSAs belonging
    to that router may remain in the databases of other routers in the OSPF domain
    until such LSAs are aged out. Hence, when the restarting router joins the network
    again, neighboring routers re- establish adjacencies while the restarting router
    is still bringing- up its interfaces and adjacencies and generates LSAs with sequence
    numbers that may be lower than the stale LSAs. Such stale LSAs may be interpreted
    as bi-directional connectivity before the initial database exchanges are finished
    and genuine bi-directional LSA connectivity exists. Such incorrect interpretation
    may lead to, among other things, transient traffic packet drops. This document
    suggests improvements in the OSPF database exchange process to prevent such problems
    due to stale LSA utilization. The solution does not preclude changes in the existing
    standard but presents an extension that will prevent this scenario.</p>"
