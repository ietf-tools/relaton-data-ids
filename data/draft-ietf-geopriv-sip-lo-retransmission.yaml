abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores an ambiguity in the interpretation of the &lt;retransmission-allowed&gt;
    element of the Presence Information Data Format for Location Objects (PIDF-LO)
    in cases where PIDF-LO is conveyed by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It
    provides recommendations for how the SIP location conveyance mechanism should
    adapt to this ambiguity. Documents standardizing the SIP location conveyance mechanisms
    will be Standards-Track documents processed according to the usual SIP process.
    This document is intended primarily to provide the SIP working group with a statement
    of the consensus of the GEOPRIV working group on this topic. It secondarily provides
    tutorial information on the problem space for the general reader. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
