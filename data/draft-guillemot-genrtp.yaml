abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a payload format, which can be used for the
    transport of both MPEG-4 Elementary Streams (ES) as well as MPEG-4 Sync Layer
    packet streams, in RTP [1] packets. The payload format allows for protection against
    loss in a generic way, through frag- mentation, grouping and extension data mechanisms,
    which can dynamically adapt to network conditions. These mechanisms can operate
    both on full and partial MPEG-4 Access Units, such as Sync Layer packets, or typed
    segments, These mechanisms can cover a broad range of protection schemes and avoid
    extra connection management complexity - e.g. for separate FEC channels - in MPEG-4
    applications with a high number of streams.</p>"
