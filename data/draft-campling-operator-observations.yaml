abstract:
- content: "<p>The following document includes observations regarding a variety of
    implementations of recursive DNS capabilities that are important to network operators
    in terms of delivering DNS services to their (several tens of millions of) customers.
    It highlights some of the challenges that need to be addressed to allow the widespread
    adoption of encrypted DNS by the end-users of network operators. The information
    is intended to aid the development of discovery mechanisms for protocols such
    as DNS-over-HTTPS. It clearly defines problems that need technical solutions to
    allow the deployment of encrypted DNS by the largest number of operators to the
    largest number of users in the shortest possible timeframe with little or no disruption
    to the user experience.</p>"
