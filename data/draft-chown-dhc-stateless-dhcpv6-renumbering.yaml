abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able to automatically
    configure their IPv6 address and default router settings. However, further settings
    are not available. If such hosts wish to automatically configure their DNS, NTP
    or other specific settings the stateless variant of the Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used. This combination of Stateless Address
    Autoconfiguration and stateless DHCPv6 could be used quite commonly in IPv6 networks.
    However, hosts using such a combination currently have no means by which to be
    informed of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings, e.g. the addition of
    a new NTP server address, changes in DNS search paths, or full site renumbering.
    This document is presented as a problem statement from which a solution should
    be proposed in a subsequent document.</p>"
