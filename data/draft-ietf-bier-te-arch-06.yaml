abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces per-packet stateless strict and loose path engineered
    replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication packets (RFC8279).
    This is called BIER-TE. BIER-TE leverages RFC8279 and extends it with a new semantic
    for bits in the bitstring. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little
    or no changes. In BIER, the BitPositions (BP) of the packets bitstring indicate
    BIER Forwarding Egress Routers (BFER), and hop-by-hop forwarding uses a Routing
    Underlay such as an IGP. In BIER-TE, BitPositions indicate adjacencies. The BIFT
    of each BFR are only populated with BPs that are adjacent to the BFR in the BIER-
    TE topology. The BIER-TE topology can consist of layer 2 or remote (route) adjacencies.
    The BFR then replicates and forwards BIER packets to those adjacencies. This results
    in the aforementioned strict and loose path forwarding. BIER-TE can co-exist with
    BIER forwarding in the same domain, for example by using separate sub-domains.
    In the absence of routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing
    underlay, and can then be operated without requiring an IGP routing protocol.
    BIER-TE operates without explicit in-network tree-building and carries the multicast
    distribution tree in the packet header. It can therefore be a good fit to support
    multicast path steering in Segment Routing (SR) networks.</p>"
