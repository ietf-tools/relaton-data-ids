abstract:
- content: <p>The HTML format for RFCs assigns style guidance to a Cascading Style
    Sheet (CSS) specifically defined for the RFC Series. The embedded, default CSS
    as included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility needs
    and to be built along a responsive design model. This document describes the requirements
    for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor. The class names are based on the classes
    defined in "HTML for RFCs" (RFC 7992).</p>
