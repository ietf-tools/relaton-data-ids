abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently IPsec mobility is the purpose of MOBIKE [RFC4555] which is
    the IKEv2 multihoming and mobility extension. More specifically, MOBIKE mobility
    support provides the ability to change the outer IP address of a tunnel mode Security
    Association. On the other hand MOBIKE multihoming support provides the ability
    of a peer to inform its correspondent that alternate IP addresses may be used
    if the current IP address does not work any more. This draft presents requirements
    to extend mobility and multihoming facilities. This includes the use of simultaneous
    IP addresses as well as other IPsec mode like transport mode.</p>"
