abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers the applicability of Deterministic Networking
    (DetNet) mapping with network slice in the context of IP/MPLS network. It identifies
    the mapping requirements and YANG data models being defined by the IETF to support
    the deployment. Existing data models are identified for deterministic networking,
    this document outlines the applicability of DetNet for network slicing. It also
    identifies the features for necessity of mapping network slicing with DetNet and
    indicates where the DetNet YANG might be extended.</p>"
