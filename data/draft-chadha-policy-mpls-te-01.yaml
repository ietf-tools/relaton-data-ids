abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to describe an information model for representing
    MPLS traffic engineering policies. RFC 2702, 'Requirements for Traffic Engineering
    over MPLS', is used as a basis for determining the types of information that need
    to be represented in such an information model. The latter document describes
    the functional capabilities required to implement policies that facilitate efficient
    and reliable network operations in an MPLS domain. The information model described
    in this draft attempts to capture the information required to enable the functional
    capabilities described in RFC 2702. This information model could be used by a
    management system to optimize network performance through the necessary network
    provisioning actions. An overview of policy-based management is given in this
    document, along with a description of the relationship of this work to other information
    models that are being defined in the IETF Policy Framework working group. This
    is followed by a detailed description of the information model, and a number of
    examples illustrating its use.</p>"
