abstract:
- content: "<p>Over time, the routing protocols have been burdended with the responsiblity
    of carrying a variety of information that is not directly relevant to their mission.
    This includes VPN parameters, configuration information, and capability data.
    All of the additional data impacts the performance and stability of the routing
    protocols negatively. This has been convenient since the backbone of a routing
    protocol is a small distributed database of routing information. Any service needing
    a distributed database has considered injecting its data into a routing protocol
    so that it can leverage the protocols database service. Architecturally, this
    is a mistake that puts the protocol at risk from undue complexity and overhead.
    To avoid this, DROID is a subsystem that is tangential to, but independent of
    the routing protocols, and provides distributed database services for other routing
    services. It is based on the publish-subscribe (pub/sub) architecture and is intentionally
    crafted to be an open mechanism for the transport of ancillary data.</p>"
