abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards
    track within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the level of vendor
    support and deployment has been relatively slow, despite the demand for technologies
    offering services with different levels of quality of service to their customers.
    This memo seeks to initiate a dialog about the design of a new version of RSVPv1,
    called RSVPv2, that meet the requirements formulated by IETF NSIS working group.
    It also outlines the motivation for using RSVP2 as 'next step in signaling'. The
    RSVPv2 framework uses the layer-split architecture separating signaling application
    and transport functions. This concept was adopted by NSIS WG and the two layers
    are called NSLP NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) and NSIS Transport Layer
    Protocol (NTLP). This draft provides design guidelines and specifications for
    the development of the RSVPv2 NSLP part. RSVP2-NSLP offers increased modularity
    and contains less mandatory objects compared to RSVPv1, which allow lightweight
    implementation and flexible application. The new protocol is extended with PHR
    and PDR objects that makes it possible to use the protocol in different part of
    multi-domain networks and use the protocol in DiffServ environment.</p>"
