abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic elliptic-curve signatures such as deterministic ECDSA
    and EdDSA have gained popularity over randomized ECDSA as their security do not
    depend on a source of high-quality randomness. Recent research has however found
    that implementations of these signature algorithms may be vulnerable to certain
    side-channel and fault injection attacks due to their determinism. One countermeasure
    to such attacks is to re-add randomness to the otherwise deterministic calculation
    of the per-message secret number. This document updates RFC 6979 and RFC 8032
    to recommend constructions with additional randomness for deployments where side-channel
    attacks and fault injection attacks are a concern. The updates are invisible to
    the validator of the signature and compatible with existing ECDSA and EdDSA validators.</p>"
