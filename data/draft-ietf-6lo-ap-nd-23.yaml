abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
    Network (6LoWPAN) Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol defined in RFCs 6775 and 8505.
    The new extension is called Address-Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND), and
    it protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks
    in a Low-Power and Lossy Network (LLN). Nodes supporting this extension compute
    a cryptographic identifier (Crypto-ID), and use it with one or more of their Registered
    Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can
    be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses. Once an address
    is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof of ownership is provided, only the
    owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing
    Source Address Validation.</p>"
