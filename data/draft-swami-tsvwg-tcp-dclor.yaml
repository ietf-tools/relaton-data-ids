abstract:
- content: "<p>A spurious timeout in TCP forces the sender to unnecessarily retransmit
    one complete congestion window of data into the network. In addition, the congestion
    state of the network could change substantially after a spurious timeout. In this
    draft we propose a conservative congestion response algorithm afert spurious timeout
    that takes network state into account.</p>"
