abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node
    can steer a packet on a specific path by prepending the packet with an SR header.
    In the framework of traffic-engineering use cases, a customer may request its
    service provider to implement some non protected paths. This means that in case
    of a failure within the network, fast-reroute (or similar) techniques should not
    be activated for those paths. This document analyzes the different options to
    implement a non protected path with Segment Routing and in a future release will
    provide a recommandation on the best option.</p>"
