abstract:
- content: "<p>In DNA for movement either within a subnet or to different network,
    various latencies are happened on network devices both host and router. This document
    tries to analyze what latencies are possible when performing DNA operations. This
    statement is targeted to Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) as well as to Mobile
    IPv6.</p>"
