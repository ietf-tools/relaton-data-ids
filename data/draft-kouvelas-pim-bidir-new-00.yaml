abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a new form of Bi-directional PIM, a variant
    of PIM Sparse Mode [1] that builds bi-directional shared trees con- necting multicast
    sources and receivers. The ideas presented in this document are similar to those
    described in [2]. The main difference between the two proposals is in the method
    used to forward packets traveling upstream from a source to the RP. In particular
    [2] uses an IP option (UMP option) on data packets to assist with upstream forwarding.
    The UMP option identifies the next hop router responsible for forwarding the packet
    upstream. In contrast, this proposal does not alter data packets to embed con-
    trol information. Instead the identification of the next hop upstream forwarder
    is performed at RP discovery time using a fail-safe elec- tion mechanism. This
    significantly simplifies forwarding procedures and eliminates forwarding loops
    and packet duplication problems that exist in [2].</p>"
