abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of IPv6 addresses by large organizations doesn't fit the commonly
    used PA/PI dichotomy. Such organizations may hold a large address block which
    is deaggregated into subprefixes that are advertised by subunits of the organization.
    This document proposes a set of best practices to allow this deaggregation to
    be controlled through filtering so that on the one hand, the size of the IPv6
    global routing table isn't unduly inflated, while on the other hand organizations
    that seek to deaggregate a large IPv6 address block don't see their reachability
    limited by remote filters.</p>"
