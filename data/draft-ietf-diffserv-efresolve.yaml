abstract:
- content: "<p>For historical interest, this document captures the EF Design Team's
    proposed solution, preferred by the original authors of RFC 2598 but not adopted
    by the working group in December 2000. The original definition of EF was based
    on comparison of forwarding on an unloaded network. This experimental Delay Bound
    (DB) PHB requires a bound on the delay of packets due to other traffic in the
    network. At the Pittsburgh IETF meeting in August 2000, the Differentiated Services
    working group faced serious questions regarding RFC 2598 - the group's standards
    track definition of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Per Hop Behavior (PHB). An 'EF
    Design Team' volunteered to develop a re-expression of RFC 2598, bearing in mind
    the issues raised in the DiffServ group. At the San Diego IETF meeting in December
    2000 the DiffServ working group decided to pursue an alternative re-expression
    of the EF PHB. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
