abstract:
- content: "<p>A RFC was accepted extending TLS usage to include OpenPGP keys (RFC
    5081) as an alternative or in addition to X.509 certificates, however the author
    did not really standardise the way the information in OpenPGP keys was to be presented
    and this could be detrimental or fragment efforts to utilise OpenPGP keys in this
    manner. The author didn't touch on the issue generating confidence scores beyond
    potential use of Certificate Authorities.</p>"
