abstract:
- content: '<p>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes:
    threshold marking and excess traffic marking. Threshold marking marks all PCN-packets
    if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a first configured rate. Excess traffic
    marking marks a proportion of PCN- packets, such that the amount marked equals
    the traffic rate in excess of a second configured rate.Requirements Language The
    key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>'
