abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of a SIP-based Distributed Call
    Signaling (DCS) architecture to support carrier class packet-based voice, video,
    and other real time multimedia services. Companion documents address a specific
    set of SIP 2.0 protocol extensions and usage rules that are necessary to implement
    the DCS architecture in an interoperable fashion. The DCS architecture takes advantage
    of endpoint intelligence in supporting telephony services without sacrificing
    the network's ability to provide value through mechanisms such as resource management,
    lookup of directory information and translation databases, routing services, security,
    and privacy enforcement. At the same time, the architecture provides flexibility
    to allow evolution in the services that may be provided by endpoints and the network.
    DCS also takes into account the need to manage access to network resources and
    account for resource usage. The SIP usage rules defined in the accompanying IDs
    specifically address the coordination between Distributed Call Signaling and dynamic
    quality of service control mechanisms for managing resources over the access network.
    In addition, the DCS architecture defines the interaction needed between network
    provided call controllers, known as a 'DCS- proxy' for supporting these services.</p>"
