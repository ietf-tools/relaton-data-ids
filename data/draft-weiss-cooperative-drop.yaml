abstract:
- content: "<p>The current state of the Internet only supports a single class of service.
    To further the success of the Internet, new capabilities must be deployed which
    allow for deterministic end to end behavior irrespective of location or the number
    of domains along the path. Experience with existing signaling based protocols
    have proven diffi- cult to deploy due to technical and economic factors. This
    document proposes using in-band frame marking to support a diverse set of ser-
    vices. In addition, the mechanisms described here will provide end users and/or
    enterprise backbones with new capabilities such as ser- vice validation, congestion
    localization, and uniform service irrespective of the type of service contract.
    For ISPs this document proposes mechanisms providing more available bandwidth
    by creating strong incentives for adaptive behavior in applications as well as
    mechanisms for providing both sender based and receiver based service contracts.</p>"
