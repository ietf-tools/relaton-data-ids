abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport Protocol
    (DMTP) concept as an extension to the Multipath Extension for QUIC (QUIC-MULTIPATH)
    as well as QUIC itself. This extension aims to support data streams with strict
    latency requirements by enabling the signaling of a stream's deadline and ideally
    by combining multipath scheduling, congestion control adaptations, and optional
    forward error correction (FEC). Moreover, DMTP leverages the path identifiers
    introduced by the Multipath Extension for QUIC to distinguish different end-to-end
    paths as they may be offered in a Path Aware Network (PAN) such as SCION. This
    allows an application to select its preferred paths while maintaining interoperability
    with standard endpoints using the Multipath Extension for QUIC. In combination,
    DMTP enables endpoints to exchange and schedule deadline-aware streams across
    multiple network paths. Additionally, this proposal also maintains compatibility
    with QUIC itself, in order to deliver its benefits - albeit with limited effectiveness
    - even in scenarios where only a single path can or should be used.</p>"
