abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
    to implement performance measurement on every member link of a Link Aggregation
    Group (LAG). Knowing the measured metrics of each member link of a LAG enables
    operators to enforce a performance based traffic steering policy across the member
    links.</p>"
