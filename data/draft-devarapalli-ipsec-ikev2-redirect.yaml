abstract:
- content: "<p>IKEv2 is a popular protocol for setting up VPN tunnels from a remote
    location to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services in the network
    behind the gateway. Currently there is no standard mechanism specified that allows
    an overloaded VPN gateway to re- direct the VPN client to attach to another gateway.
    This document proposes a re-direct mechanism for IKEv2. The proposed mechanism
    can also be used for Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to re-direct the mobile
    node to another home agent.</p>"
