abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines mechanisms for providing all IP address resource
    records (specifically including any A and AAAA resource records) in DNS response
    messages. Specifically, this document defines an 'ADDR' query-type which allows
    a system to issue a single lookup for all of the addressing resource records associated
    with a domain name (explicitly including any IPv4 and IPv6 resource records),
    and also defines an algorithm for DNS servers to use when returning supplemental
    address data in the additional-data section of a response message.</p>"
