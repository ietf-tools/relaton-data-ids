abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Commerce Messaging Protocol (SCMP) is a general-purpose
    electronic commerce message protocol for secure, real-time communication of a
    set of data from a sending agent's application to a receiving agent's server.
    Additionally the response by the receiving agent's server to the sending agent
    is the reply from the request represented by the set of data in the message's
    payload. The intent of this protocol is to define a method where trading partners
    can perform on-line business requests in an environment where the sending partner
    is fully authenticated, and the message cannot be repudiated.</p>"
