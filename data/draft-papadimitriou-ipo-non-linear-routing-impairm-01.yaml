abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, in transparent optical networks, the increasing bit-rate (10
    Gbit/s and up to 40 Gbit/s in the future), combined with the increasing number
    of wavelengths (16 and higher up to 320) and a narrowing of the channels spacing,
    enhance the impact of non-linear effects on optical signal quality.</p>"
