abstract:
- content: "<p>EVPN is being actively used to provide tenant inter-subnet-forwarding
    in DC networks, as described in [IP-PREFIX] and [INTER-SUBNET]. When those tenant
    networks are interconnected to vpn-ipv4/vpn-ipv6 or ipv4/ipv6 BGP networks, there
    is a need for the EVPN BGP Path Attributes to be seamlessly propagated so that
    the receiver PE or NVE can consider the original EVPN Attributes in its path calculations.
    This document analyses the use-cases, requirements and rules based on which the
    BGP Path Attributes should be propagated between EVPN and other BGP families.</p>"
