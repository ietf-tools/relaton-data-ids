abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides illustrations of the use of ENUM [2] functionality
    within the larger context of service-level call flows for Voice over IP communication
    where interworking between the PSTN and IP-based networks are necessary to complete
    a call. Details are presented for simple calls made on a 'direct dial' basis.
    Some details are also provided for calls made using the ITU-defined 'Global Services'
    [3,4,5]. The impact of number portability within the call scenarios is discussed.
    The objective of this document is to identify areas where gaps exist in the provision
    of services and suggest where protocol extensions for ENUM, SIP, TRIP, etc. are
    needed.</p>"
