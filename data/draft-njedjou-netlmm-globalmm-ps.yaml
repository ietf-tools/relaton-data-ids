abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem of global IP mobility management
    in a context where some mobile operators and service providers are looking for
    adequate solutions to the inter-system IP mobility problem. The document addresses
    the specific issue of moving between IP access domains that use different mobility
    management protocols and mechanisms. Indeed this type of movement would be an
    important subset of global IP mobility scenarios.</p>"
