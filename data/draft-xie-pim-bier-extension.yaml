abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture that provides
    optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate routers to maintain
    any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific BIER header. PIM is a well-known
    multicast-specific routing protocol which is widely deployed either in a VRF context
    or in a Non-VRF context. This document describes PIM extensions to signal a P2MP
    Tree with BIER information, which is called a P2MP based BIER in [I.D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].
    PIM is required to alloc Label to build a P2MP tree hop-by-hop, and build a P2MP
    based BIER forwarding table further. This requires a BitMask being carried as
    a PIM Join Attribute by downstream node to upstream node hop-by-hop, and the behavior
    is like precedures as specified in [RFC6807].</p>"
