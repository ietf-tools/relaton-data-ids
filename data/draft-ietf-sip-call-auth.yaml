abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need for QoS and media authorization and
    defines a SIP extension that can be used to integrate QoS admission control with
    call signaling and help guard against denial of service attacks. The use of this
    extension is only applicable in administrative domains, or among federations of
    administrative domains with previously agreed-upon policies, where both the SIP
    proxy authorizing the QoS, and the policy control of the underlying network providing
    the QoS belong to that administrative domain or federation of domains.</p>"
