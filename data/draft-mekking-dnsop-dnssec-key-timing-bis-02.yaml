abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes issues surrounding the timing of events related
    to DNSSEC policy. It presents timelines for various key rollovers and DNSSEC policy
    changes regarding the key signing scheme. It explicitly identifies the relationships
    between the various parameters affecting the rollover process. This document updates
    [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing] [MM: If approved] as it covers timelines
    for key rollovers in more detail and it covers additional key rollover scenarios,
    including algorithm rollover and single type key rollovers.</p>"
