abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the security framework for the Instant Messaging
    and Presence Protocols. It identifies the entities that use IMPP protocol elements,
    the trust relationships between them, security threats that are against which
    defence is to be provided, and the consequent security responsibilities of the
    active entities. Specific cryptographic and other security mechanisms are NOT
    defined here. NOTE: The security framework for IMPP is inherently bound up with
    the IMPP protocol design, and this memo is expected to evolve as decisions are
    made about the protocol design. In its current form, this memo makes some assumptions
    about the IMPP structure that must be reviewed as design proceeds.</p>"
