abstract:
- content: "<p>Microsoft Windows 2000 includes operating system specific data in the
    Kerberos V5 authorization data field that is used for access control. This data
    is used to create an NT access token. The access token is used by the system to
    enforce access checking when attempting to access objects. This document describes
    the structure of the Windows 2000 specific authorization data that is carried
    in that field for use by servers in performing access control.</p>"
