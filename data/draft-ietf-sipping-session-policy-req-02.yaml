abstract:
- content: "<p>The proxy server plays a central role as an intermediary in the establishment
    of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In that role, they can define
    and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call features. However,
    there is no standard means by which proxies can have any influence on session
    policies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc and non-conformant
    techniques have been deployed to allow for such policy mechanisms. There is a
    need for a standards-based and complete mechanism for session policies. This document
    defines a set of requirements for such a mechanism.</p>"
