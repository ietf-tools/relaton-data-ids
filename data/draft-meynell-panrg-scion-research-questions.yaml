abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft intends to summarize all SCION related questions which are
    deemed important to be answered for SCION to properly work at Internet scale.
    The set of questions is at the moment not comprehensive, but we intend them to
    initiate a discussion to determine which questions should remain here, and which
    ones are missing. When appropriate, some example solutions can be provided for
    the community to determine whether said solutions are adequate or not.</p>"
