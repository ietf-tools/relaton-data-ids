abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a Mobile IPv6 and RSVP interoperation scheme. In
    this scheme, the underlying mobility support mechanism is required to provide
    a unique flow identity regardless of node mobility, making the node mobility transparent
    to flow QoS handling mechanisms. Thus QoS signaling delay as well as data packet
    delays and losses during handoff can be reduced.</p>"
