abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this draft is to define a BGP-based auto- discovery mechanism
    for layer-1 VPNs. The auto-discovery mechanism for l1vpns allows the provider
    network devices to dynamically discover the set of PEs having ports attached to
    CEs member of the same VPN. That information is necessary for completing the signaling
    phase. One main objective of l1vpn auto-discovery mechanism is to support "single-end
    provisioning" model, where addition of a new port to a given l1vpn would involve
    configuration changes only on the PE that has this port and on the CE that is
    connected to the PE via this port.</p>
