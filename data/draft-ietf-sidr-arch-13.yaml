abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for an infrastructure to support
    improved security of Internet routing. The foundation of this architecture is
    a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) that represents the allocation hierarchy
    of IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers; and a distributed repository
    system for storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the RPKI,
    as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing security. As an
    initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate
    holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more
    ASes to originate routes to that address space. Such verifiable authorizations
    could be used, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
