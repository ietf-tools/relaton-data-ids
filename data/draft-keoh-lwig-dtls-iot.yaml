abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP-based Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the pervasive interaction
    of smart devices and people enabling new applications by means of IP protocols.
    Traditional IP protocols will be further complemented by 6LoWPAN and CoAP to make
    the IoT feasible on small devices. Security and privacy are a must for such an
    environment. Due to mobility, limited bandwidth, resource constraints, and new
    communication topologies, existing security solutions need to be adapted. We propose
    a security architecture for the IoT in order to provide network access control
    to smart devices, the management of keys and securing unicast/multicast communication.
    Devices are authenticated and granted network access by means of a pre-shared
    key (PSK) based security handshake protocol. The solution is based on Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS). Through the established secure channels, keying
    materials, operational and security parameters are distributed, enabling devices
    to derive session keys and group keys. The solution relies on the DTLS Record
    Layer for the protection of unicast and multicast data flows. We have prototyped
    and evaluated the security architecture. The DTLS architecture allows for easier
    interaction and interoperability with the Internet due to the extensive use of
    TLS. However, it exhibits performance issues constraining its deployment in some
    network topologies and hence would require further optimizations.</p>"
