abstract:
- content: "<p>During the original design of Mobile IP, the potential need for an
    administrative domain to be able to actively revoke a current Mobile IP registration
    was recognized. Due to the lack of a specific scenario requiring such a mechanism,
    it was decided that a passive mechanism, namely short registration lifetimes,
    and the denial of a subsequent registration from a MN, would be sufficient for
    this purpose.</p>"
