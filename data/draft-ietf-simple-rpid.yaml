abstract:
- content: "<p>The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format
    for representing presence information for a presentity. This format defines a
    textual note, an indication of availability (open or closed) and a Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for communication. The Rich Presence Information Data format
    (RPID) described here is an extension that adds optional elements to the Presence
    Information Data Format (PIDF). These extensions provide additional information
    about the presentity and its contacts. The information is designed so that much
    of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or user activity.
    This extension includes information about what the person is doing, a grouping
    identifier for a tuple, when a service or device was last used, the type of place
    a person is in, what media communications might remain private, the relationship
    of a service tuple to another presentity, the person's mood, the time zone it
    is located in, the type of service it offers, an icon reflecting the presentity's
    status, and the overall role of the presentity. These extensions include presence
    information for persons, services (tuples), and devices. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
