abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a modular metric calculation system termed Scored
    Fair Metric Calculation (SFMC). SFMC can be integrated with Link State and Distance
    Vector routing protocols and their extensions [1,4,5,6,7], enabling them to find
    network paths that support the highest possible number of best metrics across
    a network. SFMC makes it possible to support and mix large sets of heterogeneous
    network features and capabilities. SFMC solves many of the issues inherent in
    routing protocols that attempt to use complex sets of metrics by decoupling raw
    metric data from the input side of routing protocols. Unlike the past, SFMC regards
    all metrics all the time, while treating all metrics equally (by default). Additionally,
    the SFMC architecture provides a simple and flexible interface for extensive manipulation
    of path selection. Please send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.</p>"
