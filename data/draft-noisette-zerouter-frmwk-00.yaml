abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the operation of Zerouter mechanisms
    and protocols. It identifies the context in which the solutions specified within
    the Zerouter approach are likely to find their applicability. More precisely,
    it identifies the entities in a zerouter mesh and the interaction between zerouter
    entities and their environment.</p>"
