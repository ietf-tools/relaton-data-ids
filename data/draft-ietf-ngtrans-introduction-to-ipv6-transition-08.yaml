abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a guide to the introduction of IPv6 in the IPv4 based
    Internet or Intranets. Several general issues to start IPv6 networking in a predominantly
    IPv4 world are discussed, such as IPv6 addresses, IPv6 DNS and routing issues.
    Short descriptions are given of the different translation and migration tools
    and mechanisms that translate between IPv6 and IPv4 and/or tunnel IPv6 over IPv4.
    The remainder of this document describes how IPv6 can be introduced in various
    environments, such as ISPs, Internet Exchanges and end user environments. Suggestions
    are given on the use of the different translation and migration tools in each
    environment.</p>"
