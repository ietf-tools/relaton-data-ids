abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method to efficiently convey the differences
    between two certificates in an X.509 version 3 extension. This method allows a
    relying party to extract information sufficient to construct the paired certificate
    and perform certification path validation using the constructed certificate. In
    particular, this method is especially useful as part of a key or signature algorithm
    migration, where subjects may be issued multiple certificates containing different
    public keys or signed with different CA private keys or signature algorithms.
    This method does not require any changes to the certification path validation
    algorithm as described in RFC 5280. Additionally, this method does not violate
    the constraints of serial number uniqueness for certificates issued by a single
    certification authority.</p>"
