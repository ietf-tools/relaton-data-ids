    identifier in IP-based multimedia communication networks. This identifier would
    enable endpoints, intermediate devices, and management and monitoring systems
    to identify a session end-to-end, associate multiple endpoints with a given multipoint
    conference, track communication sessions when they are redirected, and associate
    one or more media flows with a given communication session.</p>"
