abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP is used to distribute a binding to a node. The binding includes
    a binding SID and a path represented by a list of SIDs. This document describes
    extensions to BGP for distributing the information about the binding to a protecting
    node. For an SR path via the node with the binding SID, when the node fails, the
    protecting node such as the upstream neighbor on the path uses the information
    to protect the binding SID of the failed node.</p>"
