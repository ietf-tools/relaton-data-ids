    was convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from 17 October 2022 to
    19 October 2022 as a three-day online meeting. The workshop was organized in three
    parts to discuss ways to improve network management techniques in support of even
    broader adoption of encryption on the Internet. This report summarizes the workshop's
    discussion and identifies topics that warrant future work and consideration. Note
    that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop. The views and
    positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and
