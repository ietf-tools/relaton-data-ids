- content: "<p>This document describes an abstract API that provides the minimal functionality
    required for a program to communicate effectively with peers and services on the
    network while running on a host that has more than one active network interface.
    This API is abstract: we describe the functionality that must be provided, not
    the bindings that should be used to provide that functionality. The functionality
    described here provides the building blocks from which higher-level APIs might
    be built, and is not intended to be used directly by typical applications.</p>"
