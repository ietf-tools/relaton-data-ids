abstract:
- content: "<p>The Message Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) does not allow privacy and
    topology hiding, such that MSRP users can hide the IP Address of their systems.
    This limitation is due to the fact that MSRP Path headers contain physical IP
    addresses. This document describes a mechanism which adds a level of indirection
    to allow privacy and topology hiding, to prevent remote parties and a man-in-the-middle
    from learning the IP Address and port information of the MSRP client. It also
    defines the option tag msrp-opaque, to indicate such support.</p>"
