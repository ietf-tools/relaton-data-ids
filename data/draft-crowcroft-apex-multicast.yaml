abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a memo that presents an approach to do application layer multicast.
    Our intention is to present a design that produces a tree distribution structure
    within the existing design structure of APEX and BEEP. It is not our intention
    to present a design that replaces multicast at the network layer. Where the need
    exists (and in scenarios where it would seem symbiotic), we would find it constructive
    to integrate the two technologies and perspective (i.e., application later and
    network layer multicast).</p>"
