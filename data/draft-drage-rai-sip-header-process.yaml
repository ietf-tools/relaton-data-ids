abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3427 currently defines the process for defining and registering
    new SIP header fields. This document proposes that prefixs to header field names
    should be discontinued, and that an additional category of experimental header
    field should be created. This document also relaxes the requirement that response
    codes are defined by standards track RFCs, also allowing them to be defined by
    experimental RFCs.</p>"
