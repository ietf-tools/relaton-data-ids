abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an optional ISIS extension that allows the
    creation of IS-IS flood reflection topologies. Flood reflection allows the creation
    of topologies where L1 areas provide transit forwarding for L2 destinations within
    an L2 topology. It accomplishes this by creating L2 flood reflection adjacencies
    within each L1 area. The L2 flood reflection adjacencies are used to flood L2
    LSPDUs, and they are used in the L2 SPF computation. However, they are not used
    for forwarding. This arrangement gives the L2 topology better scaling properties.
    In addition, only those routers directly participating in flood reflection have
    to support the feature. This allows for the incremental deployment of scalable
    L1 transit areas in an existing network, without the necessity of upgrading other
    routers in the network.</p>"
