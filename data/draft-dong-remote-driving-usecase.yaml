abstract:
- content: "<p>This document illustrates the use case of remote driving that leverages
    the human driver's advanced perceptual and cognitive skills to enhance autonomous
    driving when it is absent or falls short. Specifically the document analyzes the
    end-to-end latency that is required in the network to support collision avoidance
    in remote driving. The document also summarizes the other necessary requirements
    that the networking services shall support.</p>"
