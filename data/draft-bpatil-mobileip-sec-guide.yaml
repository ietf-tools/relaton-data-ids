abstract:
- content: "<p>The IP Security protocol is now well established and is being deployed
    in the global Internet. The security characteristics of IPSec can be used in Mobile
    IP networks to enable Mobile IP deployment on a wide area basis and in large networks.
    Mobile IP should leverage off of the developments of IP Security and Internet
    Key Exchange (IKE) rather than developing it's own security mechanisms. This draft
    proposes some concepts on how IP Security can be used to provide an alternative
    security framework for Mobile IP communications. It is intended to be an implementation
    guideline.</p>"
