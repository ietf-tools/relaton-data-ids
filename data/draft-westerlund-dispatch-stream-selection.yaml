abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how media stream selection can be achieved
    in both a conferencing scenario and peer to peer communication. To allow endpoints
    to select specific media streams, all available media in the session must be identifiable
    and there is a need for messages than can be securely transported between endpoints
    and network nodes. This document also describes a way to distribute the identification
    information to all participating endpoints. The necessary messages can potentially
    be mapped onto several different encodings, and this document proposes one mapping
    that uses an extended version of the Binary Floor Control Protocol.</p>"
