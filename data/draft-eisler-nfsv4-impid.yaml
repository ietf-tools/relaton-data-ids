abstract:
- content: "<p>NFSv4.0 has no method for allowing clients and servers to provide to
    each other their implementation identities. An implementation identity might contain
    the name of the software that embodies the NFSv4 client or server, and the version
    number of the software. This proposal describes how a future minor version of
    NFSv4.0 could allow clients and servers to exchange implementation identities.</p>"
