abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the work of Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures
    (BRSKI) by replacing the (stateful) TLS Circuit proxy between Pledge and Registrar
    with a stateless or stateful Circuit proxy using CoAP which is called the constrained
    Join Proxy. The constrained Join Proxy is a mesh neighbor of the Pledge and can
    relay a DTLS session originating from a Pledge with only link-local addresses
    to a Registrar which is not a mesh neighbor of the Pledge. Like the BRSKI Circuit
    proxy, this constrained Join Proxy eliminates the need of Pledges to have routeable
    IP addresses before enrolment by utilizing link-local addresses. Use of the constrained
    Join Proxy also eliminates the need of the Pledge to authenticate to the network
    or perform network-wide Registrar discover before enrolment.</p>"
