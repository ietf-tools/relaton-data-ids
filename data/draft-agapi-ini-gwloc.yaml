abstract:
- content: "<p>The development of IP to PSTN gateways has made it possible for users
    of the two disparate networks to place 'telephone' calls between the two networks
    with little effort. Users placing calls from an IP network to the PSTN network
    must choose a gateway to act as a bridge between the two networks. Selection of
    a gateway can be based on any number of criteria, such as price, codecs, version,
    billing, etc. In this draft we propose a gateway location service for this purpose.
    The gateway location service protocol is an instantiation of the Service Location
    Protocol that has been modified to run in a wide area network across many administrative
    domains.</p>"
