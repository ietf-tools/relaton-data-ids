abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion
    issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of the original
    IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for Easy IPv4), outlines the
    IPv4 public address pool expansion and the Internet system architecture enhancement
    considerations. The EzIP may expand an IPv4 address by a factor of 256M without
    affecting the existing IPv4 based Internet, nor the current private networks.
    The EzIP is in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only
    both direct and private network connectivities, but also their interoperability.
    The EzIP deployment may coexist with the current Internet traffic and the IoT
    (Internet of Things) operations without perturbing their setups, while offering
    end-users the freedom to choose either. If the IPv4 public pool allocations were
    allowed to be reorganized, the assignable pool could be multiplied by 512M times
    or even more. The EzIP may be implemented as a software / firmware enhancement
    to the Internet edge routers or private network routing gateways wherever needed,
    or simply installed as an inline adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling
    a seamless introduction. The 256M case detailed herein establishes a complete
    layer of routers for interfacing between the Internet core fabic and the end user
    premises. Incorporating the caching proxy technology in the gateway, a fairly
    large geographical area may deploy an EzIP based sub- Internet operating from
    as few as one ordinary IPv4 public address. This will immediately resolve the
    IPv4 address shortage anywhere, while transparent to the current Internet operation.
    Under the Dual- Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities will relieve
    the IPv4 address shortage issue, while affording the IPv6 more time to orderly
    reach the maturity and the availability levels required for delivering a long-term
    general service.</p>"
