abstract:
- content: "<p>The flooding algorithm is one of the most important parts of any link
    state routing protocol. It ensures that all routers within a link state domain
    converge on the same topological information within a finite period of time. To
    ensure reliability, typical implementations of the flooding algorithm send new
    information via all interfaces other than the one the new piece of information
    was received on. This redundancy is necessary to guarantee that flooding is performed
    reliably, but implies considerable overhead of utilized bandwidth and CPU time
    if neighboring routers are connected with more than one link. This document describes
    a method that reduces this overhead.</p>"
