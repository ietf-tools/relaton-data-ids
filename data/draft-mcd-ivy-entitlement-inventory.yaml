abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a YANG module for incorporating entitlements
    in a network inventory of entitlements. Entitlements define the rights for their
    holder to use specific feature(s) in a network element(s). The model is rooted
    by the concept of the capabilities offered by an element, enabled by the held
    entitlements, and considers entitlement scope, how they are assigned, and when
    they expire. The model introduces a descriptive definition of capabilities and
    the entitlement use restrictions, supporting entitlement administration and the
    understanding of the capabilities available through the network.</p>"
