abstract:
- content: "<p>The standardization of RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language)
    is imminent, and there is a user community eager to make use of the power- ful
    features it offers in the Routing Registry (IRR). Thus, a plan of action is needed
    to assure a successful transition from the RIPE-181 language currently employed
    to describe routing policies in the IRR to the more expressive RPSL. This document
    describes such a plan, which the authors believe can be used to bring about a
    successful transition in a timely fashion with a minimum of disruption to the
    IRR and its cur- rent role in Internet routing. This document will be modified
    to reflect the progress of the transition if appropriate.</p>"
