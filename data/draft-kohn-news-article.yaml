abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format of network news articles. Network
    news articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast to potentially large audiences,
    using a flooding algorithm that propagates one copy to each interested host (or
    group thereof), typically stores only one copy per host, and does not require
    any central administration or systematic registration of interested users. Network
    news originated as the medium of communication for Usenet, circa 1980. Since then
    Usenet has grown explosively, and many Internet sites participate in it. In addition,
    the news technology is now in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet
    and elsewhere. This document defines the format of network news articles in the
    context of the Internet Message Format, and adds Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    (MIME) support for multimedia and internationalized message bodies.</p>"
