abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to summarize current standardization efforts
    in the IETF ALTO working group to support important multi- domain use cases and
    show how they can benefit from network information exposure using ALTO. Besides,
    key design requirements of network information exposure to support multi-domain
    use cases are also presented along with information about novel mechanisms and
    abstractions to improve the base ALTO framework in multi-domain scenarios.</p>"
