abstract:
- content: "<p>Once a TCP connection is established, there are no mechanisms for dynamically
    rebinding the connection to new IP addresses or port numbers. During the lifetime
    of a TCP connection, a mobile host's transition between networks (and the corresponding
    change in its IP address) will break any established TCP connections. As a remedy,
    this document presents an extension of TCP with support for dynamic bindings of
    IP addresses and port numbers. Compatibility with existing TCP implementations
    is maintained, and reasonable steps are taken to prevent remote-redirction attacks.</p>"
