abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPv6 network grows, there will be more engineers and also non- engineers
    who will have the need to use an IPv6 address in text. While the IPv6 address
    architecture RFC 4291 section 2.2 depicts a flexible model for text representation
    of an IPv6 address, this flexibility has been causing problems for operators,
    system engineers, and customers. This document will describe the problems that
    a flexible text representation has been causing. This document also recommends
    a canonical representation format that best avoids confusion. It is expected that
    the canonical format is followed by humans and systems when generating an address
    to represent as text, but all implementations must accept any legitimate RFC4291
    format.</p>"
