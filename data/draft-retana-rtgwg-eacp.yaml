abstract:
- content: "<p>Energy is a primary constraint in large-scale network design, particularly
    in cloud-scale data center fabrics. While compute and storage clearly consume
    the largest amounts of energy in large-scale networks, the optics and electronics
    used in transporting data also contribute to energy usage and heat generation.
    This document provides an overview of various areas of concern in the interaction
    between network performance and efforts at energy aware control planes, as a guide
    for those working on modifying current control planes or designing new ones to
    improve the energy efficiency of high density, highly complex, network deployments.</p>"
