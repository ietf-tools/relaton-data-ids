abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec/ESP has been designed to secure IP packets exchanged between
    two nodes. IPsec implements security at the IP layer which makes security transparent
    to the applications, as opposed to TLS or DTLS that requires application to implement
    TLS/DTLS. As a result, IPsec enable to define the security rules in a similar
    way one establishes firewall rules. One of the IPsec's drawbacks is that implementing
    security on a per packet basis adds overhead to each IP packet. Considering IoT
    devices, the data transmitted over an IP packet is expected to be rather small,
    and the cost of sending extra bytes is so high that IPsec/ESP can hardly be used
    for IoT as it is currently defined in RFC 4303. This document defines Diet-ESP,
    a protocol that compress and reduce the ESP overhead of IPsec/ESP so that it can
    fit security and energy efficient IoT requirements. Diet-ESP use already existing
    mechanism like IKEv2 to negotiate the compression format. Furthermore a lot of
    information, already existing for an IPsec Security Association, are reused to
    offer light negotiation in addition to maximum compression.</p>"
