abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a general use Differentiated Services (DS) [Blake]
    Per-Hop-Behavior (PHB) Group called Dynamic RT/NRT (DRT) PHB Group. This PHB Group
    provides delivery of real-time and non-real- time IP traffic. DRT introduces two
    independently forwarded classes: a real-time (RT) class, and a non-real-time (NRT)
    class. Within each class an IP packet can be assigned one of six different levels
    of drop precedence. These levels have a relative order so that a single service
    (RT / NRT) is formed inside which the packet loss of lower levels does not have
    any significant effect on upper levels. This concept introduces dynamic RT and
    NRT services that allow the user to dynamically adjust the packet loss probability
    in response to the varying network load. A DS node does not re-order IP packets
    of the same microflow if they belong to the same DRT class. Recommended codepoints
    for this PHB Group are given.</p>"
