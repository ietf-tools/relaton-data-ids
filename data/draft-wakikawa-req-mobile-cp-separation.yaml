abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtualization and cloud services have evolved significantly in the
    last few years. Additionally trends in virtualization like Network Function Virtualiztion
    and Softward Defined Networking are bound to have implications to mobile network
    architectures of cellular systems (3G/4G), WiFi and others. IETF has developed
    a number of mobility protocols that are used in the industry today. Mobility network
    architectures continue to evolve and it is likely that they will embrace virtualization
    and cloud services trends as well. The IETF can play a role in defining the mobility
    protocols that support architectures which leverage virtualization and cloud technologies.
    This document captures several use cases and requirements for a virtualized mobile
    network architecture.</p>"
