abstract:
- content: <p>This Internet-Draft provides the description of problems faced by NFS
    and its various side band protocols, when implemented over IPv6 in various deployment
    scenarios. Solutions to the various problems are also given in the draft and are
    sought for approval. Foreword This "forward" section is an unnumbered section
    that is not included in the table of contents. It is primarily used for the IESG
    to make comments about the document. It can also be used for comments about the
    status of the document and sometimes is used for the RFC2119 requirements language
    statement.</p>
