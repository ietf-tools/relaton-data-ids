abstract:
- content: "<p>Decoupling functions from the industrial hardware enables diverse,
    migratable, cross-industry replicable applications to be deployed with flexibility
    at the edge and on the cloud. Users should be free to adjust their business policies
    in industrial IoT and with low cost. Therefore efficient and dynamic orchestration
    of the applications is critical. This document describes several use cases that
    demonstrate the applicability of Service Function Chaining in industrial edge
    computing to organize the applications and provides extra requirements to support
    this applicability.</p>"
