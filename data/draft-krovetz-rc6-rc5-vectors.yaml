- content: "<p>The RC6 and RC5 block ciphers are parameterized, allowing a variety
    of block sizes, key sizes, and security levels. This flexibility, along with simple
    implementations, make RC6 and RC5 attractive for many applications. This document
    supplies test vectors to aid in the development of compatible ciphers.</p>"
