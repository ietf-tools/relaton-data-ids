abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent
    Web IDentifiers for web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier.
    The main purpose of the standard is to support specification of references that
    are not covered by other reference techniques: to support references to material
    in web archives with restricted access. Furthermore, it supports persistent technology
    agnostic references to web archives in general, in a form that can work as an
    algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources in general. An additional
    important benefit is that the standard can be used for specifying web collections,
    which can then form a persistent computational basis for the extract of the archived
    collection parts. Since these parts can be specified generally, this further allows
    collections to be specified with elements from one or more web archives. The PWID
    URN is designed to meet requirements for proper referencing needed by researchers.
    Therefore it is designed as general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology
    agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials in web archives.</p>"
