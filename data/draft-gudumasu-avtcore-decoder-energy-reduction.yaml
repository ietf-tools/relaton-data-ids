abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RTCP feedback message format for the second
    type of green metadata defined by the ISO/IEC International Standard 23001-11,
    known as Energy Efficient Media Consumption (Green metadata), developed by the
    ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 3 MPEG System. The RTCP feedback messages specified in
    this specification is compatible and complimentary with the other draft on green
    metadata and enables receivers to provide feedback to the senders for decoder
    power reduction and thus allows feedback-based energy efficient mechanisms to
    be implemented. The feedback message has broad applicability in real-time video
    communication services.</p>"
