abstract:
- content: "<p>The Spatial Working Group is creating a Spatial Location Protocol (SLoP)
    [2] for requesting the spatial location of a target user or device. SLoP is designed
    to carry other formats that contain the spatial location. In many cases either
    the SLoP client and/or server could be a small mobile device with limited processing,
    memory, storage, and battery life. This proposal is a simple, text- based format
    to carry latitude, longitude, altitude, time, and accuracy.</p>"
