abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a fault notification protocol for use in a GMPLS-
    based failure recovery scheme. The protocol guarantees recovery path(s) activation
    in a bounded time in the event of single resource failures. These failures include
    fiber cut, transponder failure and node failure. Bounded recovery time is achieved
    by pre-signaling recovery paths whose nodes can be reached within a specific time,
    based on the physical capabilities of the nodes and the delay characteristics
    of the control plane. We propose using a flooding protocol for fault notification
    to allow for per-failure notification and to speed up the recovery process. We
    justify choices made for the notification method and the messaging required for
    the protocol. The draft does not mandate a specific implementation of the Fault
    Notification Protocol.</p>"
