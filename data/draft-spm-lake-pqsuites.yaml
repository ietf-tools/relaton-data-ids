abstract:
- content: "<p>The Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange (LAKE) protocol, Ephemeral
    Diffie-Hellman over COSE (EDHOC), achieves post-quantum security by adding new
    cipher suites with quantum-resistant algorithms, such as ML-KEM for key exchange
    and ML-DSA for digital signatures. This document specifies how EDHOC operates
    in a post-quantum setting using both signature-based and PSK-based authentication
    methods, and defines corresponding cipher suites.</p>"
