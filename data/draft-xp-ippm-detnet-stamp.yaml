abstract:
- content: "<p>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability for the delivery
    of data flows with extremely low packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery
    latency. The enabler to DetNet is a proper queue scheduling mechanism, such as
    timeslot based queueing and forwarding mechanism, which requires every router
    along the DetNet path to collect the basic timeslot mapping relationship between
    itself and its adjacent router. This document defines two Simple Two-Way Active
    Measurement Protocol (STAMP) TLVs, to acquire the basic timeslot mapping relationship
    between the local router and its adjacent router.</p>"
