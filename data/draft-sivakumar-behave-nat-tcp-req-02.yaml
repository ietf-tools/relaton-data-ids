abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT devices are available from a number of vendors and are in use by
    several residential and enterprise users. Yet, there is much variation in how
    the NAT devices work. Application developers, network administrators and users
    of NAT devices seek some level of uniformity and predictability in how various
    of the NAT devices operate. The objective of this document is to specify the operational
    and behavioral requirements on the NAT devices while processing TCP packets. A
    NAT device that conforms to the requirements listed in the document will bring
    predictability in how NATs operate with regard to TCP packet processing. A NAT
    device is said to be IETF behave compliant when it complies with the requirements
    outlined in this document and other companion BEHAVE documents like [BEH-UDP],
    which outlines the requirements for processing UDP and some generic requirements.</p>"
