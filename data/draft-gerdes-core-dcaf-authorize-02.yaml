abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a protocol for delegating client authentication
    and authorization in a constrained environment for establishing a Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS) channel between resource-constrained nodes. The protocol
    relies on DTLS to transfer authorization information and shared secrets for symmetric
    cryptography between entities in a constrained network. A resource- constrained
    node can use this protocol to delegate authentication of communication peers and
    management of authorization information to a trusted host with less severe limitations
    regarding processing power and memory.</p>"
