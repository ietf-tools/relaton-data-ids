abstract:
- content: "<p>Legislators writing laws that would limit or prohibit the sending of
    unsolicited bulk email (UBE) or unsolicited commercial email (UCE) have begun
    to include rules that require mail servers to include particular wording in the
    SMTP banner. To date, this wording has had two distinct purposes: to warn senders
    that they may not send UBE or UCE to that SMTP host, and to state the physical
    location of the host so that the sender may know which laws apply. This document
    is meant to help clarify how such legislation might be worded, and to help increase
    interoperability of various laws. It is not meant to be a standard of any kind,
    but is meant only for its informational value.</p>"
