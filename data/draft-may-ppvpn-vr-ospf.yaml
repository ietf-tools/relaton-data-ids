abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a generalized Virtual Router (VR) architecture
    and specifies the required extensions for [OSPFv2] to adapt the protocol to this
    architecture, such that separate 'instances' of OSPF can be used for different
    Service Provider (SP) customers connected to different PE to CE links of a single
    PE box. This architecture accommodates the deployment of layer 3 IP VPNs to facilitate
    services such as Intranet connectivity, and allows the consolidation of multiple
    Service Provider (SP) customers onto a single Provider Edge (PE) device, while
    enforcing all necessary security between different customer data.</p>"
