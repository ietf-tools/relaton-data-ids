abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC defines a variant of the ACK frame that carries cumulative count
    for each of the three ECN codepoints (ECT(1), ECT(0) and CE). From this information,
    the recipient of the ACK frame cannot deduce which ECN marking the individual
    packets were received with. This document defines an alternative ACK frame that
    encodes enough information to indicate which ECN mark each individual packet was
    received with. This information is essential for accurately performing adjustments
    to congestion window and sending rate of the sender.</p>"
