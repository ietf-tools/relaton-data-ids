abstract:
- content: <p>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of "Unwanted
    Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop is documented in RFC 4948 [RFC4948].
    Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for "[t]ightening the security of the core routing
    infrastructure." Four main steps were identified for improving the security of
    the routing infrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routing protocols'
    packets on the wire," also called the routing protocol transport. One mechanism
    for securing routing protocol transports is the use of per-packet cryptographic
    message authentication, providing both peer authentication and message integrity.
    Many different routing protocols exist and they employ a range of different transport
    subsystems. Therefore there must necessarily be various methods defined for applying
    cryptographic authentication to these varying protocols. Many routing protocols
    already have some method for accomplishing cryptographic message authentication.
    However, in many cases the existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and/or
    employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated. The "Keying and Authentication
    for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms.
    This document has two main parts. The first describes the threat analysis for
    attacks against routing protocols' transports. The second enumerates the requirements
    for addressing the described threats. This document, along with the KARP Design
    Guide and KARP Framework documents, will be used by KARP design teams for specific
    protocol review and overhaul. This document reflects the input of both the IETF's
    Security Area and Routing Area in order to form a jointly agreed upon guidance.</p>
