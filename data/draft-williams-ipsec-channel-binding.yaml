abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the end-point channel bindings for "IPsec channels"
    where the peers used the Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) and
    where they used public keys and/or certificates to authenticate each other. Specifically,
    we use hashes of the end- points' public keys.</p>
