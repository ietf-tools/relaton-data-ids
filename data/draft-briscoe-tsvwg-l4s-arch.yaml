abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture for the provision of a
    new service that the Internet could provide to eventually replace best efforts
    for all traffic: Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S). It is becoming
    common for _all_ (or most) applications being run by a user at any one time to
    require low latency. However, the only solution the IETF can offer for ultra-low
    queuing delay is Diffserv, which only favours a minority of packets at the expense
    of others. In extensive testing the new L4S service keeps average queuing delay
    under a millisecond for _all_ applications even under very heavy load, without
    sacrificing utilization; and it keeps congestion loss to zero. It is becoming
    widely recognized that adding more access capacity gives diminishing returns,
    because latency is becoming the critical problem. Even with a high capacity broadband
    access, the reduced latency of L4S remarkably and consistently improves performance
    under load for applications such as interactive video, conversational video, voice,
    Web, gaming, instant messaging, remote desktop and cloud-based apps (even when
    all being used at once over the same access link). The insight is that the root
    cause of queuing delay is in TCP, not in the queue. By fixing the sending TCP
    (and other transports) queuing latency becomes so much better than today that
    operators will want to deploy the network part of L4S to enable new products and
    services. Further, the network part is simple to deploy - incrementally with zero-config.
    Both parts, sender and network, ensure coexistence with other legacy traffic.
    At the same time L4S solves the long- recognized problem with the future scalability
    of TCP throughput. This document describes the L4S architecture, briefly describing
    the different components and how the work together to provide the aforementioned
    enhanced Internet service.</p>"
