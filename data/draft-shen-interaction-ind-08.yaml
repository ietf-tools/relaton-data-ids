abstract:
- content: "<p>In SIP-based networks, a SIP session MAY involve several application
    servers on the originating and terminating side. In a certain case, an application
    server needs to set some indications in SIP message to indicate service information
    (what are invoked, what can be allowed and what should blocked). This kind of
    information will be also required for composition of SIP applications. There is
    a need to provide indicators for service interaction between SIP application servers
    or other SIP endpoints. This document describes a mechanism of service interaction
    indicator for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enhances service interaction
    between SIP application servers in a trusted network.</p>"
