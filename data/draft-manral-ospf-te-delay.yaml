abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3630 [RFC3630] describes extensions to OSPF protocol RFC 2328 [RFC2328]
    to support intra-area Traffic Engineering (TE). For multiple applications such
    as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets, response times
    are critical. This document defines the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions to
    RFC 3630 [RFC3630] and and RFC 5329 [RFC5329] for defining a delay metric, which
    can be used by latency sensistive applications.</p>"
