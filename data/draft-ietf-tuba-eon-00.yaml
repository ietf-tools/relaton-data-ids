abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents the subset of the Experimental OSI Net (EON) that
    is in active use today. It serves to document current practice, which deviates
    somewhat from the usage described in the original RFC. Potential implementors
    should note that the protocol described herein is archaic and is likely to be
    replaced in the near future.</p>"
