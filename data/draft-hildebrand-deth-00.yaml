abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a strong desire in many communities for service operators
    to be able to dynamically update DNS records in an easy-to-deploy, standardized
    method. For example, operating SIP requires DNS records to be added and updated
    as the SIP service starts and is moved among different servers. This document
    describes an HTTPS-based mechanism for service operators who are authorized by
    their DNS administrator to add, change, and delete DNS records.</p>"
