abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever
    increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of network devices. Operators
    are begining to seek more information of power consumption in the network, have
    no standard mechanism to measure, report and compare power usage of different
    networking equipment under different network configuration and conditions. This
    document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live networks under
    different traffic loads and various switch router configuration settings. It provides
    a benchmarking suite which can be employed for any networking device .</p>"
