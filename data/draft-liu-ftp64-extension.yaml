abstract:
- content: "<p>The File transfer protocol, which is defined by the RFC 959, has a
    long history, but still being widely used. The original version of FTP specification
    defines IPv4 version of FTP. RFC 2428 defines IPv6 extensions of FTP, introducingEPRT
    and EPSV command. In the IPv6- IPv4 translation scenario, considerations should
    be applied to FTP client, server and translation box to ensure FTP protocol work
    properly. This document discusses the details for FTP to work in IPv4-IPv6 transitiion
    scenario. This document proposes to update IPv6 FTP client's specification to
    make it easier to work in 6to4 scenario.</p>"
