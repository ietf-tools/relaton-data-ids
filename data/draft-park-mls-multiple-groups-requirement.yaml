abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a functional requirement of Message Level Security
    (MLS) which provide an efficient management for multiple groups. Although MLS
    defines an architecture and an abstract protocol for a secure group communication,
    it overlooks the need of multiple groups. This document describes a usecase of
    the multiple groups, and the need for an efficient multiple group membership management.</p>"
