- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework to define Interface to In-Network
    Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network-level and application-level.
    In-Network Functions (INF) include In-Network Computing Functions (INCF), defined
    in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN). INF also includes In-Network Application Functions (INAF) which
    appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software- Defined Vehicles
    (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This document describes an I2INF framework,
    which includes components and interfaces to configure and monitor the INFs that
    implement applications and services.</p>"
