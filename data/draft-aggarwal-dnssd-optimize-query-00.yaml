abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS-SD allows a client to find a list of named instances of a service
    name over a particular transport within a domain of interest using standard DNS
    queries. As the number of potential responders increases, DNS-SD based discovery
    doesn't scale well. To mitigate the scaling issues, schemes to narrow down the
    search context would be needed. The document proposes to include key/value pairs
    in the form of a DNS TXT record along with the service name in the DNS query to
    assist with the discovery process. The DNS TXT record can be placed in the additional
    section of the query without requiring any changes to the structure of DNS messages.</p>"
