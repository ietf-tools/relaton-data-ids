abstract:
- content: "<p>With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained networks, users expect
    to be able to Operate, Administer and Maintain them with the familiar tools and
    protocols they already use on less constrained networks. OAM uses specific messages
    sent into the data plane to measure some parameters of a network. Most of the
    time, no explicit values are sent is these messages. Network parameters are obtained
    from the analysis of these specific messages. This can be used: o To detect if
    a host is up or down. o To measure the RTT and its variation over time. o To learn
    the path used by packets to reach a destination. OAM in LPWAN is a little bit
    trickier since the bandwidth is limited and extra traffic added by OAM can introduce
    perturbation on regular transmission. Two scenarios can be investigated: o OAM
    coming from internet. In that case, the NGW should act as a</p>"
