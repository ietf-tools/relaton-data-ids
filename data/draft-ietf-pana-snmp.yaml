abstract:
- content: "<p>The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) does not necessarily act as an
    Enforcement Point (EP) to prevent unauthorized access or usage of the network.
    When a PANA Client successfully authenticates itself to the PAA, EP(s) (e.g.,
    access routers) will need to be suitably notified. The PANA working group recommends
    the use of Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3) to deliver the
    authorization information to one or more EPs when the PAA is separated from EPs.
    The present document provides the necessary information and extensions needed
    to use SNMPv3 as the PAA-EP protocol.</p>"
