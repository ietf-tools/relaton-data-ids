abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Communication Web (RTCWEB) approach uses browser-based
    scripts to minimize the number of network protocols between server and browser
    that need standardization. With traditional interconnection concepts, the success
    of this effort is limited as different RTCWEB applications still need to interoperate.
    This document proposes an alternative interconnection model where caller and callee
    always use the same RTCWEB client and server and avoid any interworking this way.</p>"
