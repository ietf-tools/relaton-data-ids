abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/1.1 defines a Connection header, allowing 'the sender to specify
    options that are desired for that particular connection and MUST NOT be communicated
    by proxies over further connections.' Because HTTP/1.0 proxies would normally
    forward the Connection header without obeying its specification, a Connection
    header received in an HTTP/1.0 message must normally be treated as if it had been
    forwarded in error. This document defines an X-Connfrom header that identifies
    the sending host, and so is safe to use in HTTP/1.0 messages. This might be useful
    in experimenting with HTTP/1.0 implementations of applications of the HTTP/1.1
    Connection mechanism.</p>"
