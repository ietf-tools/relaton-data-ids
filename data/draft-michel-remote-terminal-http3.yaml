abstract:
- content: "<p>The secure shell (SSH) traditionally offers its secure services over
    an insecure network using the TCP transport protocol. This document defines mechanisms
    to access remote terminals by running the SSH Connection protocol over HTTP/3
    using Extended CONNECT. Remote terminals over HTTP/3 enables additional benefits
    such as the scalability offered by HTTP multiplexing, relying on TLS for secure
    channel establishment leveraging X.509 certificates, HTTP Authentication schemes
    for client and server authentication, UDP port forwarding and stronger resilience
    against packet injection attacks and middlebox interference.</p>"
