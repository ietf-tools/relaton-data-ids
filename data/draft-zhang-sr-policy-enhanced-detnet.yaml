abstract:
- content: "<p>SR Policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more
    segment lists and necessary path attributes. It enables instantiation of an ordered
    list of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering. DetNet provides
    the capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows with extremely
    low data loss rates and bounded end-to-end latency within a network domain. This
    document defines the SR policy enhancement to carry the Bounded Latency Information
    with a candidate path of SR policy. So that BLI behavior can be enabled automatically
    when the SR Policy is applied.</p>"
