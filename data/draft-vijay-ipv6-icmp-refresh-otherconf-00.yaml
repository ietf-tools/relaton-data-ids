abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC2461] provides a way by which the nodes
    can determine whether to use administered protocol for address autoconfiguration
    and other non-address information through M and O bits in the Router Advertisements.
    Though RAs can notify nodes of a change in the address prefixes, currently there
    is no way the nodes can learn that there is a change in the non-address configuration
    parameters. This will make the nodes unable to learn about new or changed configuration
    parameters like DNS server addresses. This specification extends the Neighbor
    Discovery protocol [RFC2461] to notify the nodes that the other information obtained
    through an administered protocol has been changed.</p>"
