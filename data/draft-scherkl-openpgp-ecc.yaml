abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines which algorithm specific parameters are needed
    for elliptic curve cipher (ECC) and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm
    (ECDSA) and how they have to be stored in openPGP packets. Therefore it is an
    supplement to the openPGP message format [1]. It also defines which checks are
    needed to validate ECC and ECDSA keys and which 'top-level' operations must be
    performed for encryption/decryption and signing/signature verification. But it
    gives no advices how to implement these checks and operations, nor the underlying
    mathematics. To do this, look for example at IEEE P1363 [2].</p>"
