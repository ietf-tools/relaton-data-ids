abstract:
- content: "<p>Tools like traceroute have been very valuable for the operation of
    the Internet. Part of that value comes from being able to display information
    about routers and paths over which the user of the tool has no control, but the
    traceroute output can be passed along to someone else that can further investigate
    or fix the problem. In overlay networks such as VXLAN and NVGRE the prevailing
    view is that since the overlay network has no control of the underlay there needs
    to be special tools and agreements to enable extracting traces from the underlay.
    We argue that enabling visibility into the underlay and using existing tools like
    traceroute has been overlooked and would add value in many deployments of overlay
    networks. This document specifies an approach that can be used to make traceroute
    transcend layers of encapsulation including details for how to apply this to VXLAN.
    The technique can be applied to other encapsulations used for overlay networks.
    It can also be implemented using current commercial silicon.</p>"
