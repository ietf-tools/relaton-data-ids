abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new attribute for the Telephony Routing over
    IP (TRIP) protocol. The attribute associates protocols/services in the PSTN offering
    authorized prioritization during call setup that are reachable through a TRIP
    gateway. Current examples of preferential service in the Public Switched Telephone
    Network (PSTN) are Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) in the
    U.S. and Government Telephone Preference Scheme (GTPS) in the U.K. The proposed
    attribute for TRIP is based on the NameSpace.Value tuple defined for the SIP Resource-Priority
    field. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
