abstract:
- content: "<p>This document justifies the need and lists the requirements for correlating
    SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialogs. The correlated dialogs may or may not
    be related to the same multimedia session. Being able to logically correlate multiple
    SIP dialogs is useful for applications that, for different reasons, need to establish
    several SIP dialogs to provide a given service. The logical correlation of two
    SIP dialogs is also useful, for instance, to correlate an incoming with an outgoing
    dialog at a B2BUA.</p>"
