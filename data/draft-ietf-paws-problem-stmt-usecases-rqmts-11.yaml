abstract:
- content: <p>Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use
    but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white
    space." The concept of allowing additional transmissions (which may or may not
    be licensed) in white space is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new
    use. An obvious requirement is that these additional transmissions do not interfere
    with the assigned use of the spectrum. One approach to using white space spectrum
    at a given time and location is to verify spectrum availability with a database
    that manages spectrum sharing and provides spectrum-availability information.
    The IETF has undertaken to develop a Protocol to Access Spectrum Database [1]
    for such a management database. This document describes a number of possible use
    cases of white space spectrum and technology as well as a set of requirements
    for the database query protocol. The concept of white spaces is described along
    with the problems that need to be addressed to enable white space spectrum for
    additional uses without causing interference to currently assigned use. Use of
    white space is enabled by querying a database that stores information about spectrum
    availability at any given location and time.</p>
