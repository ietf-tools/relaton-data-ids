abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
    the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide whether to engage
    in secure interactions with it - or not. Evidence about trustworthiness can be
    rather complex and it is deemed unrealistic that every Relying Party is capable
    of the appraisal of Evidence. Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to
    a Verifier. In order to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires fresh
    Evidence from an Attester. Before a Verifier can appraise Evidence it may require
    transformation to an internal representation. This document specifies Evidence
    transformation methods for DICE and SPDM formats to the CoRIM internal representation.</p>"
