abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 as specified in RFC 3775 allows a mobile node to maintain
    its IPv6 communications while moving between subnets. This document investigates
    configurations where a mobile node running Mobile IPv6 is multihomed. The use
    of multiple addresses is foreseen to provide ubiquitous, permanent and fault-tolerant
    access to the Internet, particularly on mobile nodes which are more prone to failure
    or sudden lack of connectivity. However, Mobile IPv6 currently lacks support for
    such multihomed nodes. The purpose of this document is to detail all the issues
    arising through the operation of Mobile IPv6 on multihomed mobile nodes.</p>"
