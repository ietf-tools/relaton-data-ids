abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes EAP-SKL, an Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) method which provides mutual authentication and key derivation based on
    a pre-shared secret. EAP-SKL relies on the cryptographic protocol SKEME (Secure
    Key Exchange MEchanism protocol), and hence may benefit from its simplicity and
    the provable security. EAP-SKL complies with the mandatory requirements for an
    EAP method which is intented for deployment in Wireless LAN environments.</p>"
