abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation
    functionality for very low bandwidth networks. These techniques are especially
    tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks. The Static Context
    Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of flexibility when processing
    the header fields and must be used for these kind of networks. A common context
    stored in a LPWAN device and in the network is used. This context keeps information
    that will not be transmitted in the constrained network. Static context means
    that information stored in the context, which describes field values, does not
    change during packet transmission. This avoids complex resynchronization mechanisms,
    which are incompatible with LPWAN characteristics. In most cases, IPv6/UDP headers
    are reduced to a small identifier called Rule ID. But sometimes, a packet will
    not be compressed enough by SCHC to fit in one L2 PDU, and the SCHC fragmentation
    protocol will be used. This document describes the SCHC compression/decompression
    framework and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers. Similar solutions for other protocols
    such as CoAP will be described in separate documents. Moreover, this document
    specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used in two situations:
    for SCHC-compressed packets that still exceed the L2 PDU size; and for the case
    where the SCHC compression cannot be performed.</p>"
