abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple protocol experiments have been proposed that involve changes
    to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as specified in RFC 3168. This memo
    summarizes the proposed areas of experimentation to provide an overview to the
    Internet community and updates RFC 3168, a Proposed Standard RFC, to allow the
    experiments to proceed without requiring a standards process exception for each
    Experimental RFC to update RFC 3168. Each experiment is still required to be documented
    in an Experimental RFC. In addition, this memo makes related updates to the ECN
    specifications for RTP in RFC 6679 and to the ECN specifications for DCCP in RFC
    4341, RFC 4342 and RFC 5622. This memo also records the conclusion of the ECN
    Nonce experiment in RFC 3540, obsoletes RFC 3540 and reclassifies it as Historic
    to enable new experimental use of the ECT(1) codepoint.</p>"
