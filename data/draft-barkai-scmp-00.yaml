abstract:
- content: "<p>With the proliferation of IP based internetworking services to mass
    business and consumer markets carriers are faced with operational challenges in
    an extent never before experienced in previous LAN MAN or WAN environments. To
    accommodate these new internetworking envi- ronments, carrier workflow management
    applications for service Ful- fillment, Assurance, and Billing (FAB) need to undergo
    major a tran- sition. In essence applications need to transition from being per
    technology centric to being service centric, as historic correspon- dence between
    technology and service is no longer true. Applications do not need to change in
    nature, since they still need to support inventory, CRM, order and other workflows.
    However, applications need to include a service centric aspect as basis for these
    work- flows. Service Centric solutions can be shared by a wide range of management
    and workflow applications, rather than be re-invented by each one. Service Centric
    Management solutions must be distributed in order to cope with the massive scale
    and complexity challenges of the underly- ing networks. Service Centric Management
    Protocol (SCMP) and distri- bution should be standardized to facilitate multi-vendor
    interoper- ability in this emerging space, allow for potential future embedding
    within NE, and to allow for Service Centric Management primitives to extend across
    Inter Carrier Interfaces (ICI) and inner carrier regu- latory bounds.</p>"
