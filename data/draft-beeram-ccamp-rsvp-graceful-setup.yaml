abstract:
- content: "<p>The GMPLS RSVP-TE setup procedure for transport LSPs outlined in [RFC3473]
    involves a single iteration signaling sequence. However there are certain scenarios,
    where it is not feasible to make an LSP fully operational and ready for use via
    the existing single-step setup procedure. This document proposes a 2-iteration
    setup procedure for gracefully bringing up transport LSPs in such cases.</p>"
