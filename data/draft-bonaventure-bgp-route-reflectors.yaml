abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard interdomain routing
    protocol in the Internet. Inside an Autonomous System (AS), the interdomain routes
    are often distributed by using BGP Route Reflectors (RR). Today, most RR are simple
    BGP routers. We show that by adding intelligence to the RR, it is possible to
    improve both the routing and the packet forwarding in ASes. We show how a versatile
    RR can help an AS to engineer the flow of its incoming or outgoing interdomain
    traffic. We also discuss how a versatile RR could help to reduce the BGP convergence
    time or reduce the size of the routing tables when providing BGP/MPLS VPN services.</p>"
