abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the authentication option to the telnet [1]
    protocol as a generic method for negotiating an authentication type and mode including
    whether encryption should be used and if credentials should be forwarded. While
    this document summarizes currently utilized commands and types it does not define
    a specific authentication type. Separate documents are to be published defining
    each authentication type. This document updates a previous specification of the
    telnet authentication option, RFC 2941 [2], to allow the AUTHENTICATION option
    to be used in conjunction with the START_TLS option [5].</p>"
