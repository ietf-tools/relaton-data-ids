abstract:
- content: <p>Some service providers build and operate data centers at the size exceeding
    100,000 servers. In this document, those data-centers are referred to as "large-scale"
    to differentiate them from more common smaller infrastructures. The data centers
    of that scale have unique set of network design requirement, with primary focus
    on operational simplicity and stability. This document attempts to summarize the
    authors' experiences in designing and supporting large data centers, using BGP
    as the only control-plane protocol. The intent is to describe a proven and stable
    routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry.</p>
