abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the role of the IETF and IRTF in advancing Artificial
    Intelligence for network operations (AINetOps), focusing on requirements for IETF
    protocols and architectures. AINetOps applies AI/ML techniques to automate and
    optimize network operations, enabling use cases such as reactive troubleshooting,
    proactive assurance, closed-loop optimization, misconfiguration detection, and
    virtual operator assistance. The document addresses AINetOps for both single-layer
    IP or Optical networks and multi-layer IP/Optical networks. It defines the concept
    of AINetOps for networking and provides its operational benefits such as network
    assurance, predictive analytics, network optimization, multi-layer planning, and
    more. It aims to guide the evolution of IETF protocols to support AINetOps-driven
    network management.</p>"
