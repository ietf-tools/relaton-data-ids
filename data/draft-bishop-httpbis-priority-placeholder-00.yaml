abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7540] defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating priorities.
    Some implementations have begun using closed streams as placeholders when constructing
    their priority tree, but this has unbounded state commitments and interacts poorly
    with HTTP/QUIC ([I-D.ietf-quic-http]). This document proposes an extension to
    the HTTP/2 priority scheme for both protocols.</p>"
