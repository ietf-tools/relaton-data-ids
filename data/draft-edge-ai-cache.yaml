abstract:
- content: "<p>Watching videos (Contents) from mobile devices has been causing most
    of the network traffic and is projected to remain to increase exponentially. Thus,
    numerous types of content and chunk based caching schemes have been proposed to
    handle the increasing traffic. Those caching schemes cache the whole videos at
    the edge nodes, but most of the users view only the beginning of the videos. Hence,
    caching the complete video on the edge node is an ineffective solution to reduce
    the network traffic as well as to improve the cache utilization. Thus, a chunk-level
    caching scheme to store popular videos partially and a smart prefetching scheme
    is needed to provide the missing chunks of the video. This Internet-Draft will
    expire on August 09, 2021.</p>"
