abstract:
- content: <p>All self-governing bodies have ways of managing the scope of participant
    interaction. The IETF uses a consensus-driven process for developing computer-communications
    standards in an open fashion. An important part of this consensus-driven process
    is the pervasive use of mailing lists for discussion. Notably, in a small number
    of cases, a participant has engaged in a "denial-of-service" attack to disrupt
    the consensus-driven process. Regrettably, as these bad faith attacks become more
    common, the IETF needs to establish a practice that reduces or eliminates these
    attacks. This memo recommends such a practice for use by the IETF. This document
    specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests
    discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
