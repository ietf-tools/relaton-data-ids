abstract:
- content: "<p>The IESG has identified several security issues with the current Mobile
    IPv6 specification [MIPv6]. A subsequent effort [MIPv6SecReq] details the security
    threats introduced by MIPv6. Two major issues are (1) how to obtain a security
    association between an arbitrary MN and CN such that the binding update (BU) is
    secure, and, assuming such a mechanism is in place, (2) how to secure the individual
    BU messages. This document is an assessment of the proposed solutions for problem
    (1).</p>"
