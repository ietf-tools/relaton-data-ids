abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the forwarding element (FE) model used in the
    Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol. The model represents
    the capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context
    of the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.
    More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present
    in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are
    or can be interconnected. This FE model is intended to satisfy the model requirements
    specified in RFC 3654. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
