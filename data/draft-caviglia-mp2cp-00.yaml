abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces a new object for carrying GRSVP-TE labels, namely
    Mp2Cp Label object. This new object SHOULD be used in order to move under the
    Control Plane (CP) domain LSPs that were created by the Management Plane (MP).
    The result of using Mp2Cp Label in GRSVP-TE is that, at the end of the signaling
    flow, an LSP that was created by Management Plane is moved under to Control Plane
    domain.</p>"
