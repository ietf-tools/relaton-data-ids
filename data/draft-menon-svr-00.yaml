abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Secure Vector Routing (SVR). Secure Vectors
    contain application layer metadata used for authentication and communicating network
    intent between data routers. The metadata is extensible, and could be used to
    transmit information, network routes, security policies, and quality policies
    securely across network boundaries. Boundaries include those formed by private
    network RFC1918 networks with the IPv4 public internet, and the IPv6 public internet.</p>"
