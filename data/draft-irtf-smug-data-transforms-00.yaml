abstract:
- content: "<p>In the framework document &lt;draft-irtf-smug-framework-00.txt&gt;,
    the Secure Multicast Group (SMuG) has identified three functionalities that deal
    with security transformations for the multicasted data. These are data encryption,
    source authentication, and group authentication. This document expands on the
    issues to be taken into consideration when designing transforms that realize these
    functionalities. These issues include the order of applying the transforms, their
    placement in the communication layers, possible aggregation of several functionalities
    in a single transform, and the relationships with other protocols (such as reliable
    multicast protocols). Next a specific design is proposed, that attempts to meet
    the requirements of prominent application in a simple yet flexible way.</p>"
