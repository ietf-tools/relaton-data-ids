abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the third
    version of the Internet-Standard Management Framework, termed the SNMP version
    3 Framework (SNMPv3). This Framework is derived from and builds upon both the
    original Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv1) and the second Internet-Standard
    Management Framework (SNMPv2). The architecture is designed to be modular to allow
    the evolution of the Framework over time. The document explains why using SNMPv3
    instead of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 is strongly recommended. The document also recommends
    that RFCs 1157, 1441, 1901, 1909 and 1910 be retired by moving them to Historic
    status. This document obsoletes RFC 2570. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
