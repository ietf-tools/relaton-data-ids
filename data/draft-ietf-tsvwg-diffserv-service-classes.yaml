abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes service classes configured with Diffserv and
    recommends how they can be used and how to construct them using Differentiated
    Services Code Points (DSCPs), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs),
    and Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic requirement
    that particular DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain
    service class, but as a policy and for interoperability it is useful to apply
    them consistently. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
