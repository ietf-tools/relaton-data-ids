abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets. In particular
    it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on the IEEE 802.1D-1990 standard
    between Local Area Network (LAN) segments. Provisions are made for support of
    transparent bridging. Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to
    bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments.</p>"
