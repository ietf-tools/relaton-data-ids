abstract:
- content: "<p>Firewalls are used to get controlled and secure connection between
    networks, e.g. a company's internal network and the Internet. Preferably the firewall
    is the only link between the networks to be able to guarantee a certain level
    of security. The firewall is a critical node in the network and if it would fail
    the result is lost connection between the networks. To ensure reliability and
    connectivity we add redundancy, i.e. a number of parallel firewalls are installed
    which will act as backups for each other.</p>"
