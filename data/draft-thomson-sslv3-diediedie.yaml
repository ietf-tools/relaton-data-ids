abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Sockets Layer version 3.0 (SSLv3) [RFC6101] is no longer secure.
    This document requires that SSLv3 not be used. The replacement versions, in particular
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 [RFC5246], are considerably more secure and
    capable protocols. This document updates the backward compatibility sections of
    the TLS RFCs to prohibit fallback to SSLv3.</p>"
