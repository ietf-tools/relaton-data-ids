abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies routing metrics to be used in path calculation
    for Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL). Low power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared with traditional wired networks or
    even with similar ones such as mobile ad-hoc networks. By contrast with typical
    Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link attributes,
    this document specifies a set of routing metrics suitable to LLNs.</p>"
