abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes reliable mechanisms for the publication and
    revocation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. This reliability takes
    several forms. First, it provides browsers a strong guarantee that all certificates
    they accept are truly published and unrevoked at the time they're accepted. Second,
    it allows operators to monitor for mis-issuances related to their websites in
    a highly efficient way without relying on third-party services. Third, it provides
    a high degree of operational redundancy to minimize the risk of cascading outages.</p>"
