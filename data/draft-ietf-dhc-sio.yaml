abstract:
- content: "<p>This option is provided by DHCP servers to DHCP clients to identify
    the origin of a DHCPOFFER -- on a basis other than a server's IP address -- so
    that a DHCP client may optionally select from among multiple offers based on a
    client's preference to a particular DHCP server(s). The information contained
    in this option is a hex value indicating the assigned identification of the server
    originating the DHCPOFFER in which this option is contained.</p>"
