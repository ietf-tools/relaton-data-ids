abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension, Forwarding Commitment BGP (FC-
    BGP), to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). FC-BGP provides security for the path
    of Autonomous Systems (ASs) through which a BGP UPDATE message passes. Forwarding
    Commitment (FC) is a cryptographically signed segment to certify an AS's routing
    intent on its directly connected hops. Based on FC, FC-BGP aims to build a secure
    inter- domain system that can simultaneously authenticate the AS_PATH attribute
    in the BGP UPDATE message. The extension is backward compatible, which means a
    router that supports the extension can interoperate with a router that doesn't
    support the extension.</p>"
