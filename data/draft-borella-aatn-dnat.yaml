abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT (Network Address Translation) has been proposed to extend the lifetime
    of IPv4 by allowing one or more subnets to exist behind a single IP address. It
    is desirable to support dozens, if not hundreds, of nodes on a NAT subnet. As
    it is currently defined, NAT may not gracefully scale beyond networks containing
    a few dozen nodes. In particular, the computational burden placed on the NAT router
    may be significant, especially if the router is shared by several NAT-enabled
    subnets. Additionally, NAT requires that support for many protocols be specifically
    programmed into the translation mechanism. In this document, we introduce DNAT
    (Distributed Network Address Translation), an alternative to NAT. In particular,
    DNAT will eliminate all address and port translation at the router, providing
    an application independent mechanism for sharing an IP address amongst many hosts
    while providing end-to-end connectivity.</p>"
