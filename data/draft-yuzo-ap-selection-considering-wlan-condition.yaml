abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses AP selection method utilizing the number of
    frame retransmissions in addition to received signal strength (RSSI). In a real
    environment, WLANs are congested by lots of mobile nodes, and sometimes influenced
    by other WLAN devices. They result in deterioration of communication quality.
    In such environment, each mobile node has to select an AP with better performance
    for keeping its own communication stable. To enable this, we employ the number
    of frame retransmissions and RSSI as selection indexes. We then describe an architecture
    design and implementation for our proposed scheme.</p>"
