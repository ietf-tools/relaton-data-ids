abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP utilizes DNS to discovery the IP address of the CoAP server. However
    DNS is heavy for the most resource constrained end-points. In this case the assistance
    from CoAP proxy or research directory (RD) is needed for CoAP transaction. This
    specification proposes to define one new dhcp option for proxy/RD discovery for
    the most resource constrained end-points.</p>"
