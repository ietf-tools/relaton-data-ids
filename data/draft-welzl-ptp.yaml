abstract:
- content: "<p>Endpoint congestion avoidance and control mechanisms typically rely
    on measured network performance parameters such as the round-trip- time and packet
    loss seen by the receiver, without any explicit help from the network. Packet
    loss being the primary congestion indicator, these approaches first need to exceed
    the available network capacity to obtain the information needed to react. Additionally,
    relying on packet loss leads to misinterpretation of transmission errors as a
    sign of congestion.</p>"
