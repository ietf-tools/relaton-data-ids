abstract:
- content: "<p>BGPLS provides a mechanism by which Link state and traffic engineering
    information can be collected from internal networks and shared with external network
    routers using BGP. BGPLS defines a new Address Family to exchange this information
    using BGP. BGP Optimal Route Reflection [BGP-ORR] [RFC9107] provides a mechanism
    for a centralized BGP Route Reflector to acheive requirements of a Hot Potato
    Routing as described in Section 11 of [RFC4456]. Optimal Route Reflection requires
    BGP ORR to overwrite the default IGP location placement of the route reflector;
    which is used for determining cost to the nexthop contained in the path. This
    draft augments BGPLS and defines a new extensions to exchange cost information
    to next-hops for the purpose of calculating best path from a peer perspective
    rather than local BGP speaker own perspective.</p>"
