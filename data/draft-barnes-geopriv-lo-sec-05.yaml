abstract:
- content: "<p>Location-based services (such as navigation applications, emergency
    services, management of equipment in the field) need geographic location information
    about Internet hosts, their users, and other related entities. These applications
    need to securely gather and transfer location information for location services,
    and at the same time protect the privacy of the individuals involved. This document
    describes an architecture for privacy-preserving location-based services in the
    Internet, focusing on authorization, security, and privacy requirements for the
    data formats and protocols used by these services.</p>"
