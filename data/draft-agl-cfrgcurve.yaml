- content: "<p>This memo describes an algorithm for deterministically generating parameters
    for elliptic curves over prime fields offering high practical security in cryptographic
    applications, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and X.509 certificates.
    It also specifies a specific curve at the ~128-bit security level.</p>"
