    control protocol standardized as Megaco in the IETF and as Recommendation H.248
    (now H.248.1) in the ITU-T. It is common text with Recommendation H.248.1 (05/02),
    published by the ITU-T. Megaco v2 includes the corrections to RFC 3015 which resulted
    in RFC xxxx [draft-ietf-megaco-3015corr-02.txt], plus the following new capabilities:
    - ability to audit specific properties, events, signals and statistics - use of
    serviceChange to indicate that capabilities have changed in the Media Gateway
    - playing a signal on the Root Termination - limiting the number of repetitions
    of transaction pending - allowing topology to be set per stream - ability to audit
    context properties - new Nx64K multiplex type - provision for digit buffering
    when a digit map completes. In addition, the use of the Modem Descriptor was deprecated.
    A detailed list of changes from draft-ietf-megaco-3015corr- 02.txt/H.248.1 (03/02)
    to this document is given in Appendix II at the end of this document.</p>"
