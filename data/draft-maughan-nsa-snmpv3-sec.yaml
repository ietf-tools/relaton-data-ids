abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents simpler and more secure architectures for SNMPv3
    agents than the ones specified in RFCs 2271-2275. Agent security is improved by
    restricting each module's access to data, using the 'principle of least privilege'.
    The new agent architectures are analyzed in terms of software complexity as well
    as security, and are shown in some respects to be simpler. Finally, an implementation
    prototype of this architecture is presented.</p>"
