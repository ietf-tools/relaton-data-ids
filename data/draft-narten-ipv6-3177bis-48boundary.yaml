abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3177 argued that in IPv6, end sites should be assigned /48 blocks
    in most cases. The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted that recommendation
    in 2002, but began reconsidering the policy in 2005. This document revisits and
    updates the RFC 3177 recommendations on the assignment of IPv6 address space to
    end sites. The exact choice of how much address space to assign end sites is a
    policy issue under the purview of the RIRs, subject to IPv6 architectural and
    operational considerations. This document reviews the architectural and operational
    considerations of end site assignments as well as the motivations behind the original
    3177 recommendations. Moreover, the document clarifies that a one-size-fits-all
    recommendation of /48 is not nuanced enough for the broad range of end sites and
    is no longer recommended as a single default. This document updates and replaces
    RFC 3177.</p>"
