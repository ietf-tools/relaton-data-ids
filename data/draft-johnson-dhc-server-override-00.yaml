abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay information option
    [6] which allows the DHCP relay to specify a new value for the Server-ID option,
    which is inserted by the DHCP Server. In some cases it is convenient for the DHCP
    relay to act as the actual DHCP server such that DHCP RENEWAL requests will come
    to the relay instead of going to the server directly. This gives the relay the
    opportunity to include the Relay Agent option with appropriate suboptions even
    on RENEWAL messages. This new relay agent suboption allows the relay to tell the
    DHCP server what value to use in the Server-ID option [3]. If this suboption is
    not present, the server should build the Server-ID option in the normal fashion.</p>"
