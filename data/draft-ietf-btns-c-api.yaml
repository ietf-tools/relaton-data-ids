- content: "<p>IPsec based security is usually transparent for applications and they
    have no standard APIs for gathering information on connection security properties.
    This document specifies an API that increases the visibility of IPsec to applications.
    The API allows applications to allow BTNS extensions, control the channel bindings,
    and control also other security properties related to IPsec. This document presents
    C-bindings to the abstract BTNS API.</p>"
