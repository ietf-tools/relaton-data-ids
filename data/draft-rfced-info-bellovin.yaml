abstract:
- content: "<p>IP spoofing attacks based on sequence number spoofing have become a
    serious threat on the Internet (CERT Advisory CA-95:01). While ubiquitous crypgraphic
    authentication is the right answer, we propose a simple modification to TCP implementations
    that should be a very substantial block to the current wave of attacks. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an
    Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
