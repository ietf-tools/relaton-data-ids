abstract:
- content: "<p>The increased complexity in the management of highly heterogeneous
    optical networks is recently forcing vendors and providers to look for novel mechanisms
    which diminish the manual intervention by favoring the autonomous execution of
    several operational tasks, especially when dealing with network congestion or
    failure events. The adoption of cognitive techniques in networking envisions a
    network which is able to adapt itself to current or forecasted conditions by taking
    into account previous history, and which is able to act proactively, rather than
    reactively, in order to avoid problems before they arise. In this document, a
    novel architectural framework that introduces cognitive techniques in the optical
    networking domain is described, and several use cases provided to emphasize its
    effectiveness.</p>"
