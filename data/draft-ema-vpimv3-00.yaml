abstract:
- content: "<p>General electronic mail (email) provides a facility for exchanging
    messages of seemingly arbitrary content. In common email usage, text is the primary
    media with one or more attachments. A class of special-purpose computers has evolved
    to provide voice messaging services. These machines generally interface to a telephone
    switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services. Message exchange
    between these voice-mail only systems can best be achieved using VPIM Version
    2. Fax messaging is another special purpose messaging system which interface to
    a telephone switch and provide the ability to send and receive images over the
    PSTN. When sending these messages over the Internet rather than the PSTN, the
    simple mode fax profile defined in RFC ABCD should be used. Other electronic messaging
    systems include paging, and short message service. It is expected that other messaging
    systems developed for specific environments will continue to be developed. This
    profile defines a new version of the VPIM specification for the interchange of
    voice messages between a voice messaging system as defined in [VPIM] and a unified
    messaging system. In this sense, a unified messaging system is capable of sending
    and receiving each of several different message types. Typical unified messaging
    systems today consolidate fax messages, voice messages, and email messages into
    a single system and permit the forwarding a received message of one type as an
    attachment to a message of another type. Further, this profile will define the
    interactions between a media agnostic (multi-media) messaging system with unified
    messaging and voice messaging systems. A media agnostic system may combine several
    media into a single message. Such a message may not have primary a media but rely
    upon several components to</p>"
