abstract:
- content: "<p>To support IP mobility, mobile IPv4 was designed for IPv4 network and
    the mobility extension for IPv6 has been also drafted. However, mobile IPv4 and
    mobile IPv6 are not compatible to each other so that a mobile IPv4 host can not
    function properly while it changes its point of attachment to IPv6 networks and
    vice versa. The document specifies an architecture and mechanisms to solve mobility
    problems in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. The solution presents a dual
    stack model that implements a new address mapper on mobile hosts. The address
    mapper on a mobile host associates the home address in one protocol such as IPv4
    with a care-of-address in the other protocol, i.e. IPv6. It dispatches IPv4/IPv6
    packets to proper layers of the protocol stack, and provides transparent services
    to upper layers regardless of the attached networks. Therefore, the new architecture
    facilitates the mobility of hosts in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks.</p>"
