abstract:
- content: "<p>With protocols such as SIP (RFC2543 [1]) and HTTP (RFC2616 [2]), a
    AAA mechanism may be used in the back-end to handle the authentication, authorization
    and accounting functionality. Two authentication mechanisms specified within RFC2616
    and RFC2543 are the Basic and Digest authentication. In this document, we describe
    how these authentication mechanisms can utilize the NASREQ application DIAMETER
    AAA framework.</p>"
