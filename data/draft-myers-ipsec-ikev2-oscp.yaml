abstract:
- content: "<p>While IKEv2 supports public key based authentication (PKI), the corresponding
    use of in-band CRLs is problematic due to unbounded CRL size. The size of an OCSP
    response is however well-bounded and small. This document defines two extensions
    to IKEv2 which enable the use of OCSP for in-band signaling of certificate revocation
    status. Two new content encodings are defined for use in the CERTREQ and CERT
    payloads: OCSP Responder Hash and OCSP Response. An OCSP Responder Hash CERTREQ
    payload triggers transmission of an OCSP Response CERT payload.</p>"
