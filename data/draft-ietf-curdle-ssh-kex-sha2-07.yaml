abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to update the recommended set of key exchange
    methods for use in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol to meet evolving needs for
    stronger security. This RFC updates [RFC4253] MUST algorithms. This RFC also notes
    that the [IANASSH] has replaced [RFC4250] as the primary reference document for
    SSH Protocol Assigned Numbers. This document adds recommendations for adoption
    of Key Exchange Methods which MUST, SHOULD+, SHOULD, SHOULD-, MAY, SHOULD NOT,
    and MUST NOT be implemented. New key exchange methods will use the SHA-2 family
    of hashes and are drawn from these from [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-curves] and new-modp
    from the [I-D.ietf-curdle-ssh-modp-dh-sha2] and gss-keyex [NEWGSSAPI].</p>"
