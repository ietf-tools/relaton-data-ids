abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for online meetings and dating
    websites. The proposed architecture can use its own profiles database as well
    as the other internet based social networking database resources. The document
    proposes a modular design for online meeting and similar kind of applications
    on Internet. The architecture proposes an application specific search without
    breaching privacy of the registered members. It also proposes to utilize member
    profiles from legacy databases and websites as well as other implementations of
    this architecture.</p>"
