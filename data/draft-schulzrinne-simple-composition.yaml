abstract:
- content: "<p>Composition creates a presence document from multiple components published
    by one or more sources. This document identifies sources of information that a
    compositor might draw on presence composition and describes steps for composition.
    The composing function can be complex, so we intentionally restrict the discussion
    to cases that are likely to be common across many users of presence systems. We
    present an XML format for specifying a composition policy, based on our discussion.</p>"
