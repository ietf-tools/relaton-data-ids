abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3344 [2] contains no provision to allow a home agent to inform
    a mobile node that it needs to stop acting as the home agent for the mobile node.
    Dynamical Home Agent assignment [3] is designed for assigning a optimal home agent
    for mobile node, not for proactively notifying a mobile node to change it's home
    agent. This document specifies a new MIP4 control message that can be used between
    a home agent and mobile node to signal a mobile node that it should acquire a
    new home agent.</p>"
