abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. These applications require better isolation and have more stringent
    performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.
    An enhanced VPN may be used for 5G transport network slicing, and will also be
    of use in more generic scenarios. This document specifies BGP-LS based mechanism
    with necessary extensions to advertise the information of Segment Routing (SR)
    based virtual networks. These virtual networks could be used as the underlay of
    enhanced VPN service. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing
    with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
