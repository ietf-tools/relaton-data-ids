abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Authentication Framework includes
    two authentication schemes: Basic and Digest. Both schemes employ a shared secret
    based mechanism for access authentication. The Authentication and Key Agreement
    (AKA) mechanism performs user authentication and session key distribution in Universal
    Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. AKA is a challenge- response
    based mechanism that uses symmetric cryptography. This memo specifies an AKA based
    one-time password generation mechanism for HTTP Digest access authentication.</p>"
