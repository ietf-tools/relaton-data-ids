abstract:
- content: "<p>The O(n**2) problem is a well-known problem which occurs when overlay
    network models are used, e.g. for building vpns. This draft compares four different
    methods as to accomplish an effective full mesh connectivity and shows precisely
    the amount of resource consumption in each case - i.e. the consumption of states
    and labels.</p>"
