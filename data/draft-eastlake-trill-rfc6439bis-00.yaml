abstract:
- content: <p>TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can
    have multiple end stations and TRILL switches attached. Where multiple TRILL switches
    are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end stations on that link is
    handled by a subset of those TRILL switches called "Appointed Forwarders", with
    the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled by at most one TRILL switch.
    This document clarifies and updates the Appointed Forwarder mechanism. It updates
    RFC 6325 and obsoletes RFC 6439.</p>
