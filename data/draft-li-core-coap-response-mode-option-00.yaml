abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
    Two response modes are defined: Piggy-backed Response and Separate Response. This
    specification provides a simple extension for CoAP, to indicate in the request
    the required response mode, and also the required response time. Note Discussion
    and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</p>"
