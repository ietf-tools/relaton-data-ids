abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the common architecture for Multicast Security
    (MSEC) key management protocols to support a variety of application, transport,
    and network layer security protocols. It also defines the group security association
    (GSA), and describes the key management protocols that help establish a GSA. The
    framework and guidelines described in this document permit a modular and flexible
    design of group key management protocols for a variety of different settings that
    are specialized to applications needs. MSEC key management protocols may be used
    to facilitate secure one-to-many, many-to-many, or one-to-one communication. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
