abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IETF protocols may use of cryptographic algorithms to provide
    confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation. Communicating peers must support
    the same cryptographic algorithm or algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.
    This memo provides guidelines for ensuring that such a protocol has the ability
    to migrate from one algorithm to another over time.</p>"
