abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents the requirements of burst-level control in order
    to improve channel efficiency in optical networks. By processing and control the
    finer granularity of burst data, the network can improve its utilization than
    the present circuit switching based optical networks. Implementation issues of
    transmission and switching for data burst are took into consideration.</p>"
