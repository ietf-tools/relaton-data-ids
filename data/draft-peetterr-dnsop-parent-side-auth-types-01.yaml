abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS RR types with numbers in the range 0xFA00-0xFDFF are now included
    in special treatment like DS RR type specified in [RFC4035]. Authoritative servers,
    DNSSEC signers, and recursive resolvers need to extend the conditions for DS special
    handling to also include this range. This means: being authoritative on the parent
    side of a delegation; being signed by the parent; being provided along with delegations
    by the parent. DNSSEC validators also need to implement downgrade protection described
    in Section 5.3.</p>"
