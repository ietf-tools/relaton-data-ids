abstract:
- content: "<p>Some functionalities (e.g. fragmentation/reassembly and Encapsulating
    Security Payload) provided by IPv6 can be viewed as independent of IPv6 or even
    IP entirely. This document proposes to provide those functionalities at different
    layers (e.g., MPLS, BIER or even Ethernet) independent of IP.</p>"
