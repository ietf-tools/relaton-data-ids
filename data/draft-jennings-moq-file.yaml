abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides a way to save the meta data about each
    MoQ Object in one or more files as well as pointers to other files that contain
    the contents of the object. Separating of the meta data and payload data allow
    the payload data to remain in files that are used for other purposes such as serving
    HLS/DASH video. This format makes it easier to test and develop caching relays
    and create test data they can serve to client.</p>"
