abstract:
- content: "<p>In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But
    in practice, there is. Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut This document discusses a number
    of differences between the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 [1] and RFC
    1195 [3] and the protocol as it is deployed today. These differences are discussed
    as a service to those implementing, testing, and deploying the IS-IS Protocol
    to route IP traffic.</p>"
