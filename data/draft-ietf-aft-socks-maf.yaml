abstract:
- content: "<p>SOCKS V5 [RFC 1928] provides a means to select one from among a number
    of authentication methods but does not provide any means for utilizing multiple
    authentication methods to obtain certain desired authentication properties. MAF
    is a client-initiated but server-managed framework. MAF relies on a trusted Authentication
    Management Server (AMS) to: 1) Select the authentication methods to be invoked,
    2) order the execution of methods at the client, as appropriate, and 3) assign
    integrity grades to the final, composite authentication after all methods that
    were invoked have completed.</p>"
