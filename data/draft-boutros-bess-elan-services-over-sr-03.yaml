abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new approach for deploying Ethernet LAN (ELAN)
    services with an objective of achieving high scalability, faster network convergence,
    and reduced operational complexity. Furthermore, it naturally brings the benefits
    of All-Active multihoming as well as MAC learning in data-plane.</p>"
