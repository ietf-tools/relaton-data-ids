abstract:
- content: "<p>A new layer of encapsulation is required with RBridges. A previous
    Internet Draft [2] (draft-bryant-perlman-trill-pwe-encap-00) proposes an encapsulation
    header that contains a Nickname, a flag, TTL and CoS. This document introduces
    additional fields, and gives arguments for their usefulness. As a result the encapsulation
    header needs to be expanded and will no longer be able to be in MPLS format. The
    WG will need to decide on the tradeoffs between this additional functionality,
    and compatibility with an existing (MPLS) format.</p>"
