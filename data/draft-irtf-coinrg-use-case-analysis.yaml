abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing in the Network (COIN) has the potential to enable a wide
    variety of use cases. The diversity in use cases makes challenges in defining
    general considerations. This document analyzes the use cases described in its
    companion document and potentially explores additional settings, to identify general
    aspects of interest across all use cases. The insights gained from this analysis
    will guide future COIN discussions.</p>"
