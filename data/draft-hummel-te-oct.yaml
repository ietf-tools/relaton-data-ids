abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes to engineer traffic such that we can speak of an
    Orchestrally Conducted Traffic (OCT): Any traffic stream (given by its source
    and destination nodes and by a priority class) may use several differently routed
    LSPs. Each, traffic stream ingress reports, periodically, the currently measured
    traffic load (in bitrate) to a common TE Conductor (TEC) who evaluates them as
    to forecast what traffic load change might occur in the immediate time ahead.
    Accordingly the TEC computes well synchronized likelihood values by which to take
    which route/LSP. These values will be such that any traffic stream will be served
    as good as possible, as often as possible, while equally ranked traffic streams
    are treated fair, higher ranked streams are prioritized and the network thruput
    is maximized. The TEC sends the likelihood values to the respective ingress node,
    who will distribute the received packets of the traffic stream to the pertaining
    LSPs accordingly.</p>"
