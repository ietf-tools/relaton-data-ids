abstract:
- content: <p>Hierarchical Carrier Supporting Carrier deployments involve a Carrier
    Core which hereinafter is called the Tier-1 provider and two or more VPN sites
    that are carriers themselves hereinafter called Tier-2 providers that offer MPLS
    VPN services to their own customers. In such cases normally LDP is used to distribute
    labels amongst the routers (P and PE devices) in the Tier-2 provider's sites.
    When RSVP based TE-LSPs are constructed to explicitly route traffic for Tier-2
    ISP's customers from the Tier-2 PEs to the CE of the Tier-1 provider and such
    TE-LSPs exist on multiple sites of the Tier-2 provider, the Tier-2 ISP may require
    splicing together through an "auto-match-and- splice-together" facility such that
    traffic flows from the PE of the Tier-2 ISP through the TE-LSP onto the CE of
    the Tier-1 ISP and then onto the other site and takes a path through a specific
    TE-LSP from the CE of the other site to the destination Tier-2 PE and then onto
    the final customer. This solution offers a lot of advantages such as providing
    adequate assurance that the bandwidth for the traffic flowing through these spliced
    TE-LSPs is met. It also provides a explicit routing of the traffic rather than
    through the regular LDP (which follows IGP) scenarios. Such explicitly routed
    TE-LSPs would have been constructed taking into account factors such as using
    under-utilized links for example. Splicing together these TE-LSPs in various sites
    and doing the splicing on an auto-match based on bandwidth or delay metrics would
    be a good service to offer to the Tier-2 ISPs customers. This draft outlines a
    scheme that offers such a feature and service to the Tier-2 ISPs through the addition
    of certain additional label exchanges and some additional labels such as the RSVP-stitch
    label and the RSVP-splicing-LDP label in the label stack which can be used to
    splice together these tunnels. In case of re-optimization of the LSP end-to-end
    there is a wide variety of choices for the near-end PE to hook up with a suitable
    far-end tunnel in the other Tier-2 site. Explicit tunnel setup can be obviated
    by merely choosing from a set of already constructed tunnels based on criterion
    that may involve various parameters. Also fast-reroute in case of remote tunnel
    failure is taken care of.</p>
