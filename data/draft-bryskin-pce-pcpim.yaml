abstract:
- content: "<p>The Policy-Enabled Path Computation Framework [PCE-POLICY] introduced
    the use of the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM), [RFC3060], as a framework
    for supporting path computation policy within the context of the Path Computation
    Element (PCE)-Based Architecture, [RFC4655]. This document defines the Path Computation
    Policy Information Model (PCPIM), which provides the specifics of using PCIM as
    the method for supporting path computation policy. PCPIM includes classes that
    model constraints, conditions, actions, variables and values associated with supporting
    path computation policy. While PCPIM was conceived to operate within the path
    computation element (PCE)-based architecture, it can be applied to any path computation
    methodology.</p>"
