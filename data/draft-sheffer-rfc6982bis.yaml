abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations by including an Implementation Status
    section. This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration
    to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence
    of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
    more mature. This process is not mandatory. Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged
    to consider using the process for their documents, and working groups are invited
    to think about applying the process to all of their protocol specifications. This
    document obsoletes RFC 6982, advancing it to a Best Current Practice.</p>"
