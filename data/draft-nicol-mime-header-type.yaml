abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the problems encountered in serving documents over the WWW is
    the correct generation of the MIME fields required by the HTTP protocol, and in
    particular, generating the correct MIME type for body content. This memo defines
    a file format that can be used to aid in the correct generation of such fields,
    and how servers should interpret the file format. Use of this file format can
    also benefit other protocols such as FTP.</p>"
