abstract:
- content: "<p>Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is one of the foreseen future forms
    of spamming that SIP open-wide networks may have to handle. SPIT also has more
    impact on users than email spam since it is more intrusive. Email as a store-and-forward
    communication mechanism allows for several filtering mechanisms to be applied
    to the full content before being presented to the user. Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) interaction is, in contrast, real-time communication and therefore does
    not provide much information prior to the transmission of the content, making
    it both harder to filter and more annoying to users. The responsibility for filtering,
    blocking calls, or taking any other preventive action can belong to different
    elements in the call flow and may depend on various factors. This document discusses
    the requirements to define authorization policies that should allow end users
    or other parties to setup anti-SPIT policies for triggering these actions. These
    policies typically match a particular SIP communication pattern based on a number
    of attributes. The range of attributes includes information provided, for example,
    by the SIP protocol itself, by the SIP identity mechanism, by information carried
    within SAML assertions or by reputation systems of social networks.</p>"
