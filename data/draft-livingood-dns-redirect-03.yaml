abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called
    DNS Redirect services deployed today by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), DNS
    Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other organizations providing so-called
    DNS Redirect services via their recursive DNS servers, as well as to describe
    the recommended practices regarding relating to DNS redirect. This document specifically
    and narrowly addresses those cases where DNS Redirect is being utilized to provide
    a web error redirect service to end users, and describes the critical implications
    for DNS Redirect when DNSSEC is deployed.</p>"
