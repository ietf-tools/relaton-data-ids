abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an extension to the [CAP] protocol and can be used within [iTIP]
    objects. A CU may wish to invite a UPN to an event where the UPN does not have
    a account on the CU's CS. This memo describes two methods to dynamically create
    UPNs in order for those UPNs to gain access to the 'Organizers' CS. This memo
    also includes a description of how to include an [OTP] challenge in an object
    directed to a CU. The CUA must compute the password in order to respond to the
    object. This challenge and its response can be sent in the clear as the values
    are computed using a secret that would not be known to anyone snooping the line.</p>"
