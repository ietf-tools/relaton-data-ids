abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has no guidance
    for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents. The Dynamic
    Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) states that IPsec should be used
    to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents, but does not recommend
    encryption. And, with recent concerns about pervasive monitoring it is appropriate
    to provide recommendations for DHCPv4 and also improve the recommendations for
    DHCPv6. This document updates RFC1542 and RFC3315.</p>"
