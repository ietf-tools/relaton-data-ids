abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is the key protocol of IPv6 first-hop. ND uses
    multicast extensively and trusts all hosts. In some scenarios like wireless networks,
    multicast can be inefficient. In other scenarios like public access networks,
    hosts may not be trustable. Consequently, ND issues may happen in various scenarios.
    The issues and solutions are documented in more than 30 RFCs. It is difficult
    to keep track of all these issues and solutions, and how the various solutions
    fit together. Therefore, deployment guidelines are needed. This document firstly
    summarizes the known ND issues and optimization solutions into a one-stop reference.
    Analyzing these solutions reveals an insight: isolating hosts is effective in
    solving ND issues. Four isolation methods are proposed and their applicability
    is discussed. Guidelines are then described for selecting a suitable isolation
    method based on the deployment scenario.</p>"
