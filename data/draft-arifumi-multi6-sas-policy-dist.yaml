abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for the distribution of source address
    selection policy from ISPs to gateway routers for consumers and from the gateways
    to end nodes. This method is particularly effective when a consumer site has multiple
    address blocks. Every end node is guided by the policy in selecting an appropriate
    source address for each destination address and every gateway is guided by the
    policy in forwarding packets to appropriate next-hop ISPs. This makes it possible
    for an end node to set a connection up without being concerned about failures
    of transfer due to ingress filtering by the ISPs, for ISP operators to manage
    consumers' behavior and networking policy, and for consumers to be provided with
    networks that are almost automatically robust and reliable.</p>"
