abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet access through public networks require authentication of clients
    and networks to each other. While there are currently used link-layer protocols
    such as PPP, it is very desirable to provide a network-layer solution that can
    work across multiple types of links. Authentication of roaming clients is generally
    handled by AAA protocols. In order to use AAA between the network and the client,
    we need a protocol to carry required messages. This draft defines how we can extend
    the standard router discovery protocol to use it as a carrier for the authentication
    purposes.</p>"
