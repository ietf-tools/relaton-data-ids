abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the ACME protocol [RFC8555]
    that enables Acme server to use the public key authentication protocol to verify
    that the real certificate applicant behind the Acme client has control over the
    identity and to ensure strong consistency between the identity in the challenge
    phase and the identity of the final certificate issued. This document also proposes
    a process extension for removing CSR at the certificate application phase.</p>"
