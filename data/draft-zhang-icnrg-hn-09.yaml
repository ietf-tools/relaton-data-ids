abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds
    of information including resources, services and data. With many proposals of
    novel network architectures emerging, such as DONA, ICN NDN, the location-based
    routing starts to transfer to the content based ones. Currently, it is incompatible
    that many different information naming schemes are adopted in different network
    proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The
    proposed naming scheme adopts a hybrid naming structure, which includes hierarchical
    component, flat component and attribute component. The hybrid naming (hn) scheme
    enables to identify different routing information uniformly, and provides many
    great advantages, such as high aggregation, limited length, suffix holes remission,
    fuzzy matching support, high security and good compatibility with IPv4/IPv6, DONA,
    CCN/NDN and so on.</p>"
