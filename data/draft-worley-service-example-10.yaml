abstract:
- content: <p>The "music on hold" feature is one of the most desired features of telephone
    systems in the business environment. "Music on hold" is where, when one party
    to a call has the call "on hold", that party's telephone provides an audio stream
    (often music) to be heard by the other party. Architectural features of SIP make
    it difficult to implement music-on-hold in a way that is fully compliant with
    the standards. The implementation of music-on-hold described in this document
    is fully effective and standards-compliant, and has a number of advantages over
    the methods previously documented. In particular, it is less likely to produce
    peculiar user interface effects and more likely to work in systems which perform
    authentication than the method of RFC 5359.</p>
