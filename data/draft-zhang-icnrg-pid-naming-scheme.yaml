abstract:
- content: "<p>In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable
    object or entity with a name, such as a named data chunk, a device, or a service
    end. Different from host-centric connectivity, ICN connects named entities using
    name-based routing and forwarding. At the same time, network entities, end devices,
    and applications have variant demands to verify the integrity and authenticity
    of these entities through names. This document proposes a generic naming schema
    called PID, which supports trust provenance, content lookup, routing, and inter-domain
    resolution for ICN. With PID schema, a name consists of three components: principal(s),
    identifier(s), and domain(s). In this draft, we only illustrate the principle
    and concept of PID and the functional role of each component, and leave encoding
    approaches as implementation options.</p>"
