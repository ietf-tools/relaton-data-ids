abstract:
- content: "<p>Increased diversity and abuse of access, across the open Internet,
    mandates additional accountability for sending SMTP clients, in the absence of
    prior, direct arrangement with receiving SMTP servers. One means for enabling
    this is by registration with third-party services that vouch for the policies
    and accountability of SMTP clients accessing SMTP servers. This specification
    defines a means for an SMTP client to list third-party services that are prepared
    to vouch for it, and a means for an SMTP server, or its intermediary, to query
    vouching services.</p>"
