abstract:
- content: "<p>STUN has proven to be a popular mechanism for providing basic NAT traversal
    capabilities for UDP traffic. As it has matured it has become an attractive target
    for extensions that move away from STUN's discovery function towards explicit
    communication with middleboxes -- in other words, as an on-path signaling protocol.
    This document describes a more generalized framework for using STUN for solving
    on- path signaling problems.</p>"
