abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the Pan European in- vehicle emergency call
    service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally
    referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special
    form of emergency calls placed by vehicles. eCall deployment is required by 2015
    in European Union member states, and eCall (and eCall-compatible systems) are
    also being deployed in other regions. eCall provides an integrated voice path
    and a standardized set of vehicle, sensor (e.g., crash related), and location
    data. An eCall is recognized and handled as a specialized form of emergency call
    and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)
    capable of processing the vehicle data and trained in handling emergency calls
    from vehicles. Currently, eCall functions over circuit-switched cellular telephony;
    work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall, sometimes called packet- switched eCall
    or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this document assists in that work by describing
    how to support eCall within the IP-based emergency services infrastructure. This
    document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency Call Additional Data
    Block for the eCall vehicle data.</p>
