abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a solution suite for TRILL data center sites
    to be connected over WAN networks. TRILL protocol is primarily designed to work
    within intra-data centers. Connecting different sites over WAN using overlay tunnel
    protocols is the primary method employed at present. Though this presents a simple
    mechanism to extend the LAN sites to be interconnected, it also brings in the
    problem of scalability for TRILL nicknames exchanged between sites, latency, duplication
    of traffic etc. This draft proposes a way to extend the TRILL sites without having
    to reveal the data of the LAN like customer MAC's or provide MAC's over the WAN,
    but to establish connections between various sites by extending routing protocol
    to exchange minimal information, thus reducing the information flow to the required
    sites only. Document also proposes BGP routing protocol extensions as an example
    to establish paths and information about the essential RBridges nicknames, over
    WAN networks like MPLS.</p>"
