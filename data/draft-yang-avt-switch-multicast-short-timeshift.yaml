abstract:
- content: "<p>When a client requests a time-shift service for a multicast session
    using RTP for media transport, like pause, instant replay, slow- motion video,
    frame-by-frame viewing, rewind, fast-forward, etc., it needs to switch from multicast
    session to unicast session. This unicast session will always serve for the time-shift
    service unless the client manually switches back to the multicast session. Actually
    a time- shift request may happens for all clients. That is, multicast session
    stream will be replaced by many unicast time-shift streams having significant
    impact on network bandwidth usage. In this document, we describe a method using
    existing RTP and RTCP protocol infrastructure that switches back to multicast
    session from unicast session of time-shift. In this method, a burst RTP flow which
    is a little faster than the primary multicast rate may be transmitted so that
    unicast session may catch up and switch back to multicast session.</p>"
