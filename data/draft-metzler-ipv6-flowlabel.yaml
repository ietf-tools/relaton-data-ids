abstract:
- content: "<p>IP version 6 is specified in [1], but it specifies not completely the
    usage of the flow label field that is contained in the IPv6 Header. This document
    specifies a potential use of the IPv6 flow label that provide to applications
    access to the flow label so as to distinguish between several flows within the
    application. This results in basic requirements on the handling of the flow label
    within the network.</p>"
