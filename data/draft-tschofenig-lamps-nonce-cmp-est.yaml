abstract:
- content: "<p>Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) and Enrollment over Secure Transport
    (EST) define protocol messages for X.509v3 certificate creation and management.
    Both protocol provide interactions between client systems and PKI management entities,
    such as a Registration Authority (RA) and a Certification Authority (CA). CMP
    and EST allow an RA/CA to request additional information it has to provide in
    a certification request. When an end entity places attestation Evidence in a Certificate
    Signing Request (CSR) it may need to demonstrate freshness of the provided Evidence.
    Attestation technology today often accomplishes this task via the help of nonces.
    This document specifies how nonces are provided by an RA/CA to the end entity
    for inclusion in Evidence.</p>"
