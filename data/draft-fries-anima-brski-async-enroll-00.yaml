abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the enhancement of automated bootstrapping
    of a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to operate in domains featuring
    no or only timely limited connectivity to backend services offering enrollment
    functionality like a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In the context of deploying
    new devices the design of BRSKI allows for online (synchronous object exchange)
    and offline interactions (asynchronous object exchange) with a manufacturer's
    authorization service. It utilizes a self-contained voucher to transport the domain
    credentials as a signed object to establish an initial trust between the pledge
    and the deployment domain. The currently supported enrollment protocol for request
    and distribution of deployment domain specific device certificates provides only
    limited support for asynchronous PKI interactions. This memo motivates support
    of self-contained objects also for certificate management by using an abstract
    notation to allow off-site operation of PKI services, with only limited connectivity
    to the pledge deployment domain. This addresses specifically scenarios, in which
    the deployment domain of a pledge does not perform the final authorization of
    a certification request and rather delegates this decision to an operator backend.
    The goal is to enable the usage of existing and potentially new PKI protocols
    supporting self- containment for certificate management.</p>"
