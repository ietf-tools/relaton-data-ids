abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a method for annotating XML schemas expressed in
    the RELAX NG language and transforming them to a form suitable for direct inclusion
    in an XML source of an I-D or RFC. The XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)
    stylesheet performing the transformation also automatically generates cross- references
    between RELAX NG pattern definitions and their references.</p>"
