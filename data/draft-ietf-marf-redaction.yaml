abstract:
- content: "<p>Email messages often contain information that might be considered private
    or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms. When such a message becomes
    the subject of a report intended to be shared with other entities, the report
    generator may wish to redact or elide the sensitive portions of the message. This
    memo suggests one method for doing so effectively. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
