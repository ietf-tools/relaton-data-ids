abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for the communication between
    Border Routers (BR) and a Bandwidth Broker (BB) in a MPLS/DiffServ core network.
    This architecture is based on the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol and
    defines a new Client Type extension for it. This specification applies basically
    to intra-domain MPLS/DiffServ network scenarios. However, the same extensions
    to COPS are suitable for inter-domain communications, when MPLS Label Switched
    Paths (LSP) with QoS-DiffServ guarantees are established across multiple MPLS/DiffServ
    islands. Therefore, this document provides also a simple and efficient model for
    inter-BB communication.</p>"
