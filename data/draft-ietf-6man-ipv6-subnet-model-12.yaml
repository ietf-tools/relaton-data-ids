abstract:
- content: '<p>IPv6 specifies a model of a subnet that is different than the IPv4
    subnet model. The subtlety of the differences has resulted in incorrect implementations
    that do not interoperate. This document spells out the most important difference:
    that an IPv6 address isn''t automatically associated with an IPv6 on-link prefix.
    This document also updates (partially due to security concerns caused by incorrect
    implementations) a part of the definition of "on-link" from RFC 4861. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
