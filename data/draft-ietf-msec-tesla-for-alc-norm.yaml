abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details the Timed Efficient Stream \\%Loss-Tolerant Authentication
    (TESLA) packet source authentication and packet integrity verification protocol
    and its integration within the Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) and NACK-Oriented
    Reliable Multicast (NORM) content delivery protocols. This document only considers
    the authentication/integrity verification of the packets generated by the session's
    sender. The authentication and integrity verification of the packets sent by receivers,
    if any, is out of the scope of this document. This document defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
