abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an enhancement to the Stateless Cookie mechanism
    described in RFC 5996. Whereas the original mechanism prevents denial-of-service
    (DoS) attacks that use multiple spoofed source addresses, the mechanism here is
    effective against a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS), where the attackers
    use their own source address. This is accomplished by requiring proof of work
    by the Initiator before allocating resources at the Responder.</p>"
