abstract:
- content: "<p>LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP-based transport for control plane to
    establish the data session and user plane for actual data delivery. In existing
    architecture, IP transport used in the user plane is not optimized for data transport,
    which leads to an inefficient data delivery. IP unicast routing from server to
    clients is used for delivery of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE), where
    each user gets a separate stream. From a bandwidth and routing perspective, this
    approach is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast technologies have emerged recently
    for mobile networks, but their deployments are very limited or at an experimental
    stage due to complex architecture and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly
    emerging technology with built-in features for efficient multimedia data delivery.
    However much of the work is focused on fixed networks. The focus of this draft
    is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks by using ICN in a 3GPP
    protocol stack. ICN has an inherent capability for multicast, anchorless mobility
    and security, and it is optimized for data delivery using local caching at the
    edge. The proposed approaches in this draft allow ICN to be enabled natively over
    the current LTE stack comprising PDCP/RLC/MAC/ PHY, or in a dual stack mode (along
    with IP). These approaches can help optimize the mobile networks by leveraging
    the inherent benefits of ICN. This document is a product of the Information-Centric
    Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
