abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a summary of the work of the ACE design team of the
    Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Working Group. If the IDN WG selects a single
    ACE, the design team suggests DUDE. There are many factors that the IDN WG might
    consider that may lead it to choose a different ACE; those factors and proposals
    that some of the design team members favored are also described in this document.</p>"
