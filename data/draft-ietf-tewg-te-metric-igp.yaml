abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a common practice on how the existing metric
    of Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) can be used as an alternative metric to the
    Traffic Engineering (TE) metric for Constraint Based Routing of MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering tunnels. This effectively results in
    the ability to perform Constraint Based Routing with optimization of one metric
    (e.g., link bandwidth) for some Traffic Engineering tunnels (e.g., Data Trunks)
    while optimizing another metric (e.g., propagation delay) for some other tunnels
    with different requirements (e.g., Voice Trunks). No protocol extensions or modifications
    are required. This text documents current router implementations and deployment
    practices. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
    Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
