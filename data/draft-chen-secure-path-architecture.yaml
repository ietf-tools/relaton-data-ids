abstract:
- content: "<p>Some users need to choose nodes that meet security requirements to
    form secure routing and ensure that traffic can defend against dynamic attacks
    during path forwarding. In this architecture, there are four roles defined: attester,
    authorizer, controller and secfunction, the interaction of these four roles can
    achieve the selection of secure routing and security services. The purpose of
    this architecture is to secure the routing, including node static security assessment,
    dynamic security defense, and routing path and security service consistency validation.</p>"
