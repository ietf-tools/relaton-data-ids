abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the problems of audio codecs with variable external
    sampling rates. Historically, for audio codecs, the RTP timestamp frequency was
    chosen to match the sampling rate of the audio codec. However, this choice is
    nowadays more difficult to justify, because of the advent of audio codecs (and,
    even more important, practical use cases) that support multiple sample rates and
    the switch between the sample rates during the lifetime of an RTP session. This
    Internet draft addresses the problem by suggesting that RTP Payload RFCs for such
    codecs to utilize a single, high, unified RTP timestamp frequency.</p>"
