abstract:
- content: "<p>Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on environments
    covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.) and IP/MPLS Packet switched
    networks. However, there is minimal documentation on GMPLS support of Layer-2
    Label Switched Paths (L2 LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet LSPs, Asynchronous Transfer
    Mode (ATM) LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. This document provides a framework
    for GMPLS in support of L2 LSPs in several network environments, in particular,
    Ethernet.</p>"
