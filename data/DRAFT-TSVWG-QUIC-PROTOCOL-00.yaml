abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>   QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and
    secure\n   transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for\n
    \  HTTP/2 semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application\n   protocol,
    QUIC builds on decades of transport and security\n   experience, and implements
    mechanisms that make it attractive as a\n   modern general-purpose transport.
    \ QUIC provides multiplexing and\n   flow control equivalent to HTTP/2, security
    equivalent to TLS, and\n   connection semantics, reliability, and congestion control
    equivalent\n   to TCP.\n\n\t </p>\n      "
