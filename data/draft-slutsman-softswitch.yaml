abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of this document is to identify and propose a new work item
    for the IETF. To this end, the document defines the term 'software switch' for
    the purposes of describing a mechanism by which existing PSTN Intelligent Network
    (IN) service control can be reused in IP networks. IP telephony is one application
    that can benefit from this mechanism, but there are other potential applications
    of interest (for example, Unified Messaging) which this draft does not address.
    Specifically, the document illustrates the role of the software switch in IP telephony.
    The document then narrows, for practical purposes, the scope of the software switch
    so as to identify an architecture and mechanism for interworking of Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and Intelligent Network Application Part Protocol (INAP). The so
    defined mechanism can be implemented as an application layer protocol, when architectural
    entities reside in different machines, or inter-process communications protocol,
    if they reside in the same machine. It is the proposal of this document to define
    at a minimum a meta-protocol (from which particular implementations can be derived)
    as a work item in the IETF. Some (but not all) parts of this work have already
    been discussed in the IETF. To help delineating the proposed work item, this Internet
    draft explains how it relates to the efforts of the existing IETF working groups
    that deal with the protocols for PSTN/Internet interworking (IPTEL, MEGACO, PINT,
    SPIRITS, and SIGTRAN) and ITU-T.</p>"
