abstract:
- content: "<p>This document affirms that the governance and activities of the IETF
    must be inclusive, accessible, and safe for all individuals, regardless of geography,
    language, race, gender, or sexual orientation. While the IETF promotes global
    Internet standards for everyone, structural and contextual barriers still limit
    the full and equal participation of many stakeholders, particularly from underrepresented
    regions and marginalized communities. This draft proposes key principles and recommendations
    to ensure that IETF meetings and processes reflect the foundational values of
    openness, diversity, inclusion, and non-discrimination.</p>"
