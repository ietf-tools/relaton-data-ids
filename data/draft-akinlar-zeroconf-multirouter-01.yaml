abstract:
- content: "<p>Zero Configuration (Zeroconf) Networks are a particular class of TCP/IP
    networks that may be established in the home, in small offices or even for a variety
    of adhoc purposes. Zeroconf networks do not have and should not be expected to
    have user configurable network infrastructure such as DHCP, DNS and other administered
    network services. This is because typical zeroconf network users neither have
    the skill nor the desire to configure, administer or manage a network [1]. The
    IETF Zeroconf Requirements draft [1] presents the zeroconf protocol requirements
    for 4 areas: IP host configuration, domain name to IP address resolution, IP multicast
    address allocation, and service discovery. This draft builds on [1] and lists
    the zeroconf protocol requirements for IP router configuration and dynamic routing
    protocol in multi-router zeroconf networks. The IETF Zeroconf Requirements draft
    [1] presents the zeroconf protocol requirements for 4 areas: IP host configuration,
    domain name to IP address resolution, IP multicast address allocation, and service
    discovery. The most complex network topology addressed by the Zeroconf Requirements
    document [1] is a multi-segment zeroconf network connected by a single router.
    This drafts builds on that draft and lists the zeroconf protocol requirements
    for IP router configuration and dynamic routing protocols in multi-router zeroconf
    networks.</p>"
