abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for signaling a PE router's tunnel
    encapsulation capabilities. One example is its capability to encapsulate MPLS
    using dynamic GRE and/or IP. This is applicable when a MPLS packet is tunneled
    using dynamic GRE and/or IP encapsulation [MPLS-IP-GRE] between PE routers. For
    instance the MPLS packet may be a 2547 based MPLS VPN packet [2547bis], a layer
    2 packet transported using MPLS [MARTINI], a MPLS tunneled IPv6 packet or a MPLS
    IPv6 VPN packet [BGP-VPN-IPv6]. Adding such a mechanism has several benefits.
    It helps in blackhole avoidance and eases transitioning from MPLS tunneling based
    Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs to GRE/IP tunneling based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs (and vice
    versa). Such a mechanism is needed where a network may be using MPLS and GRE (or
    IP) for tunneling, simultaneously in different parts of the network. It can help
    in encapsulation selection when multiple tunneling technologies are supported.</p>"
