abstract:
- content: "<p>The security problems in the internet are due to inherent problems
    in the TCP/IP stack. The purpose of this draft is to brief on some of the measures
    to prevent security attacks in TCP/IP network, by changing some of the ways in
    which the TCP/IP protocol stack works. The security attacks which are addressed
    in this draft are: 1) ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing and MAC address
    cloning 2) TCP Initial sequence number prediction This version offers backward
    compatibility with cards that do not support the security features mentioned in
    this draft. In view of this, changes have been made to section 2.3 and a new section
    (Section 2.4) has been added.</p>"
