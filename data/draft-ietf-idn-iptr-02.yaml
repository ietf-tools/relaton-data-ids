abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft attempts to address the problem of how an IP address should
    be properly mapped to a set of internationalized domain names(iDNs). It is currently
    unspecified how a PTR record can be used for this purpose. In addition, the syntax
    of the PTR resource record may be too restrictive for such a mapping in a more
    culturally meaningful context. This document suggests a new TYPE called IPTR using
    EDNS0 and a mechanism to combind language information with such a mapping.</p>"
