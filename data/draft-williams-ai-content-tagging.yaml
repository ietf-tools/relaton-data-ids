abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a classification and tagging system designed
    to identify and preserve the provenance of digital content (text, audio, video,
    and other media) to ensure the integrity of training datasets for machine learning
    systems. The framework described herein aims to support a standardized mechanism
    for tagging data with metadata that specifies whether the content was human-generated
    or AI-generated. This enables the exclusion of AI-generated data from training
    corpora where human-originated material is required, and it facilitates the maintenance
    of clean, verifiable sources for future AI development.</p>"
