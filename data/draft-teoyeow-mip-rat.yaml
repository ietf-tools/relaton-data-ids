abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability for
    mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is accessible
    by its home address, regardless of its current location in the Internet. When
    away from home, the mobile node acquires a care-of address indicating its current
    location. It registers the care-of address with a registration server (RS). The
    RS setups a reverse twice network address translation (RAT) table on a RAT device.
    The RAT device transparently routes datagrams destined for the mobile node's home
    address to the care-of address by reverse twice network address translation. The
    protocol requirements for the mobile node is minimal. End-users can have mobility
    support easily as registration is done using widely available applications.</p>"
