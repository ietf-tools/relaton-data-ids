abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the problem of authentication and authorization
    in distributed environments constituted by several users communicating with application
    servers and communicating with each others. Each user in this environment can
    also play the role of an application provider. Imagine a large music event where
    the provided network infrastructure is enhanced with network storage equipment
    to allow visitors to access content relating to the bands playing at the events,
    such as recorded video of previous performances, supplementary audio and video
    material relevant to the bands playing, etc. Certain content is, however, not
    necessarily available to everyone under the same conditions. Instead access control
    is applied before the full range of audio, and video material can be accessed.
    Other content, such as previews, might be offered for free. How can such authentication,
    and authorization infrastructure be made available with minimal configuration
    complexity for a temporary event like a music festival? This document describes
    a problem statement based on the attempt to use Kerberos and lists a couple of
    requirements for potentially needed Kerberos extensions.</p>"
