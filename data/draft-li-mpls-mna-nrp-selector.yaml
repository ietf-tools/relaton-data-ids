abstract:
- content: "<p>An IETF Network Slice service provides connectivity coupled with a
    set of network resource commitments and is expressed in terms of one or more connectivity
    constructs. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a collection of resources identified
    in the underlay network to support IETF Network Slice services. A Slice-Flow Aggregate
    refers to the set of traffic streams from one or more connectivity constructs
    belonging to one or more IETF Network Slices that are mapped to a specific NRP
    and provided the same forwarding treatment. The packets associated with a Slice-Flow
    Aggregate may carry a marking in the packet's network layer header to identify
    this association and this marking is referred to as NRP Selector. The NRP Selector
    is used to map the packet to the associated NRP and provide the corresponding
    forwarding treatment to the packet. MPLS Network Actions (MNA) technologies are
    used to indicate actions for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and/or MPLS packets and
    to transfer data needed for these actions. This document discusses options for
    using MPLS Network Actions (MNAs) to carry the NRP Selector in MPLS packets.</p>"
