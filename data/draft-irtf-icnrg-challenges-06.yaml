abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes research challenges for Information-Centric Networking
    (ICN), an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to directly support information
    distribution by introducing uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.
    Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation,
    enabling or enhancing a number of desirable features, such as security, user mobility,
    multicast, and in-network caching. Mechanisms for realizing these benefits is
    the subject of ongoing research in the IRTF and elsewhere. This document describes
    current research challenges in ICN, including naming, security, routing, system
    scalability, mobility management, wireless networking, transport services, in-network
    caching, and network management. This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric
    Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</p>"
