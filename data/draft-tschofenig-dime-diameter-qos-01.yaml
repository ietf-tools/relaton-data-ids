abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Diameter application that performs Authentication,
    Authorization, and Accounting for Quality of Service (QoS) reservations. This
    protocol is used by elements along the path of a given application flow to authenticate
    a reservation request, ensure that the reservation is authorized, and to account
    for resources consumed during the lifetime of the application flow. Clients that
    implement the Diameter QoS application contact an authorizing entity/application
    server that is located somewhere in the network, allowing for a wide variety of
    flexible deployment models.</p>"
