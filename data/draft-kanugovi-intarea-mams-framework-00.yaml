abstract:
- content: "<p>In multiconnectivity scenarios the end-user devices can simultaneously
    connect to multiple networks based on different access technologies and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. Both the quality of experience of the users
    and the overall network utilization and efficiency may be improved through a smart
    selection and combination of access and core network paths that can dynamically
    adapt to changing network conditions. This document presents the problem statement
    and proposes solution principles. It specifies the requirements and architecture
    for the multi-access management services framework that can be used to 1) flexibly
    select the best combination of access and core network paths for uplink and downlink,
    as well as 2) determining the user plane treatment and traffic distribution over
    the selected links ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced application
    performance.</p>"
