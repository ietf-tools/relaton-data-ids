abstract:
- content: "<p>Smart metering deployments in residential settings introduce the prospects
    of ad-hoc deployment of internetworked IPv6 customer premise equipment (CPE).
    WiFi access points, cable boxes and other home devices with internet access could
    all be internetworked with smart metering devices by customers with no data networking
    expertise resulting in a complex multi-segment network with differing prefixes,
    routing support and service discovery needs.</p>"
