abstract:
- content: "<p>Homomorphic encryption is an algorithm that allows computations to
    be performed on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. This document
    provides a homomorphic cryptographic protocol that supports addition and multiplication
    in the ciphertext state. In this document, the proposed protocol can be used to
    protect user privacy in measurement information collection and statistics by using
    homomorphic encryption. And let the collector server receive the computation results
    without having to acknowledge the information plaintext of each individual client.</p>"
