abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a practical solution for the security of SNMP
    packets. It allows any SNMP packet to be transmitted with strong authentication
    information. Packets can be optionally encrypted for full security. This encapsulation
    protocol is designed to allow implementations to meet USA export requirements.
    It supports SNMPv1 [2], SNMPv2 [11], and will support any future SNMP protocol
    enhancements. It can be added transparently so that investment in existing SNMP
    protocol stacks can be preserved. Administration is kept simple, in particular
    public key management and time synchronization. This encapsulation scales well
    to large numbers of managers and agents. It is designed to facilitate implementation
    and to minimize troubleshooting with extensive error reporting mechanisms.</p>"
