abstract:
- content: "<p>An end-to-end email security solution is proposed by implementing both
    DANE and DMARC protocols. DMARC enables the recipient's mail server, with a method
    to verify the sender's ingenuity. DANE intends to mitigate the MITM attack, by
    enabling the sender a method to authenticate the recipient's mail domain. DANE
    and DMARC therefore complement each other by allowing the sender to verify the
    recipient's domain, and the recipient to verify the sender's address respectively.</p>"
