abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the efficient mechanism to set up and maintain
    the LSP for the economy class services (called ES-LSP: Economy class Services
    LSP). The mechanism is to reduce the overload of MPLS networks and to continue
    the economy class services when the ES-LSP is failed. There are two parts to fulfill
    this mechanism. Firstly, it is to minimize the information to establish and to
    keep the ES-LSP. Secondly, in this mechanism, the nodes adjacent to the failure
    point may switch over the data packet to IP forwarding instead of MPLS label swapping.
    On the other hand, the adjacent nodes switch over the data packets to the label
    swapping of MPLS at the restoration of the failure. However, in general, the ES-LSP
    session is withdrawn, the ES-LSP itself is reestablished into the different route
    or the ES is discontinued by the ES-LSP failure[1]. Thus, for the service continuity
    of the failed ES-LSP, this mechanism uses the hybrid data forwarding of MPLS label
    swapping and IP forwarding.</p>"
