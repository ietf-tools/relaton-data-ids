abstract:
- content: "<p>The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF were
    created more than ten years ago. Since then, there has been considerable change
    in the tasks and in our own expectations. The IETF community has discussed these
    changes and the problems they cause. The community has some sense of the properties
    they expect from future arrangements, including structural and organizational
    changes, changes to volunteer and staff personnel resources, and transparency
    changes. This document is a product of a design team, focused on providing additional
    information to the community about solution options, as well as supporting analysis
    of the implications of those options. To be clear, the community is responsible
    for adopting any recommendations or making any final decisions.</p>"
