abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    'DTMFAD' to allow the use of SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY to collect DTMF signals. This
    package is required to implement Committee T1 Technical Report T1.TR.82-2003.
    The 'DTMFAD' event package requires the definition of two new Event header field
    parameters. This package also requires the use of a new MIME type, application/DTMF-event,
    to allow for the transfer of DTMF data in the NOTIFY body. Registration of this
    MIME type is also provided in this document. This document has been produced,
    on behalf of Committee T1, as part of the IANA registration process.</p>"
