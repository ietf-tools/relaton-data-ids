abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the main questions posed during recent discussions on distributed
    mobility architectures is if the distributed architecture can have advantages
    in terms of costs with respect to a centralized one. This draft describes a general
    method to calculate the costs of the centralized and distributed scenarios. Even
    if a simplified model has been used, some information can be earned. Each operator
    can use this model and his own costs to discover the optimal architecture based
    on traffic observed in the network.</p>"
