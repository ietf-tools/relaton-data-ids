abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the data plane of the path-aware, inter- domain
    network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation
    networks). One of the basic characteristics of SCION is that it gives path control
    to endpoints. The SCION Control Plane is responsible for discovering these paths
    and making them available as path segments to the endpoints. The role of the SCION
    Data Plane is to combine the path segments into end-to-end paths, and forward
    data between endpoints according to the specified path. The SCION Data Plane fundamentally
    differs from today's IP-based data plane in that it is _path-aware_: In SCION,
    interdomain forwarding directives are embedded in the packet header. This document
    provides a detailed specification of the SCION data packet format as well as the
    structure of the SCION header. SCION also supports extension headers, which are
    additionally described. The document continues with the life cycle of a SCION
    packet while traversing the SCION Internet, followed by a specification of the
    SCION path authorization mechanisms and the packet processing at routers. This
    document contains new approaches to secure path aware networking. It is not an
    Internet Standard, has not received any formal review of the IETF, nor was the
    work developed through the rough consensus process. The approaches offered in
    this work are offered to the community for its consideration in the further evolution
    of the Internet.</p>"
