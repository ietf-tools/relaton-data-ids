abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a master key used between a client of the Protocol
    for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) and an enforcement point,
    for bootstrapping lower-layer ciphering. The master key is derived from the Master
    Session Key of the Extensible Authentication Protocol as a result of successful
    PANA authentication. The master key guarantees cryptographic independence among
    enforcement points bootstrapped from PANA authentication across different address
    families. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
