abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows the members of the
    group to agree on a set of GroupContext extensions. MLS includes a mechanism to
    do a wholesale replacements of all GroupContext extensions, but not to modify
    individual extensions. In this document, we define a mechanism that allows implementations
    to add, update, and remove each element of the GroupContext individually. This
    also makes it practical for applications using MLS to exploit this feature of
    MLS to ensure that the group members are in agreement on the state of the application
    in addition to MLS-related state.</p>"
