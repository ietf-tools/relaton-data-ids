abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of an additive stream cipher as a confidentiality
    mechanism within the context of the IPSec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
    [KA98b]. This transform fits into and extends the framework of ESP CBC-Mode Cipher
    Algorithms [PA98]. Further, this draft describes the use of the Counter Mode of
    a block cipher as an ESP encryption transform.</p>"
