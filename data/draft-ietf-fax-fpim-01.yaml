abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a number of experimental facilities; as such,
    it is not an official product of the IETF FAX working group, but records some
    of the possible enhancements to the simple service described in [SERVICE]. This
    version is being made available document the options being considered, so that
    they might be used as the basis for experimentation. As an Experimental protocol,
    it is inappropriate for this specification to be used as a basis for products
    or other formal standards without the appropriate additional review.</p>"
