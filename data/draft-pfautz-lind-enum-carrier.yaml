abstract:
- content: <p>This document considers how so-called "carrier" or "infrastructure"
    ENUM and "end user" or "public" ENUM can share a single Tier 1 registry yet have
    independent Tier 2 providers. This approach allows the common cooperative infrastructure
    required by ENUM to be shared by end users and carriers reducing costs and facilitating
    adoption of ENUM generally. The essence of the proposal is to populate the Tier
    1 registry with non-terminal NAPTRs rather than NS records and use different ENUM
    service fields for carrier and end user records.</p>
