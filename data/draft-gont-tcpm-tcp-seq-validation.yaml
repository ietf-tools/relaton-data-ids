abstract:
- content: "<p>When TCP receives packets that lie outside of the receive window, the
    corresponding packets are dropped and either an ACK, RST or no response is generated
    due to the out-of-window packet, with no further processing of the packet. Most
    of the time, this works just fine and TCP remains stable, especially when a TCP
    connection has unidirectional data flow. However, there are three scenarios in
    which packets that are outside of the receive window should still have their ACK
    field processed, or else a packet war will take place. The aforementioned issues
    have affected a number of popular TCP implementations, typically leading to connection
    failures, system crashes, or other undesirable behaviors. This document describes
    the three scenarios in which the aforementioned issues might arise, and formally
    updates RFC 793 such that these potential problems are mitigated.</p>"
