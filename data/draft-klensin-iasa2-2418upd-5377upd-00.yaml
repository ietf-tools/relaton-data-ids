abstract:
- content: "<p>The IASA2 effort changes the terminology associated with several roles
    and the relationships among existing bodies and functions to the successors of
    others. In some cases, the relevant earlier documents address other matters, including
    ones that are critical to IETF processes, and are better dealt with by updating
    the relevant terminology or provisions rather than attempting to replace the earlier
    documents in their entirety. This document provides those updates for RFCs 2418
    and 5377 [[and perhaps others in later versions]].</p>"
