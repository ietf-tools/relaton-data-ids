abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents operational, policy and security considerations
    for the authors and publishers of client applications that choose to implement
    DNS resolution through any of the protocols that provide private, encrypted connections
    between the application itself and the DNS resolver. As these protocols, depending
    on implementation choices and deployment models, may impact the Internet significantly
    at the architectural, legal and policy levels, the document records the current
    consensus on how these protocols should be used by applications, especially user-facing
    applications meant for mass usage by non-technical consumers.</p>"
