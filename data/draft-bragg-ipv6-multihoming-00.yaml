abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Addressing scheme mandates provider addressing to achieve
    aggregation. Multi-homing is a fact of life. Current proposals to reconcile these
    requirements involve mitigation, by constraining deployment topologies to avoid
    loss of aggregation in the backbone only. This draft views the combined requirement
    as equivalent to the use of loose source routing by hosts, and makes some outline
    proposals as to how this can be achieved.</p>"
