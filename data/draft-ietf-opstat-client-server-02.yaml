abstract:
- content: "<p>Network administrators gather data related to the performance, utilization,
    usability and growth of their data network. The amount of raw data gathered is
    usually quite large, typically ranging somewhere between several megabytes to
    several gigabytes of data each month. Few (if any) tools exist today for the sharing
    of that raw data among network operators or between a network service provider
    (NSP) and its customers. This document defines a model and protocol for a set
    of tools which could be used by NSPs and Network Operation Centers (NOCs) to share
    data among themselves and with customers.</p>"
