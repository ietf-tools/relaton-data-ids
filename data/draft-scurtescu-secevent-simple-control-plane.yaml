abstract:
- content: "<p>Security Event Token (SET) delivery requires event receivers to indicate
    to event transmitters the subjects about which they wish to receive events, and
    how they wish to receive them. This specification defines an HTTP API for a basic
    control plane that event transmitters can implement and event receivers may use
    to manage the flow of events from one to the other.</p>"
