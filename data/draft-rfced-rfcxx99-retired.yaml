abstract:
- content: <p>Beginning in December 1991, a "Request for Comments Summary" was published
    every 100 RFCs. RFC numbers ending with 99 were reserved for these summary documents.
    This document retires the publication of the RFC summary documents. Moving forward,
    RFC numbers ending in 99 will be assigned to RFCs-to-be.</p>
