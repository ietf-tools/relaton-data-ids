abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC3530 described an fs_locations attribute which can be used to allow
    an fs to migrate between servers without disrupting client access and to refer
    a client to another server providing access to a specified file system. Initial
    implementation work for this feature has exposed a number of areas where RFC3530's
    handling of the issues leaves something to be desired. This document makes a number
    of suggestions to remedy these issues when the NFSv4 spec next undergoes a significant
    revision, most likely in connection with implementing a new minor revision, such
    as NFSv4.1.</p>"
