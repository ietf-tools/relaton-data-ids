abstract:
- content: "<p>[EDNOTE: The intention of this draft is to get IANA KE codepoints for
    ML-KEM. It could be a standards track draft given that ML-KEM will see a lot of
    adoption, an AD sponsored draft, or even an individual stable draft which gets
    codepoints from Expert Review. The approach is to be decided by the IPSECME WG.
    ] NIST recently standardized ML-KEM, a new key encapsulation mechanism, which
    can be used for quantum-resistant key establishment. This draft specifies how
    to use ML-KEM as an additionall key exchange mechanism in IKEv2 along with traditional
    (Elliptic Curve) Diffie- Hellman. This hybrid approach allows for negotiating
    IKE and Child SA keys which are safe against cryptanalytically-relevant quantum
    computers and theoretical weaknesses in ML-KEM as it is relatively new.</p>"
