abstract:
- content: "<p>LTE, 4G mobile networks use IP transport which is not optimized for
    data transport. IP unicast routing from server to clients is used for delivery
    of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE), where each user gets separate stream.
    From bandwidth and routing perspective this approach is inefficient. Multicast
    and broadcast technologies have emerged recently for mobile networks, but their
    deployments are very limited or at an experimental stage due to complex architecture
    and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly emerging technology with built in
    features for efficient multimedia data delivery, however majority of the work
    is focused on fixed networks. The main focus of this draft is on native deployment
    of ICN in cellular mobile networks by using ICN into 3GPP protocol stack. ICN
    has an inherent capability for multicast, anchorless mobility, security and it
    is optimized for data delivery using local caching at the edge. The native ICN
    or dual stack (along with IP) deployment will bring all inherent benefits and
    help in optimizing mobile networks.</p>"
