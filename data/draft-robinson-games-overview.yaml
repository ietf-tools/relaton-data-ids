- content: "<p>This document looks at games and their use on computers, where they
    have been and where they are going, their relationship to the Internet and its
    eventual to communicate for multi-player capability. The document solicits input
    on, and proposes creating, a generic standard for game protocols and other systems
    that generate real-time and transaction-based traffic. If such a standard for
    transaction-based traffic exists, other applications may be able to use it, and
    server programs to handle processing of multi-user games may then be possible.</p>"
