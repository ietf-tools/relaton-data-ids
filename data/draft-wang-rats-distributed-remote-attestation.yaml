abstract:
- content: "<p>In the RATS architecture, remote attestation typically involves multiple
    roles: verifier, attester, endorser, reference value provider, and relying party.
    However, in complex networks, the large number of entities in each role can significantly
    increase the cost of communication and computational resources. This document
    proposes a simplified remote attestation method based on distributed ledger(DL)
    technology, which aims to reduce the overhead for participants in multi-party
    networks.</p>"
