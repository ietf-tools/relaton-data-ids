abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of identity as a raw public key in
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). The
    TLS protocol procedures are kept unchanged, but signature algorithms are extended
    to support Identity-based signature (IBS). A few Identity-based signature algorithms
    from different standard organizations are supported in the current version.</p>"
