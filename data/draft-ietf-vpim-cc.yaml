abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of a mechanism for identifying body
    parts that a sender deems critical in a multi-part Internet mail message. The
    mechanism described is a parameter to Content-Disposition, as described by RFC
    3204. By knowing what parts of a message the sender deems critical, a content
    gateway can intelligently handle multi-part messages when providing gateway services
    to systems of lesser capability. Critical content can help a content gateway to
    decide what parts to forward. It can indicate how hard a gateway should try to
    deliver a body part. It can help the gateway to pick body parts that are safe
    to silently delete when a system of lesser capability receives a message. In addition,
    critical content can help the gateway chose the notification strategy for the
    receiving system. Likewise, if the sender expects the destination to do some processing
    on a body part, critical content allows the sender to mark body parts that the
    receiver must process. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
