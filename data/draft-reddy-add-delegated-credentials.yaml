abstract:
- content: "<p>An encrypted DNS server is authenticated by a certificate signed by
    a Certificate Authority (CA). However, for typical encrypted DNS server deployments
    on Customer Premise Equipment (CPEs), the signature cannot be obtained or requires
    excessive interactions with a Certificate Authority. This document explores the
    use of TLS delegated credentials for a DNS server deployed on a CPE. This approach
    is meant to ease operating DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of
    encrypted DNS capabilities.</p>"
