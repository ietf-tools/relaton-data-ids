abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we identify requirements for supporting the traffic
    engineering of IP networks. Requirements for traffic measurement in service provider
    environments are presented and justified, and related issues are discussed. Highlights
    of requirements are: 1. To aid network dimensioning, mechanisms to collect node-pair-
    based traffic data are required to facilitate the derivation of per- service-class
    traffic matrix statistics. 2. For service assurance, the use of higher-order statistics
    is required. 3. To preserve representative traffic detail at manageable sample
    volumes, packet-sampled measurements are required. 4. To manage large volumes
    of measured data, use of bulk transfer and filtering/aggregation mechanisms are
    required.</p>"
