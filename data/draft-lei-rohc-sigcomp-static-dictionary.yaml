abstract:
- content: "<p>The SigComp static dictionary for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    signalling was done by first version RFC3485. SIP protocol related extensions
    were completed and published in a series IETF documents. Those SIP protocol extensions
    had been used in 3GPP IMS and IMS based applications. The new extensions to SIP
    protocol weaken the intention of static dictionary for SIP signalling compressing
    which is to reduce overload risks in radio access network and core network involving
    wireless network.</p>"
