abstract:
- content: "<p>When users are at known underground locations, such as tube stations
    they often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from the satellites required
    cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggests providing GPS locations over WiFI
    using remote IP detection for a server to respond with the correct name of clients
    location and the clients GPS location.IP address. Extending this to those without
    WiFI access the standard goes one stage further, by offering a hidden WiFI network
    with a standard name, such as .location. The principle being that mobile devices
    can look for this network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected. It is hoped
    that this will allow those using mapping services to know where they are when
    travelling on underground trains etc.</p>"
