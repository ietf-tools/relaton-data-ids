abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),
    a specialized transfer protocol for use with constrained networks and nodes for
    machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy and building automation.
    These constrained nodes often have 8-bit microcontrollers with small amounts of
    ROM and RAM, while networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates
    and typical throughput of 10s of kbps. CoAP provides request/reply and subscribe/notify
    interaction models between appliciation end-points, supports built-in resource
    discovery, and includes key web concepts such as URIs and RESTful methods. CoAP
    easily translates to HTTP for integration with the web while meeting specialized
    requirements such as multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity for constrained
    environments.</p>"
