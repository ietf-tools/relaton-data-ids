abstract:
- content: "<p>It is very common that implementers of HTTP severs require the ability
    to associate an identifier to an HTTP request and or response, this can be for
    a number of reasons which could include checking for duplicate requests, allowing
    the caller of an API to maintain a record of their interaction with the server
    or to track client/server requests through a disparate system of services. In
    any case, the implementer will quite often use a custom HTTP header and either
    assign a value itself or require the caller to supply the value. This document
    outlines a consistent storage mechanism for this identifier by way of a standard
    HTTP header and a new status code for when a mandated identifier is omitted. The
    purpose is to create better consistency for clients of third-party HTTP servers
    and HTTP based APIs by introducing this standard request and response header.</p>"
