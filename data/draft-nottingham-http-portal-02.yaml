abstract:
- content: <p>"Captive portals" are a commonly-deployed means of obtaining access
    credentials and/or payment for a network. This memo introduces a new HTTP status
    code as a means of addressing issues found in these deployments. This memo should
    be discussed on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list, although it is not a work
    item of the HTTPbis WG.</p>
