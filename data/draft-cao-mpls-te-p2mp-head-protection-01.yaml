abstract:
- content: '<p>Protection methods for RSVP-TE P2MP LSP have been described in [TE-
    FRR]([RFC4090]) and [P2MP-TE-Bypass], but there are no solutions to protect an
    RSVP-TE P2MP head node. This document discusses the scenario for RSVP-TE P2MP
    LSP head node failure protection and describes the protection procedures. RSVP-TE
    extensions for such protection are also described. To protect the head node, a
    backup head node is appointed which forwards traffic to downstream LSRs of the
    LSP when the protected head node fails. The backup head node is not on the path
    of protected LSP. Similar to [TE-FRR] there are two methods that can apply: one-
    to-one backup and facility backup. Only one-to-one backup is described in detail
    here, facility backup will be discussed in a future version of this draft. Conventions
    used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>'
