abstract:
- content: "<p>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The
    Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a collection
    of nodes. Each site is named by a site address drawn from a global number space
    while each node is named by a node address drawn from a number space local to
    each site. Routing among sites depends solely on site addresses while that within
    each site on node addresses. Flat routing to render inherent mobility as well
    as mapped routing to additionally cope with table size are proposed. The model
    can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling
    its applicability, for example, to inter- planetary as well as body area networks.</p>"
