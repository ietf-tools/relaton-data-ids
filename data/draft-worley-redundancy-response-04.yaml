abstract:
- content: "<p>An increasing number of SIP architectures implement multiple path routing
    (MPR), which is the providing of more than one path for a call to reach a destination
    user agent (UA). A typical example is a redundant pair of gateways from a SIP
    system to the PSTN. A call from the SIP system to the PSTN can pass through either
    gateway to ultimately reach the destination telephone. In order to gain the benefits
    of redundancy in case one of the gateways fails or reaches capacity, a proxy forks
    INVITEs serially to both gateways. Unfortunately, if the call passes through one
    gateway but fails at the destination phone (e.g., ring-no-answer), the proxy will
    then fork the call to the other gateway, because the proxy has no way to know
    that the call failed at the destination phone rather than at the first gateway.
    The second fork will fail in the same way at the same destination phone. This
    annoys both the caller (because the call takes twice as long as it should before
    failing) and anyone within earshot of the destination phone. Similar failures
    plague any other SIP architecture where a request can reach a destination through
    multiple paths. To gain the benefits of MPR without suffering from this problem,
    the proxy which forks a request onto the redundant paths needs to be able to determine
    if a fork that failed reached the destination UA and was rejected by the UA (and
    so an alternate path should not be tried), or if the fork failed before reaching
    the UA (and so an alternate path should be attempted). This document is to begin
    a discussion of strategies for making this determination.</p>"
