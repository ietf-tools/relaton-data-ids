abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).
    HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes. HIP is
    based on a Sigma-compliant Diffie- Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers
    from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication. The protocol
    is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the- middle
    (MitM) attacks. When used together with another suitable security protocol, such
    as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and
    optional encryption for upper- layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP. This memo
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
