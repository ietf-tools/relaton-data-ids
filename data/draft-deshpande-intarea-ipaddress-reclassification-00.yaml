abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an AI based TCP-IP model. By understanding how
    the Network is evolving from a Wireless and Software perspective the limitations
    of current Internet Architecture are identified and the corrections needed for
    the Big Data bottleneck present in current Internet Architecture are described
    further. This draft explains about the implicit life cycle between the Cloud,
    Network and Internet. An important conclusion is drawn that the Network cannot
    be declassified from the Cloud. Based on the evolution of the Virtualized Datacenter
    within the Cloud architecture framework and the implicit fact that the Network
    also needs to grow and scale towards the Cloud another important conclusion that
    the whole Topological address space which is the current IP address space (IP
    as well as IPv6) needs to be reclassified or divided into a physical (or logical)
    address space and a new Virtual address space. The Virtual address space is a
    Centralized Control plane which only processes routing information. A future Internet
    architecture for resolving the Big Data bottleneck which introduces a Virtual
    address space at specific Intersection points such as Inter-AS, CsC and IXP (Internet
    Exchange Points) is described.</p>"
