abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a policy-based Differentiated Services [DSARCH]
    architecture that has been realized on the AIX operating system. We briefly motivate
    the benefits of supporting DiffServ functions on servers using policy-based networking,
    and outline the requirements for DiffServ-enabled servers. We then describe the
    policy-based DiffServ infrastructure we have developed for AIX. Experimental results
    using Web server workloads demonstrate the efficacy of the DiffServ mechanisms
    provided. We also outline ongoing work in deploying diffserv-capable AIX servers
    on Internet2.</p>"
