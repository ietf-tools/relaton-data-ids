abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT provides routing transparency for hosts in disparate routing realms
    to communicate with each other. However, external agents such as Application Level
    Gateways (ALGs), Host-NAT-clients and Management applications need to interact
    with NAT and influence its operations. The document identifies the resources and
    other elements controlled by a NAT device, with specific focus on areas subject
    to influence from external agents. An Application Programming Interface (API)
    framework by which external agents could interact with NAT is presented. The intent
    of this document is to leverage the API specification as a base to identify requirements
    for the development of one or more protocols by which external agents could interact
    with NAT.</p>"
