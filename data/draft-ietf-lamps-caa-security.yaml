abstract:
- content: <p>Cryptographic domain validation procedures leverage authenticated communication
    channels to ensure resilience against attacks by both on-path and off-path network
    adversaries which attempt to tamper with communications between the Certification
    Authority (CA) and the network resources related to the domain contained in the
    certificate. Domain owners can leverage "security" Property Tags specified in
    CAA records (defined in [RFC8659]) with the critical flag set, to ensure that
    CAs perform cryptographically-constrained domain validation during their issuance
    procedure, hence defending against global man- in-the-middle adversaries. This
    document defines the syntax of the CAA security Property as well as acceptable
    means for cryptographically-constrained domain validation procedures.</p>
