abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides support for flow-level multipathing with rapid failover for both unicast
    and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology. Active-active
    connection at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics to end
    stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus. This informational document
    discusses the high-level problems and goals when providing active-active connection
    at the TRILL edge.</p>"
