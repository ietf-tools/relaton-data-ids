abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the X.509
    CRL mechanism used to determine if a public-key certificate is valid or revoked.
    These enhancements provide advantages over existing CRL mechanisms, including
    those that use static CRL partitioning as defined in ISO/IEC 9504-8/ITU-T Rec.
    X.509. In particular, the mechanisms proposed can: (a) reduce the need for unnecessarily
    fetching unchanged CRLs, thereby greatly expanding the value of caching CRLs;
    (b) allow CRL timeliness to be improved; (c) accommodate dynamic partitioning
    as opposed to fixed partitioning; (d) better support use of certificates in multiple
    environments with different CRL stores. This document is submitted for consideration
    as the basis of possible future IETF standardization. Please send comments on
    this document to the ietf-pkix@imc.com mail list.</p>"
