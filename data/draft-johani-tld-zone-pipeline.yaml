abstract:
- content: '<p>Today most TLD registries publish DNSSEC signed zones. The sequence
    of steps from generating the unsigned zone, via DNSSEC signing and various types
    of verification is referred to as the "zone pipeline". The robustness and correctness
    of the zone pipeline is of crucial importance and the zone pipeline is one of
    the most critical parts of the operations of a TLD registry. The goal of this
    document is to describe the requirements that the.SE Registry choose in preparation
    for the implementation of a new zone pipeline. The document also describes some
    of the design consequences that follow from the requirements. Hence this document
    is intended to work as a guide for understanding the actual implementation, which
    is planned to be released as open source. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being
    collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline
    (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline). The most recent working
    version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available there. The
    authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>'
