abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) enables DHCPv4
    servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers configuration flexibility.
    If not being secured, DHCPv4 is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly spoofing
    attacks. This document analyzes the security issues of DHCPv4 and specifies a
    Secure DHCPv4 mechanism for communications between DHCPv4 clients and servers.
    This document provides a DHCPv4 client/server authentication mechanism based on
    sender's public/private key pairs or certificates with associated private keys.
    The DHCPv4 message exchanges are protected by the signature option and the timestamp
    option newly defined in this document.</p>"
