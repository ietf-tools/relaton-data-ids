abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links, and
    these links often define certain expectations about the interactions (such as
    HTTP methods being allowed, media types being accepted in the request, or URI
    templates being supported). While these expectations are essential to define the
    possible interactions, it may be useful to further narrow them down by providing
    link descriptions, which can help clients to gain more runtime knowledge about
    the resource they are about to interact with. This memo defines Link Descriptions,
    a model and associated media type that can be used to describe links by supporting
    descriptive markup for representing interaction information with links. Link Descriptions
    can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make Link
    Descriptions runtime-capable, without having to create their own representation
    for them.</p>"
