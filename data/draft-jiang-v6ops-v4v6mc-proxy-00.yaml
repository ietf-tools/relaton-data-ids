abstract:
- content: "<p>During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the interoperation
    between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. Multicast services across
    IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. Besides the packet-based multicast translation
    mechanism, this document describes a multicast proxy solution. The solution is
    a multicast deployment for transition scenario. It does not propose any new protocol
    for multicast. The multicast proxy is deployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks.
    It is mainly based on content cache concept. Without packet-based translation,
    it retires the content data from IPvX network, caches the data, and multicasts
    the data in IPvY network. It acts as a multicast leaf in the IPvX network where
    the data source locates. It also acts as a multicast source in IPvY network where
    the multicast client locates.</p>"
