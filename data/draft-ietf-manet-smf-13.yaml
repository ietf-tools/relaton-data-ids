abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) mechanism
    that provides basic Internet Protocol (IP) multicast forwarding suitable for limited
    wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) use. It is mainly applicable in
    situations where efficient flooding represents an acceptable engineering design
    trade- off. It defines techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD),
    to be applied in the forwarding process, for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol use.
    This document also specifies optional mechanisms for using reduced relay sets
    to achieve more efficient multicast data distribution within a mesh topology as
    compared to classic flooding. Interactions with other protocols, such as use of
    information provided by concurrently running unicast routing protocols, or interaction
    with other multicast protocols, as well as multiple deployment approaches are
    also described. Distributed algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related
    discussion are provided in the appendices. Basic issues relating to the operation
    of multicast MANET border routers are discussed, but ongoing work remains in this
    area, and is beyond the scope of this document.</p>"
