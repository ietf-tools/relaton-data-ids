abstract:
- content: "<p>The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft to support
    multihoming is such that a unique prefix is given to each interface of a Mobile
    Node (MN) that is attached to the PMIPv6 domain. However, multihoming can also
    be provided using same unique prefix for all interfaces of MN similar to the MONAMI6
    (Mobile Nodes and Multiple Interfaces in IPv6) concept. This memo explores and
    highlights lack of advanced multihoming support and other hand-off related issues
    where appropriate in three different mobility management protocol models for multiple
    interfaced mobile nodes. Firstly, when single prefix is allocated for all interfaces
    of MN in the PMIPv6 domain. Secondly, when unique prefix is allocated for each
    interface as in PMIPv6 standard protocol model. Thirdly, when a multiple interfaced
    node uses different mobility management mechanisms for each of its interfaces.</p>"
