abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for ICN regardless of
    the underlying network protocols. When Lookup-By-Name routing (LBNR) is used the
    first thing to do is name to locator resolution. Once the locator is acquired,
    discovery and delivery steps are carried out based on the network protocol of
    the locator. However, if the requestor and contents server are in heterogeneous
    networks discovery and delivery step could not be carried out smoothly. To let
    this happen seamlessly we propose scalable routing scheme based on hierarchically-organized
    domain structure. This scheme is independent of underlying network protocols and
    is more scalable thanks to the abstraction of location spaces. Internet is projected
    as spaces (i.e. domains) which have hierarchical relationship among them, and
    each node which belongs to a domain can be reached through "locator" which is
    a concatenation of "domain IDs".</p>
