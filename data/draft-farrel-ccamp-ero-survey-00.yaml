abstract:
- content: "<p>During discussions of a document to provide guidance on the use of
    addressing fields within the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) signaling protocol used in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (GMPLS), it was determined that there was considerable variation in the implementation
    of options for the Explicit Route Object (ERO). Since there was a proposal to
    deprecate some of the options, it was felt necessary to conduct a survey of the
    existing and planned implementations. This document summarizes the survey questions
    and captures the results. Some conclusions are also presented. This survey was
    informal and conducted via email. Responses were collected and anonymized by the
    CCAMP working group chair.</p>"
