abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a secure data aggregation scheme based on key
    vector sharing. New key set is negotiated among sink and sensor nodes, and then
    each sensor node uses one key in the set to encrypt and decrypt sensory data.
    A key vector structure is constructed and shared among them. Since the size of
    the shared key vector structure is constant, the transmission overhead is saved
    in the proposed scheme while security is ensured. Moreover, MAC integrity mechanism
    is also included in the proposed scheme. The recommended scheme reduces the transmitted
    overhead so as to save the energy consumption of each sensor node.Meanwhile, the
    scheme is data-loss resilient. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
