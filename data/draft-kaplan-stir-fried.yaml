abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a type of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for new
    STIR Working Group participants. Since its inception three months ago there have
    been over 1,500 emails on the mailing list, before the WG was even formed. Some
    of the emails repeat topics, because newcomers cannot be expected to read all
    previous emails in the archive. This document is an attempt to capture some of
    the previously asked and answered questions. This document is written by one individual,
    is not intended to be published as an RFC, and is only meant as a temporary FAQ
    while the Working Group begins. The document attempts to provide both high- level
    information for non-experts, as well as low-level information for protocol experts.</p>"
