abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines two new kinds of credentials for use within
    the Message Layer Security (MLS) credential framework: UserInfo Verifiable Credentials
    and multi-credentials. UserInfo Verifiable Credentials allow clients to present
    credentials that associate OpenID Connect attributes to a signature key pair held
    by the client. Multi-credentials allow clients to present authenticated attributes
    from multiple sources, or to present credentials in different formats to support
    groups with heterogeneous credential support.</p>"
