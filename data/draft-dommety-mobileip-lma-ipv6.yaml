abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 is better integrated into IPv6, thereby obviating the need
    for Foreign Agents (FA) in IPv6 [5]. In IPv6 most, if not all, ofthe functions
    of the Mobile IPv4 FA [1] are assumed by other parts of the Mobile IPv6 architecture.
    Specifically, all routers send Router Advertisements and the Mobile Node (MN)
    does its own detunneling and Routing Header processing.</p>"
