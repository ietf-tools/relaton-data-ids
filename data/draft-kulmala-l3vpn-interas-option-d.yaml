abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an additional option to the 'Multi-AS Backbones'
    section of [RFC4364]. This option combines per VPN VRFs at the Autonomous System
    Border Router (ASBR) as described in 'Option A' with the redistribution of labeled
    VPN-IPv4 routes as described in 'Option B'. In addition, this option allows for
    a data plane consisting of two methods of traffic forwarding between attached
    ASBR pairs. In this Multi-AS option, the ASBR installs VPN-IPv4 routes into VRFs
    in the same manner as described in [RFC4364] e.g. VPN-IPv4 routes are converted
    back to IPv4 routes and imported into VRFs via Route Target (RT) based filtering
    policies. Once installed in a VRF, selected IPv4 routes are converted to VPN-IPv4
    routes by the addition of Route Distinguisher (RD) values, along with one or more
    associated RTs as configured per VRF at the ASBR. Dependant on service provider
    preference, traffic forwarding between attached ASBRs is either via per VRF attachment
    circuits or a 'global' (non-VRF attachment circuit associated) IP interface. In
    both traffic forwarding cases, packets may be MPLS-labeled or non-labeled. If
    attached ASBR pairs belonging to separate Autonomous Systems (AS) make use of
    this Multi-AS option, then VRF based route filtering policies via RTs is achieved
    directly between ASBR pairs, independent of PE based RT filtering within an AS.</p>"
