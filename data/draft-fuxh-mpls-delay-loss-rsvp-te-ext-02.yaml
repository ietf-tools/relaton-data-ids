abstract:
- content: <p>With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the distances
    between the user and the applications are growing. For multiple applications such
    as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets, the response times
    are critical as is packet loss, while other applications require more throughput.
    For example, financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to- end private
    pipe line delay optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms. Delay, jitter, loss
    and SLA (Service Level Agreement) are key parameters that these "high value" customers
    use to select a private pipe line provider. This document extends RSVP-TE protocol
    to promote SLA experince of delay and packet loss application.</p>
