abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a set of cryptographic transforms for use in the
    Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2). The transforms are based on
    ISO and Chinese cryptographic standard algorithms (called "ShangMi" or “SM” algorithms).
    The use of these algorithms with IKEv2 is not endorsed by the IETF. The SM algorithms
    is ISO standardization and are mandatory for some scenario in China, so this document
    provides a description of how to use the SM algorithms with IKEv2 and specifies
    a set of cryptographic transforms so that implementers can produce interworking
    implementations.</p>
