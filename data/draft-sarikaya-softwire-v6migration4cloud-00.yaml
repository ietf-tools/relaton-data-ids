abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how Dual Stack Lite or 4rd can be used to support
    IPv4 users in a cloud network that is IPv6 based. The cloud network is IPv6 only
    which simplifies the network operation and management. IPv4 users are supported
    either one of the transition technologies of DS-Lite or 4rd. This protocol is
    ideal for new cloud deployments since no new public IPv4 addresses are needed.</p>"
