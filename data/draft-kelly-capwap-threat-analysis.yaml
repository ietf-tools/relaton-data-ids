abstract:
- content: <p>Early Wireless LAN (WLAN) deployments feature a "fat" Access Point (AP)
    which serves as a standalone interface between the wired and wireless network
    segments. However, this model raises scaling, mobility, and manageability issues,
    and the CAPWAP protocol [CAPWAP] is being developed in reponse. CAPWAP effectively
    splits the fat AP functionality into two network elements, and the communication
    channel between these components may traverse potentially hostile hops. This document
    analyzes the security exposure resulting from the introduction of CAPWAP, and
    summarizes the associated security considerations for CAPWAP implementations and
    deployments.</p>
