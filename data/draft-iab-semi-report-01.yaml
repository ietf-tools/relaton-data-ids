abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) through its IP Stack Evolution
    program, the Internet Society, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)
    Zurich hosted the Stack Evolution in a Middlebox Internet (SEMI) workshop in Zurich
    on 26-27 January 2015 to explore the ability to evolve the transport layer in
    the presence of middlebox- and interface-related ossification of the stack. The
    goal of the workshop was to produce architectural and engineering guidance on
    future work to break the logjam, focusing on incrementally deployable approaches
    with clear incentives to deployment both on the endpoints (in new transport layers
    and applications) as well as on middleboxes (run by network operators). This document
    summarizes the contributions to the workshop and provides an overview of the discussion
    at the workshop, as well as the outcomes and next steps identified by the workshop.
    The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants
    and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</p>"
