abstract:
- content: "<p>In some environments, a relay agent resides in a network element which
    also has access to one or more virtual private networks (VPNs). If a DHCP server
    wishes to offer service to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCP server
    needs to know information about the VPN on which each client resides. The Virtual
    Subnet Selection sub- option of the relay-agent-information option is used by
    the relay agent to tell the DHCP server important information about the VPN (called
    the Virtual Subnet Selection information, or VSS) for every DHCP request it passes
    on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forward any DHCP reply that
    the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.</p>"
