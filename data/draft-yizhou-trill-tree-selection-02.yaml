abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL uses the distribution trees to deliver multi-destination frames.
    Multiple trees can be used by an ingress RBridge for different flow based on VLAN
    and/or multicast group. Different ingress RBridges may choose different distribution
    trees for the same VLAN and/or multicast group traffic. Distribution trees are
    normally pruned based on VLAN. For any RBridge RBn, if RBn has downstream receivers
    of VLAN x in a distribution tree t, there will be an entry of (t, x, port list)
    in the multicast forwarding table on RBn. If there are n trees and m VLANs, the
    multicast forwarding table size on RBn is typically n*m entries. The value of
    m is up to 4096 and n is the total number of distribution trees in the campus.
    If fine grained labeling is implemented or finer granularity filtering such as
    VLAN plus L2/L3 multicast address is used for pruning, the multicast forwarding
    table size further increases dramatically. TRILL multicast forwarding table size
    is limited by hardware and L3 multicasting may share the same table with it in
    hardware implementations. Therefore multicast table entry is a precious resource.
    This document specifies a VLAN based tree selection mechanism to reduce the TRILL
    multicast forwarding table size on RBridge.</p>"
