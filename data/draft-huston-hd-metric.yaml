abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an analysis of the Host Density metric as it is
    currently used to guide registry allocations of IPv6 unicast address blocks. This
    document contrasts the address efficiency as currently adopted in the allocation
    of IPv4 network addresses and that used by the IPv6 protocol. Note that for large
    allocations there are very significant variations in the target efficiency metric
    between the two approaches. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
