abstract:
- content: "<p>Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals (e.g.,
    a workstation user or a network server) on an open network. The Kerberos protocol
    provides a facility called pre-authentication. Pre-authentication mechanisms can
    use this facility to extend the Kerberos protocol and prove the identity of a
    principal. This document describes a more formal model for this facility. The
    model describes what state in the Kerberos request a pre-authentication mechanism
    is likely to change. It also describes how multiple pre-authentication mechanisms
    used in the same request will interact. This document also provides common tools
    needed by multiple pre-authentication mechanisms. One of these tools is a secure
    channel between the client and the key distribution center with a reply key strengthening
    mechanism; this secure channel can be used to protect the authentication exchange
    and thus eliminate offline dictionary attacks. With these tools, it is relatively
    straightforward to chain multiple authentication mechanisms, utilize a different
    key management system, or support a new key agreement algorithm. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
