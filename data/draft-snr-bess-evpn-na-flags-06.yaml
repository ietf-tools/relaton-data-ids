abstract:
- content: "<p>The MAC/IP Advertisement route specified in [RFC7432] can optionally
    carry IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use
    this information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6
    Neighbor Solicitation messages and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the
    Address Resolution procedure. However, if the Neighbor information is learnt via
    EVPN, the PE would not know if a particular IPv6-&gt;MAC pair belongs to a host,
    a router or a host with an anycast address as this information is not carried
    in the MAC/IP route advertisements. This document proposes an OPTIONAL advertisement
    of the Flags defined in [RFC4861] along with the EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement routes,
    so that an EVPN PE implementing a proxy-ND function can reply to Neighbor Solicitations
    with the correct Flag information in Neighbor Advertisements.</p>"
