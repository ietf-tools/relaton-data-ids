abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents ISO7816 interface for TLS1.3 stack running in secure
    element. It presents supported cipher suites and key exchange modes, and describes
    embedded software architecture. TLS 1.3 is the de facto security stack for emerging
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Some of them are constraint nodes, with limited
    computing resources. Furthermore cheap System on Chip (SoC) components usually
    provide tamper resistant features, so private or pre shared keys are exposed to
    hacking. According to the technology state of art, some ISO7816 secure elements
    are able to process TLS 1.3, but with a limited set of cipher suites. There are
    two benefits for TLS-SE; first fully tamper resistant processing of TLS protocol,
    which increases the security level insurance; second embedded software component
    ready for use, which relieves the software of the burden of cryptographic libraries
    and associated attacks. TLS-SE devices may also embed standalone applications,
    which are accessed via internet node, using a routing procedure based on SNI extension.</p>"
