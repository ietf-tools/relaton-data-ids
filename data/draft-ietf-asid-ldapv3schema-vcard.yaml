abstract:
- content: "<p>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPV3] is gaining
    widespread acceptance as a method for accessing Internet directories. Many of
    the LDAP clients accessing these directories also provide support for emitting
    the directory information in the form of a vCard electronic business card object.
    This memo defines a new X.500 object class, called the vCardObject, that extends
    the X.521 standard organizationalPerson and residentialPerson in order to provide
    a unique LDAP schema for accessing Internet directories in terms of the vCard
    attributes. The schema defined by this memo should be used when accessing a directory
    via LDAP Version 3 and searching or retrieving directory information based on
    vCard related attributes. The schema describes the attribute types and object
    classes that have a 1-to-one correspondence with vCard properties. This schema
    may also be used to define a set of object classes and attributes for storing
    metadata and binding information for a directory entry that closely follows the
    vCard object in directories that support LDAP.</p>"
