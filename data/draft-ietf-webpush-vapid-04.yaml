abstract:
- content: <p>An application server can use the Voluntary Application Server Identification
    (VAPID) method described in this document to voluntarily identify itself to a
    push service. The "vapid" authentication scheme allows a client to include its
    identity in a signed token with requests that it makes. The signature can be used
    by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application
    server to a single entity. The identification information can allow the operator
    of a push service to contact the operator of the application server. The signature
    can be used to restrict the use of a push message subscription to a single application
    server.</p>
