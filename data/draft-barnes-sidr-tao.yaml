abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the rpki-updown protocol to provide
    support for transferring Internet Number Resources from one INR holder to another.
    Such transfers take place external to the RPKI, using procedures defined within
    and between RIRs. This protocol facilitates automation of the maintenance of RPKI
    data in the context of INR transfers. The protocol supports asynchronous transfers
    of live or unused INRs within an RIR or between RIRs. The scope of this protocol
    is limited to the transfer of Internet Number Resources within the Resource Public
    Key Infrastructure. In support of this protocol, this document also defines a
    new signed object type for the RPKI repository system, the Transfer Authorization
    Object (TAO).</p>"
