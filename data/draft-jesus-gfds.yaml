- content: "<p>Building and managing highly dynamic and heterogeneous decentralized
    systems can prove to be quite challenging due to the great complexity and scale
    of such environments. This document specifies a Generic Framework for Building
    Dynamic Decentralized Systems (GFDS), which composes a reference architecture
    and execution model for developing and managing these systems, while providing
    high-level abstractions to users.</p>"
