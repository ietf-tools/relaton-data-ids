abstract:
- content: "<p>There are number of deployment scenarios where there is a need for
    a home agent to allocate the same private IPv4 address to multiple mobile nodes
    that it is serving. A service provider hosting home agent service for enterprises,
    or for supporting some of the IPv6 transitioning solutions related to IPv4 address
    exhaust problem, a home agent may have to allocate the same private IPv4 address
    to multiple mobile nodes. The Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 does not have such support.
    This document specifies extensions to Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 for supporting overlapping
    private IPv4 address assignment support.</p>"
