abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to provide enhanced Internet connectivity
    to mobile ad hoc networks. To achieve this goal, we borrow the concept of Mobile
    IPv6 and make the most use of available multiple gateways. Specifically, our scheme
    makes a global address being used by Upper layer reachable by peer Internet node
    by registering another global address as a locator with corresponding gateway
    for the address being cared while the gateway can not obtain host route information
    for the cared address because of frequent partitions. We introduce stateful auto-configuration
    for acquisition of global address in mobile ad-hoc networks because it can avoid
    duplicate address problem and help prevent traffics from going outside a manet
    or unnecessary control traffic by route discovery of reactive routing protocols
    from being issued. In addition, it can support for our scheme since our scheme
    requires some security guarantee to register a locator with a gateway as Mobile
    IPv6 requires for Binding Updates. Basically, our extended support and stateful
    configuration of global address are devised to extend AODV, but the concept is
    also applicable for proactive routing protocols such as OLSR, TBRPF. Further,
    our extended support can be useful for a mobile node(MN) in Mobile IPv6 to maintain
    its reachability from the Internet by utilizing multi-hop manet extension as a
    virtual link since it can help determine intelligently when current CoA should
    be changed and Binding Update with new CoA be performed while it can make the
    current CoA reachable from Internet even when the GW which assigned the CoA is
    not reachable from the manet node any more.</p>"
