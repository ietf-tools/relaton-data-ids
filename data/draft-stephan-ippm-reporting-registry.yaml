abstract:
- content: "<p>The intend of this memo is to set up an IANA registry that collects
    best current practices in terms of reporting IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) measurements
    for composition, to users and to end-users. It proposes default values for well
    known usages and focuses on the identification of the information that should
    be reported to increase interoperabilty between standard metrics measurements
    and to facilitate the exchange of measurements results through measurement applications.</p>"
