abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) Working Group has produced an
    Internet Draft that proposes to use an IPsec AH header that carries both a public
    key and a signature. However, based on the recent discussion at the mailing lists
    it seems that such a usage of AH is considered inappropriate at least by some
    members of the IPSEC WG. In this draft we introduce an alternative method, where
    a separate extension header is used to carry the public key, and the AH header
    only contains a signature.</p>"
