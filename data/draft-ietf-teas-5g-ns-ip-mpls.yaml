abstract:
- content: '<p>5G slicing is a feature that was introduced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) in mobile networks. This feature covers slicing requirements for
    all mobile domains, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN),
    and Transport Network (TN). This document describes a basic RFC XXXX Network Slice
    realization model in IP/MPLS networks with a focus on the Transport Network fulfilling
    5G slicing connectivity requirements. This realization model reuses many building
    blocks currently commonly used in service provider networks. Note to the RFC Editor:
    Please update "RFC XXXX Network Slice" with the RFC number assigned to I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices.
    Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Discussion
    of this document takes place on the Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling
    Working Group mailing list (teas@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/teas/.
