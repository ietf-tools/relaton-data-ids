abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Access Router Information Protocol (ARIP) whereby
    a mobile host can improve the handoff performance by exchanging, in advance, the
    information among geographically adjacent access router(AR)s. This protocol does
    not need a certain assumption of network topology so that it can be applied to
    heterogeneous networks as well as homogeneous networks. This document also describes
    a framework to minimize the handoff latency with the aid of ARIP. Therefore, ARIP
    can be combined with the protocol such as Fast Handovers (for Mobile IPv6) which
    tries to minimize the handoff latency.</p>"
