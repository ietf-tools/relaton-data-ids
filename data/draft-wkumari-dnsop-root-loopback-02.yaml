abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have longer-than-desired round trip times
    to the closest DNS root server. Such resolvers can greatly decrease the round
    trip time by running a copy of the full root zone on a loopback address (such
    as 127.0.0.1). Typically, the vast majority of queries going to the root are for
    names that do not exist in the root zone, and the negative answers are cached
    for a much shorter period of time. This document shows how to start and maintain
    such a copy of the root zone in a manner that is secure for the operator of the
    recursive resolver and does not pose a threat to other users of the DNS.</p>"
