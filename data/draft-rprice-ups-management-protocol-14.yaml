abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the command/response protocol currently used
    in the management of Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units and other power
    devices often deployed in small offices, and in IT installations subject to an
    erratic public power supply. The UPS units typically interface to an Attachment
    Daemon in the system they protect. This daemon is in turn polled by a Management
    Daemon which notifies users and system administrators of power supply incidents,
    and automates system shutdown decisions. The commands and responses described
    by this document are exchanged between the UPS Attachment Daemon and the Management
    Daemon. The practice current when this protocol was first developed risks weak
    security and this is addressed in the Security Considerations sections of this
    document.</p>"
