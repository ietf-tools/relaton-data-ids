abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual LAN Link State Protocol (VLSP) is part of the InterSwitch
    Message Protocol (ISMP). ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch communication
    within distributed determine and maintain a fully connected mesh topology graph
    of the switch fabric. Each switch maintains an identical database describing the
    topology. Call-originating switches use the topology database to determine the
    path over which to route a call connection. VLSP provides support for equal-cost
    multipath routing, and recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological
    changes, utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic.</p>"
