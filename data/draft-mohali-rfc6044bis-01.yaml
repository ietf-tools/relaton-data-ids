abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the SIP History-Info header field is the solution adopted
    in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header field is nevertheless already implemented
    and used for conveying call diversion related information in the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) signaling. On one hand, the non-standard Diversion header field
    is described, as Historic, in [RFC5806]. On the other hand, the History-Info header
    field is described in [RFC7044] that obsoletes the original[RFC4244] describing
    the History-Info header field. [RFC7044] defines the SIP header field, History-Info,
    for capturing the history information in requests and new SIP header field parameters
    for the History-Info and Contact header fields to tag the method by which the
    target of a request is determined. [RFC7044] also defines a value for the Privacy
    header field that directs the anonymization of values in the History-Info header
    field. Since the Diversion header field is used in existing network implementations
    for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP
    History-Info standardized solution is needed. This document describes a recommended
    interworking guideline between the Diversion header field and the History-Info
    header field to handle call diversion information. In addition, an interworking
    policy is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence. This work is intended to
    enable the migration from non-standard implementations and deployments toward
    IETF specification-based implementations and deployments. This document obsoletes
    [RFC6044]that describes the interworking between the Diversion header field [RFC5806]
    and the obsoleted History-Info header field as defined on [RFC4244].</p>"
