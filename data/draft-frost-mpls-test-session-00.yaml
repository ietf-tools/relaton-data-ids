abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6374 defines procedures for packet loss and throughput measurement
    in MPLS networks. Some forms of measurement rely on the existence of a stream
    of test messages that flows between measurement points, from which the loss and
    throughput characteristics of the underlying data channel are inferred. This document
    presents procedures for the establishment and maintenance of such test sessions.</p>"
