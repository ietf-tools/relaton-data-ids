abstract:
- content: "<p>This defines the information model for the Security Automation and
    Continuous Monitoring (SACM) standards. The working group faces a set of complex
    issues when trying to define an information model that complicates this effort:
    o There are many standards in the SACM space which are not interoperable o There
    exists an extremely large and diverse set of data types which are desirable to
    exchange o Many data types depend on the operating systems from which they are
    collected; making a universal typing harder o A goal of SACM is to cover a diverse
    set of system types These complex needs create a information model which is difficult
    to unify within the environment. Instead, this information model design is focused
    on minimum needed functionality with the desire to include a type system design
    into the information model allowing for easy expandability. It is envisioned that
    this information model will serve the following purposes: o Enough well specified
    elements in order to exchange key data fields between systems o Sufficient typing
    system to expand key fields over time and use of a registry to standardize common
    expansions o Meta information such that compplete information exchange using various
    other formats understood by all parties can be used as needed to exchange complete
    records on demand o Sufficient action verbs defined to allow orchestration between
    various systems to allow unified control of federated components</p>"
