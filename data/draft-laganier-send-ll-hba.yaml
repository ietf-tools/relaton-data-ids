abstract:
- content: "<p>The current mechanisms used by Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) to
    secure the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) relies almost solely on public key
    cryptography (i.e. Certificates and/or Cryptographically Generated Addresses).
    While these approaches provide very strong guarantees on the authenticity of an
    IP address to link layer address mapping, they are computationally expensive,
    which might be a problem on resource-constrained devices. It is also recognized
    in the SEND specification that it does not compensate for an insecure link layer;
    more specifically, no protections are offered against spoofing, link disruption,
    or bombing DoS attacks launched at the link layer. Accordingly, this note suggests
    an alternative to the current specification of SEND which leverage on the deemed
    required link layer security to secure NDP. This technique is based on the use
    of a specific kind of IPv6 addresses, the so-called Link Layer Hashed Based Addresses
    (LL-HBA), and of link layer address reachability tests. When the link layer security
    prevents attacker to redirect frames at the link layer layer, this technique allows
    to provide some level of security to NDP while relying solely on symmetric (i.e.,
    computationally inexpensive) cryptography.</p>"
