abstract:
- content: "<p>[PWE3-CONTROL] specifies a 'signaling protocol' which uses extensions
    of LDP [RFC 3036] to set up and maintain pseudowires [PWE3-FR, PWE3- ARCH]. Like
    any protocol which sets up connections, the signaling protocol provides a method
    by which each endpoint can identify the other. [L2VPN-FW] describes a number of
    different ways in which sets of pseudowires may be combined together into 'Provider
    Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs' (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different
    kinds of L2VPN. Different kinds of L2VPN may have different 'provisioning models',
    i.e., different models for what information needs to be configured in what entities.
    Once configured, the provisioning information is distributed by a 'discovery process',
    and once the information is discovered, the signaling protocol is automatically
    invoked to set up the required pseudowires. The semantics of the endpoint identifiers
    which the signaling protocol uses for a particular type of L2VPN are determined
    by the provisioning model. This document specifies a number of PPVPN provisioning
    models, and specifies the semantic structure of the endpoint identifiers required.
    It further specifies how the endpoint identifiers are carried in the 'Generalized
    Identifier FEC' of [PWE3-CONTROL]. It is believed that the specified identifiers
    can also be carried within the L2TP signaling protocol, though this is currently
    not specified.</p>"
