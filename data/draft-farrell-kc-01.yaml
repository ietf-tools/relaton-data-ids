abstract:
- content: "<p>Some asymmetric key generation implementations do not use sufficient
    randomness giving rise to a number of bad public keys, for example with known
    factors, being used on the Internet. This memo specifies [[for now: just outlines]]
    an experimental protocol that could be used by a private key holder to talk to
    a responder that knows the values of (some of) those bad keys that have been seen
    in the wild. The protocol only allows a holder of the relevant private key to
    request information, as doing otherwise could weaken the overall security of the
    Internet and also considers confidentiality and privacy as important requirements,
    as information that a given bad public key is associated with a particular identifier
    could also weaken the security of the Internet.</p>"
