abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensive use of Internet electronic mail demonstrates a need to be
    able to communicate various descriptive information about participants. The information
    ranges from telephone and postal addressing, to an indication of the media supported
    by their electronic mail and information processing environment. This specification
    provides a basis for encoding such 'PCI' business card information by using the
    STIF [CROC93] syntax. A MIME Content sub-type is defined for carriage of PCI information.</p>"
