abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for the Kerberos
    protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange. This document has three
    goals. First, increase the security of Kerberos pre-authentication exchanges by
    making offline brute-force attacks infeasible. Second, enable the use of second
    factor authentication without the need for a separately-established secure channel.
    This is achieved using the existing trust relationship established by the shared
    first factor. Third, make Kerberos pre- authentication more resilient against
    time synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp
    from the client.</p>"
