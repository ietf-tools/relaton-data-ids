abstract:
- content: "<p>The DMZ Link Bandwidth draft provides a way to load-balance traffic
    to a destination (which is in a different AS than the source) which is reachable
    via more than one path. Typically, the link bandwidth (either configured on the
    link of the EBGP egress interface or set via a policy) is encoded in an extended
    community and then sent to the IBGP peer which employs multi-path. The link-bandwidth
    value is then extracted from the path extended community and is used as a weight
    in the FIB, which does the load-balancing. This draft extends the usage of the
    DMZ link bandwidth to another setting where the ingress BGP speaker requires knowledge
    of the cumulative bandwidth while doing the load-balancing. The draft also proposes
    neighbor- level knobs to enable the link bandwidth extended community to be regenerated
    and then advertised to EBGP peers to override the default behavior of not advertising
    optional non-transitive attributes to EBGP peers.</p>"
