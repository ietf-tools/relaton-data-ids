abstract:
- content: "<p>A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment that enforces
    that any code within that environment cannot be tampered with, and that any data
    used by such code cannot be read or tampered with by any code outside that environment.
    This architecture document motivates the design and standardization of a protocol
    for managing the lifecycle of trusted applications running inside such a TEE.</p>"
