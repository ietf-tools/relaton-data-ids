abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) with
    a simple mechanism for a client to determine the "liveliness" of a request for
    which it is still expecting a response or a notification, and with a mechanism
    to request the cancellation of such a request.</p>
