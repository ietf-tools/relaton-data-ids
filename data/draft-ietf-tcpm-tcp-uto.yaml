abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain
    unacknowledged before a connection is forcefully closed. It is a local, per-connection
    parameter. This document specifies a new TCP option -- the TCP User Timeout Option
    -- that allows one end of a TCP connection to advertise its current user timeout
    value. This information provides advice to the other end of the TCP connection
    to adapt its user timeout accordingly. Increasing the user timeouts on both ends
    of a TCP connection allows it to survive extended periods without end-to-end connectivity.
    Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients
    that they will maintain the connection state only for a short time without connectivity.
