abstract:
- content: "<p>We discuss the issue of multicasting in Nimrod. We identify the requirements
    that Nimrod has of any solution for multicast support. We compare existing approaches
    for multicasting within an internetwork and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
    Finally, as an example, we outline the mechanisms to support multicast in Nimrod
    using the scheme currently being developed within the IETF - namely, the Protocol
    Indpendent Multicast (PIM) protocol.</p>"
