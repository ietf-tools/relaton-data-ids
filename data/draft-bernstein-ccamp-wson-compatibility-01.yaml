abstract:
- content: "<p>While the current GMPLS WSON framework can deal with many types of
    wavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend the control plane to
    networks that include a combination of transparent optical and hybrid electro
    optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters.
    Such networks are frequently referred to as translucent optical networks in the
    literature. Some of the systems use in such networks can be limited to processing
    WSON signals with specific characteristics or attributes. In addition, some of
    the network elements may be able to perform important optional processing functions
    such as regeneration on a signal and would need to be provisioned as part of optical
    path establishment. This document provides a WSON signal definition and attributes
    characterization based on ITU-T interface and signal class standards and describes
    the signal compatibility constraints of this extended set of network elements.
    The signal characterization, network element compatibility constraints and enhanced
    provisioning support enable GMPLS routing and signaling to control these devices
    and PCE to compute optical light-paths subject to signal compatibility attributes.</p>"
