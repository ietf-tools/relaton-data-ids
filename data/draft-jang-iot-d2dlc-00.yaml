abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, D2D communication is drawing attention as a technology capable
    of reducing an excessive load on a network infrastructure and increasing network
    coverage. When using heterogeneous wireless communication technologies such as
    WiFi and Bluetooth, which are basically provided to user terminals such as smartphones,
    the connectivity of D2D communication can be further strengthened. In this paper,
    we propose a multi-hop communication technique using heterogeneous wireless communication
    technologies.</p>"
