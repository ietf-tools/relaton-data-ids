abstract:
- content: "<p>JUNOScript is an XML-based API for managing devices. It allows access
    to both operational and configuration data using a simple RPC mechanism. Sessions
    can be established using a variety of connection-oriented access methods. This
    document describes the framing protocol, message content, and capabilities of
    this API. Design decisions and motivations are also discussed. No attempt is made
    to formally define a protocol, but rather to document the capabilities of JUNOScript
    as part of the discussion of XML-based network management.</p>"
