abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is being written because there are a number of firewalls
    in the Internet that inappropriately reset a TCP connection upon receiving certain
    TCP SYN packets, in particular, packets with flags set in the Reserved field of
    the TCP header. In this document we argue that this practice is not conformant
    with TCP standards, and is an inappropriate overloading of the semantics of the
    TCP reset. We also consider the longer-term consequences of this and similar actions
    as obstacles to the evolution of the Internet infrastructure.</p>"
