abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide different customers with logically
    separated connectivity over a common network infrastructure. With the introduction
    and evolvement of 5G and other network scenarios, some existing or new customers
    may require connectivity services with advanced characteristics comparing to traditional
    VPNs. Such kind of network service is called enhanced VPNs (VPN+). VPN+ can be
    used to deliver IETF network slices, and could also be used for other application
    scenarios. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which
    consists of a set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated from the
    physical underlay network, and is associated with a customized logical network
    topology. VPN+ services can be delivered by mapping one or a group of overlay
    VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as the virtual underlay. In packet forwarding, some
    fields in the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs
    to, so that the VTN-specific processing can be performed on each node the packet
    traverses. This document proposes a new Hop-by-Hop option of IPv6 extension header
    to carry the VTN related information, which could used to identify the set of
    network resources allocated to a VTN and the rules for packet processing. The
    procedure of processing the VTN option is also specified.</p>"
