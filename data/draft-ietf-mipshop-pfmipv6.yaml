abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6; RFC 3775) provides a mobile node with IP mobility
    when it performs a handover from one access router to another, and fast handovers
    for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) are specified to enhance the handover performance in
    terms of latency and packet loss. While MIPv6 (and FMIPv6 as well) requires the
    participation of the mobile node in the mobility-related signaling, Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 (PMIPv6; RFC 5213) provides IP mobility to nodes that either have or do not
    have MIPv6 functionality without such involvement. Nevertheless, the basic performance
    of PMIPv6 in terms of handover latency and packet loss is considered no different
    from that of MIPv6. When the fast handover is considered in such an environment,
    several modifications are needed to FMIPv6 to adapt to the network-based mobility
    management. This document specifies the usage of fast handovers for Mobile IPv6
    (FMIPv6; RFC 5568) when Proxy Mobile IPv6 is used as the mobility management protocol.
    Necessary extensions are specified for FMIPv6 to support the scenario when the
    mobile node does not have IP mobility functionality and hence is not involved
    with either MIPv6 or FMIPv6 operations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
