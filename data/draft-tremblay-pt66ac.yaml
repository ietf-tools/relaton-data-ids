abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to extend IPv6 prefix translation
    [NAT66] to statelessly translate between IPv6 prefixes of differing lengths. This
    technique, called PT66 addressing bit compression (PT66-AC), provides a way to
    map a shorter prefix (such as the fixed [6to4] prefix) to a longer global unicast
    prefix, while avoiding stateful translation. The difference between the prefix
    lengths is compensated for by removing an unused string of subnetting bits, as
    specified, from the addresses within the shorter prefix.</p>"
