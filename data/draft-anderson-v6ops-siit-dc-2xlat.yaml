abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension of the SIIT-DC [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc]
    architecture, which allows applications that are incompatible with IPv6, SIIT-DC
    and/or Network Address Translation in general to operate correctly in an SIIT-DC
    environment. This is accomplished by introducing a new component called a SIIT-DC
    Host Agent, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Gateway. The application
    is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity. The reader is expected
    to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in [I-D.anderson-v6ops-siit-dc].</p>"
