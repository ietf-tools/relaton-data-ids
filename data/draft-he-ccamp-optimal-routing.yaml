abstract:
- content: <p>We propose a novel framework for inter-area MPLS optimal routing. The
    key to our proposal lies in deploying an overlaid star optical network in the
    OSPF backbone area and introducing the concept of "virtual area border routers"
    (v-ABRs). Compared with other proposals, our framework can provide globally optimized
    inter-area routing and has very good compatibility to existing traditional IP/MPLS
    routers.</p>
