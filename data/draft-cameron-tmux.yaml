abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the problems with the use of terminal servers is the large number
    of small packets they can generate. Frequently, most of these packets are destined
    for only one or two hosts. TMux is a protocol which allows multiple short transport
    segments, independent of application type, to be combined between a server and
    host pair.</p>"
