abstract:
- content: "<p>The current route target distribution specification described in RFC4684
    defines Route Target NLRIs of maxiumum length of 12 bytes. The IPv6 specific Route
    Target extended community is defined in RFC5701 as length of 20 bytes. Since the
    current specification only supports prefixes of maximum length of 12 bytes, the
    lack of an IPv6 specific Route Target reachability information may be a problem
    when an operator wants to use this application in a pure IPv6 environment. This
    document defines an extension that allows BGP to exchange longer length IPv6 Route
    Target prefixes.</p>"
