abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level
    protocol for control over the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP
    provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time
    data, such as audio and video. Sources of data can include both live data feeds
    and stored clips. This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery
    sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast
    UDP and TCP, and delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 1889). RTSP uses the
    Session Control Protocol (SCP) (see appendix) to allow the use of a single TCP
    connection between the client and server for controlling delivery of one or more
    streams of data.</p>"
