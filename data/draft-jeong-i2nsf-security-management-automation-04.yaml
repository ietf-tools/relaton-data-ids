abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Security Management Automation (SMA) of cloud-based
    security services in the framework of Interface to Network Security Functions
    (I2NSF). The security management automation in this document deals with closed-loop
    security control, security policy translation, and security audit. To support
    these three features in SMA, this document specifies an augmented architecture
    of the I2NSF framework with new system components and new interfaces.</p>"
