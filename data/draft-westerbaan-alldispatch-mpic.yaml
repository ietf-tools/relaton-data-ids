abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an API for Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration
    (MPIC) services to facilitate domain control validation (DCV) from multiple network
    perspectives. MPIC enhances the security of publicly-trusted certificate issuance
    by mitigating the risk of localized, equally-specific BGP hijacking attacks that
    can undermine traditional DCV methods permitted by the CA/Browser Forum Baseline
    Requirements for TLS Server Certificates. This API enables Certification Authorities
    (CAs) to more reliably integrate with external MPIC providers, promoting a more
    robust and resilient Web PKI ecosystem. The API design prioritizes flexibility,
    scalability, and interoperability, allowing for diverse implementations and deployment
    models. This standardization effort is driven by the need to consistently address
    vulnerabilities in the domain validation process highlighted by recent research
    and real-world attacks, as reflected in Ballot SC-067 V3 of the CA/Browser Forum's
    Server Certificate Working Group.</p>"
