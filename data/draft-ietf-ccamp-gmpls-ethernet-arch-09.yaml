abstract:
- content: <p>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities
    of Ethernet switches and Ethernet forwarding models. As a consequence, the role
    of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were
    the domain of other technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) /
    Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Asynchronous
    Transfer Mode (ATM). This document defines an architecture and framework for a
    Generalized- MPLS-based control plane for Ethernet in this "transport network"
    capacity. GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies. Some additional
    extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed, and this document provides a
    framework for these extensions. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
