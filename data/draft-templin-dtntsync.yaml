abstract:
- content: "<p>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model
    in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.
    DTN nodes include timestamps in the bundles of data they send so that correspondents
    can identify the bundles and determine the length of time they have been in the
    system. However, there is currently no specified strategy for synchronizing the
    clocks between DTN nodes. This document therefore presents a problem statement
    for time synchronization in DTNs.</p>"
