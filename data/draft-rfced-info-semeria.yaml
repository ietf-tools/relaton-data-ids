abstract:
- content: "<p>The first part of this paper describes the benefits of multicasting,
    the MBONE, Class D addressing, and the operation of the Internet Group Management
    Protocol (IGMP). The second section explores a number of different algorithms
    that may potentially be employed by multicast routing protocols: - Flooding -
    Spanning Trees - Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB) - Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting
    (TRPB) - Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM) - Core Based Trees The third part contains
    the main body of the paper. It describes how the previous algorithms are implemented
    in multicast routing protocols available today. - Distance Vector Multicast Routing
    Protocol (DVMRP) - Multicast OSPF (MOSPF) - Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM)</p>"
