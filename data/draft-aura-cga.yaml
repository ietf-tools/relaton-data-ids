abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses where
    the interface identifier is generated by hashing the address owner's public key.
    The address owner can then use the corresponding private key to assert address
    ownership and to sign messages sent from the address without any additional security
    infrastructure. This document describes a generic CGA format that can be used
    in multiple applications.</p>"
