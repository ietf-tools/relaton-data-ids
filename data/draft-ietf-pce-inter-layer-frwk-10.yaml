abstract:
- content: "<p>A network may comprise multiple layers. It is important to globally
    optimize network resource utilization, taking into account all layers rather than
    optimizing resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows better
    network efficiency to be achieved through a process that we call inter-layer traffic
    engineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool to achieve
    inter-layer traffic engineering. This document describes a framework for applying
    the PCE-based architecture to inter-layer Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) traffic engineering. It provides suggestions for
    the deployment of PCE in support of multi-layer networks. This document also describes
    network models where PCE performs inter-layer traffic engineering, and the relationship
    between PCE and a functional component called the Virtual Network Topology Manager
    (VNTM). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
