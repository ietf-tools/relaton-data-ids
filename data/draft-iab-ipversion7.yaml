abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet growth has created serious problems of address space consumption
    and routing information explosion. A solution to these problems requires a new
    version of the Internet Protocol, which we call IP version 7 ('IPv7'). This memo
    presents architectural guidelines that any IPv7 should meet. It then discusses
    how an IPv7 based upon the OSI CLNP protocol would meet these requirements, and
    presents the reasons for the IAB's preference for this solution. Finally, it makes
    a three-part recommendation: (1) proceed at full speed on CIDR; (2) do the design
    work on IPv7 based on CLNP; and (3) continue to pursue research in advanced routing
    and other future extensions of the Internet architecture.</p>"
