abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Bay Networks Gateway architecture for interworking
    of PSTN SS7 with Internet. Signaling System 7 (SS7) networking is the primary
    means used in the PSTN for control of circuit-switched connections and value added
    PSTN services such as freephone (800/888) number translation, calling card validation
    and Intelligent Network services. The Gateway architecture provides a scalable
    method of supporting interworking between SS7 network elements and Internet elements
    such as a Remote Access Server (RAS). The Gateway architecture can support connection
    control and database access. Gateway design, functions and protocol are described.</p>"
