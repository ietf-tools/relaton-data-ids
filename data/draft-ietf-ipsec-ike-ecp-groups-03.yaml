abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes new Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups
    for use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key Exchange version 2
    (IKEv2) protocols in addition to previously defined groups. Specifically, the
    new curve groups are based on modular arithmetic rather than binary arithmetic.
    These new groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC implementations
    and standards, particularly NIST standards. In addition, the curves defined here
    can provide more efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
