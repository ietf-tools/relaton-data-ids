abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information
    networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g.
    latency) have become (or are becoming) as (or more) critical to data path selection
    than other metrics. This document describes extensions to the BFD protocol, such
    that network performance information can be gathered in a scalable fashion, and
    subsequently used (by other protocols) to make path selection decisions. These
    extensions will also provide granular performance monitoring information.</p>"
