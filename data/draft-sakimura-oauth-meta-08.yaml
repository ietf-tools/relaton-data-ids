abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an extensible metadata framework that may
    be inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to process those
    responses. It is expressed either as a link header, or query parameters. It will
    allow the client to learn the metadata about the particular response. For example,
    the client can learn where the members in the response could be used, what is
    the characteristics of the payload is, how it should be processed, and so on.
    Since they are just additional response header/query parameters, any client that
    does not understand this extension should not break and work normally while supporting
    clients can utilize the metadata to take the advantage of the extension.</p>"
