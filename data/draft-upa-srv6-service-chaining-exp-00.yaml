abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports lessons learned from an experimental deployment
    of service chaining with Segment Routing over the IPv6 data plane (SRv6) at an
    event network. The service chaining part of the network was comprised of four
    SRv6-capable nodes (three products from different vendors), five SRv6 proxy nodes
    (two products from different vendors and three open source software), and six
    services. This network was deployed at Interop Tokyo 2019, and it successfully
    provided network connectivity and services to all the exhibitors and visitors
    on the event.</p>"
