abstract:
- content: "<p>Home network (Homenet) is a good application scenario for ICN considering
    it is a point where diverse users, devices, applications, and services meet. Homenets
    are getting increasingly complex with the presence of application specific sensors,
    smart appliances, and smart networking devices such as residential gateway. Home
    automation today is being driven by several alliances such as DLNA, AllJoyn, ZigBee,
    and Z-Wave aimed at supporting homenet services such as multimedia sharing, lighting
    control, climate control, and energy management. These standards overlay application
    semantics over a host centric architectures which is inefficient, and the lack
    of inter- operability among these standards results in high cost, inflexibility,
    and inter-operability issues. Homenet is an information-centric environment where
    the objective is to enable consumers and producers to interact in a contextual
    manner independent of their underlying topology arrangement. Although the overall
    homenet objectives over an ICN framework versus any other are the same; ICN can
    distinguish itself by providing a rich service abstraction layer applicable in
    local scale as in BAN/PAN/LAN, and also enable intelligent interaction beyond
    the homenet boundary. In this draft we share the idea of a contextualized information-
    centric bus (CIBUS) which builds over ICN abstraction of naming, name resolution,
    and content dissemination for home network by providing support for service management,
    context processing and monitoring, policy management, and policy based routing
    and forwarding. CIBUS allows applications and services to discover each other,
    subscribe/ notify to event upon which service composition can be realized locally
    or in a centralize manner. Furthermore, service policies can be applied at high
    granularity which can be imposed in the routing and forwarding plane through ICN
    extensions. Some of these CIBUS features that were realized in [5] is presented
    here.</p>"
