abstract:
- content: "<p>Location-based services, navigation applications, emergency services,
    management of equipment in the field, and other location-dependent services need
    geographic location information about a Target (such as a user, resource or other
    entity). There is a need to securely gather and transfer location information
    for location services, while at the same time protect the privacy of the individuals
    involved. This document focuses on the authorization, security and privacy requirements
    for such location-dependent services. Specifically, it describes the requirements
    for the Geopriv Location Object (LO) and for the protocols that use this Location
    Object. This LO is envisioned to be the primary data structure used in all Geopriv
    protocol exchanges to securely transfer location data. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
