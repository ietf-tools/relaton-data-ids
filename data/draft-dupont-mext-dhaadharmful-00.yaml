abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) mechanism is described
    in the Mobile IPv6 specification. This mechanism is mandatory in any compliant
    Mobile IPv6 implementation and so in any MIPv6 based protocols too. On the other
    hand, DHAAD was the only one mechanism to discover a potential Home Agent for
    a Mobile Node in the past. This is no longer the case today. This document analyzes
    the security of the different existing home agent discovery mechanisms and promotes
    the remove of DHAAD from the future Mobile IPv6 standard, in light of this security
    analysis.</p>"
