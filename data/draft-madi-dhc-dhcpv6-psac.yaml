abstract:
- content: "<p>IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel
    of security mechanism to protect the communication between the host and the local
    servers, such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304]. In the public wireless access
    environment, an extra trust relationship configuration between the roaming host
    and the local server, manually or by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible. DHCP is
    typically the first protocol executed by a mobile host when it enters a new network,
    so this document present an extension to DHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters needed
    for IPSec, avoiding the delay invited by manual configuration of security association
    or IKE interaction for IPSec.</p>"
