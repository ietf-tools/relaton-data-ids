abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment routing uses globally-known labels to accomplish forwarding
    along shortest paths, and label stacks to accomplish explicit routing along arbitrary
    paths. These labels are advertised using an IGP. This draft describes how label
    bindings corresponding to RSVP, LDP, BGP labeled-unicast, and static LSPs are
    advertised in segment routing and how these labels can be combined with other
    segment routing labels to create forwarding paths. This draft also describes how
    context labels for egress node protection are advertised in using segment routing
    IGP extensions.</p>"
