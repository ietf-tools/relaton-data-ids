abstract:
- content: "<p>The Low Latency Low Loss Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture allows
    data flows over the public Internet to predictably achieve ultra-low queuing latency,
    generally zero congestion loss and scaling of per-flow throughput without the
    problems of traditional TCP. To achieve this, L4S data flows use a 'scalable'
    congestion control similar to Data Centre TCP (DCTCP) and a form of Explicit Congestion
    Notification (ECN) with modified behaviour. However, until now, scalable congestion
    controls did not co-exist with existing TCP Reno/ Cubic traffic---scalable controls
    are so aggressive that 'Classic' TCP algorithms drive themselves to starvation.
    Therefore, until now, L4S controls could only be deployed where a clean-slate
    environment could be arranged, such as in private data centres (hence the name
    DCTCP). This specification defines `DualQ Coupled Active Queue Management (AQM)',
    which enables these scalable congestion controls to safely co-exist with Classic
    Internet traffic. The Coupled AQM ensures that a flow runs at about the same rate
    whether it uses DCTCP or TCP Reno/Cubic. It achieves this indirectly, without
    having to inspect transport layer flow identifiers, When tested in a residential
    broadband setting, DCTCP also achieves sub-millisecond average queuing delay and
    zero congestion loss under a wide range of mixes of DCTCP and `Classic' broadband
    Internet traffic, without compromising the performance of the Classic traffic.
    The solution also reduces network complexity and eliminates network configuration.</p>"
