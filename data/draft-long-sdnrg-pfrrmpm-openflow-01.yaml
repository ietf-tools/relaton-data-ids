abstract:
- content: "<p>In the SDN, the controller is in charge of the maintenance and administration
    of variable aspects like the network topology and the network resources etc. of
    the whole network. Administrative strategies are made upon these work and sent
    to the switches from the controller so as to instruct the network devices to apply
    appropriate policies to the data flows. As for the data packet which reaches the
    ingress OpenFlow switch for the first time, the packet itself or a fraction of
    the packet will be encapsulated into a packet-in message and will be sent to the
    controller to request for a new flow rule. After the flow-mod message and the
    packet-out message are sent back to the switch from the controller, the determined
    forwarding action will be applied to the certain data flow. So far, the inbound
    latency caused by the creation of the packet-in message and the outbound latency
    caused by the receive and the execution of the flow-mod message are highlighted
    when it comes to the concerns about the latency and the effectiveness of the data
    transportation in the SDN[Mazu]. Attention to the studies on the processing order
    of the flow rule request message like the packet-in message and the packet-out
    message is comparatively low. As the SDN continually grows in scale and complexity
    and the packets' forwarding policies become more recursive and dynamic, the number
    of the switches under the administration of the same controller is elevated and
    unavoidably causes the network congestion problem widespread. The scale of modern
    networks and data-centers and the associated operational expense deteriorates
    the delay problem in the network with congestion. The ability to help the services
    with high priority be processed without delay becomes critical. This document
    proposes the combination of appending a priority tag to the packet-in message
    and the Priority based Flow Rule Request Message Processing Mechanism(PFRRMPM)
    as a solution to help the data flow with high priority or lantency-sensitive to
    acquire the forwarding rule without or with shorter waiting latency when there
    are excess flow rule request messages in the SDN.</p>"
