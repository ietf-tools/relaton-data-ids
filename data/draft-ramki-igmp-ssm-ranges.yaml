abstract:
- content: "<p>In an IGMP snooping multicast network with version 3 (v3) enabled on
    the routers, when a v2 join/leave is received for a multicast group the router
    operates on V2 compatible mode. For SSM ranges a (*,G)v2 or v3 report should be
    ignored by the router/switch. The IGMP snooping switches may not have knowledge
    about the user configured SSM range in the network to correctly discard/ignore
    the v2 join/ leave. Accepting (*,G) v2 or v3 will cause SSM operations to fail.
    This draft discusses distribution of SSM ranges in the L2 multicast network so
    that L2 snooping switches can learn about the configured SSM ranges and discard
    any (*,G) v2/v3 reports for the said ranges.</p>"
