abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the expected business telephony requirements
    for delivering called party name towards SIP entities. A couple of mechanisms
    exist to deliver calling name and number to the called party. None exist for exposing
    the called party name or preferred identity to the calling party. This draft proposes
    a mechanism to provide this capability.</p>"
