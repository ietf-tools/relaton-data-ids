abstract:
- content: "<p>The fundamental problem of Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) computation
    which is typical of quality of service routing, is that the problem is NP-hard.
    While standard approximation methods exist, their complexity may often be prohibitive
    in terms of scalability. Recently pre-computation and caching techniques have
    been suggested [3] [4] to achieve better on-demand computation costs. The motivation
    for pre- computation and path caching is to reduce as much of the on-demand computational
    overhead as possible. To fully utilize Pre-computation and caching of QoS paths
    at a source, mechanisms should be available to verify the validity of either the
    full or a partial subset of the pre-computed paths. The mechanisms should preferably
    support verification of the consistency of either partial or the full pre-computed
    path cache. In an IP control plane, CSPF is expected to work in conjunction with
    OSPF-TE [1] and RSVP-TE [2] protocols. To support CSPF algorithms that might want
    to use pre-computation and caching techniques rooted at a source or an identified
    core in the network, we propose mechanisms to dynamically setup OSPF 'virtual
    links' and describe setting up of 'virtual areas' to enable OSPF based selective
    network monitoring and updation. Such an extension will help deploy flexible CSPF
    algorithms that might be distributed, partially distributed or utilize pre-computation
    or caching techniques.</p>"
