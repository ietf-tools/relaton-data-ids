abstract:
- content: "<p>The email ecosystem has long had a very permissive set of common processing
    rules in place, despite increasingly rigid standards governing its components,
    ostensibly to improve the user experience. The handling of these come at some
    cost, and various components are faced with decisions about whether or not to
    permit non-conforming messages to continue toward their destinations unaltered,
    adjust them to conform (possibly at the cost of losing some of the original message),
    or outright rejecting them. This document includes a collection of the best advice
    available regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used
    as implementation guidance. It must be emphasized, however, that the intent of
    this document is not to standardize malformations or otherwise encourage their
    proliferation. The messages are manifestly malformed, and the code and culture
    that generates them needs to be fixed. Therefore, these messages should be rejected
    outright if at all possible. Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise
    legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and, unfortunately,
    commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply reject or discard them.
    Accordingly, this document presents alternatives for dealing with them in ways
    that seem to do the least additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened
    up to match the standards.</p>"
