abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distribute routing
    information between autonomous systems (ASes), is a critical component of the
    Internet's routing infrastructure. It is highly vulnerable to a variety of malicious
    attacks both in theory and in practice, due to the lack of a scalable means of
    verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of BGP control traffic. This document
    is a protocol specification for Secure BGP (S-BGP), an extension to BGP-4. S-BGP
    adheres to the principle of least privilege and uses countermeasures that create
    an authentication and authorization system that addresses most of the security
    problems associated with BGP. To facilitate adoption and deployment, S-BGP is
    designed to minimize the overhead (processing, bandwidth, storage) added by its
    countermeasures and to be interoperable with the current BGP so as to be incrementally
    deployable.</p>"
