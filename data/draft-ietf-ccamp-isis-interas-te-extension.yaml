abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the ISIS (ISIS) protocol to support
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) for multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes). It defines ISIS-TE extensions for
    the flooding of TE information about inter-AS links, which can be used to perform
    inter- AS TE path computation. No support for flooding information from within
    one AS to another AS is proposed or defined in this document. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
