abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a "reverse change of authorization (CoA)" path
    for RADIUS packets. This specification allows a home server to send CoA packets
    in "reverse" down a RADIUS/TLS connection. Without this capability, it is impossible
    for a home server to send CoA packets to a NAS which is behind a firewall or NAT
    gateway. The reverse CoA functionality extends the available transport methods
    for CoA packets, but it does not change anything else about how CoA packets are
    handled.</p>
