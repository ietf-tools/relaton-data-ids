abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides specification for aggregation of RSVP end-to-
    end reservations over MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) tunnels or MPLS Diffserv-aware
    MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) Tunnels. This approach is based on RFC 3175 and
    simply modifies the corresponding procedures for operations over MPLS TE tunnels
    instead of aggregated RSVP reservations. This approach can be used to achieve
    admission control of a very large number of flows in a scalable manner since the
    devices in the core of the network are unaware of the end-to-end RSVP reservations
    and are only aware of the MPLS TE tunnels.</p>"
