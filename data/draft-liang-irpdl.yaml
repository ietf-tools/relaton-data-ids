abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an information retrieval protocol for digital
    library. This protocol has two parts: standard search Webservice, which defines
    the format of query words and the search results; a method to find and select
    such search Webservice. By using this protocol, all the databases including web
    page database, digital issue database, and video database, can release the uniform
    search Webservice, though these databases may have different metadata standards
    and architectures. And these Webservice can be easily found and visited by search
    systems. This very protocol makes it possible that users can obtain all kinds
    of information on the Internet in single search engine, but not visit lots of
    different search engines one by one.</p>"
