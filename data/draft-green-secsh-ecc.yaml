- content: "<p>This document describes algorithms based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography
    (ECC) for use within the Secure Shell (SSH) transport protocol. In particular,
    it specifies Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, Elliptic Curve
    Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV) key agreement, and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
    Algorithm (ECDSA) for use in the SSH Transport Layer protocol. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
