abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes different scenarios in Third Generation Partnership
    Project (3GPP) defined packet network, i.e., General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
    that would need IP version 6 and IP version 4 transition. The focus of this document
    is on the scenarios where the User Equipment (UE) connects to nodes in other networks,
    e.g., in the Internet. GPRS network internal transition scenarios, i.e., between
    different GPRS elements in the network, are out of scope. The purpose of the document
    is to list the scenarios for further discussion and study. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
