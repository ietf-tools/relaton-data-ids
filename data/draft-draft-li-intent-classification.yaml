abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 7575 [RFC7575] defines Intent as an abstract high-level policy
    used to operate the network. Intent management system includes an interface for
    users to input requests and an engine to translate the intents into the network
    configuration and manage their lifecycle. Up to now, there is no commonly agreed
    definition, interface or model of intent. This document discusses what intent
    means to different stakeholders, describes different ways to classify intent,
    and an associated taxonomy of this classification.</p>"
