abstract:
- content: "<p>A pseudowire (PW) is used in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solutions
    to form any-to-any connections and provide service demuliplexing among Provider
    Edge routers (PEs), and is normally transported over one single network path.
    Flow-aware PW enable a PW to take advantage of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or
    Link Aggregation Groups (LAG) in a packet switched network (PSN). PW packets with
    a flow label can be transported over multi-paths. This method can apply to the
    PWs in a VPLS service. This document describes how VPLS solutions utilize a PW
    with a flow label, and defines protocol extension for the provisioning of such
    PWs.</p>"
