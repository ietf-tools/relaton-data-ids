abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the Finger user information protocol. This is a
    simple protocol which provides an interface to a user information server. Based
    on RFC 742, the original memo on the Finger protocol, this memo attempts to clarify
    the expected communication between the two ends of a Finger connection. It also
    tries not to invalidate the many existing implementations or add unnecessary restrictions
    to the original protocol definition. This edition updates RFC 1288.</p>"
