abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model which supports cloud SLA applications.
    Two apps currently operating from this model are a cloud based policer application
    and a distributed-denial-of-service attack redirect application. Other applications
    are planned as well. Key to this model is that it includes semantics for mounting
    objects from remote network element datastores. These semantics are necessary
    so that applications can operate on objects distributed across multiple devices
    as if they were part of a single local datastore.</p>"
