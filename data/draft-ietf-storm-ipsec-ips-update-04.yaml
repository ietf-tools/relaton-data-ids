abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 3723 specifies IPsec requirements for block storage protocols over
    IP (e.g., Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)) based on IPsec v2
    (RFC 2401 and related RFCs); those requirements have subsequently been applied
    to remote direct data placement protocols, e.g., the Remote Direct Memory Access
    Protocol (RDMAP). This document updates RFC 3723's IPsec requirements to IPsec
    v3 (RFC 4301 and related RFCs) and makes some changes to required algorithms based
    on developments in cryptography since RFC 3723 was published.</p>"
