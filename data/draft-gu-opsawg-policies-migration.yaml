abstract:
- content: "<p>In accompany with the migration of a Virtual Machine (VM), state associated
    with the VM located on the Hypervisors and the network side devices (e.g., Firewalls)
    need to be updated in order to guarantee that the services executed on the migrated
    VM will not be disrupted. VM vendors have their own ways to migrate VM's state
    on Hypervisors, and so this is out the scope of this draft.This draft introduces
    the background of state migration on network devices using several application
    scenarios and tries to specify a clear scope for the future standardization work
    on state migration on network devices.</p>"
