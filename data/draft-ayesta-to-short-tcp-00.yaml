abstract:
- content: "<p>This document shows that short TCP sessions are prone to timeout. In
    particular, one single segment loss will provoke TCP to timeout if the document
    size is below certain threshold. This document analyzes the benefit of TCP modifications
    such as Limited Transmit Algorithm [RFC3042] and Increasing Initial Window [RFC2414]
    in the context of short-lived TCP transfers. However TCP remains vulnerable to
    the losses at the very end of the transmission. Therefore we suggest complementary
    modifications to Limited Transmit Algorithm to recover effectively from losses
    at the end of the TCP transfer.</p>"
