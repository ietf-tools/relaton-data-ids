abstract:
- content: "<p>Group communication over the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    can be secured by means of Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments
    (Group OSCORE). At deployment time, devices may not know the exact security groups
    to join, the respective Group Manager, or other information required to perform
    the joining process. This document describes how a CoAP endpoint can use descriptions
    and links of resources registered at the CoRE Resource Directory to discover security
    groups and to acquire information for joining them through the respective Group
    Manager. A given security group may protect multiple application groups, which
    are separately announced in the Resource Directory as sets of endpoints sharing
    a pool of resources. This approach is consistent with, but not limited to, the
    joining of security groups based on the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization
    in constrained environments.</p>"
