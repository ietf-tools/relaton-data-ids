abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) defines a tree of names starting
    with root, ".", immediately below which are top level domain (TLD) names such
    as ".com" and ".us". RFC2606 reserved a small number of TLD names for use in documentation
    examples, private testing, experiments, and other circumstances in which it is
    desirable to avoid conflict with current or future actual TLD names in the DNS.
    The evolution of Internet engineering and operation practices since RFC2606 was
    published in 1999, and the expected addition of new TLD names to the DNS, recommend
    this update to the list of reserved TLD names, and the creation of a "reserved
    TLD name registry" to which additional names may be added as new requirements
    arise. It is important to note that TLD names may be reserved, in other contexts,
    for policy, political, or other reasons that are distinct from the IETF's concern
    with Internet engineering and operations. This document reserves TLD names only
    for operational and engineering reasons.</p>
