abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to instantiate and manage Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) on a Path Computation Client (PCC). This includes the ability
    for a PCE to specify a Binding Segment Identifier (SID) for an LSP as described
    in RFC9604. A binding value specified by a PCE may not be available for use on
    the PCC. This can lead to LSP instantiation failures or entire PCEP message being
    rejected. This document proposes extensions to PCEP to allow a PCC to fall back
    to allocating a Binding SID from its own dynamic range if the value specified
    by the PCE is unavailable. It also defines a mechanism for the PCC to report both
    the requested and the allocated binding values back to the PCE.</p>"
