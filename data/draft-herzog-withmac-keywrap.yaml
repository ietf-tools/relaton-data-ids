abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new key-wrapping algorithm to be used in
    the EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData structures of the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax. Because these structures do not provide data-origin authentication,
    a recipient cannot cryptographically verify that the plaintext received was the
    plaintext encapsulated by the message's original sender. The With- MAC key-wrapping
    algorithm allows an EncryptedKey value to hold both a wrapped symmetric key and
    a MAC value on the data to be authenticated. When used in EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData
    and AuthEnvelopedData structures, therefore, these structures can achieve data-origin
    authentication (in some circumstances) using only symmetric-key algorithms. This
    is useful in cases where the structures must be generated by entities without
    certified digital- signature keys.</p>"
