abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an authenticated key agreement method for the
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3. The authentication method
    requires that the server (and optionally client) is pre-provisioned with a unique
    long-term static asymmetric Finite Field Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve
    Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) keypair; the peer must be able to obtain the public key
    of the endpoint via an out-of-band mechanism (e.g. pre-provisioning). The handshake
    provides ephemeral (EC)DH keys, and a common key schedule is agreed using Double-
    or Triple-(EC)DH. Confirmation of knowledge of the key schedule provides server
    (and optionally client) authentication.</p>"
