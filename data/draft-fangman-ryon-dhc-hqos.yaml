abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
    option that is passed from the DHCP Server to the DHCP Client to define which
    QoS mechanism and the specific classification settings to be used by the host
    in its IP datagram forwarding field. This document describes the option support
    for IP datagram network layer QoS mechanisms. This option does have the ability
    to support data link layer QoS mechanisms if so defined in future updates of this
    document.</p>"
