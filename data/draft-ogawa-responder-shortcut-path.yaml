abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a peer-to-peer protocol to set up shortcut paths
    in an environment where an internetworking (L3) protocol, such as IP, overlays
    a link-layer (L2) protocol such as ATM. In such a network, L3 routing is the default
    mechanism for data transfer but it is also possible to set up direct L2 paths
    such as ATM VCs, that bypass L3 routing, so as to expedite the transfer of data.
    The protocol described in this memo can be applied as an inter-LIS (Logical IP
    Subnetwork) shortcut protocol when an L2 subnetwork is configured into multiple
    LISs. It can also be used as an independent protocol to set up direct L2 paths.
    In this way, it operates without L2 address resolution servers and allows the
    use of conventional routers (those without address resolution function) in the
    network. Therefore, it is useful for networks that have no available L2 address
    resolution service.</p>"
