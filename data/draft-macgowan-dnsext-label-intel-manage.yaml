abstract:
- content: "<p>A multidimensional array of domain label analysis and extensions are
    offered to overcome a number of issues with the DNS and its use to locate resources
    on the Internet. These goals are accomplished by proposing a naming convention
    to add labels to domain strings. The result will be a rational relationship to
    the content that will provide a method for meeting the ever-increasing need to
    expand the namespace, while providing an efficient search system to access content
    in a user- friendly manner.</p>"
