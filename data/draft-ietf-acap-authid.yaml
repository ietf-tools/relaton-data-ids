abstract:
- content: "<p>Most distributed (client/server) applications require an authenti-
    cation process between the client and the server before the server will grant
    access to its managed resources. Many applications pro- vide varying levels of
    access to server resources based on a combi- nation of authentication credentials
    and access control rules. The collection of information used to control access
    to resources is called 'authorization information'. The authorization identifer
    datasets contain lists of users and groups of users that can be used by applications
    for authorization purposes. Access control mechanisms can be abstracted from under-
    lying authentication mechanisms and credential formats. They can be extended to
    include group memberships in dynamic calculations for access rights to resources
    or in definition of one time autho- rization certificates. The Application Configuration
    Access Protocol (ACAP) supports the remote storage and access of many types of
    structured configuration information. The authorization identifier datasets specification
    describes the 'userid' and 'groupid' datasets which contain the authorization
    information. It also describes ACAP server capabili- ties that advertise a server's
    support for authorization user and group semantics.</p>"
