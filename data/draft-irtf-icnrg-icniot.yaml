abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to the Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols to enable
    a horizontally unified IoT architecture. The objective of such an architecture
    is to make resource objects securely accessible to applications across organizations
    and domains. Towards this goal, quite a few proposals have been made to build
    an application-layer based unified IoT platform on top of today's host-centric
    Internet. However, there is a fundamental mismatch between the host-centric nature
    of today's Internet and the mostly information-centric nature of the IoT domain.
    To address this mismatch, the common set of protocols and network services offered
    by an information-centric networking (ICN) architecture can be leveraged to realize
    an ICN-based IoT (or ICN- IoT) architecture that can take advantage of the salient
    features of ICN such as naming, security, mobility, compute and efficient content
    and service delivery support offered by it. In this draft, we summarize the general
    IoT demands, and ICN features that support these requirements, and then discuss
    the challenges to realize an ICN-based IoT framework. Beyond this, the goal of
    this draft is not to offer any specific ICN-IoT architectural proposal.</p>
