abstract:
- content: "<p>IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) is used for compressing the
    IP payload in transmission to increase the communication performance. The IPComp
    is applied to payload of the IP datagram, starting with the first octet immediately
    after the IP header in IPv4, and starting with the first octet after the excluded
    IPv6 Extension headers. However, Transport layer information such as source port
    and destination port are useful in many network functions in transmission. This
    document defines extensions of IP payload compression protocol (IPComp) to support
    compressing the payload excluding the transport layer information, to enable network
    functions using transport layer information (e.g., ECMP) working together with
    the payload compression. This document also defines an extension of IPComp to
    indicate the payload is not compressed to solve the out-of-order problems between
    the compressed and uncompressed packets.</p>"
