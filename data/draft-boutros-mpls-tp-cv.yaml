abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies method for verifying the connection of an MPLS
    Transport Profile(MPLS-TP) Label Switched Path (LSP) for management purpose. The
    proposed extension is based on MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM). The goal is to verify that an MPLS-TP is properly setup in both control
    and data planes, as well as to record the identities of all the LSRs along the
    path of MPLS-TP LSP.</p>"
