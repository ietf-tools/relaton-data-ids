abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for fast protection against the
    failure of an egress node of a "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER) domain.
    It is called BIER egress protection. It does not require any per-flow state in
    the core of the domain. With BIER egress protection the failure of a primary BFER
    (Bit Forwarding Egress Router) is protected with a backup BFER such that traffic
    destined to the primary BFER in the BIER domain is fast rerouted by a neighbor
    BFR to the backup BFER on the BIER layer. The mechanism is applicable if all BIER
    traffic sent to the primary BFER can reach its destination also via the backup
    BFER. It is complementary to BIER- FRR which cannot protect against the failure
    of a BFER.</p>
