abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the BGP-4 Finite State Machine in detail. This
    Finite State machine (FSM) describes how the 27 events operate on the 6 states
    described in the BGP-4 standard. These 27 events include administrative events,
    timer events, TCP connectivity events and BGP message events. This document is
    standards track to accompany the BGP-4 [1] standard as a standard document. This
