abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses H.323 communication as it is being developed and
    implemented within the context of today's Internet (I1 and I2). As such it suggests
    a model that the authors believe can be developed using current thinking, protocols,
    and practices. It is also intended to support a vision for future communication
    development that will allow multi-mode communication to become more universally
    useful for end-users while becoming more sophisticated and reliable in its technological
    foundation. The authors see the concepts emerging within and around the development
    of the H.323 standard as some of the most promising today for enabling Internet-extensible
    multi-mode global communication. After a brief presentation of a communication
    model, several problems and concerns with the present state of H.323 communication
    are presented along with specific recommendations for changes in these areas.</p>"
