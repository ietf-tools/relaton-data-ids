abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Update includes the destination prefix and AS_PATH that records
    the AS number through which it passes. The traffic routing to the destination
    prefix should be forwarded along the AS sequence in AS_PATH. However, due to traffic
    redirection, route aggregation and etc., the AS path of forwarding and the AS_PATH
    of BGP Update often do not match. The inconsistency leads to security risks such
    as black holes, loops in inter-domain forwarding, and the possibility of forwarding
    through malicious AS that source/upstream AS does not want to pass through.</p>"
