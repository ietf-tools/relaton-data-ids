abstract:
- content: "<p>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards
    track within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the level of vendor
    support and deployment has been relatively slow, despite the desire of many to
    deploy technology to deliver services with different levels of quality of service
    (QoS) to their customers. The reasons for this are arguably well-understood and
    documented and are not the focus of this memo. This memo is proposing a (NSIS
    Transport Layer Protocol) NTLP, that is a modified version of RSVPv1 specified
    in RFC2205. Furthermore, it provides design guidelines and specifications for
    the development of the NLTP that is based on a modified version of RSVPv1.</p>"
