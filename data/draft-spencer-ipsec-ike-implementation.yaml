abstract:
- content: "<p>The current IPsec specifications for key exchange and connection management,
    RFCs 2408 [ISAKMP] and 2409 [IKE], leave many aspects of connection management
    unspecified, most prominently rekeying practices. Pending clarifications in future
    revisions of the specifications, this document sets down some successful experiences,
    to minimize the extent to which new implementors have to rely on unwritten folklore.</p>"
