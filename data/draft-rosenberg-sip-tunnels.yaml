abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the usage of SIP to establish a variety of
    layer three tunnels, including IP-in-IP tunnels, IPSec tunnels, and MPLS LSPs.
    We also show how the INFO method can be used to carry the data for those tunnels.
    The result is that existing proxy networks can be reused for routing of IP packets.</p>"
