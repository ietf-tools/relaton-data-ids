abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo addresses an issue with the current PIM in Sparse Mode. In
    the case of router reboot, PIM networks have to converge slowly and suffer long
    outage of traffic flows. This memo proposes a Generation Identifier (GenId) Option
    in PIM Hello messages. It enables neighbors to quickly detect router reboot and
    thus to synchronize RP-Set information and forwarding states by triggering Bootstrap
    and Join/Prune messages to the rebooted router. The rebooted router then is able
    to quickly recover from the reboot.</p>"
