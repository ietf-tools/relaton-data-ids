abstract:
- content: "<p>Application Servers, SIP Proxies, and SoftSwitches (a.k.a. Media Gateway
    Controllers) act as SIP [2] User Agents to control the media processing capabilities
    of media servers. The SIP Request URI identifies the desired service and provides
    a context for the media server to interpret the SIP message. This document describes
    a standard SIP addressing mechanism to address specific services. Because of SIP's
    flexibility, the existing protocol accommodates these services. This document
    proposes a standard URI scheme for important media services such as announcements
    and conferencing.</p>"
