abstract:
- content: "<p>The IS-IS routing protocol (ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols
    at the link layer for point-to-point links. As a result, it does not use a three-way
    handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-point media. This paper defines
    an backward-compatible extension to the protocol that provides for a three-way
    handshake. It is fully interoperable with systems that do not support the extension.
    Additionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than 256 point-to-point
    links on a single router. This extension has been implemented by multiple router
    vendors; this paper is provided as information to the Internet community in order
    to allow interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.</p>"
