abstract:
- content: "<p>The SDO 3GPP has done tremendous work to either standardize or study
    various types of wireless services that would depend on the satellite constellation
    network. While the ISLs, or Inter-Satellite Links, along with the routing scheme(s)
    over them are critical to help fullfil the satellite services, the 3GPP considers
    them out-of-scope. This leaves the significant work to be explored in the IETF
    domain. This draft stems from the 3GPP satellite use cases that have been studied
    for many years up to now, across a couple of releases, and lands on summarizing
    the challenges &amp; considerations of the satellite-based routing. Based on some
    unique &amp; advantageous characteristics associated with satellite networks,
    the draft raises briefly the general routing considerations for the integrated
    Non- Terrestrial &amp; Terrestial Networks.</p>"
