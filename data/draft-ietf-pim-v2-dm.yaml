abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a multicast routing algorithm efficient
    for multicast groups that are densely distributed across a network. This protocol
    does not have a topology discovery mechanism often used by a unicast routing protocol.
    It employes the same packet formats sparse- mode PIM [PIMSM] uses. This protocol
    is called dense-mode PIM. The foundation of this design was largely built on Deering's
    early work on IP multicast routing [Deering91].</p>"
