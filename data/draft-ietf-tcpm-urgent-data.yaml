abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes how current TCP implementations process TCP
    urgent indications and how the behavior of some widely deployed middleboxes affects
    how end systems process urgent indications. This document updates the relevant
    specifications such that they accommodate current practice in processing TCP urgent
    indications, raises awareness about the reliability of TCP urgent indications
    in the Internet, and recommends against the use of urgent indications (but provides
    advice to applications that do). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
