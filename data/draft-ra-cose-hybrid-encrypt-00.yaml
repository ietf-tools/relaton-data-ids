abstract:
- content: "<p>Hybrid key exchange refers to using multiple key exchange algorithms
    simultaneously and combining the result with the goal of providing security even
    if all but one of the component algorithms is broken. It is motivated by transition
    to post-quantum cryptography. This document provides a construction for hybrid
    key exchange in JOSE and COSE. It defines the use of traditional and PQC algorithms,
    a hybrid post-quantum KEM, for JOSE and COSE.</p>"
