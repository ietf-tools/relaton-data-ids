abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS-TE Graceful Shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying the
    nodes in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the TE capability on
    a link or on an entire Label Switching Router (LSR) is going to be disabled. MPLS-TE
    graceful shutdown mechanisms are tailored toward addressing planned outage in
    the network. This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms to reduce
    or eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned shutdown of a network
    resource. These operations are equally applicable to both MPLS-TE and its Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) extensions. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
