abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper summarizes the recommended correlation between service classes
    and their usage, with references to their corresponding recommended Differentiated
    Service Code Points (DSCP), traffic conditioners, Per-Hop Behaviors (PHB) and
    Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic requirement that
    particular DSCPs, traffic conditioner PHBs and AQM be used for a certain service
    class, but as a policy it is useful that they be applied consistently across the
    network.</p>"
