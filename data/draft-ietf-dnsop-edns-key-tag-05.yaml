abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
    authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.
    These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting
    from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This
    document specifies two different ways for validating resolvers to signal to a
    server which keys are referenced in their chain of trust. The data from such signaling
    allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC-signed
    zone.</p>"
