abstract:
- content: "<p>A key presumption of the Internet architecture has been that devices
    are general purpose computers. By constraining the set of devices that connect
    to the Internet to non-general purpose devices, we can introduce a set of network
    capabilities that provides an additional layer of protection to those devices.
    One such capability is the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD). This work builds
    on many existing network capabilities so as to be easily deployable by all involved.
    The focus of this work is primarily, but not exclusively, in the realm of security;
    and again primarily, but not exclusively, relating to smart objects.</p>"
