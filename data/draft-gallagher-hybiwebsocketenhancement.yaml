abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an update to RFC 6455 (WebSockets) which would
    enhance security by preventing network mapping via WebSockets. By comparing timing
    differences between failed opening handshakes, WebSockets can be abused within
    web browsers to discover details about a target's private network. WebSocket network
    mapping is more efficient than other in-browser mapping techniques as it can take
    advantage of child WebWorker processes to bypass the throttling mitigations in
    many browsers. An attacker can exploit this browser weakness when a victim accesses
    an attacker-controlled web page.</p>"
