abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC5837 describes a mechanism for Extending ICMP for Interface and
    Next-Hop Identification, which allows providing additional information in an ICMP
    error that helps identify interfaces participating in the path. This is especially
    useful in environments where each interface may not have a unique IP address to
    respond to, e.g., a traceroute. This document introduces a similar ICMP extension
    for Node Identification. It allows providing a unique IP address and/or a textual
    name for the node, in the case where each node may not have a unique IP address
    (e.g., the IPv6 nexthop deployment case described in draft-chroboczek-intarea-v4-via-v6).</p>"
