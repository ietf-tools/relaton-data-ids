abstract:
- content: "<p>Network operators and service providers are facing the challenge of
    deploying systems from different vendors while looking for a trade- off among
    transmission performance, network device reuse, and capital expenditure without
    the need of being tied to single vendor equipment. The deployment and operation
    of more dynamic and programmable network infrastructures can be driven by adopting
    model- driven and software-defined control and management paradigms. In this context,
    YANG enables to compile a set of consistent vendor- neutral data models for networks
    and components based on actual operational needs emerging from heterogeneous use
    cases. This document proposes YANG models to describe events, operations, and
    finite state machine of YANG-defined network elements. The proposed models can
    be applied in several use cases: i) in the context of optical networks to pre-instruct
    data plane devices (e.g., an optical transponder) on the actions to be performed
    (e.g., code adaptation) in case some events, such as physical layer degradations,
    occur; ii) in general data networks, network telemetry applications can define
    and embed custom data probes into data plane devices. A probe in many cases can
    be modeled as an FSM; iii) the monitoring of packet loss and delay through a network
    clustering approach.</p>"
