abstract:
- content: "<p>This document briefly examines what is known about the effects of the
    BGP MRAI timer, particularly on convergence. It highlights published work which
    suggests the MRAI interval as deployed has an adverse effect on the convergence
    time of BGP. It then recommends revised, lower default values for the MRAI timer,
    thought to be more suited to today's Internet environment.</p>"
