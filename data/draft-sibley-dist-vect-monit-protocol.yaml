abstract:
- content: "<p>Distance Vectored Monitoring Protocol (DVMP) is a inter-device communications
    protocol that merges the intelligence of routing protocol design with the ability
    to notify network management personnel of troubles experienced on managed devices.
    DVMP is intended to suppliment or replace conventional SNMP based monitoring systems
    in small to medium sized autonomous networks, require minimal planning or configuration
    overhead, and be familiar in configuration and operation to network administrators.</p>"
