abstract:
- content: "<p>This document complements the Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering
    (DS-TE) requirements document by giving a functional specification for the Maximum
    Allocation with Reservation (MAR) Bandwidth Constraints Model. Assumptions, applicability,
    and examples of the operation of the MAR Bandwidth Constraints Model are presented.
    MAR performance is analyzed relative to the criteria for selecting a Bandwidth
    Constraints Model, in order to provide guidance to user implementation of the
    model in their networks. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
