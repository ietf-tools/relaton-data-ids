abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals
    of On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling, a Layer-3 mechanism for 6TiSCH networks. The purpose
    of OTF is to dynamically adapt the aggregate bandwidth, i.e., the number of reserved
    soft cells between neighbor nodes, based on the specific application constraints
    to be satisfied. When using OTF, softcell reservation is distributed: through
    the 6top interface, neighbor nodes negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated/
    deleted, with no intervention needed of a centralized entity. This document aims
    at defining a module which uses the functionalities provided by the 6top sublayer
    to (i) extract statistics and (ii) determine when to reserve/delete soft cells
    in the schedule. The exact reservation and deletion algorithm, and the number
    and type of statistics to be used in the algorithm are out of scope. OTF deals
    only with the number of softcells to be reserved/deleted; it is up to 6top to
    select the specific soft cells within the TSCH schedule.</p>"
