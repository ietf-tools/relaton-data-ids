abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the "SVCB" and "HTTPS" DNS resource record
    (RR) types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make connections
    to network services, such as for HTTPS origins. SVCB records allow a service to
    be provided from multiple alternative endpoints, each with associated parameters
    (such as transport protocol configuration and keys for encrypting the TLS ClientHello).
    They also enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The
    HTTPS RR is a variation of SVCB for HTTPS and HTTP origins. By providing more
    information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these
    records offer potential benefits to both performance and privacy. TO BE REMOVED:
    This proposal is inspired by and based on recent DNS usage proposals such as ALTSVC,
    ANAME, and ESNIKEYS (as well as long standing desires to have SRV or a functional
    equivalent implemented for HTTP). These proposals each provide an important function
    but are potentially incompatible with each other, such as when an origin is load-balanced
    across multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN). Furthermore, these each add potential
    cases for adding additional record lookups in addition to AAAA/A lookups. This
    design attempts to provide a unified framework that encompasses the key functionality
    of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility for addressing similar
    future challenges. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github
    at: https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc [1]. The most recent working version
    of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available there. The authors
    (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>'
