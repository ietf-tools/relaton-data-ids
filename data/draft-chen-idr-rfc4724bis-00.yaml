abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize
    the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. An End-of-RIB marker is
    specified and can be used to convey routing convergence information. A new BGP
    capability, termed "Graceful Restart Capability", is defined that would allow
    a BGP speaker to express its ability to preserve its forwarding state during BGP
    restart, as well as to convey its intention of generating the End-of-RIB marker
    upon the completion of its initial routing update. Finally, procedures are outlined
    for temporarily retaining routing information across a TCP session termination/re-establishment.
    The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to all routers, both
    those with the ability to preserve the forwarding state during BGP restart and
    those without (although the latter need to implement only a subset of the mechanisms
    described in this document).</p>
