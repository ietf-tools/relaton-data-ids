- content: "<p>The IETF policies about rights in Contributions to the IETF are designed
    to ensure that such Contributions can be made available to the IETF and Internet
    communities while permitting the authors to retain as many rights as possible.
    This memo is an update to [RFC5378] and retains the same consistent policies about
    intellectual property rights in Contributions to the IETF and contains the edits
    needed to recognize the IETF Intellectual Property Management Corporation (IPMC)
    as the successor to the IETF Trust. This memo updates [RFC5378].</p>"
