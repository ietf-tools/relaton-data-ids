abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC7862, Network File System (NFS) version 4
    minor version 2, by adding two operations to prevent the client from destroying
    session when getting the reply of a mis-ordered request with NFS4ERR_SEQ_MISORDERED.
    In NFSv4 minor version 1, sequence ID is used to ensure that the size of the needed
    reply cache is tightly bounded. If the server gets a mis-ordered request, the
    client will often break the session and establish a new session with the server.
    This approach results in a significant burden on the client and the server. During
    the process of session rebuilding, IO performance will be affected. This is especially
    troublesome when network latency is substantial, as, for example when client and
    server are in different locations. This document will propose extensions to NFSv4
    that would allow client reconnection to be dispensed with.</p>"
