abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the motivation and requirements for the use
    of Network Level Packet Erasure Coding to improve the performance of the QUIC
    protocol that is proposed a new transport protocol. The document does not specify
    a specific code but lists the salient features that a code should have in order
    to deal with know loss patterns on QUIC paths.</p>"
