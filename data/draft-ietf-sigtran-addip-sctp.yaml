abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) [RFC2960] to provide a method to add or delete an IP address from
    an existing association or to request the peer to change its primary destination
    address. The benefit of this extension is for machines with hot pluggable interface
    cards the ability to add (and/or delete) IP addresses dynamically without forcing
    an SCTP association restart.</p>"
