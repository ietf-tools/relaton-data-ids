abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for enabling RDMA Network Interface
    Cards (RNICs) that implement both the IETF and RDMAC versions of the DDP and RDMAP
    protocols to interoperate with legacy RNICs that are based on the RDMAC version
    of the protocols. The proposed scheme uses MPA Request/Reply Frames to negotiate
    the protocol version as well as MPA marker and MPA CRC. A ULP or other supporting
    entity must perform this negotiation on behalf of the RDMAC RNIC because RDMAC
    MPA does not define an MPA connection scheme using MPA Request/Reply frames. This
    draft also makes specific recommendations for minor changes to the IETF MPA, DDP,
    and RDMAP internet drafts to aid in interoperability.</p>"
