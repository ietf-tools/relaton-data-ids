abstract:
- content: "<p>This document enumerates and describes the candidate schemes that can
    be used to indicate the presence of the MPLS extension header(s) following the
    MPLS label stack. The similar schemes are also applicable for indicating the potential
    in-stack extensions. After a careful evaluation of these options by comparing
    their pros and cons, it is expected that one should be chosen as the final standard
    scheme for MPLS extension indicator.</p>"
