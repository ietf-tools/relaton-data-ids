abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) provides reliable delivery
    of data across any network path, including network paths containing satellite
    channels. While TCP works over satellite channels there are several IETF standardized
    mechanisms that enable TCP to more effectively utilize the available capacity
    of the network path. This document outlines some of these TCP mitigations. This
    document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
