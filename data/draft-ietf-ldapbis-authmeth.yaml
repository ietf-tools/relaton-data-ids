abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes authentication methods and security mechanisms
    of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This document details establishment
    of Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the StartTLS operation. This document
    details the simple Bind authentication method including anonymous, unauthenticated,
    and name/password mechanisms and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer
    (SASL) Bind authentication method including the EXTERNAL mechanism. This document
    discusses various authentication and authorization states through which a session
    to an LDAP server may pass and the actions that trigger these state changes. This
    document, together with other documents in the LDAP Technical Specification (see
    Section 1 of the specification's road map), obsoletes RFC 2251, RFC 2829, and
    RFC 2830. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
