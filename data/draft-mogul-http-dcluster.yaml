abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP 'Delta encoding,' the transmission of a compact encoding of the
    change between instances of a Web resource instead of retransmitting the entire
    new value, has been shown to be of potential value. Research has shown additional
    benefits if deltas can be computed between instances of different resources. This
    document describes a compatible extension to HTTP delta encoding to support 'clustering',
    where multiple resources (URLs) are treated as a pool, and the use of 'templates',
    where a large set of resource instances are most naturally described as deltas
    from a chosen template resource.</p>"
