abstract:
- content: "<p>In workload-to-service communication, a common pattern is for a workload
    to present a JSON Web Token (JWT) to a remote endpoint in order to obtain a temporary
    credential for the service it ultimately needs to access. It is a partial adaptation
    for workloads of existing flows designed for users. Implementing this pattern
    combines multiple existing standards from different working groups and standards
    bodies. Since this pattern is not described in a specification, it leads to variability
    in interoperability. The purpose of this document is to capture this common workload
    identity practice as an RFC in order to obtain consistency and promote interoperability
    in industry.</p>"
