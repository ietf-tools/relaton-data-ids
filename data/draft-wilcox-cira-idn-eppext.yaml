abstract:
- content: "<p>The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), administering
    the .CA country-code top-level domain, offers internationalized domain names (IDN)
    in French, one of Canada's official languages. CIRA's Extensible Provisioning
    Protocol (EPP) services have been augmented with an IDN EPP extension in order
    to support registrars desiring to register internationalized domains using French
    characters as bundled domains. This document defines the extension to the Extensible
    Provisioning Protocol used at CIRA to support IDN operations.</p>"
