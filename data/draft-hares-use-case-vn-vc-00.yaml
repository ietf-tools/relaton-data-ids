abstract:
- content: "<p>Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and abstract
    the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to the third-party applications
    running in software. The application can utilize a programmable interface to receiving
    these virtual or abstract resources in a form that allows monitoring or manipulation
    of resources. Various programmatic interfaces have been proposed to interface
    directly to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow, ForCES), or do device configuration
    (NETCONF). ALTO has proposed a informational interface to the application. Only
    the progammatic Interface to the Routing System (IRS) provides an interface directly
    to the routing system to utilize all aspects of the routing system as a system.
    The IRS system interacts with the control plane processes to monitor best paths
    to any destination and to change the routing information base (RIB) or MPLS label
    information Base (LIB) which feeds the forwarding tables the information needed
    to actually switch traffic at a local level. This document outlines how SDN networks
    can use the IRS interface to implement an automated set of network services for
    Virtual Connection on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD)</p>"
