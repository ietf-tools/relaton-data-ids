abstract:
- content: <p>This memo introduces "Signaling In-Network Computing operations" (SINC),
    a mechanism to enable signaling in-network computing operations on data packets
    in specific scenarios like NetReduce, NetDistributedLock, NetSequencer, etc. In
    particular, this solution allows to flexibly communicate computational parameters,
    to be used in conjunction with the payload, to in-network SINC-enabled devices
    in order to perform computing operations.</p>
