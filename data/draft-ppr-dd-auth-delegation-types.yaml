abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes modifications to the Domain Name System (DNS)
    protocol to support a range of authoritative resource record types at delegation
    points. Currently, the DNS only allows DS (Delegation Signer) records at a delegation
    point as authoritative data. This draft extends that model by enabling the inclusion
    of a range of RRtypes at delegation points. The proposed modifications preserve
    compatibility with existing DNS resolution behavior while providing a clear framework
    for identifying and processing these records as authoritative data at delegation
    points.</p>"
