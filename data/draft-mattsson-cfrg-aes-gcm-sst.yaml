abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Galois Counter Mode with Secure Short Tags
    (GCM-SST) Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm. GCM-SST
    can be used with any keystream generator, not just a block cipher. The main differences
    compared to GCM [GCM] is that GCM-SST uses an additional subkey Q, that fresh
    subkeys H and Q are derived for each nonce, and that the POLYVAL function from
    AES- GCM-SIV is used instead of GHASH. This enables short tags with forgery probabilities
    close to ideal. This document also registers several instances of Advanced Encryption
    Standard (AES) with Galois Counter Mode with Secure Short Tags (AES-GCM-SST).
    This document is the product of the Crypto Forum Research Group.</p>"
