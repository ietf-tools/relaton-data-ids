abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the representation
    of structured information, supporting Boolean values, numbers, strings, arrays,
    and tables. Recently, a number of applications have started to look for binary
    representation formats that solve a similar problem. In particular, constrained
    node networks can benefit from such a binary representation format. A very successful
    binary representation that is otherwise comparable to JSON is MessagePack. Recently,
    a number of implementations have modified or extended MessagePack such that it
    allows for distinguishing UTF-8 strings from binary data. Further discussion on
    the MessagePack repository has resulted in proposals how to integrate such an
    addition back into the MessagePack community. This draft, as an independent effort,
    documents one such format, tentatively calling it BinaryPack1pre2 while the MessagePack
    extension proposals make their way through the MessagePack community. The current
    version -01 of this document is a snapshot that demonstrates a general direction.
    The details may change in future versions based on the development of the MessagePack
    specification.</p>"
