abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the media and security architecture for Media
    Over QUIC, a protocol suite intended to run in browsers and other non-browser
    endpoints and support unified architecture and protocol for data delivery that
    enables a wide range of media applications with different resiliency and latency
    needs without compromising the scalability and cost effectiveness associated with
    content delivery networks. Note to readers: This document as it stands might not
    reflect accurately all decisions that are in active discussions in the WG, but
    it lays out a foundation for expected architectural requirements. The specification
    will be updated based on the decision made in the WG.</p>"
