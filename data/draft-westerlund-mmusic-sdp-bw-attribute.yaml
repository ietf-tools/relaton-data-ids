abstract:
- content: "<p>Knowledge of what bandwidths the end-points intend to use is important
    both for the other end-point and for resource allocation in various types of networks.
    This is especially important for wireless access networks which typically have
    quite limited resources. The bandwidth attribute in Session Description Protocol
    (SDP), 'b=AS', is today quite widely used to define the bandwidth that the end-points
    intends to use, in various types of sessions. This document will show that the
    existing bandwidth attribute, such as 'b=AS', although widely used in today's
    scenarios, has limitations that make it hard or even impossible for the end-points
    to express their intentions accurately when it comes to bandwidth usage. To solve
    the identified problems, this document defines a new extensible SDP bandwidth
    attribute 'a=bw' which enables more detailed control over the bandwidth declarations,
    request, and allocations. With the new bandwidth attribute it is possible to define
    different scopes in the session setup and then negotiate the bandwidth individually
    for each scope.</p>"
