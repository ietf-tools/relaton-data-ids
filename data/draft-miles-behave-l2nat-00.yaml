abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a "Layer2-Aware" IPv4-to-IPv4 (NAT44) Service
    Provider NAT function that identifies subscriber traffic based on IP- independent
    methods such as a link-layer address, VLAN, PPP session, tunnel, etc. in order
    to allow one to either avoid "double-NAT" (NAT444) of subscriber IP traffic altogether,
    the need for additional "Shared Service-Provider" IPv4 address space, or partitioning
    of RFC 1918 space between subscribers. While the mechanisms described in this
    document may be applicable to a variety of network architectures, the primary
    focus is on residential "fixed-line" Internet access.</p>
