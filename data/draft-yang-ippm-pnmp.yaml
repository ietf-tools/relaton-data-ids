abstract:
- content: "<p>PNMP, precise network measurement protocol, is used for out-of-band
    network measurement. As 5G is continuously evolving, there become many more time
    sensitive services which require high precision of measurements. In addition,
    in order to better simulate the transmission of packets of monitored services,
    the length and priorities of the measurement packets SHOULD be customized, especially
    for some network that is inclined to get congested. PNMP can not only support
    PTP, precise time protocol, but also allow some customization on packet payload.
    It only introduces a little overhead by adding an extendable header over IP header.</p>"
