abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents extensions to Version 1 of the Resource Reservation
    Setup Protocol (RSVP). These extensions ameliorate RSVP support of Large Scale
    Multicast Applications (LSMA) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN). With these types
    of applications, several hosts at any particular site are participating in a session.
    Efficient RSVP use requires aggregation of their addresses into a single entry
    for classification purposes. The extensions allow such aggregation of state in
    a simple manner that requires no changes to the base RSVP specification.</p>"
