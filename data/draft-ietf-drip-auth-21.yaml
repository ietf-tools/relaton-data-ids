abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to add trust into the Broadcast Remote
    ID (RID) specification discussed in the DRIP Architecture; first trust in the
    RID ownership and second in the source of the RID messages. It defines message
    types and associated formats (sent within the Authentication Message) that can
    be used to authenticate past messages sent by an unmanned aircraft (UA) and provide
    proof of UA trustworthiness even in the absence of Internet connectivity at the
    receiving node.</p>"
