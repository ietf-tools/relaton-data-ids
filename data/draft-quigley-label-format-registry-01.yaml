abstract:
- content: "<p>In the past Mandatory Access Control(MAC) systems have used very rigid
    policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and platform. As MAC
    systems are more widely deployed additional flexibility in mechanism and policy
    is required. Where traditional trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security
    and integrity models, modern systems have expanded to include technologies such
    as type enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms it has proven
    through past efforts to be virtually impossible to accomodate all parties in one
    security label format and model. To accomodate multiple MAC mechanisms and label
    formats this document proposes a registry of label format specifications. This
    registry contains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and string preferences
    and associates those identifiers with an extensive document outlining the exact
    syntax and use of the particular label format.</p>"
