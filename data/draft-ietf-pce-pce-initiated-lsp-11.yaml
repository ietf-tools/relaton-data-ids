abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests. The extensions for stateful
    PCE provide active control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control
    over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE. This document describes the
    creation and deletion of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.</p>"
