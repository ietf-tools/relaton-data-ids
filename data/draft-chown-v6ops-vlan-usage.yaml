abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet VLANs are quite commonly used in enterprise networks for the
    purposes of traffic segregation. This document describes how such VLANs can be
    readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise, including the scenario
    of early deployment prior to availability of IPv6-capable switch-router equipment,
    where IPv6 may be routed in parallel with the existing IPv4 in the enterprise
    and delivered at Layer 2 via VLAN technology. The IPv6 connectivity to the enterprise
    may or may not enter the site via the same physical link.</p>"
