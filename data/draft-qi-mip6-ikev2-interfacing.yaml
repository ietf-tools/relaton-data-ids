abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the issues associated with interfacing between
    IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6. When mobile nodes bootstrap in foreign network or handover
    to a new network, IKEv2/IPsec can not probe the changing of care-of-address, which
    is related security associations. One simple extension to the SADB_ACQUIRE in
    PF_KEY framework is proposed to support this interfacing. And the operation modification
    of IKEv2 and MIPv6 are described in this proposal based on the SADB_ACQUIRE extension.
    A new mobility security reference database is created to store the temporary mobility
    parameters.</p>"
