abstract:
- content: "<p>A direct interpretation of the Internet of Things concept refers to
    the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing or thing-to-thing
    communication. Although the security needs are well-recognized, it is still not
    fully clear how existing IP-based security protocols can be applied to this new
    setting. This Internet-Draft first provides an overview of security architecture,
    its deployment model and general security needs in the context of the lifecycle
    of a thing. Then, it presents challenges and requirements for the successful roll-out
    of new applications and usage of standard IP-based security protocols when applied
    to get a functional Internet of Things.</p>"
