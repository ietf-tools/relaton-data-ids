abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    a mechanisms for the Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCE can be used for
    computing paths in the SR networks. Stateful PCE provide active control of MPLS-TE
    LSPs via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally
    configured LSPs to the PCE. Further, stateful PCE could also create and remove
    PCE-initiated LSPs by itself. A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by integrating with elements of
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN). In some use cases, such as PCECC or Binding
    Segment Identifier (SID) for Segment Routing (SR), there are requirements for
    a stateful PCE to make allocation of labels, SIDs, etc. These use cases require
    PCE aware of various identifier spaces from where to make allocations on behalf
    of a PCC. This document describes a mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of the
    identifier space set aside for the PCE control via PCEP. The identifier could
    be an MPLS label, a SID or any other to-be-defined identifier that can be allocated
    by a PCE.</p>"
