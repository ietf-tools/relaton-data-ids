abstract:
- content: "<p>VoIP over MPLS typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS.
    For an MPLS VPN, the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload
    is typically no more than 30 bytes. VoIP over MPLS header compression can significantly
    reduce the VoIP overhead through various compression mechanisms. This is important
    on access links where bandwidth is scarce, and can be important on backbone facilities,
    especially where costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections). In this draft
    we propose to use RSVP extensions to signal the header compression context and
    other control messages between the ingress and egress LSR. We provide two approaches
    to determining the header compression context: a) re-use the methods in cRTP to
    determine the context, and b) re-use the methods in Swallow's and Berger's 'simple'
    approach to determine the context.</p>"
