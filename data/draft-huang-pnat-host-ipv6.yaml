abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy to
    mandate the application in the host to change in the first place, the network
    layer may have to have a solution to support conventional IPv4 appliations in
    the IPv6 only network, especially when there are multiple applications need to
    be supported. This document describes a mechanism for providing a host-based IPv6
    translation technology which could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility.
    A new well known IPv6 prefix is used for the destination address translation and
    network assigned prefix will be used for source address translation.</p>"
