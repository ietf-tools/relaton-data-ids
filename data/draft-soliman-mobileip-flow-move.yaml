abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this draft is to introduce a new extension to MIPv6 to allow
    hosts to direct inbound flows individually to certain preferred interfaces. This
    extension to MIPv6 allows multi-homed hosts to take full advantage of the diverse
    access technologies that they may be connected to and direct their traffic according
    to internal policies specified by the users or applications.</p>"
