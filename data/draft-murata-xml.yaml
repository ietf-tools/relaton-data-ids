abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes five new media types -- text/xml, application/xml,
    text/xml-external-parsed-entity, application/xml- external-parsed-entity, and
    application/xml-dtd -- for use in exchanging network entities that are related
    to the Extensible Markup Language (XML). This document also standardizes a convention
    (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types when
    those media types represent XML MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) entities.
