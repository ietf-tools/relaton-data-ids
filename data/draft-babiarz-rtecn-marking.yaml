abstract:
- content: "<p>At the 62nd IETF meeting, it was requested that the authors of Congestion
    Notification Process for Real-Time Traffic (RT-ECN) draft look at rate proportional
    marking as an method of indicating that traffic has exceeded a configured rate.
    In version 03 of RT-ECN draft (draft-babiarz-tsvwg-rtecn-03) we stated, when the
    rate exceeds the engineered traffic level, all packets as indicated by a DS codepoint
    from ECN-capable end-systems are marked to indicate congestion for the duration
    of the experienced congestion. In this memo, we looked at the two approaches,
    provide analysis as well our conclusions.</p>"
