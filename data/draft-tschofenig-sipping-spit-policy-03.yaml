abstract:
- content: "<p>SPAM, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk, might
    be a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks. The responsibility for filtering
    or blocking calls can belong to different elements in the call flow and may depend
    on various factors. This document defines an authorization based policy language
    that allows end users to upload anti-SPIT policies to intermediaries, such as
    SIP proxies. These policies mitigate unwanted SIP communications. It extends the
    Common Policy authorization framework with additional conditions and actions.
    The new conditions match a particular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) communication
    pattern based on a number of attributes. The range of attributes includes information
    provided, for example, by SIP itself, by the SIP identity mechanism, by information
    carried within SAML assertions.</p>"
