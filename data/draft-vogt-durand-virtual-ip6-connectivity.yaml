abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the impetus to invest in interworking between IP versions
    4 and 6 is initially on the side of early IPv6 adopters, more substantial IPv6
    deployment in the future will shift this impetus towards the side of the legacy
    IPv4 Internet. However, interworking techniques for IPv4-only networks are as
    yet largely unexplored. This document proposes Virtual IPv6 Connectivity, a technique
    for IPv4-only networks to communicate with the IPv6 Internet.</p>"
