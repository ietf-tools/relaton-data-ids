abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes the context and goals for a Common Name Resolution
    Protocol. It defines the terminology used concerning a 'Common Name' and how one
    might be 'resolved', and establishes the distinction between 'resolution' and
    more elaborate search mechanisms. It establishes some expected contexts for use
    of Common Name Resolution, and the criteria for evaluating a successful protocol.
    It also analyzes the various motivations that would cause services to provide
    Common Name resolution for both public, private and commercial use.</p>"
