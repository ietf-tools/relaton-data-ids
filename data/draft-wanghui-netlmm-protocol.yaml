abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a network-based localized mobility management
    (NETLMM) protocol which enables mobile nodes remaining reachable while moving
    across different access routers in a certain access network zone called Edge Mobility
    Domain (EMD). This protocol requires no extra host stack support and no complex
    security and signaling interactions between mobile node and the access network.
    Especially, by utilizing the neighbor Access Router (AR) information, NETLMM can
    achieve very fast and smooth handover performance to fit the requirements of most
    real-time and interactive multimedia applications.</p>"
