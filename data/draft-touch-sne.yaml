abstract:
- content: "<p>Sliding window protocols use finite sequence numbers to determine segment
    placement and order. These sequence number spaces wrap around and are reused during
    the operation of such protocols. This document describes a way to extend the size
    of these sequence numbers at the endpoints to avoid the impact of that wrap and
    reuse without transmitting additional information in the packet header. The resulting
    extended sequence numbers can be used at the endpoints in encryption and authentication
    algorithms to ensure input bit patterns do not repeat over the lifetime of a connection.</p>"
