- content: "<p>Mobile IP is required for hosts moving within the Internet topology.
    Mobile IP manages IP mobility resulting from the change in Care-of-Address when
    a host moves within the Internet topology. When a Mobile Node moves from one point
    of attachment to another, a mobility binding update to the respective home agent
    and/or correspondent node(s) occurs.</p>"
