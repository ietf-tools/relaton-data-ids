abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
    the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic
    algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is
    at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in
    such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite public
    keys and composite signature data. This draft defines a structure generic enough
    to be useful beyond the post-quantum transition for any situation where a widely-supported
    but untrusted algorithm is being migrated to newer cryptography. This document
    defines structures for binding an explicit pair of cryptographic algorithms together
    into a single object identifier, and it provides ASN.1 structures for encoding
    these pairwise composite public keys, private keys in wire protocols, as well
    as using them in conjunction with composite signatures, encryption and key transport
    mechanisms.</p>"
