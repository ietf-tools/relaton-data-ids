abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an information model for networking policy conditions
    as part of the general information model for representing networking policy defined
    in draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt. The information model described in this
    document is focussed on the structural class networkingPolicyCondition that extends
    the class policyCondition described draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt. Five
    auxiliary classes are defined to describe conditions that refer to (1) the communicating
    hosts, (2) the communicating users (3) application data (4) routing information
    at the device enforcing the policy and (5) layer 2 or data link layer information
    of the device. This document is based on the QoS and IPSec schema first described
    in [3] and [4].</p>"
