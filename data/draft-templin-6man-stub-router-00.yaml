abstract:
- content: <p>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] specifies the operation
    of routers, including the process of sending and receiving Router Advertisement
    (RA) messages. However, the specification makes no distinction between different
    classes of routers that may occur on a link. In particular, the specification
    is written from the perspective of routers that are "authoritative for the link",
    i.e., routers that connect the link to provider networks. This document discusses
    considerations for a different class of routers known as "stub routers". Status
