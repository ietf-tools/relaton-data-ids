abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a modification to the Real-time Transport Control
    Protocol to enable the operation of RTP/RTCP with unicast RTCP feedback in Single
    Source multicast sessions such as Source Specific Multicast (SSM) Communication
    where the traditional model of Any Source Multicast (ASM) group communication
    of many to many is not possible and for any group communication which might benefit
    from a sender controlled summarised reporting mechanism. This specification extends
    [1], section 6 which defines the RTP session group control channel.</p>"
