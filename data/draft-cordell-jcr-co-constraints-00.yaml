abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Content Rules (JCR) [JCR] provides a powerful, intuitive and concise
    method for defining the structure of JSON [RFC7159] messages. However, modern
    JSON usage patterns occasionally mean that JCR alone is not able to capture the
    required constraints in a satisfactory way. This document describes JCR Co-Constraints
    (JCRCC) which defines additional JCR directives and annotations that can be added
    to a JCR ruleset in order to define more detailed constraints on JSON messages.</p>"
