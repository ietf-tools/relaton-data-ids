abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents DOTS signal channel Call Home service, which
    enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS client, and to
    receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS client. The DOTS server in
    turn uses the attack traffic information to identify the compromised devices launching
    the outgoing DDoS attack and takes appropriate mitigation action. The Call Home
    service is not specific to the home networks; the solution targets any deployment
    which requires to block DDoS attack traffic closer to the source(s) of a DDoS
    attack.</p>"
