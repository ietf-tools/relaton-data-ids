abstract:
- content: <p>With RPL - the "IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy Networks"
    - published as a Proposed Standard after a ~2-year development cycle, this document
    presents an observation of the resulting protocol, of its applicability, and of
    its limits. The documents presents a selection of observations on the protocol
    characteristics, exposes experiences acquired when producing various prototype
    implementations of RPL, and presents results obtained from testing this protocol
    - by way of network simulations, in network testbeds and in deployments. The document
    aims at providing a better understanding of possible limits of RPL, notably the
    possible directions that further protocol developments should explore, in order
    to address these.</p>
