abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the TN3287 protocol is to provide a general, bi-directional
    printer communications facility. It's primary goal is to allow a standard method
    of interfacing printer devices and printer-oriented processes to each other. This
    protocol will allow a TN3270 Client to process 3287 print data streams. This RFC
    supplements and extends the RFC 854, TELNET Protocol Specification. This RFC also
    presents an example of the correct implementation.</p>"
