abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to extend the RMON framework [RFC2819] to monitor end
    devices such as IP phones, pagers, Instant Message Clients, mobile phones, and
    PDA devices. This memo proposes an extension of RMON Framework to allow Real-time
    Application QoS information of these types of end devices to be retrieved with
    SNMP, independent of the technology used to perform the measurements. An end-to-end
    user experience of the quality of service (QoS) and performance for such an application
    is a combination of device performance, transport network performance and specific
    application context. The memo also defines a common framework to identify a set
    of application QoS parameters and a reporting mechanism using a common protocol
    data unit (PDU) format used between RAQMON Data Source (RDS) and RAQMON Report
    Collector (RRC) to report QOS statistics using RTCP and SNMP as underlying transport
    protocol. The original RAQMON draft &lt;draft-siddiqui-rmonmib-raqmon-mib-01.txt&gt;
    is split into 3 parts namely RAQMON Framework, RAQMON QOS PDU and RAQMON MIB.
    This memo only defines the RAQMON Framework along with companion drafts &lt;draft-siddiqui-rmonmib-raqmon-mib-02.txt&gt;
    that defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) and &lt;draft-siddiqui-rmonmib-raqmon-pdu-00.txt&gt;
    that defines RAQMON PDUs. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p>"
