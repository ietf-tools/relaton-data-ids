abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new response code, 4XX(Blocked), for the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP). This response code can be used by User Agent Client
    (UAC) that intentionally does not want to have session with an incoming request
    from another user with particular SIP services. For example UAC does not want
    to establish a session with an incoming request for video conference from particular
    domain. The existing mechanisms in SIP do not provide any such facility to refuse
    a request based request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), SIP application, media
    type or other SIP services.</p>"
