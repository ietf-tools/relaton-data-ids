abstract:
- content: <p>Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes. A block
    of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly called "reserved
    labels". They will be called "special purpose labels" in this document. As there
    are only 16 of these labels, caution is needed in the allocation of new special
    purpose labels, yet at the same time allow forward progress when one is called
    for. This memo defines some procedures to follow in the allocation and retirement
    of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special purpose label
    space. Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for these labels to "Special
    Purpose MPLS Label Values", and creates a new one called the "Extended Special
    Purpose MPLS Label Values" registry.</p>
