abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the use of DNS NOTIFY ([RFC1996] beyond conventional
    zone transfer hints, bringing the benefits of ad-hoc notifications to DNS delegation
    maintenance in general. Use cases include DNSSEC key rollovers hints, and quicker
    changes to a delegation's NS record set. To enable this functionality, a method
    for discovering the receiver endpoint for such notification message is introduced,
    via the new NOTIFY record type. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify
    (https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized- notify). The
    most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available
    there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>"
