abstract:
- content: "<p>Techniques that improve user privacy by hiding original client IP addresses,
    such as VPNs and proxies, have faced challenges with server that rely on IP addresses
    to determine client location. Maintaining a geographically relevant user experience
    requires large pools of IP addresses, which can be costly. Additionally, users
    often receive inaccurate geolocation results because servers rely on geo-IP feeds
    that can be outdated. To address these challenges, we can allow clients to actively
    send their network geolocation directly to the origin server via an HTTP Client
    Hint. This approach will not only enhance geolocation accuracy and reduce IP costs,
    but it also gives clients more transparency regarding their perceived geolocation.</p>"
