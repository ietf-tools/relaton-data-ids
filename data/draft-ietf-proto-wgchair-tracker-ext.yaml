abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the changes required to make it possible for
    working group chairs to update the I-D tracker during document shepherding, after
    the request for publication. It also describes additional requirements for the
    chairs to use the I-D tracker for managing WG documents from their earliest stages.
    Having the tracker support the working groups more fully is a primary benefit,
    but in addition, this moves towards the goal of providing an integrated view of
    document states from -00 to RFC publication.</p>"
