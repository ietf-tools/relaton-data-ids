abstract:
- content: "<p>This document tries to address an approach for reorganization of entire
    network in a large address space. It describes how entire address space can be
    distributed within some regions and sub regions inside each of them by establishing
    mesh structured hierarchy. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this
    architecture in the context of IPv6. This document also tries to come out with
    an approach how IP switch based network can perform as good as ATM network for
    the processing of real time traffic.</p>"
