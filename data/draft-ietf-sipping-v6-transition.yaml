abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the IPv4 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    user agents can communicate with IPv6 SIP user agents (and vice versa) at the
    signaling layer as well as exchange media once the session has been successfully
    set up. Both single- and dual-stack (i.e., IPv4-only and IPv4/IPv6) user agents
    are considered. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
