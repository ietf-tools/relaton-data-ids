abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses the motivation and requirements for including
    specific operational and telemetry information into data packets while the data
    packet traverses a path between two points in the network. This method is referred
    to as "in-situ" Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), given that
    the OAM information is carried with the data packets as opposed to in "out-of-band"
    packets dedicated to OAM. In situ OAM complements other OAM mechanisms which use
    dedicated probe packets to convey OAM information.</p>
