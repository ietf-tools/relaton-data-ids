abstract:
- content: "<p>Current 6bone backbone routing guidelines prohibit traditional multihoming
    in IPv6, because current IPv4-style multihoming doesn't scale. This stands in
    the way of successful adoption of IPv6. The solution outlined in this memo proposes
    aggregating the routing information for multihomed destinations inside service
    provider networks based on geography to accomplish scalable multihoming in IPv6
    using current protocols and implementations. This solution does not require network
    operators to increase the density of interconnection; nor does it require significant
    cooperation or simultaneous adoption.</p>"
