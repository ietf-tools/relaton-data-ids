abstract:
- content: "<p>Considering that 6LoWPAN packets can be as large as 2K bytes and that
    an 802.15.4 frame with security will carry in the order of 80 bytes of effective
    payload, a packet might end up fragmented into as many as 25 fragments at the
    6LoWPAN shim layer. If a single one of those fragments is lost in transmission,
    all fragments must be resent, further contributing to the congestion that might
    have caused the initial packet loss. This draft introduces a simple protocol to
    recover individual fragments between 6LoWPAN endpoints.</p>"
