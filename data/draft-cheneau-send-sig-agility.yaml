abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a mechanism to enable the Secure Neighbor Discovery
    (SEND) protocol to select between different signature algorithms to use with Cryptographically
    Generated Addresses (CGA). It also provides optional support for interoperability
    between nodes that do not share any common signature algorithms.</p>"
