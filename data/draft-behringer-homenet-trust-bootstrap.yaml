abstract:
- content: "<p>A homenet must be aware of its borders, and the realms within those.
    This document proposes an approach to bootstrap trust in such an environment.
    The idea is to select one device as the trust anchor and to enrol other devices
    into the domain. The result is the creation of a domain of trust in the homenet,
    with a common trust anchor. This trust model can subsequently be used to determine
    boundaries, and to autonomically bootstrap network services.</p>"
