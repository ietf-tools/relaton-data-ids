abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper Discusses several points Lacking in the presentation of
    the IEPS Specification, and Condemns others as unwarranted mandates, which defines
    the Internet and its use as a Vehicle for WAR. The Alternative, 'GWEBS', develops
    is a more realistic foundation that supports saving lives (Addressing the Concerns
    of all People in General, Regardless) during the Occurrence of some Catastrophic
    Event, which is the mandate it mintains regarding the Implementation of a Uniform
    Universal Protocol that is the foundation for the 'Global Wide Emergency Broadcast
    System' that is used to Protect the lives and Livelihoods of all the Inhabitants
    of Our Planet. Furthermore, this paper also addresses a more fundamental concern
    that requires the involvement of the UN (United Nations), which would mandate
    the Implementation of a World Wide Global Internet Backbone for every Country.
    The Development of such World Wide Global Infrastructure (A Global System to be
    sure) would guarantee uniform Access for All People, and would establish the necessary
    Foundation, infrastructure, as would be required for any Global Wide Emergency
    Broadcast System (GWEBS) to work. In other words, this paper supports the belief
    that Information, and the exchange or the sharing related thereto, is just as
    important as the Sustenance Consumed, which indeed, is the Vital Necessity used
    to sustain Life itself.</p>"
