abstract:
- content: "<p>The Interface to the routing system (I2RS) specifies a new interface
    that a client (I2RS client) can utilize to interface to the routing system. Some
    applications that utilize the services of I2RS client may require a specific set
    of data in response to network events or conditions based on pre-established rules.
    In order to reduce the data flow through the network, the I2RS client needs to
    signal the I2RS agent to filter some of the collected data or events prior to
    transmission to the i2rs client. This functionality is necessary to meet the requirements
    I2RS enabled services which include service- layer routing improvements, and control
    of traffic flows and exit points. This document introduces a read-only I2RS RIB
    policy Informational Model that provides filters for the reads and notifications
    from the I2RS RIB Info Model (IM). This model utilizes a generic information model
    (IM) for policy templates that is extensible and hierarchical. These templates
    support the features described by the I2RS architectural model.</p>"
