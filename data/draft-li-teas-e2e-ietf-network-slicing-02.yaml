abstract:
- content: "<p>Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance
    requirement of different services or customers in a shared network. An IETF network
    slice may be used for 5G or other network scenarios. In the context of 5G, the
    5G end-to-end network slices consist of three major types of network technology
    domains: Radio Access Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN) and Core Network (CN).
    The transport network slice can be realized as IETF network slices. In the transport
    network, the IETF network slice may span multiple network administrative domains.
    In order to facilitate the mapping between network slices in different network
    technology domains and administrative domains, it is beneficial to carry the identifiers
    related to the 5G end-to-end network slice, the multi-domain IETF network slice
    together with the intra-domain network slice related identifier in the data packet.
    This document describes the framework of end-to-end IETF network slicing, and
    introduces the identifiers related to 5G end-to-end network slice and the multi-domain
    IETF network slice. These identifiers can be carried in the data packet. The roles
    of the different identifiers in packet forwarding is also described. The network
    slice identifiers may be instantiated with different data planes.</p>"
