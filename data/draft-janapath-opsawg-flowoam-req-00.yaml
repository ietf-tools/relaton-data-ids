abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Operations and Management (OAM) requirements
    that improve on the traditional OAM tools like Ping and Traceroute. These requirements
    have arisen from the fact that more details than given by Ping and Traceroute
    are required while troubleshooting or doing performance and network planning.
    These requirements have been gathered from network operators especially from data
    centers where the networks have slightly different characteristics compared to
    regular campus/carrier networks.</p>"
