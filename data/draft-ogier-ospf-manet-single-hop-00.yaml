abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.
    This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single- hop broadcast network,
    which is a special case of a MANET in which each router is a (one-hop) neighbor
    of each other router. Unlike an OSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can
    have a different cost associated with each neighbor. The document includes configuration
    recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single- hop networks.</p>"
