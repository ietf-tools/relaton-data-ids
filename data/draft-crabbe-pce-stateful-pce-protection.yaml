abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful PCE [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] can apply global concurrent
    optimizations to optimize LSP placement. In a deployment where a PCE is used to
    compute all the paths, it may be beneficial for the protection paths to also be
    computed by the PCE. This document defines extensions needed for the setup and
    management of MPLS-TE protection paths by the PCE.</p>"
