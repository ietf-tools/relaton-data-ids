abstract:
- content: <p>In Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs), customer multicast flows
    are carried in "tunnels" through a service provider's network. The base specifications
    for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN "auto-discovery routes" and specify how to use
    an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual customer multicast
    flow is being carried in a particular tunnel. However, those specifications do
    not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple customer flows
    are being carried in a single tunnel. Those specifications also do not provide
    a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default to carry
    all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by all the
    provider edge routers of the MVPN. This document eliminates these restrictions
    by specifying the use of "wildcard" elements in the customer flow identifiers.
    With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer
    flows or even to all customer flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
