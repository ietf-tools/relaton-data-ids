abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed multimedia applications require performance guarantees
    from the underlying network subsystem. Ethernet has been the dominant local area
    network architecture in the last decade, and we believe that it will remain popular
    because of its cost-effectiveness and the availability of higher-bandwidth Ethernets.
    We present the design of a software-based timed-token protocol called RETHER that
    provides real-time performance guarantees to multimedia applications without requiring
    any modifications to existing Ethernet hardware. RETHER features a hybrid mode
    of operation to reduce the performance impact on non-real-time network traffic,
    a race-condition-free distributed admission control mechanism, and an efficient
    token-passing scheme that protects the network against token loss due to node
    failures or otherwise. Performance measurements from a prototype running on 10-Mbps
    Ethernet and 100-Mbps Fast-Ethernet indicate that up to 60 of the raw bandwidth
    can be reserved without deteriorating the performance of non-real-time traffic
    significantly. This scheme is consistent with the ISSLL over LANs framework described
    in [7].</p>"
