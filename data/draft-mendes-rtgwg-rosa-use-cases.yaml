abstract:
- content: "<p>The proliferation of virtualization, microservices, and serverless
    architectures has made the deployment of services possible in more than one network
    location, alongside long practised replication within single network locations,
    such as within a CDN datacentre. This necessitates the potential need to coordinate
    the steering of (client-initiated) traffic towards different services and their
    deployed instances across the network. The term 'service-based routing' (SBR)
    captures the set of mechanisms for said traffic steering, positioned as an anycast
    problem, in that it requires the selection of one of the possibly many choices
    for service execution at the very start of a service transaction, followed by
    the transfer of packets to that chosen service endpoint. This document provides
    typical scenarios for service-based routing, particularly for which a more dynamic
    and efficient (in terms of both latency and signalling overhead) selection of
    suitable service execution endpoints would not exhibit the overheads and thus
    latency penalties experienced with existing explicit discovery methods. Related
    drafts introduce the design for an in-band service discovery method instead, named
    Routing on Service Addresses (ROSA), based on the insights from the use case and
    problem discussion in this draft.</p>"
