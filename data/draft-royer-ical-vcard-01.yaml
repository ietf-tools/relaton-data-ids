abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a registration of a [iCAL] component called 'VCARD'. And
    defines that the 'VCARD' component as the 'vcard entity' object as defined in
    [vCARD] and [LDAPVCARD]. This memo describes a way to include contact information
    in [iCAL] objects. The contact information is included by the insertion of [vCARD]
    objects into [iCAL] objects. Also included is an extension to [LDAPVCARD] to allow
    [CAP] URLs. This memo does not define [iCAL] or [vCARD] objects.</p>"
