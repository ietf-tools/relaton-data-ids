abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC4364 and RFC4659 define respectively BGP extensions to provide VPN-IPv4
    and VPN-IPv6 services. When defined RFC5549 has brought up an inconsistency in
    how the next hop is encoded when a VPN-IPv4 NLRI carries an IPv6 next hop compared
    to RFC4364 and RFC4659. For some reasons, existing and deployed implementations
    of RFC5549 haven't followed the specification and are using an VPN-IPv6 next hop
    as in RFC4364 and RFC4659. Moving these implementations to be compliant with RFC5549
    may break existing network deployments. This document proposes a modification
    of RFC5549 to enable compliancy of these implementations. These document also
    proposes additional modifications of RFC5549 to address missing points.</p>"
