abstract:
- content: <p>This memo defines two extensions to the SMTP service. The first extension
    enables a SMTP client and server to negotiate the use of an alternative to the
    DATA command, called "BDAT", for efficiently sending large MIME messages. The
    second extension takes advantage of the BDAT command to permit the negotiated
    sending of MIME messages that employ the binary transfer encoding. This document
    is intended to obsolete RFC 3030.</p>
