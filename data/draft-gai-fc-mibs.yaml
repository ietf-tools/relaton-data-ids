abstract:
- content: "<p>Fibre Channel (FC) is a high speed serial interface technology that
    supports several Upper Layer Protocols including Small Computer System Interface
    (SCSI) and IP. Fibre Channel is standardized by the INCITS T11 Technical Committee.
    Fibre Channel Standards include Framing and Signaling protocols [FC-FS], Generic
    Services protocols [FC-GS-3], Switch Fabric protocols [FC-SW-2], etc. The management
    of a Fibre Channel network requires to monitor and set many parameters related
    to these protocols and this may be accomplished defining a proper set of MIBs.</p>"
