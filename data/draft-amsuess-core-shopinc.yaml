abstract:
- content: "<p>Applications built on CoAP face a conflict between the technical need
    for short message sizes and the interoperability requirement of following BCP190
    and thus registering (relatively verbose) well-known URI paths. This document
    introduces an option that allows expressing well-known paths in as little as two
    bytes.</p>"
