abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a protocol for configuring Network Address Translators
    (NATs) and firewalls dynamically to create address bindings and open pinholes.
    NATs and firewalls are a problem for applications using voice and video streaming,
    such as IP telephony, because they need to establish voice or video channels dynamically.
    The Simple NAT and Firewall Control (SNFC) protocol allows clients to send requests
    for this purpose to serving NATs and/or firewalls. The protocol is designed to
    provide a very simple and basic solution that can easily be implemented and used.</p>"
