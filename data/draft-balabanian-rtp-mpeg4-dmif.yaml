abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft technical proposal describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4 payloads
    interacts with the MPEG-4 Sync layer through the MPEG (Delivery Multimedia Integration
    Framework) DMIF. Single or multiple MPEG-4 streams can be carried over one RTP
    session. MPEG-4 information essential for the efficient packing and unpacking
    of MPEG-4 streams into/from RTP is identified. The DMIF end-to-end signaling protocol
    is applied to identify the MPEG-4 RTP payload types and ensure stack compatibility
    at both sender and receiver locations. DMIF also interprets the RTCP reports by
    comparing its statistics to the requested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If the statistics
    fail to meet the requested QoS then action is taken to either continue with the
    impaired performance, upgrade the network service class, scale down the stream
    or delete the stream. This action is apart from scalability using the stream back-channel
    flow control which may be present between an encoder and its decoder. This is
    an update of the draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mpeg4-dmif-00. It reflects the latest MPEG-4
    specs. In addition some clarifications are included and an open issues section
    is established based on feedback received.</p>"
