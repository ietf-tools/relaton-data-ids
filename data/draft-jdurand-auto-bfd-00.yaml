abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution called AUTO-BFD, that automatically
    initiates BFD sessions for BGP next-hops. This makes it possible to avoid blackholing
    scenarios when a BGP peer is not the BGP next-hop, especially on Internet eXchange
    Points (IXPs) when BGP Route-Servers are deployed. When they are configured with
    this mechanism, routers can automatically try to establish a new adjacency for
    every new BGP next-hop. BGP routes are then checked against the state of the BFD
    session for the corresponding next-hop. Foreword A placeholder to list general
    observations about this document.</p>"
