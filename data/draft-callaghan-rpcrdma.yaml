abstract:
- content: "<p>A protocol is described providing RDMA as a new transport for ONC RPC.
    The RDMA transport binding conveys the benefits of efficient, bulk data transport
    over high speed networks, while providing for minimal change to RPC applications
    and with no required revision of the application RPC protocol, or the RPC protocol
    itself.</p>"
