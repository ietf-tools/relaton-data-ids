abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router Advertisement
    messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-Lite AFTR addresses to IPv6 hosts
    (i.e., a default IPv6 route for DS-Lite traffic). The provisioning of the AFTR
    address is crucial to access IPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context.
    Means to ensure reliable delivery of this information to connecting hosts is a
    must. Furthermore, this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS- Lite
    serviced customers among a set of deployed AFTRs without requiring a central knowledge
    of the underlying topology and deployed AFTRs.</p>"
