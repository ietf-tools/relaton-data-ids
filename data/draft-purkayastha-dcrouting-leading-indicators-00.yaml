abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a few use cases to illustrate the expectations
    on today's network. Based on those expectations, it describes how the network
    architecture and network requirements are changing. The new requirements are impacting
    data center architecture. The way data centers are evolving, such as central data
    centers to smaller data centers, a single deployment to multiple deployments,
    is described. With this new data center model, areas such as routing inside the
    data center and outside the data center is impacted. The document describes this
    impact and summarizes few features for these new data center model.</p>"
