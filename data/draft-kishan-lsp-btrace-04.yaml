abstract:
- content: "<p>Label switched path (LSP) backtrace is a method to backtrack the paths
    followed by packets in a particular multi protocol label switching (MPLS) forwarding
    equivalence class (FEC). This document describes encoding and procedures for new
    label distribution protocol (LDP) messages, backtrace message and backtrace reply
    message used for performing LSP backtrace. Backtrace message is sent upstream
    for an established LSP. Backtrace message can be used for LDP LSPs as well as
    for constraint based label switched paths (CR-LSPs). Data requested through backtrace
    message is encoded into backtrace reply message. Backtrace reply message is sent
    in downstream direction. It always travels towards the tail end of an LSP. Backtrace
    mechanism described in this document can also be used for obtaining additional
    attributes of LSPs.</p>"
