abstract:
- content: "<p>Unrelated(out-of-bailiwick) name server names are required for DNS
    hosting services. However, using unrelated name server names increases the name
    resolution costs. This document proposes using in-domain name servers as much
    as possible for name resolution of unrelated name server names to reduce the name
    resolution costs.</p>"
