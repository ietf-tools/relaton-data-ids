abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol almost exclusively
    used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains.
    Due to this central nature, it is important to understand the security and reliability
    measures that can and should be deployed to prevent accidental or intentional
    routing disturbances. Previously, security considerations for BGP have been described
    in [RFC7454]. Since the publications of [RFC7454], several developments and changes
    in operational practice took place that warrant an update of these best current
    practices. This document updates [RFC7454], reiterating the best practices for
    BGP security from that document and adding new practices and recommendations that
    emerged since the publication of [RFC7454]. In the current version, this document
    covers practices to protect the BGP sessions itself such as Time to Live (TTL),
    the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), and control-plane filtering. It also describes
    measures to better control the flow of routing information, using prefix filtering
    and automation of prefix filters, max-prefix filtering, Autonomous System(AS)
    path filtering, route flap dampening, and BGP community scrubbing. Newly added
    information and improvements include a unification of terminology, orienting it
    in [RFC9234], changing recommendations regarding IXP LAN prefixes to align with
    operational practice, discussing ASPA and BGP roles, expanding on community scrubbing,
    filter generation and evaluation practices to limit performance overhead, expanding
    on outbound and internal filtering for defense in depth, global prefix limits,
    and community based filtering for downstream prefixes.</p>"
