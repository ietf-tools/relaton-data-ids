abstract:
- content: "<p>General electronic mail (email) provides a facility for exchanging
    messages of seemingly arbitrary content. In common email usage, text is the primary
    media with one or more attachments. A class of special-purpose computers has evolved
    to provide voice- messaging services. These machines generally interface to a
    telephone switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services. Message
    exchange between these voice-mail only systems can best be achieved using VPIM
    Version 2.</p>"
