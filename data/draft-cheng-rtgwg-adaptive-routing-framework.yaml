abstract:
- content: "<p>In many cases, ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) flow-based hashing leads
    to high congestion and variable flow completion time. This reduces applications
    performance. Load balancing based on local link quality is not always optimal,
    A global view of congestion, with information from remote links, is needed for
    optimal balancing. Adaptive routing is a technology that makes dynamic routing
    decision based on changes in traffic load and network topology. This document
    describes a framework for Adaptive Routing. Specifically, it identifies a set
    of adaptive routing components, explains their interactions, and exemplifies the
    workflow mechanism.</p>"
