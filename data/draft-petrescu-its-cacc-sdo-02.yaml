abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise
    Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development Organizations
    such as ETSI, IEEE P1609, SAE, 3GPP, ISO and FirstNet. C-ACC and Platooning involve
    concepts of direct vehicle-to-vehicle, and device-to-device communications, which
    are developped at least by 3GPP and precursory by the METIS EU project. They are
    illustrated very clearly in emergency settings such as FirstNet. IP messages -
    instead of link-layer messages - are pertinent for C-ACC and Platooning use-cases
    because applications for road safety such as WAZE, iRezQ and Coyote (currently
    involving infrastructure) are IP messages, and proved succesful in deployments.
    Applications such as Sentinel are direct between vehicles but are not IP, currently.</p>"
