abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the
    OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway
    protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI. This allows a single routing
    protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and
    multi-protocol environments. This specification was developed by the IS-IS working
    group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. The final international standard
    version of the OSI IS-IS protocol is contained in ISO 10589 [1]. Comments should
    be sent to 'isis@merit.edu'.</p>"
