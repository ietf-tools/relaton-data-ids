abstract:
- content: "<p>There are some problems with current RT-Constrain mechanism defined
    in RFC 4684. Firstly, the IPv6 address specific Route Target defined in [RFC5701]
    cannot be accommodated in current RT membership NLRI. Secondly, the distribution
    of RT-Constrain information cannot build correct VPN distribution graph when hierarchical
    route reflection (RR) is used. Thirdly, current RT-Constrain mechanism is used
    for filtering of all kinds of VPN services and can result in imprecise VPN route
    distribution when multiple VPN services are deployed in the network. This document
    describes the above problems in detail and proposes solutions for these problems.
    A generalized RT-Constrain mechanism is defined to accommodate the IPv6 address
    specific Route Target and to precisely control propagation of different kinds
    of VPN routing information. The proposed solution avoids unnecessary advertising
    and receiving of VPN routes when multiple VPN services are deployed. This document
    also proposes modifications of advertisement rules of RT- Constrain information
    to ensure the integrity of VPN distribution graph.</p>"
