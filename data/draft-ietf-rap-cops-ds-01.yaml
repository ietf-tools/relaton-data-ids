abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a clear need for relatively simple and coarse methods of providing
    differentiated classes of service for Internet traffic, to support various types
    of services, and specific business requirements. The IETF has chartered the Differentiated
    Service WG to define the differentiated services architecture and a common language
    for differentiated services. In parallel, the IETF RSVP Admission Policy (RAP)
    WG has defined the COPS (Common Open Policy Service) protocol [COPS]. This document
    describes enhancements to the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol to support
    policy services in a Differentiated Services (DiffServ) environment. Further modifications
    to COPS for DiffServ may be proposed in the future, but what is presented here
    is thought to be the minimum necessary additions.</p>"
