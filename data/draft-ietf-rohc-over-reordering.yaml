abstract:
- content: "<p>RObust Header Compression (ROHC), RFC 3095, defines a framework for
    header compression, along with a number of compression protocols (profiles). One
    operating assumption for the profiles defined in RFC 3095 is that the channel
    between compressor and decompressor is required to maintain packet ordering. This
    document discusses aspects of using ROHC over channels that can reorder packets.
    It provides guidelines on how to implement existing profiles over such channels,
    as well as suggestions for the design of new profiles. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
