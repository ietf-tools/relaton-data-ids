abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the need and the mechanisms to dynamically
    update configuration of network monitoring devices to help identify distributed
    denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in a network. Once an attack is signalled by
    a client or detected locally, provisioning cycles are triggered to program a set
    of network elements to undertake appropriate actions (including, blackhole, drop,
    rate- limit, or add to watch list) on the suspect traffic.</p>"
