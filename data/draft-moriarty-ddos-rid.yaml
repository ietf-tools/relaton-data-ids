abstract:
- content: "<p>Network security incidents such as Denial of Service (DoS), system
    compromises, worms, and viruses typically result in the loss of service, data,
    and resources both human and system. Security incidents can be detrimental to
    the health of the network as a whole. Network Providers (NP) need to be equipped
    and ready to assist in tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in
    place before the occurrence of an attack. This paper proposes a proactive inter-network
    communication method to integrate existing tracing mechanisms across NP boundaries
    to identify the source(s) of an attack. The various methods implemented to detect
    and trace attacks must be coordinated on the NPs network as well as provide a
    communication mechanism across network borders. It is imperative that NPs have
    quick communication methods defined to enable neighboring NPs to assist in tracking
    a security incident across the Internet. This proposal integrates current incident
    detection and tracing practices for network traffic, which could be extended for
    security incident handling. Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended
    and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the defined protocol and extended
    to each NP's clients.</p>"
