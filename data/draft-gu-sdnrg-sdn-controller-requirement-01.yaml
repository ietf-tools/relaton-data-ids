abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements of SDN controllers including fundamental technical
    requirements, requirements of the SDN controller architecture and the requirements
    of the SDN controller functionality are provided. All these requirements raised
    are focused on the scalability, reliability, programmability, intercommunity,
    security and the network management of the SDN controller.Based on the requirements,
    we have realized the SDN controller based on Opendaylight foused on cloud datacenter.Due
    to realization, the interface between other devices besides the ovs is not included
    up to now, while in the actual design, some connections between controller and
    the forwarding devices such as SDN gateway, firewall, and NAT are added into the
    requirement of controller.</p>"
