abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for a user agent client to request
    the marking of a previously sent Instant Message as cancelled. From a user's perspective,
    the user agent server, or other proxies or relay points in the network, can effectively
    remove the first message, giving the impression the first message was cancelled.
    This document describes the utility of such a function, as well as the futility
    of attempting to create a true message cancellation feature.</p>"
