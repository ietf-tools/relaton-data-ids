abstract:
- content: "<p>Threshold cryptography operation modes are described with application
    to the Ed25519, Ed448, X25519 and X448 Elliptic Curves. Threshold key generation
    allows generation of keypairs to be divided between two or more parties with verifiable
    security guaranties. Threshold decryption allows elliptic curve key agreement
    to be divided between two or more parties such that all the parties must co-operate
    to complete a private key agreement operation. The same primitives may be applied
    to improve resistance to side channel attacks. A Threshold signature scheme is
    described in a separate document. https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/cfrg/
    (http://whatever)Discussion of this draft should take place on the CFRG mailing
    list (cfrg@irtf.org), which is archived at .</p>"
