abstract:
- content: "<p>WebRTC provides a solution for peer-to-peer streaming between web applications
    by leveraging a Real-Time Protocol (RTP) stream between two clients. This RTP
    stream is expected to be sent over an UDP (Universal Datagram Protocol) connection,
    which by definition has no built-in reliability. Recently the FEC FRAME Working
    Group of the IETF has come up with a framework and technical recommendations for
    applying forward error correction (FEC) to unreliable streams. This framework
    can be applied to WebRTC with minimal changes to the specification.</p>"
