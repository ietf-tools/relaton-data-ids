abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing allows a node to steer a packet through an ordered list
    of instructions, called segments. The ingress node prepends a SR header to a packet
    containing a set of "segments". A segment can represent any instruction topological
    or service-based. Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with
    a new type of routing extension header. A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.
    An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in
    the routing extension header. The segment to process is indicated by a pointer
    in the routing extension header. Upon completion of a segment, the pointer is
    incremented. This document describes how to decrease the length of the IPv6 list
    with ListID carried.</p>
