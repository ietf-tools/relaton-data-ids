abstract:
- content: "<p>The widespread adoption of Ethernet L2VPN services and the advent of
    new applications for the technology (e.g. data center interconnect) have culminated
    in a new set of requirements that are not readily addressable by the current VPLS
    solution. In particular, multi- homing with all-active forwarding is not supported
    and there's no existing solution to leverage MP2MP LSPs for optimizing the delivery
    of multi-destination frames. Furthermore, the provisioning of VPLS, even in the
    context of BGP-based auto-discovery, requires network operators to specify various
    network parameters on top of the access configuration. This document specifies
    the requirements for an Ethernet VPN (E-VPN) solution which addresses the above
    issues.</p>"
