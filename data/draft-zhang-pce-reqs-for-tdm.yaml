abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the special requirements for applying the Path
    Computation Element (PCE) in Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) networks, including
    Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), and
    Digital Wrapper (G.709 ODUk). The material presented in this document is collected
    here for analysis. The intention is to separate this material into separate documents
    on generic GMPLS requirements, generic GMPLS extensions, and TDM-specific requirements
    and extensions. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST
    NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
