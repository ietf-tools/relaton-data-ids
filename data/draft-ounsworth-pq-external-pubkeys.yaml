abstract:
- content: "<p>Many of the post quantum cryptographic algorithms have either large
    public keys or signatures. In the interest of reducing bandwidth of transitting
    X.509 certificates, this document defines new public key and signature algorithms
    for referencing external public key and signature data by hash, URL, etc. This
    mechanism is designed to mimic the behaviour of an Authority Information Access
    extension.</p>"
