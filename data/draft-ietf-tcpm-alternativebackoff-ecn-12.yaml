abstract:
- content: "<p>Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms allow for burst tolerance
    while enforcing short queues to minimise the time that packets spend enqueued
    at a bottleneck. This can cause noticeable performance degradation for TCP connections
    traversing such a bottleneck, especially if there are only a few flows or their
    bandwidth-delay product (BDP) is large. The reception of a Congestion Experienced
    (CE) Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) mark indicates that an AQM mechanism
    is used at the bottleneck, and the bottleneck network queue is therefore likely
    to be short. Feedback of this signal allows the TCP sender-side ECN reaction in
    congestion avoidance to reduce the Congestion Window (cwnd) by a smaller amount
    than the congestion control algorithm's reaction to inferred packet loss. Therefore,
    this specification defines an experimental change to the TCP reaction specified
    in RFC 3168, as permitted by RFC 8311.</p>"
