abstract:
- content: "<p>Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO) is a cryptographic
    technique that provides all of the security services that are used in the Secure
    Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). This note describes how to use AERO in SRTP.
    AERO has minimal data expansion, avoids the need to manage implicit state, and
    provides strong misuse resistance. These properties make it an ideal cryptographic
    transform for SRTP, as it enables SRTP to easily handle multiple senders sharing
    the same key, multiple receivers with late- joiners in a session, decentralized
    conferences with minimal control, and mixers that selectively forward RTP traffic.
    RTP architectures that utilize AERO can use the normal SSRC collision detection
    mechanism, and can ignore problematic SRTP artifacts such as the Roll-Over Counter
    (ROC) and Initial Sequence Number.</p>"
