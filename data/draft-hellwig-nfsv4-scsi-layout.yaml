abstract:
- content: "<p>Parallel NFS (pNFS) extends Network File Sharing version 4 (RFC5661)
    to allow clients to directly access file data on the storage used by the NFSv4
    server. This ability to bypass the server for data access can increase both performance
    and parallelism, but requires additional client functionality for data access,
    some of which is dependent on the class of storage used. The main pNFS operations
    document specifies storage-class-independent extensions to NFS, the pNFS Block/Volume
    Layout (RFC5663) specifies the additional extensions for use of pNFS with block-and
    volume-based storage, while this document provides extensions to the pNFS Block/Volume
    Layout document to provide reliable fencing and better device discoverability
    for SCSI based shared storage devices.</p>"
