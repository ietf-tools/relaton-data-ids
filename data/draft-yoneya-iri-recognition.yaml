abstract:
- content: <p>Nowadays access to the Internet is a part of daily life. Users see URIs
    written in various ways on various media, recognize them as "the Internet Addresses",
    and use them to access to the Internet. Many application programs recognize URIs
    automatically and make links to them, so the users can access to the URIs very
    easily. But, at this moment, most of application programs can't recognize Internationalized
    Domain Name (IDN) and Internationalized URI (IRI) correctly, so users will feel
    stress when using IDNs and IRIs. Utilization of the IDNs and the IRIs are getting
    higher. Therefore, improvement of the application programs are highly recommended.
    This document is intended to be an application developpers' guideline for recognizing
    and corresponding to IDNs/IRIs correctly.</p>
