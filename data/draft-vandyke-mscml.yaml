abstract:
- content: "<p>Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) is a markup language used
    in conjunction with SIP to provide advanced conferencing and interactive voice
    response (IVR) functions. MSCML presents an application-level control model, as
    opposed to device-level control models. One use of this protocol is for communications
    between a conference focus and mixer in the IETF SIP Conferencing Framework. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
