abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extended Key Usage (EKU) value which indicates
    that the certificate holder is authorized to sign security tokens to assert claims,
    or attributes, about a subject. When a certificate that asserts the claimSigning
    EKU signs a claim, the owner of the service holding that certificate is asserting
    that a statement about the subject is true. For example, a IdP secure token service
    (STS) would use an X.509 certificate containing the claimSigning EKU to sign SAML
    assertions containing an identifier and attributes about a user. This EKU value
    would allow for a separation between the designation that a given Identity belongs
    within a given Federation, and the empowerment of that entity within the federation
    to sign claims.. This approach allows for greater flexibility for the operators
    of Federated systems and for Certification Authorities and avoids the overloading
    of other, already established methods (such as Assurance Level designation via
    certificatePolicy OID).</p>"
