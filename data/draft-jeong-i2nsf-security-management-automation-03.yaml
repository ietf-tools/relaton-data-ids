abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension of the framework of Interface
    to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) for Security Management Automation (SMA)
    in cloud-based security services. The security management automation in this document
    deals with a security polity translation and a feedback-based security service
    enforcement. To support these two features in SMA, this document specifies an
    augmented architecture of the I2NSF framework with a new system component and
    a new interface.</p>"
