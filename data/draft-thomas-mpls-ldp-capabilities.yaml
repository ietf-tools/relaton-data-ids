- content: "<p>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) have
    been proposed. Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization.
    It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future. At present
    LDP has no guidelines for advertising such enhancements at LDP session initialization
    time. There is also no mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after the
    session is established. This document provides guidelines for advertising LDP
    enhancements at session initialization time. It also defines a mechanism to enable
    and disable enhancements after LDP session establishment.</p>"
