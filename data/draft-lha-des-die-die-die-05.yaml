abstract:
- content: "<p>A long long time ago Data Encryption Standard (DES) was standardized.
    Some 30 years later (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST), today 6 years later, its time for DES to finally
    die. By 2008 it was possible to brute force DES keys in 6.4 days using less than
    USD 10k worth of hardware. So by 2008 DES had passed its sell-by date. This document
    updates RFC1964, RFC4120, and RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos.
    Because the version of Kerberos specified in RFC1510 only supports DES and has
    been replaced by RFC4120, RFC1510 is reclassified as historic.</p>"
