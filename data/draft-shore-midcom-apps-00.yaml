abstract:
- content: "<p>As an architecture is evolving around an interface between middleboxes
    in the transport plane [Srisuresh] and the applications which must traverse them,
    we need to document the implications for applications. This documentation is intended
    both to provide guidance for application designers and to help network architects
    come to a better understanding of sources of complexity in our networks.</p>"
