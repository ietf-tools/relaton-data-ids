abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IRCX, a set of extensions to the Internet Relay
    Chat (IRC) protocol defined in RFC 1459[1]. Only client-server interactions are
    defined. The added functionality includes user authentication for multiple security
    providers, support for UNICODE[2] characters, multilayer security, and a unified
    property mechanism. Chat server implementations can support channel or server
    services with full control over all messages and events. These services communicate
    with the core server over an extended IRC connection. All changes to the IRC protocol
    are designed such that existing clients will continue to work against servers
    implementing the extensions. Support for the extended protocol can be queried
    by clients to take advantage of the added functionality or to conform to the basic
    protocol as defined in RFC1459.</p>"
