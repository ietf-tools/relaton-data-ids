abstract:
- content: "<p>Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size of
    the routing table they use and propagate. This draft explores an alternative to
    length-based filters which allows for more automatic configuration and which provides
    for better redundancy. Rather than use a filter, this draft proposes a method
    of modifying the BGP longest match algorithm by setting a bound on the prefix
    lengths eligible for preference. A bound would operate on long prefixes when covering
    route announcements are available; in certain circumstances it would cause a router
    to prefer an aggregate over a more specific route announcement.</p>"
