abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States Government has published the National Security Agency's
    Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic
    algorithm policy for national security applications. This document specifies the
    conventions for using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite
    algorithms in Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). It applies to the capabilities,
    configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems
    (described in NIST Special Publication 800-59) that employ IPsec. This document
    is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value
    information. It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators
    of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
