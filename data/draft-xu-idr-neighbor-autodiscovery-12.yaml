abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP is being used as the underlay routing protocol in some large- scaled
    data centers (DCs). Most popular design followed is to do hop-by-hop external
    BGP (EBGP) session configurations between neighboring routers on a per link basis.
    The provisioning of BGP neighbors in routers across such a DC brings its own operational
    complexity. This document introduces a BGP neighbor discovery mechanism that greatly
    simplifies BGP operations in such DC and other networks by automatic setup of
    BGP sessions between neighbor routers using this mechanism.</p>"
