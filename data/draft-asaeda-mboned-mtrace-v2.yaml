- content: "<p>This document describes the IGMP and the ICMPv6 multicast traceroute
    facility. Unlike unicast traceroute, multicast traceroute requires special packet
    types and implementations on the part of routers. This specification describes
    the required functionality in multicast routers, as well as how management applications
    can use the new router functionality.</p>"
