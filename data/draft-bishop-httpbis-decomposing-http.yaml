- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol in its various versions combines concepts
    of both an application and transport-layer protocol. As this group contemplates
    employing alternate transport protocols underneath HTTP, this document attempts
    to delineate the boundaries between these functions to define a shared vocabulary
    in discussing the revision and/or replacement of one or more of these components.</p>"
