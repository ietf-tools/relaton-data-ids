abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo requires support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in all
    electronic mail user agents (MUAs) and the servers with which they communicate
    when using standard protocols, including Interactive Message Access Protocol (IMAP),
    Post Office Protocol (POP) and the variant of the Simple Message Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) used in message submission. It also requires support for TLS in mail protocol
    servers provided by electronic mail service providers, and encourages mail service
    providers to migrate to requiring TLS for all interaction with their servers.
    In addition, this memo details specific recommendations for implementation and
    use of TLS with electronic mail protocols used in interactions between MUAs and
    mail service providers. Use of TLS with SMTP for message relaying is described
    in a separate document, and not in scope for this document. The recommendations
    in this memo do not replace the functionality of, and are not intended as a substitute
    for, end-to-end encryption of electronic mail.</p>"
