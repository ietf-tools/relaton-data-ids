abstract:
- content: "<p>The latency spin bit is an optional feature included in the QUIC transport
    protocol [I-D-QUIC]. It enables passive, on-path observations for estimation of
    latency. This document presents the results of an inquiry into the potential of
    using randomized response mechanisms (RRM) to reduce privacy loss in latency measurements.
    It concludes that RRM could be used to introduce choice for clients in preserving
    privacy in latency measurements. But the trade-offs, especially since the latency
    spin bit is already optional, do not favour RRM.</p>"
