abstract:
- content: "<p>This document adapts the X.500 directory administrative model for use
    by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The administrative model
    partitions the Directory Information Tree (DIT) for various aspects of directory
    data administration, e.g., subschema, access control, and collective attributes.
    The generic framework that applies to every aspect of administration is described
    in this document. The definitions that apply for a specific aspect of administration,
    e.g., access control administration, are described in other documents.</p>"
