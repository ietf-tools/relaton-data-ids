abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps In Signaling (NSIS) working group within the IETF is
    currently in the process of defining a signaling protocol. Consensus was reached
    to split the protocol into two layers; a general-purpose transport layer and a
    client layer that is application specific. The subject of this document is the
    specification of a client layer that can be used to request Quality of Service
    (QoS) to a network.</p>"
