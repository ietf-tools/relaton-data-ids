abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise Equipment
    (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a mostly end-to-end
    connectivity while keeping the major threats outside of the home. It is documenting
    an existing IPv6 deployment by Swisscom and allows all packets inbound/outbound
    EXCEPT for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as weak
    passwords) are well-known. The policy is a proposed set of rules that can be used
    as a default setting. The set of blocked inbound and outbound ports is expected
    to be updated as threats come and go.</p>"
