abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6
    Mobile Object Networking (IPMON). A moving object is a physically movable networked
    device with 5G communication capability, such as a terrestrial vehicle (e.g.,
    car and motorcycle), a user's smart device (e.g., smartphone, smart watch, and
    tablet), an aerial vehicle (e.g., drone and helicopter), and a marine vehicle
    (e.g., boat and ship). These mobile objects are called vehicles in this document.
    The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. First, this document explains
    use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking over 5G. Next, for IPv6-over-5G vehicular
    networks, it makes a gap analysis of current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor
    Discovery).</p>"
