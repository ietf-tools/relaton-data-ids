abstract:
- content: "<p>Firewall performs resource intensive filtering of traffic based on
    set of rules. A single firewall becomes a traffic bottleneck depending on network
    expansion, number of connections and the throughput required. This document describes
    a method of interconnecting the firewalls at multiple geographic locations through
    standalone network. It will enable firewall to dedicate its full processing capacity
    to perform task of packet filtering. The tasks of encryption, dynamic routing
    and anti-spoofing of traffic are taken care outside firewall function. The placement
    of firewall and routing device along with protocols to be used will form the proposed
    system to improve overall network security and scalability.</p>"
