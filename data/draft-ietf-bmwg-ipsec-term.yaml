abstract:
- content: "<p>This purpose of this document is to define terminology specific to
    measuring the performance of IPsec devices. It builds upon the tenets set forth
    in [RFC1242], [RFC2544], [RFC2285] and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working
    Group (BMWG) documents used for benchmarking routers and switches. This document
    seeks to extend these efforts specific to the IPsec paradigm. The BMWG produces
    two major classes of documents: Benchmarking Terminology documents and Benchmarking
    Methodology documents. The Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other
    related terms. The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect
    the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.</p>"
