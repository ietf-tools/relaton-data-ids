abstract:
- content: <p>RFC3261 constrained several SIP header fields whose grammar contains
    the "name-addr / addr-spec" alternative to use name-addr when certain characters
    appear. Unfortunately it expressed the constraints with prose copied into each
    header field definition, and at least one header field was missed. Further, the
    constraint has not been copied into documents defining extension headers whose
    grammar contains the alternative. This document updates RFC3261 to state the constraint
    generically, and clarifies that the constraint applies to all SIP header fields
    where there is a choice between using name-addr or addr-spec. It also updates
    those extension SIP header fields that use the alternative to clarify that the
    constraint applies (RFCs 3325, 3515, 3892, 4508, 5002, 5318, 5360, and 5502).</p>
