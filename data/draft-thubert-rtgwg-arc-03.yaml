abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces the concept of ARC, a two-edged routing construct
    that forms its own fault isolation and recovery domain. The new paradigm can be
    leveraged to improve the network utilization and resiliency for unicast and multicast
    traffic in multiple environments, and is optimized to compute short reroute paths
    in case of breakages.</p>"
