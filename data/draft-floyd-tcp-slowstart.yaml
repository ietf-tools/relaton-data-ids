abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start for
    use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. For TCP connections that
    are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands) of MSS-sized
    segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start procedure
    can result in increasing the congestion window by thousands of segments in a single
    round-trip time. Such an increase can easily result in thousands of packets being
    dropped in one round-trip time. This is often counter- productive for the TCP
    flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the congested
    link. This note describes Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting
    the number of segments by which the congestion window is increased for one window
    of data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for TCP connections
    with large congestion windows.</p>"
