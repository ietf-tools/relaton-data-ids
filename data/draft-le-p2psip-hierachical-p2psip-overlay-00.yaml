abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the hierarchical overlay architecture in Peer-
    to-Peer (P2P) SIP system. The P2P SIP is defined as a distributed network and
    each peer is equal in it. But actually peers are different from each other on
    many aspects, e.g., physical performance, network performance or system performance
    (e.g., uptime). So node heterogeneity should been considered enough in P2P SIP
    system, which affects the scalability and service availability of P2P SIP overlays.
    This draft introduces the performance concerns of P2P SIP overlay without consideration
    of node heterogeneity at first. After that, an alternative architecture of hierarchical
    P2P SIP overlay is brought up.</p>"
