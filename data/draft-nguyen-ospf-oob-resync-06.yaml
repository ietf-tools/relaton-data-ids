abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.
    Link State Database (LSDB) synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods
    -- initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF router has just been connected to
    the network and asynchronous flooding that ensures continuous LSDB synchronization
    in the presence of topology changes after the initial procedure was completed.
    It may sometime be necessary for OSPF routers to resynchronize their LSDBs. The
    OSPF standard, however, does not allow routers to do so without actually changing
    the topology view of the network. This memo describes a vendor-specific mechanism
    to perform such a form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization. The mechanism described
    in this document was proposed before Graceful OSPF Restart, as described in RFC
    3623, came into existence. It is implemented/supported by at least one major vendor
    and is currently deployed in the field. The purpose of this document is to capture
    the details of this mechanism for public use. This mechanism is not an IETF standard.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
