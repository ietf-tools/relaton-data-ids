- content: "<p>Due to the computation and storage limitations of constrained-node
    networks, it is costly to apply those security mechanisms based on public key
    algorithm. This document proposed a subliminal channel hiding communication method,
    which can provide message authentication service and protect the transmission
    of the sensitive data.</p>"
