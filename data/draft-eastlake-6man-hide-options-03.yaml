abstract:
- content: "<p>There are increasing requests for a variety IPv6 hop-by-hop options
    but such IPv6 options are poorly handled, particularly by high-speed routers in
    the core Internet where packets having options are commonly discarded. This document
    proposes a simple method of transiently hiding such options for part of a packet's
    path to protect the packet from discard.</p>"
