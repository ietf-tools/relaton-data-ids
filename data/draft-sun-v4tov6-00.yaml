abstract:
- content: "<p>Current approaches can not solve the scenario that the users from IPv4
    Internet to access IPv6-only content. When IPv6 content are becoming more and
    more popular, it is important to ensure that IPv6- only content can be reachable
    from legacy IPv4-only clients via some IPv4-only network. This document proposes
    an approach for IPv4-only users to access IPv6-only content, and can also achieve
    address sharing in the server side. It is designed to cover the Scenario 2 in
    [RFC6144].</p>"
