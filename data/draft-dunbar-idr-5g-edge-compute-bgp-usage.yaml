abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the problems in the 5G Edge computing environment
    and how BGP can be used to propagating additional information, so that the ingress
    routers in the 5G Local Data Network can make path selection not only based on
    the routing distance but also the running environment of the destinations. The
    goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G EC services.</p>"
