abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols such
    as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP. Over the last few years, several serious
    attacks on TLS have emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher
    suites and their modes of operation. This document provides recommendations for
    improving the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations
    are applicable to the majority of use cases.</p>"
