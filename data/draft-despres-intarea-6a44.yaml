abstract:
- content: "<p>In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a last resort
    IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081]. However, because it is designed
    to work without involvement of Internet service providers, it has significant
    limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is
    uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of
    NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being base on ISP cooperation,
    avoids these limitations. At the beginning of IPv6 addresses, it replaces the
    Teredo well-known prefix by network specific prefixes assigned by local ISP's
    (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd). In hosts, 6a44 can be implemented
    either autonomously or as an extension of Teredo. Except for IANA numbers that
    remain to be confirmed, the specification is intended to be complete enough for
    running codes to be independently written and the solution to be incrementally
    deployed.</p>"
