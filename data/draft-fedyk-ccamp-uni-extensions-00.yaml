abstract:
- content: "<p>This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines
    extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route diversity
    within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge nodes. A particular
    example where route diversity within the core network is desired, are dual-homed
    edge nodes. The document also defines GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency
    requirements for edge node initiated LSPs. This document uses a VPN model that
    is based on the same premise as L1VPN framework [RFC4847] but may also be applied
    to other technologies. The extensions are applicable both to VPN and non VPN environments.
    These extensions move the UNI from basic connectivity to enhanced mode connectivity
    by including additional constraints while minimizing the exchange of CE to PE
    information. These extensions are applicable to the overlay extension service
    model. Route Diversity for customer LSPs are a common requirement applicable to
    L1VPNs. The UNI mechanisms described in this document are L1VPN compatible and
    can be applied to achieve diversity for sets of customer LSPs. The UNI extensions
    in support of latency constraints can also be applied to the extended overlay
    service model in order for the customer LSPs to meet certain latency requirements.</p>"
