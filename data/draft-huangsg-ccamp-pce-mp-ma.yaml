abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose an interaction scheme using Mobile Agent (MA) between the
    Path Computation Element (PCE) and Management Plane (MP) to solve information
    collection delay and management message congestion. It is a new collaboration
    mechanism about MP in intelligent optical networks. This mechanism also specifies
    a flexible communication mode between MP and PCE.</p>"
