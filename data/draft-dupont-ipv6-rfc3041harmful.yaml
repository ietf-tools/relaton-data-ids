abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the privacy extensions for stateless address autoconfiguration
    [1] is to change the interface identifier (and the global-scope addresses generated
    from it) over time in order to make it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other
    information collectors to identify when different addresses used in different
    transactions actually correspond to the same node. Current Distributed Denial
    of Service (DDoS) [2] attacks employ forged source addresses which can also be
    in the same prefixes than the real addresses of the compromised nodes used for
    attacks. Indeed, network ingress filtering defeats DDoS using 'random' forged
    source addresses.</p>"
