abstract:
- content: "<p>In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP) (RFC
    5440) is used between a controller and the network devices, using which controller
    can setup and tear down Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) based label switched
    paths(LSPs) in the network having Path Computation Client (PCC) as Label Switched
    Router (LSR). In an environment where dynamic tunnels are used to provide MPLS
    based customer services instead of a Label Switched Path, the specifications lacks
    a method to report the Dynamic tunnels over PCEP session to PCE. This draft defines
    a method to advertise the dynamic tunnels via PCEP session to PCE. This document
    proposes new object TLV that can be used to report dynamic tunnels to the PCE.</p>"
