abstract:
- content: <p>If we model the system of Internet names as a set of directed graphs
    in an absolute naming context, following RFC 819, an Internet name is not necessarily
    a name in the domain name system, but is simply a unique name associated with
    a particular directed graph. The resolution of the name, in other words, is independent
    from it being an "Internet name". The DNS is a common, but not the only, resolution
    context for Internet names. This document discusses the consequences of the need
    to select among multiple resolution contexts.</p>
