abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring
    data. While it evolved from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) -- a markup
    language primarily focused on structuring documents -- XML has evolved to be a
    widely-used mechanism for representing structured data. There are a wide variety
    of Internet protocols being developed; many have need for a representation for
    structured data relevant to their application. There has been much interest in
    the use of XML as a representation method. This document describes basic XML concepts,
    analyzes various alternatives in the use of XML, and provides guidelines for the
    use of XML within IETF standards-track protocols. This document specifies an Internet
    Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements.</p>"
