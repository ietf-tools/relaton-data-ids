abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flow Specification (Flowspec) provides a mechanism to distribute
    traffic flow specifications and the forwarding actions to be performed to the
    specific traffic flows. A set of Flowspec components are defined to specify the
    matching criteria that can be applied to the packet, and a set of BGP extended
    communities are defined to encode the actions a routing system can take on a packet
    which matches the flow specification. An IETF Network Slice enables connectivity
    between a set of Service Demarcation Points (SDPs) with specific Service Level
    Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Expectations (SLEs) over a common underlay
    network. To meet the connectivity and performance requirements of network slice
    services, network slice service traffic needs to be mapped to a corresponding
    Network Resource Partition (NRP). The edge nodes of the NRP needs to identify
    the traffic flows which belong to a network slice and steer the matched traffic
    into the corresponding NRP, or a specific path within the corresponding NRP. BGP
    Flowspec can be used to distribute the matching criteria and the forwarding actions
    to be preformed on network slice service traffic. The existing Flowspec components
    can be reused for the matching of network slice services flows at the edge of
    an NRP. New components and traffic action may need to be defined for steering
    network slice service flows into the corresponding NRP. This document defines
    the extensions to BGP Flowspec for IETF network slice traffic steering (NS-TS).</p>"
