abstract:
- content: "<p>The DELEG Working Group is soon going to be choosing a base protocol
    that describes how resolvers will be able to get a new DNS resource record to
    create a new process for DNS delegation. After a resolver gets this new type of
    record, it needs to know how to process the record in order to get a set of nameservers
    for a zone. This document lists many of the considerations for that process, including
    many open questions for the DELEG Working Group. More considerations and open
    questions might be added in later versions of this draft. Note that this draft
    is _not_ intended to become an RFC. It is being published so that the DELEG Working
    Group has a place to point its efforts about how resolvers get nameservers for
    a zone while it continues to work on choosing a base protocol. The work that results
    from this might be included in the base protocol specification, or in a new draft
    authored by some of the many people who have done earlier work in this area.</p>"
