abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an object-oriented information model of IP Security
    (IPsec) policy designed to facilitate agreement about the content and semantics
    of IPsec policy, and enable derivations of task- specific representations of IPsec
    policy such as storage schema, distribution representations, and policy specification
    languages used to configure IPsec-enabled endpoints. The information model described
    in this document models the configuration parameters defined by IPSec. The information
    model also covers the parameters found by the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE).
    Other key exchange protocols could easily be added to the information model by
    a simple extension. Further extensions can further be added easily due to the
    object-oriented nature of the model. This information model is based upon the
    core policy classes as defined in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and
    in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions (PCIMe). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
