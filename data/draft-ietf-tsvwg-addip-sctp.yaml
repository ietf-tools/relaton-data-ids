abstract:
- content: "<p>A local host may have multiple points of attachment to the Internet,
    giving it a degree of fault tolerance from hardware failures. Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) (RFC 4960) was developed to take full advantage of such a multi-homed
    host to provide a fast failover and association survivability in the face of such
    hardware failures. This document describes an extension to SCTP that will allow
    an SCTP stack to dynamically add an IP address to an SCTP association, dynamically
    delete an IP address from an SCTP association, and to request to set the primary
    address the peer will use when sending to an endpoint. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
