abstract:
- content: <p>Link-local networks such as home Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial
    Internet of Things are becoming increasingly prosperous, with a large number of
    small devices deployed in the link-local networks. These devices discover each
    other through ".local." domain names of DNS-based zero-configuration network protocol.
    However, the lack of specialized security operations to supervise link-local DNS
    resolution leads to some security risks. This memo addresses the potential risks
    associated with the leakage of link-local DNS traffic to external networks, the
    lack of identity authentication on ".local." domain requests, and the lack of
    rate-limiting on ".local." domain responses, which poses the leakage of link-local
    device information and the risk of DDoS attacks. Furthermore, the document proposes
    a set of best practices and technical solutions to mitigate these risks and ensure
    that ".local." domain name resolution remains confined within the local network
    segment.</p>
