abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes Time To Live (TTL) processing in hierarchical
    Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks and is motivated by the need to
    formalize a TTL-transparent mode of operation for an MPLS label-switched path.
    It updates RFC 3032, "MPLS Label Stack Encoding". TTL processing in both Pipe
    and Uniform Model hierarchical tunnels are specified with examples for both "push"
    and "pop" cases. The document also complements RFC 3270, "MPLS Support of Differentiated
    Services" and ties together the terminology introduced in that document with TTL
    processing in hierarchical MPLS networks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
