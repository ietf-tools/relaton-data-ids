abstract:
- content: "<p>In Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) several extension
    are proposed to cope with constrain provide Wavelength Switched Optical Networks
    (WSON). One of the technology constrain related to Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
    (DWDM) systems is the bi-directionality of the lightpath. This memo provides some
    consideration about how extending the signaling phase to cope with the bi-directional
    requirements. The procedure is independent from the wavelength continuity constrain
    in both direction.</p>"
