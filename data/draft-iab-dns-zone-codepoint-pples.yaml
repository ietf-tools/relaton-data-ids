abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) makes available
    to DNS zone administrators a very wide range of Unicode code points. Most operators
    of zones should probably not permit registration of U-labels using the entire
    range. This is especially true of zones that accept registrations across organizational
    boundaries, such as top-level domains and, most importantly, the root. It is unfortunately
    not possible to generate algorithms to determine whether permitting a code point
    presents a low risk. This memo presents a set of principles that can be used to
    guide the decision of whether a Unicode code point may be wisely included in the
    repertoire of permissible code points in a U-label in a zone.</p>"
