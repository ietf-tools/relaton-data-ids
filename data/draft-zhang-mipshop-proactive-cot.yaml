abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a practical scheme to run the care-of address
    test (part of the Return Routability test for Mobile IPv6 route optimization)
    in a proactive way in the context of the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6)
    protocol, so that the latency caused by the care-of address test after movements
    can be removed or reduced. Proactive care-of address test can make the Return
    Rroutability protocol more suitable for delay sensitive applications especially
    when it is applied in conjunction with other Return Routability optimization schemes.</p>"
