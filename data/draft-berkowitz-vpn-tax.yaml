abstract:
- content: "<p>Most useful networking ideas involve some level of abstraction. Virtual
    private networks (VPN) map an abstraction of an user-defined interface onto an
    infrastructure. Multihoming strategies are virtualizations in the infrastructure
    [Berkowitz multihome] that should be invisible to the VPN. Proprietary definitions
    of VPNs proliferate in the marketplace, to the confusion of end users. This memorandum
    proposes a taxonomy which can describe a variety of VPN models. It does not recommend
    any specific model, but suggests a consistent way of describing specific VPNs.
    This document differs from some other working papers that go more deeply into
    the VPN mechanisms. In contrast, this document is focused on user requirments.</p>"
