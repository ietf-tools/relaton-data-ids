abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an overview snapshot of the HRPC project to
    map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to human rights,
    with a focus on the promotion and protection of the freedom of expression and
    of association. It provides a framework while reporting on the study including:
    theoretical background, results and basic considerations. It will reference the
    detailed work being done on terminlogy and case studies documented in the research
    draft. It also folds in discussions from the research literature. The documents,
    [HRPC-Research] and this document, form an interrelated set that may later be
    combined into a single document. This draft is still in very early stages and
    welcomes further contribution. Text is solicited. Discussion on this draft at:
    hrpc@irtf.org // https://www.irtf.org/mailman/admindb/hrpc</p>"
