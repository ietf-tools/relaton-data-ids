abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes basic ideas and data components of 'Capability
    Card,' which is a kind of attribute certificates designed from the standpoint
    of a secure communication framework on the Internet. Similar to the SPKI certificates,
    a capability card can be used to grant a person particular access privileges to
    resources like WWW pages, IRC channels, and message boxes. In addition, it can
    carry a variety of descriptive information about the issuer, the resources, and
    the privileges specified in it. A capability card is written in XML, which is
    becoming a standard format rapidly for the internet data exchange. Consequently,
    users can handle various information in capability cards visually with an XML
    viewer. This is a fairly desirable feature for the existing internet services.
    In this document, following the motivation and the basic concepts, the elements
    of XML DTD of capability cards are described.</p>"
