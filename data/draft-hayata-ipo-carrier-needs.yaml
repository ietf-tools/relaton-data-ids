abstract:
- content: "<p>As discussed in [1], the need for survivable optical networks is critical,
    and introducing capabilities that further enhance network survivability continues
    to be an essential objective. This is particularly important for operators with
    stringent requirements for network resilience and service survivability. However,
    disruption of service can result not only from faults, but also from scheduled
    maintenance procedures. This draft introduces some additional considerations and
    carrier needs related to failure recovery and scheduled maintenance work in switched
    optical networks. These are of critical importance for serving -business customers
    who require super high quality service assurance and pay correspondingly high
    tariffs in order to guarantee this level of QoS.</p>"
