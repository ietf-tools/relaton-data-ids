abstract:
- content: "<p>To support host autoconfiguration, a host's dynamically acquired address
    must be registered in the Domain Name System (DNS) automatically. This document
    specifies the extensions to DNS to enable autoregistration. DNS extensions include
    a new operation that enables records associated with an existing node to be updated,
    and a new resource record attribute that enables records to be invalidated automatically.
    The changes are designed to be minimal and are expected to occur in conjunction
    with the DNS security extensions[DNSSEC] and the incremental zone transfer mechanism[DNSIXFR].</p>"
