abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications
    are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications and services
    easier. This document provides a platform-neutral schema for representing AI agents'
    identities in JSON format, enabling them to be transferred in the SCIM protocol
    to the service. This establishes an agentic identity so that an agent can subsequently
    be authenticated and authorized to interact with the service.</p>"
