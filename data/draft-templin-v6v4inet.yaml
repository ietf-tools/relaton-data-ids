abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 128-bit address space was designed as a solution for the 32-bit
    limitation of IPv4, but the proliferation of IPv4 in the global Internet continues
    via private addressing domains behind Network Address Translators (NATs). For
    these reasons, deployment of IPv6 at the end nodes with minimal perturbation of
    IPv4 networks presents a natural long-term transition and coexistence alternative.
    This document proposes a coexistence scenario with IPv6 for end to end addressing
    and IPv4 for network traversal.</p>"
