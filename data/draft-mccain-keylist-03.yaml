abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may subscribe
    to an organization's keylist to keep its internal keystore up-to-date. Ensuring
    that all members of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP public
    keys is critical to maintaining operational security. Without the most recent
    keys and a source of trust for those keys (as this document specifies), users
    must manually update and sign each others keys -- a system that is untenable in
    larger organizations. This document proposes a experimental format for the keylist
    file as well as requirements for clients who wish to implement this experimental
    keylist subscription functionality.</p>"
