abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides recommendations on the use of the secure hash
    functions SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 specified in FIPS 180. SHA- 512/224 and
    SHA-512/256 are SHA-512-based and truncated to match the output size of SHA-224
    and SHA-256. On 64-bit platforms, the SHA-512- truncated algorithms provide better
    performance than their comparably sized SHA-224 and SHA-256 variants.</p>"
