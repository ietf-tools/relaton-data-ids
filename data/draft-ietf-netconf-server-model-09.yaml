abstract:
- content: '<p>This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model and a
    RESTCONF server configuration data model. These data models enable configuration
    of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves, including which transports are
    supported, what ports the servers listen on, call-home parameters, client authentication,
    and related parameters. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft
    contains many placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values
    at the time of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that

    both in the Normative References section, as well as in body text throughout.
