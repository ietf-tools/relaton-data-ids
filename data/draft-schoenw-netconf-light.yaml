abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a profile of the NETCONF protocol called NETCONF
    Light. This profile modularizes the NETCONF protocol and allows devices to announce
    that they only support a subset of the NETCONF protocol operations. This is useful
    in situations where devices are either too resource constrained to support all
    NETCONF operations or where devices are gradually updated from proprietary configuration
    interfaces to support NETCONF.</p>"
