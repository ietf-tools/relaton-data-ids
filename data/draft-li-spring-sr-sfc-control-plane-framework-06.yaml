abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
    paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments".
    Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well
    as an IPv6 data plane. Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides support for the
    creation of composite services that consist of an ordered set of Service Functions
    (SF) that are to be applied to packets and/or frames selected as a result of classification.
    SFC can be implemented based on several technologies, such as Network Service
    Header (NSH) and SR. This document describes a framework for constructing SFC
    based on Segment Routing. The document reviews the control plane solutions for
    route distribution of service function instance and service function path, and
    steering packets into a service function chain.</p>
