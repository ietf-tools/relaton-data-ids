abstract:
- content: "<p>Requesting help in an emergency using a communications device such
    as a telephone or mobile is an accepted practice in most of the world. As communications
    devices increasingly utilize the Internet to interconnect and communicate, users
    will continue to expect to use such devices to request help, regardless of whether
    or not they communicate using IP. The emergency response community will have to
    upgrade their facilities to support the wider range of communications services,
    but cannot be expected to handle wide variation in device and service capability.
    The IETF has several efforts targeted at standardizing various aspects of placing
    emergency calls. This memo describes best current practice on how devices and
    services should use such standards to reliably make emergency calls</p>"
