- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes managed objects used for monitoring selectable performance metrics
    and statistics derived from the monitoring of network packets and sub-application
    level transactions. The metrics can be defined through reference to existing IETF,
    ITU, and other standards organizations' documents. The monitoring covers both
    passive and active traffic generation sources. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
