abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol for alerting a dormant mode host
    of incoming packets. A unique characteristic of the proposed protocol is that
    its major operations, namely, paging registration, monitoring and capturing of
    paging triggering packets, and initiation of the paging operation, are performed
    primarily in a last-hop subnet (i.e., the edge subnet to which the host is connected
    before entering dormant mode). The proposed protocol conforms with the DMHA (Dormant
    Mode Host Alerting) protocol requirements discussed in the IETF Seamoby WG.</p>"
