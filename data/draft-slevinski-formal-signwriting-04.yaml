abstract:
- content: <p>Sutton SignWriting is the universal and complete solution for written
    sign language, ISO 15924 script code "Sgnw". It has been applied by a wide and
    deep international community of sign language users. Sutton SignWriting is an
    international standard for writing sign languages by hand or with computers. From
    education to research, from entertainment to religion, SignWriting has proven
    useful because people are using it to write signed languages. Formal SignWriting
    is one particular computerized design for Sutton SignWriting that envisions a
    sign as a two part word. Each word is written as a string of characters that can
    be recognized and processed by regular expressions. The design has been optimized
    for display, searching, sorting, text flow, and other character processing. Where
    as American Sign Language is a natural language, Formal SignWriting is a formal
    language. A formal language is useful in mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.
