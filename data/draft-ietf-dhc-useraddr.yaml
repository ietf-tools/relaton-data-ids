- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism that DHCP clients can use optionally
    to obtain their IP addresses from different address pools configured on a DHCP
    server. A DHCP client can specify a class to which it belongs. Based on the class,
    a DHCP server selects the appropriate address pool to assign an address to the
    client.</p>"
