abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2065 defines a means for storing cryptogrpahic public keys in the
    Domain Name System. An additional code point is defined for the KEY resource record
    (RR) algorithm field to indicate that the key itself is not stored in the KEY
    RR but is pointed to by the KEY RR. Encodings to indicate different types of key
    and pointer formats are specified.</p>"
