abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the high level architecture for Security Automation
    and Continuous Monitoring (SACM). The architecture identifies the components that
    provide for the collection, storage, dissemination, and evaluation of posture
    information. This architecture also describes the interfaces and associated operations
    that define the interactions between these components. This information will inform
    future engineering work around identifying existing standards for collecting,
    storing, disseminating, and evaluating endpoint posture information. This architecture
    will also help in identifying standardization gaps that require new engineering
    effort. Security practitioners need to request, analyze, and aggregate posture
    information from disparate sources that use differing means to identify endpoints,
    hardware, software, and configurations. This task is made harder by the large
    number of different protocols and formats needed to bring together all of this
    information into a single view. This architecture provides a means to automatically
    gather posture data together for standardized dissemination to downstream components.
    This allows security practitioners that leverage this architecture to focus on
    managing security problems, not data.</p>"
