abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SDP) is the subject of numerous specifications
    that have been produced by the IETF. It can be difficult to locate the right document,
    or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SDP. This specification
    serves as a guide to the SDP RFC series. It lists a current snapshot of the specifications
    under the SDP umbrella, briefly summarises each, and groups them into categories.
    Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent
    to mmusic@ietf.org.</p>"
