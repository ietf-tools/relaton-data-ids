abstract:
- content: "<p>Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments,
    and industries. In recent years, these two novel frameworks created jitters and
    excitements across major academic institutions and communities of practice. While
    these are considered disruptive to major network infrastructures operating on
    status quo, SDN and NFV nonetheless bring network resiliency, scalability, manageability,
    and, most importantly, lower long-term operational expenditures when implemented
    properly. They create opportunities for innovation that engage key players from
    networks, security, and software to develop new controllers, APIs, networks, and
    technologies. However, new innovations come with associated risks and security
    issues. This document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches
    important aspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks. This architecture, which is considered
    first to be proposed thru this draft, can be elaborated and modified as the frameworks
    mature over time.</p>"
