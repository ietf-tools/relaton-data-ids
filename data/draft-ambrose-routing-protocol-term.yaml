abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to describe terminology specific to the
    benchmarking of devices that support one or more routing protocols. It builds
    upon the tenets set forth in RFC 2544 and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology
    Working Group (BMWG) efforts. This document seeks to extend these efforts to the
    router benchmarking paradigm. The BMWG produces two major classes of documents:
    Benchmarking Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The
    Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms. The Methodology
    documents define the procedures required to collect the benchmarks cited in the
    corresponding Terminology documents.</p>"
