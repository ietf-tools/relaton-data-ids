abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Semantic Content Packages, an experimental
    data structure and associated format for storing and transmitting a named set
    of RDF statements with a set of content streams. Packages can be arranged as a
    set of files in a directory hierarchy or serialized into a single stream for transmission
    and archival storage. For the latter, a new ZIP-based media type, application/scp,
    is defined.</p>"
