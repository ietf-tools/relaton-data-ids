abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an RTCP XR report block, which reports packet
    transport parameters. The report block was developed by BT for pre-standards use
    in BT's next-generation network. This document has been produced to describe the
    report block in sufficient detail to register the block type with IANA in accordance
    with the Specification Required policy of RFC 3611. This specification does not
    standardise the new report block for use outside BT's network. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
