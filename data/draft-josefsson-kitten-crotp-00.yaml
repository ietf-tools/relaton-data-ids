abstract:
- content: "<p>The CROTP mechanism family provide support for two-factor authentication
    using a static long-term password and a single use changing one-time password
    (OTP) in the SASL and GSS-API frameworks. The design of CROTP is based on SCRAM
    described in RFC 5802. CROTP works with several OTP system, including the Open
    AuTHentication HOTP algorithm described in RFC 4226.</p>"
