abstract:
- content: "<p>The debate over whether to store cryptographic keys used by applications
    in the Domain Name System or not has been going on for some time. There are arguments
    for and against [6]. This document tries to take a step further and provides some
    initial terminology, problem statement and use cases for storing application keys
    in DNS, in order to enable more substantiated input to the discussion. We mention
    some proposed solutions so far. We also give some requirements on a solution (be
    it DNS based or not) that would satisfy the use cases.</p>"
