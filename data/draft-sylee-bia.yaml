abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism of dual stack hosts using the technique
    called 'Bump-in-the-API' which allows for the hosts to communicate with other
    IPv6 hosts using existing IPv4 applications. The goal of this mechanism is the
    same as the Bump-in-the-stack mechanism [BIS], but this mechanism provides the
    translation method between the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. So that the goal is achieved
    simply without IP header translation.</p>"
