abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a programming interface to standardize the way software
    programs manage cryptographic modules and use cryptographic services offered by
    modules. Although a number of interfaces for commercial environments have been
    standardized and are in use, this is the first generic cryptographic interface
    to be developed that supports cryptographic modules separating two security domains
    and is thus ideal for the high assurance environment. The interface has been designed
    to also allow less demanding environments to take advantage of its features.</p>"
