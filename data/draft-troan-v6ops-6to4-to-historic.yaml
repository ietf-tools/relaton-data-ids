abstract:
- content: <p>Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4)"
    IPv6 transitioning mechanism has shown that the mechanism is unsuitable for widespread
    deployment and use in the Internet. This document requests that RFC3056 and the
    companion document "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" RFC3068 are moved
    to historic status.</p>
