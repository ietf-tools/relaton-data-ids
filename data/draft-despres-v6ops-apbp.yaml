abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses, for the IPv4-IPv6 coexistence period, the
    combined requirement that: (1) legacy IPv4 hosts can establish IPv4 transport
    connection s from customer sites having IPv6-only permanent addresses; (2) for
    good scalability, no network address translations (NATs), and a fortiori no application
    level gateways (ALGs), need to be supported within network infrastructures. To
    satisfy this requirement, it is concluded that an address-port-borrowing-protocol
    (APBP) is needed.</p>"
