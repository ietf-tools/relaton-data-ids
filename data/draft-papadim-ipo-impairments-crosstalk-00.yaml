abstract:
- content: "<p>Optical in-band crosstalk between interfering optical channels has
    been identified (see [ITC-DIL]) as one of the major limitations to the diameter
    and the performance of photonic (or all-optical) networks. In this context in-band
    crosstalk remains a cause of optical signal degradation in switching elements
    included in a Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC).</p>"
