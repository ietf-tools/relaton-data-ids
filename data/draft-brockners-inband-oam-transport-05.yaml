abstract:
- content: "<p>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) records operational
    and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between
    two points in the network. In-situ OAM is to complement current out-of-band OAM
    mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe packets. This document outlines
    how in-situ OAM data fields can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment
    Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension headers), and IPv4. Transport options
    are currently investigated as part of an implementation study. This document is
    intended to only serve informational purposes.</p>"
