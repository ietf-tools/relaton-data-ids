abstract:
- content: "<p>The establishment of a shared model of trust is critical to any functioning
    technology ecosystem, particularly when it relates to the sharing of data and
    the execution of Consumer specific actions. Traditional models of trust have typically
    revolved around implicit trust established through bi-lateral arrangements (i.e.
    legal contracts) between participants. The issue with this approach is that, at
    scale, it is not possible for all participants to efficiently establish communication
    with all other participants. This leads to the requirement for a mechanism to
    establish trust across participants in a way that the business layer of an organisation
    has confidence in ensuring participant interaction is validated.</p>"
