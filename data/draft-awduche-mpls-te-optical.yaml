abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach to the design of control planes
    for optical crossconnects (OXCs), which leverages existing control plane techniques
    developed for MPLS Traffic Engineering. The proposed approach combines recent
    advances in MPLS traffic engineering control plane constructs with OXC technology
    to: (1) provide a framework for real-time provisioning of optical channels in
    automatically switched optical networks, (2) foster the expedited development
    and deployment of a new class of versatile OXCs, and (3) allow the use of uniform
    semantics for network management and operations control in hybrid networks consisting
    of OXCs and label switching routers (LSRs). The proposed approach is particularly
    advantageous for OXCs intended for data-centric optical internetworking systems.
    In such environments, it will help to simplify network administration. This approach
    also paves the way for the eventual incorporation of DWDM multiplexing capabilities
    in IP routers.</p>"
