abstract:
- content: "<p>TCP-ENO and tcpcrypt perform encryption at the transport layer. They
    also define a few parameters that are intended to be used or configured by applications.
    This document specifies operating system interfaces for access to these parameters.
    We describe the interfaces in terms of socket options, the de facto standard API
    for adjusting per-connection behavior in TCP/IP, and sysctl, a popular mechanism
    for setting global defaults. Operating systems that lack socket or sysctl functionality
    can implement similar interfaces in their native frameworks, but should ideally
    adapt their interfaces from those presented in this document.</p>"
