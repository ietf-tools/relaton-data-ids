abstract:
- content: <p>Each I2NSF agent and I2NSF client needs to provide application level
    support for management traffic during periods of DDoS and network security attacks
    to deal with congestion (burst and/or continuous), high error rates and packet
    loss due to the attacks, and the inability to utilize a transport protocol (E.g.
    TCP) due to a specific protocol attack. This application level support needs to
    be able to select the key management system and provide "chunking" of data (in
    order to fit in reduced effective MTUs), compression of data (in order to fit
    into reduced bandwidth), small security envelope )in order to maximize room for
    management payload), and fragmentation and reassembly at the application layer
    for those protocols which do not support fragmentation/reassembly (E.g. UDP or
    SMS). These Secure Session Layer services may only be deployed on a the few management
    ports which need to be protected during DDoS attacks or network security attacks,
    and turned on/off based on need. The application and the network instrumentation
    need to cooperate to determine if this service needs to be turned on or off. This
    draft specifies a security session layer services(SSLs) which provide these features
    in terms of APIs (North-Bound and South-bound), and the component features (interface
    to key management systems, data compression, chunking of data, secure session
    envelope (SSE) to send data, and fragmentation and reassembly, and ability to
    detect existence of attack).</p>
