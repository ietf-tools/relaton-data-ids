abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a methodology for allowing the nodes in a Virtual
    Private LAN Service (VPLS) network as described in [VPLS] to discover each other
    via MPLS signaling. It also defines a methodology whereby the individual VPLS
    services are discovered via MPLS signaling. The goal is to allow a VPLS network
    to be created using MPLS signaling and a minimal amount of configuration.</p>"
