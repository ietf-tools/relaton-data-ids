abstract:
- content: <p>Increasingly the need for IPv6 ND Proxy [RFC4389]) to be a Standards
    Track document is growing. During the specification of the IPv6 CE Router in the
    IETF v6ops Working Group, the IPv6 CE Router has use for ND Proxy to bridge disparate
    MAC layers LAN ports. There is also the use of ND Proxy in cable broadband NBMA
    network for DAD and ND address resolution on a cable access concentrator. Another
    case where ND Proxy is required is when one does not have enough IPv6 address
    space to route. This short note recommends that the ND Proxy RFC be changed to
    a Standards Track document. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted
    to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts
