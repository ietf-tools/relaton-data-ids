abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance of IoT architecture based on virtual
    thing environment for security. In the heterogeneous IoT environment, Internet
    of Things(IoT) have a limitation in adapting management function such as updating
    software, adopting various general cryptography mechanisms since they have limited
    processing power, storage space and transmission capacities. Moreover, IoT could
    not support all of requirement for IoT management function in heterogeneous environment.
    Especially, security is one of the issue in heterogeneous environments. Therefore,
    this draft describes IoT architecture based on virtual thing environment and classify
    the requirements as well as problem statement.</p>"
