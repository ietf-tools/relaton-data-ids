abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some mechanisms to enable an IP network to
    transport both the IP traffic of the local realm and the IP traffics of external
    realms in the native (non-tunneled) way [TRANSP-FRAM]. The methods, described
    in this document, provide to the routers of the operated network the necessary
    information enabling the delivery of IP traffics originated from the foreign realms
    the operator offer connectivity to. This information is derived by the currently
    available routing information routers have and is moreover provided to them by
    the mean of a local delivery mechanism.</p>"
