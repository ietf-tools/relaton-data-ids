abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes MEGACO/H.248 [6,2] call-setup set up procedures
    that enable T.38 [4] capable media gateways to transition between a Voice over
    IP (VoIP) call and a Facsimile over IP (FoIP) (using ITU-T Rec. T.38) call either:
    a) with the real-time intervention of a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) using one
    of the existing mechanisms in Rec. T.38 Annex B/H.323, Rec. T.38 Annex D/SIP-SDP
    and Rec. T.38 Annex E/H.248, and Rec. H.323 Annex D. b) without the real-time
    intervention of a Media Gateway Controller (MGC). The only involvement of the
    MGC will be during initial connection capabilities negotiation between the media
    gateways. At this stage, both the MGs and the MGCs are unaware of the type of
    connection, (i.e. Voice, Fax, Modem, etc.). This contribution also describes how
    these call set-up procedures can be used in conjunction with the existing procedures
    of ITU-T Rec. H.323 Annex D to set-up two parallel channels, one for voice and
    the other for T.38, without any modifications of the procedures.</p>"
