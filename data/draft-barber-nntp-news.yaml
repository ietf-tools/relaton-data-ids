abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network News Transport Protocol has been in use in the Internet
    for a decade and remains one of the most popular protocols (by volume) in use
    today. This document is a replacement for RFC 977 and officially updates the protocol
    specification. It clarifies some vagueness in RFC 977, includes some new base
    functionality and provides a specific mechanism to add standardized extensions
    to NNTP.</p>"
