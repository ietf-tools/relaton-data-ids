abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the 608 (Rejected) SIP response code. This response
    code enables calling parties to learn that an intermediary rejected their call
    attempt. The call will not be answered. As a 6xx code, the caller will be aware
    that future attempts to contact the same UAS will likely fail. The present use
    case driving the need for the 608 response code is when the intermediary is an
    analytics engine. In this case, the rejection is by a machine or other process.
    This contrasts with the 607 (Unwanted) SIP response code, which a human at the
    target UAS indicated the call was not wanted. In some jurisdictions this distinction
    is important. This document also defines the use of the Call-Info header in 608
    responses to enable rejected callers to contact entities that blocked their calls
    in error. This provides a remediation mechanism for legal callers that find their
    calls blocked.</p>"
