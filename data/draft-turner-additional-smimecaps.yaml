abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists values for the S/MIME Capabilities Attribute. The
    attribute itself is defined in RFC TBD1, but the values for each are defined in
    separate algorithm documents and in some cases not at all. The SMIME Capability
    values can be included in S/MIME messages as a signed attribute and in public
    key certificates as an extension. //RFC EDITOR: Replace TBD1 with the # assigned
    to draft-ietf-smime- 3851bis-10.txt.</p>"
