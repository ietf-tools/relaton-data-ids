abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-idr-link-bandwidth] defines a BGP link bandwidth extended
    community attribute, which can enable devices to implement unequal- cost load-balancing.
    However, the bandwidth value encapsulated by the extended community attribute
    is of the floating-point type, which is inconvenient to use. In this document,
    a set of new types of link bandwidth extended community are introduced to facilitate
    the configuration and calculation of link bandwidth.</p>"
