abstract:
- content: "<p>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
    supporting multiple types of authentication methods. In the most common deployment
    scenario, a peer and server authenticate each other through an authenticator;
    the server sends the master session key (MSK) to the authenticator so that the
    peer and the authenticator can establish a security association for per-packet
    access enforcement. It is desirable to not repeat the entire process of authentication
    when the peer moves to another authenticator. This document specifies extensions
    to EAP keying hierarchy and an EAP method- independent protocol to facilitate
    such efficient Re-authentication between the peer and the server through an authenticator.</p>"
