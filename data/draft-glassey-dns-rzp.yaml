abstract:
- content: "<p>The changing structure and size of today's Internet has taxed the existing
    name services and their architecture to the breaking point. The DNS system of
    today was unfortunately architected to have a single root zone and limited set
    of Top Level Domains. This is defined usually in the set of root servers any resolving
    request uses to lookup an address. This proposal then is an attempt to lessen
    the impact on end-users and registrars and to allow IP owners a greater freedom
    in representing namespace to their customers. The elevator description is that
    this I-D proposes the restructuring of domain names more fully along the lines
    of a telephone number by creating a ROOT ZONE PROTOCOL as an addition to multiply
    the existing DNS services times the number of ROOT ZONES.</p>"
