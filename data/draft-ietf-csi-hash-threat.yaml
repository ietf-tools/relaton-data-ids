abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes the use of hashes in Secure Neighbor Discovery
    (SEND), the possible threats to these hashes and the impact of recent attacks
    on hash functions used by SEND. The SEND specification currently uses the SHA-1
    hash algorithm and PKIX certificates and does not provide support for hash algorithm
    agility. This document provides an analysis of possible threats to the hash algorithms
    used in SEND. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
