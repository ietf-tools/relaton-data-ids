abstract:
- content: "<p>ENUM possesses the feature of E.164 number authenticity, therefore
    by being carried with initiation signal of application services, ENUM number can
    be used to identify originer. The service initiation signal includes sender's
    (originer's) un- encrypted ENUM number and encrypted ENUM number, or some other
    information needed by specific applications, then receiver decrypts encrypted
    ENUM number and compares decrypted result with the un- encrypted ENUM number to
    authenticate the originer's identity.</p>"
