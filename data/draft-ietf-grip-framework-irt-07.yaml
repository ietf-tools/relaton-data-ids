abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to express the general Internet community's
    expectations of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). It is not
    possible to define a set of requirements that would be appropriate for all teams,
    but it is possible and helpful to list and describe the general set of topics
    and issues which are of concern and interest to constituent communities. CSIRT
    constituents have a legitimate need and right to fully understand the policies
    and procedures of 'their' Computer Security Incident Response Team. One way to
    support this understanding is to supply detailed information which users may consider,
    in the form of a formal template completed by the CSIRT. An outline of such a
    template and a filled in example are provided.</p>"
