abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Mobility Basic Support Protocol (NEMO BS) is the protocol proposed
    for the mobility management of mobile networks. However, NEMO BS cannot deal with
    the problem of pinball routing in the nested mobile network. And the related solutions
    are not yet considered and discussed in the IETF. MANEMO (MANET for NEMO) is designed
    to solve this problem. This article puts forward a novel MANEMO route optimization
    solution to solve the pinball routing in nested NEMO.</p>"
