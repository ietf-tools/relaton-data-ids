abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and tunneling
    paradigms where a source node can choose a path without relying on hop-by-hop
    signaling. The same mechanism can also be utilized for Service Function Chaining
    (SFC) to steer packets through service functions performing specific services
    such as DPI, Firewall, accounting etc. This document specifies extensions to the
    Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute
    and instantiate SR-TE paths that have service functions (SF) (or service segments)
    involved.</p>"
