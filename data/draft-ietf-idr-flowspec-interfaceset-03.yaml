abstract:
- content: <p>BGP flowspec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules. The primary application of this extension
    is DDoS mitigation where the flowspec rules are applied in most cases to all peering
    routers of the network. This document will present another use case of BGP flowspec
    where flow specifications are used to maintain some access control lists at network
    boundary. BGP flowspec is a very efficient distributing machinery that can help
    in saving OPEX while deploying/updating ACLs. This new application requires flow
    specification rules to be applied only on a specific subset of interfaces and
    in a specific direction. The current specification of BGP flowspec ([RFC5575])
    introduces the notion of flow specification (which describes the matching criterion)
    and traffic filtering actions. The flow specification is encoded as part of the
    NLRI while the traffic filtering actions are encoded as extended communities.
    The combination of a flow specification and one or more actions is known as a
    flow specification rule. [RFC5575] does not detail where the flow specification
    rules need to be applied. Besides the flow specification and traffic filtering
    actions, this document introduces the notion of traffic filtering scope in order
    to drive where a particular rule must be applied. In particular, this document
    introduces the "interface-set" traffic filtering scope that could be used in parallel
    of traffic filtering actions (marking, rate-limiting ...). The purpose of this
    extension is to inform remote routers about groups of interfaces where the rule
    must be applied. This extension can also be used in a DDoS mitigation context
    where a provider wants to apply the filtering only on specific peers.</p>
