- content: "<p>In this draft, we made gap analysis with some exisitng IETF work that
    could be related to State Migration. First of all, a short description of general
    state migration requirements is listed, and then we presents a brief survey of
    MIDCOM, PCP and Forces. The goal of this draft is to figure out whether there
