abstract:
- content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,
    PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm.
    If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally disconnected from the core,
    it is desirable for a core router "P" carrying traffic to the failed edge router
    PEi to immediately restore traffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled
    to PEi and destined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers that advertised
    P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it is highly desirable to keep
    the core BGP-free while not imposing restrictions on external connectivity. Thus
    (1) a core router should not be required to learn any BGP prefix, (2) the size
    of the forwarding and routing tables in the core routers should be independent
    of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) there should be no special router (or group
    of routers) that handles restoring traffic or the need for one router to store
    the forwarding table of another router, (4) re-routing traffic without waiting
    for re-convergence must not cause loops, and (4) there should be no restrictions
    on what edge routers advertise what prefixes. For labeled prefixes, (6) the repairing
    core router must swap the label stack advertised by the failed edge router PEi
    for the prefix P/m with the label stack advertised for the same prefix by the
    edge router PEj before re- tunneling the packet to PEj</p>
