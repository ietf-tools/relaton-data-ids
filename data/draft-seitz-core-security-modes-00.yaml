abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoAP draft defines how to use DTLS as security mechanism. In order
    to establish which nodes are trusted to initiate a DTLS session with a device,
    the following security modes are defined: NoSec, PreSharedKey, RawPublicKey, and
    Certificate. These modes require either to provision a list of keys of trusted
    clients, or to handle heavyweight certificates. This memo proposes two intermediate
    security modes involving a trusted third party that are very similar to PreSharedKey
    and RawPublicKey respectively, but which do not require out-of-band provisioning
    of client keys to the device.</p>"
