abstract:
- content: "<p>A transport network is a lower-layer network designed to provide connectivity
    services for a higher-layer network to carry the traffic opaquely across the lower-layer
    network resources. A transport network may be constructed from equipment utilizing
    any of a number of different transport technologies such as the optical transport
    infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
    (SDH) and Optical Transport Network (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by
    the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS- TP). All transport networks have high benchmarks
    for reliability and operational simplicity. This suggests a common, technology-
    independent management/control paradigm that can be extended to represent and
    configure specific technology attributes. This document describes the high-level
    requirements facing transport networks in order to provide open interfaces for
    resource programmability and control/management automation. Furtheremore, gap
    analysis against existing models are also provided so that it can used as the
    guidance to separate efforts/drafts proposing new models or augmentation models
    based on existing models.</p>"
