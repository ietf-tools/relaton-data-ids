abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies extensions to the Entity Attestation Token
    (EAT) [RFC9248] to support robust, interoperable attestation of capabilities in
    agentic AI systems. These extensions introduce new claims and guidance for securely
    asserting agent functional, reasoning, and operational capabilities, as well as
    their compositional structure and policy constraints. The goal is to enable trustworthy,
    verifiable, and privacy-respecting capability attestation for autonomous agents
    in dynamic, decentralized environments.</p>"
