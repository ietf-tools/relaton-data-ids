abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of carrier-side stateless solution requires some particular
    considerations in mobile network contexts. The widely existed legacy network restricts
    the development of IP address provisioning based on DHCP-PD. The memo provided
    several potential approaches to facilitate the issues and provide the possibilities
    leveraging 3GPP mechanism. The stateless algorithm is required to be updated depending
    to the preferred solution accordingly.</p>"
