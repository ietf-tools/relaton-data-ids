abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies DIS options that enrich the potential behavior
    of the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) specified in [I-D.ietf-roll-rpl].
    The goal is to enable new leaf nodes to quickly discover and attach to the routing
    structure, without having to wait for spontaneous DIO transmissions by neighbour
    routers and without causing them to reset their DIO timers.</p>"
