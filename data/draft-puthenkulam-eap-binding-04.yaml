abstract:
- content: "<p>There are several motivations for using compound authentication methods
    using tunnels, but man-in-the-middle attacks have been found in these protocols
    under certain circumstances. They occur when the inner methods used inside a tunnel
    method are also used outside it, without cryptographically binding the methods
    together. At the time of writing this document, several protocols being proposed
    within the IETF were vulnerable to these attacks, including IKE with XAUTH, PIC,
    PANA over TLS, EAP TTLS and PEAP. This document studies the problems and suggests
    potential solutions to mitigate them. We also provide a reference solution for
    an EAP tunneling protocol like PEAP.</p>"
