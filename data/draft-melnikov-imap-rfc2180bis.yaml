abstract:
- content: "<p>IMAP4[IMAP4] is rich client/server protocol that allows a client to
    access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. Within the protocol
    framework, it is possible to have differing results for particular client/server
    interactions. If a protocol does not allow for this, it is often unduly restrictive.</p>"
