abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establish
    shared protection LSP tunnels. The method presented enables the set up and reservation
    of resources of protection LSPs while sharing the network protection bandwidth.
    The described use of RSVP allows the protection LSP to be established without
    changes to a pre-existing OSPF-TE protocol. Of course, A 'TE' routing protocol
    is not required, but would be desirable as it would reduce the number of crank-backs.
    In the companion draft [Shared- OSPF-TE], extensions to OSPF/OSPF-TE are presented
    that enable further optimized operations to support efficient sharing of protection
    bandwidth.</p>"
