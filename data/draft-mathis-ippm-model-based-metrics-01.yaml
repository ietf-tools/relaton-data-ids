abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine
    if a long path can meet predefined end-to-end application performance targets.
    This is done by section-by-section testing -- by applying a suite of single property
    tests to successive sections of a long path. In many cases these single property
    tests are based on existing IPPM metrics, with the addition of success and validity
    criteria. The sub-path at a time tests are designed to facilitate IP providers
    eliminating all known conditions that might prevent the full end-to- end path
    from meeting the users target performance. This approach makes it possible to
    to determine the IP performance requirements needed to support the desired end-to-end
    TCP performance. The IP metrics are based on traffic patterns that mimic TCP but
    are precomputed independently of the actual behavior of TCP over the sub-path
    under test. This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating nearly all of the
    difficulties encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics, which rely on
    congestion control equilibrium behavior. A natural consequence of this methodology
    is verifiable network measurement: measurements from any given vantage point are
    repeatable from other vantage points.</p>"
