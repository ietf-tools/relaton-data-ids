abstract:
- content: "<p>The H.323 standard defined by the International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU) describes 'Visual telephone systems and equipment for local area networks
    which provide a non-guaranteed quality of service', that is to say, video conferencing
    over Local Area Networks and the Internet. Although it has been generally accepted
    that H.323 is an appropriate standard for audio/video telephony on the Internet,
    it is a complex standard. It describes a broad and complex set of capabilities,
    including interoperation with other types of video conferencing systems, and contains
    references to a number of other ITU standards. This document describes the parts
    of the standard that are necessary for Internet telephony and multipoint conferencing.
    It describes the messages that are necessary to work with other H.323 implementations.
    In a separate section, it also lists the messages that must be implemented to
    be H.323 compliant. This document is a guide to make the standard more accessible.
    It is not intended to duplicate information in the standard. It does not contain
    specifications of the messages or details of the protocol.</p>"
