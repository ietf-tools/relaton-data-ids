abstract:
- content: "<p>Router reported packet loss is the primary signal of when a network
    is not doing its job. Some packet loss is normal or intended in TCP/ IP networks,
    however. To minimise network packet loss through automated network operations
    we need clear and accurate signals of all packets which are dropped and why. This
    document describes our experience from implementing a packet loss classification
    scheme to provide these signals and enable automated network mitigation of unintended
    packet loss.</p>"
