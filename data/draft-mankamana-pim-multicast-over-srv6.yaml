abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents solutions for deploying multicast in SRv6 networks.
    It explores the use of the native IPv6 multicast data plane for multicast distribution.
    The document discusses distributed control plane mechanisms, including PIM, and
    its integration with IGP Flex-Algo to optimize multicast delivery. The document
    also addresses overlay multicast solutions for both the Global Table Multicast
    (GTM) and Multicast VPNs (MVPNs), utilizing IP-in- IPv6 encapsulation without
    requiring additional shim layers.</p>"
