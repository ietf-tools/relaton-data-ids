abstract:
- content: "<p>When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks it has to be
    reauthenticated. If the home network has multiple AAA servers the reauthentication
    request may not be received by the same AAAH as previous authentication requests.
    In order for the new AAAH to be able to forward the request to the correct HA
    it has to know the identity of the HA. This document defines an extension that
    enables the HA to pass its identity to the mobile node which can in turn pass
    it to the AAA server when changing point of attachment. This document specifies
    a NAI extension that can carry these NAIs.</p>"
