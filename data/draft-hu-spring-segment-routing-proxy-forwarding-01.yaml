abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) supports the creation of
    explicit paths using segment lists containing adjacency-sids, node- sids, anycast-sids,
    and binding-sids. When the segment list defining an SR-TE path contains a node-sid,
    and the node fails, the network may no longer be able to properly forward traffic
    on that SR-TE path. [I-D.bashandy-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] and [I-D.hegde-spring-node-protection-for-sr-te-paths]
    describe a mechanism that allows local repair actions on the direct neighbors
    of the failed node to temporarily route traffic to the node immediately following
    the failed node on the SR-TE path segment list. However, once the IGP shortest
    paths have converged, the local repair mechanism is no longer sufficient to continue
    forwarding traffic using the original segment list of the SR-TE path, since the
    non- neighbors of the failed node will no longer have a route to reach the failed
    node. This document describes a mechanism that allows traffic to continue to be
    forwarded on an SR-TE path for an extended period of time after the failure of
    a node used in the path's segment list.</p>"
