abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides a number of extensions to the Hierarchical MIPv4
    model in [1] as well as a new Hierarchical MIPv6 model. A number of additions
    are made to Regional Tunnel Management in terms of Fast Handoffs and the avoidance
    of triangle routing within the hierarchical domain. A few extensions were also
    made for MIPv6 and neighbour discovery to allow for the introduction of a hierarchical
    MIPv6 mobility management model. The proposed hierarchical mobility management
    for MIPv6 will improve the performance of MIPv6 in terms of handoff speed and
    is well-suited to implement access control and handoffs between different access
    technologies.</p>"
