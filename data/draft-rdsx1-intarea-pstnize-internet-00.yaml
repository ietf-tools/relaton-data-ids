abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses the features and functions that the Internet must
    support in order to be as robust and trustworthy as the public switched telephone
    network (PSTN, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Public_switched_telephone_network).
    In general the PSTN-like features and functions include verifiable addressing
    and numbering, higher privacy and security, increased reliability (no more than
    around five minutes of unplanned outage over one year time period), survivability
    and resiliency, desirable level of scalability, alarms, correlation, and diagnosis
    capability, and local/international level of accountability. Incorporation of
    these (or similar) features are expected to harden the Internet. The topics related
    to Internet hardening were discussed during IETF88 technical plenary (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/technical-
    plenary.html) in Vancouver, BC, Canada in Nov. 2013. A follow-up joint W3C/IAB
    workshop on strengthening the Internet against pervasive monitoring (STRINT, https://www.w3.org/2014/strint)
    was held before IETF89 meeting in London, UK. During the IETF90 Technical Plenary
    Session (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/minutes/minutes-90-iab- techplenary)
    on Monday, 21 July 2014 in Toronto, Canada the Technical Topic discussion focused
    on Network topology and geography. The presentations revealed that for business
    relationship and/or policy reasons, local traffic routinely cross national borders
    for so called 'efficient' routing, thereby facilitating monitoring, copying, and
    surveillance of traffic from users' sessions by both authorized and unauthorized
    entities. All of the technical presentations are available at the website of IETF90
    proceedings(http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/slides/slides-90-iab- techplenary-9.pdf).
    In this draft, we discuss the requirements for PSTNization of Internet interfaces,
    protocols, services, and management and configuration capabilities. NOTE: We are
    looking for additional contributors to update the contents of Section 2 to Section
    6. If you are interested, please send an email to draft-rdsx1-intarea-pstnize-internet@tools.ietf.org
    with the relevant Section Number and Section Title in the Subject line of your
    email with an estimated completion time.</p>"
