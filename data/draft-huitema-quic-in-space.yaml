abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the challenges of running the QUIC transport
    over deep space links, where delays are in order of minutes and communications
    are based on scheduled time windows. Using the experience of various testbeds,
    it provides guidance to implementations to support this use case. This document
    may apply to other use cases that have similar characteristics, such as IoT in
    disconnected and distant settings.</p>"
