abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes and discusses the textual encodings of the
    Public-Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX), Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS),
    and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). The textual encodings are well-known,
    are implemented by several applications and libraries, and are widely deployed.
    This document articulates the de facto rules by which existing implementations
    operate and defines them so that future implementations can interoperate.</p>"
