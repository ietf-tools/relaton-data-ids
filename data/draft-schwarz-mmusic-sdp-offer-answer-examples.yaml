abstract:
- content: <p>This document gives examples of Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer
    exchanges. The SDP offer/answer protocol was revised by [SDPCapNeg] and [MediaCapNeg]
    plus other extensions. Examples include the indication, negotiation and selection
    of media configurations ("codecs"). This document discusses primarily examples
    of IP bearer emulation scenarios for PSTN modem calls in SIP- controlled VoIP
    networks. Further may be highlighted the examples like for instance "autonomous
    state transitioning between Audio VoIP and T.38 FoIP" or "G.725 terminal emulation".
    The purpose of this document is thus the same as the list of examples by RFC 4317
    [2] for the legacy SDP offer/answer protocol (RFC 3264 [1]).</p>
