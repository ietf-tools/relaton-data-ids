abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISAKMP/Oakley document [HC97] describes a proposed standard for
    using the Oakley Key Exchange Protocol in conjunction with ISAKMP to obtain authenticated
    and secret keying material for use with ISAKMP, and for other security associations
    such as AH and ESP for the IETF IPsec DOI. The public-key encryption method of
    carrying out Phase 1 of the key exchange in the ISAKMP/Oakley document provides
    significant security advantages over the other alternatives and should be the
    method of choice in many implementations. Unfortunately, as currently described
    in [HC97] the method requires two public key encryption and decryption operations
    from both the Initiator and the Responder. The present document describes a small
    modification to this method. The resulting scheme requires only one public key
    encryption and decryption operation from each party, while maintaining (and even
    improving on) the strong security properties of the ISAKMP/Oakley public-key encryption
    mode. Remark: This document is NOT self-contained, it is intended as an addendum
    to the authentication methods defined in [HC97]. In particular, it uses notation
    and definitions of [HC97]. Thus, it is best read in conjunction with [HC97].</p>"
