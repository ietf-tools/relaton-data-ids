abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with the unpredictable
    disruption problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since Licklider
    Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] provides retransmission-based reliability
    for bundles, several times of retransmissions can be seen as a failure occurred
    over links. The proposed mechanism is used to direct the following packets to
    other nodes and probes the availability of the links which has disrupted unexpectedly.</p>"
