- content: "<p>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as an IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
    mechanism to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication. This method
    can be efficiently implemented in hardware for speeds of 10 gigabits per second
    and above, and is also well-suited to software implementations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
