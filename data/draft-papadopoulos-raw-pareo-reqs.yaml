abstract:
- content: "<p>The Packet Replication and Elimination (PRE) mechanism duplicates data
    packets into several paths in the network to increase reliability and provide
    low jitter. PRE may be used to complement layer-2 Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)
    and receiver-end Ordering to form the PAREO functions. Over a wireless medium,
    this technique can take advantage of communication Overhearing, when parallel
    transmissions over two adjacent paths are scheduled. This document presents the
    concept and details the required changes to the current specifications that will
    be necessary to enable the PAREO functions.</p>"
