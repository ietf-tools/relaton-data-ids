abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the terminology and gives a network model for
    different strategies concerning Voiceband Data (VBD) transport services. The purpose
    of this effort is to set the reference space for describing and evaluating Megaco/H.248
    signaling procedures. Primary scope are voiceband data services, typically inherent
    part in voice-over-packet networks (e.g., like Internet Telephony). Motivation:
    VBD calls typically start out as a voice call. The modems on the VBD devices at
    the Termination detect the switch to VBD (like facsimile) and fax modem or data
    modem transmission begins. With the development of Voice over IP, many CODECs
    have been developed which are optimized for the transmission and reception of
    voice. In creating these CODECs, VBD transport may not reliably be used over the
    same transmission channel. In an effort to optimize the transmission of VBD, specialized
    protocols (e.g., T.38, or V.150) have been developed to provide a more reliable
    transport, minimize bandwidth usage, etc.</p>"
