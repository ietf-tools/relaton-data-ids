abstract:
- content: "<p>BFD mechanism [BFD] was original designed to detect failures in communication
    with a forwarding plane next hop. BFD operates on top of any data protocol being
    forwarded between two systems. This document describes how to use the BFD mechanism
    for detecting the MPLS FEC mismatch. The proposal is based on the FEC mismatch
    mechanism of ITU-T Y.1713. The proposed solution covers the mpls network when
    use BFD as the fault detection mechanism.</p>"
