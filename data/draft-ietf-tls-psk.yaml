abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies three sets of new ciphersuites for the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support authentication based on pre-shared keys
    (PSKs). These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys, shared in advance among the
    communicating parties. The first set of ciphersuites uses only symmetric key operations
    for authentication. The second set uses a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated
    with a pre-shared key, and the third set combines public key authentication of
    the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
