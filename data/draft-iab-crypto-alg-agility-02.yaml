abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IETF protocols use cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality,
    integrity, or non-repudiation. Communicating peers must support the same set of
    cryptographic algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly. This memo provides
    guidelines to ensure that protocols have the ability to migrate from one algorithm
    suite to another over time.</p>"
