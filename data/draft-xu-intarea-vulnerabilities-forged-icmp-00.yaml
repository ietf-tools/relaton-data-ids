abstract:
- content: "<p>ICMP error messages are vital for network reliability, providing feedback
    on issues such as unreachable hosts or fragmentation requirements. They help devices
    adapt dynamically, support troubleshooting, and enable essential functions like
    Path MTU Discovery. However, off-path attackers on the Internet may forge ICMP
    error messages to bypass legitimate validation mechanisms, causing the victim's
    TCP/IP stack to misinterpret network conditions and exposing critical vulnerabilities.
    This document analyzes how such forged ICMP errors can be exploited by off-path
    attackers to induce cross-layer interactions within the victim's TCP/IP stack,
    leading to four classes of vulnerabilities: information leakage, desynchronization
    of shared variables, semantic gaps, and identity deception. These ICMP-based attacks
    allow off-path attackers to manipulate network traffic, disrupt communication
    flows, and compromise both infrastructure and user privacy, without being on the
    direct communication path. The document concludes with proposed countermeasures
    and recommendations for protocol evolution.</p>"
