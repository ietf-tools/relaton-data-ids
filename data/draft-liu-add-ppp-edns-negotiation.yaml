abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extensions to the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
    Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP) for negotiating encrypted DNS resolver
    configurations. These extensions allow PPP peers to exchange information about
    encrypted DNS servers supporting protocols such as DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over
    HTTPS (DoH), and DNS over QUIC (DoQ). The design maintains backward compatibility
    with RFC 1877 while addressing modern security requirements.</p>"
