abstract:
- content: "<p>The operational impact of deploying real-time service support into
    the internet may be greater even than the impact of deploying of novel routing
    and addressing features. First, introduction of diverse service qualities may
    alter usage patterns in ways that are inconsistent with current provisioning.
    Second, the initial deployment required to reap the benefits of multi-service
    internetworking is broader than that required to meet current routing and addressing
    challenges, for while benefits of enhanced routing and addressing paradigms may
    require only incremental deployments coupled with tunneling or encapsulation strategies,
    advances in real-time service quality accrue only along paths where the relevant
    technology is deployed end-to-end.</p>"
