abstract:
- content: "<p>In IP access networks that support host mobility, the routing paths
    between the host and the network may change frequently and rapidly. In some cases,
    the host may establish certain routing-related services on subnets that are left
    behind when the host moves. Examples of such services are AAA, header compression,
    and QoS. In order for the host to obtain those services on the new subnet, the
    host must explicitly re-establish the service by performing the necessary signaling
    flows from scratch. In some cases, this process would considerably slow the process
    of establishing the mobile host on the new subnet. An alternative is to transfer
    information on the existing state associated with these services, or context,
    to the new subnet, a process called 'context transfer'. This document discusses
    the desirability of context transfer for facilitating seamless IP mobility.</p>"
