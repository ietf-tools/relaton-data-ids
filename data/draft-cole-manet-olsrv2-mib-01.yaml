abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring and managing aspects of the Optimized Link
    State Routing protocol version 2. The Optimized Link State Routing MIB also reports
    state information, performance metrics, and notifications. In addition to configuration,
    this additional state and performance information is useful to management stations
    troubleshooting Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks routing problems.</p>"
