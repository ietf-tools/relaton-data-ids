abstract:
- content: "<p>This is the Workshop Report for the IETF Administrative Support Activity
    2.0 (IASA 2.0) Virtual Workshops, held on 28 February 2017 at 1100 UT and 1600
    UT. The original IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was created ten years
    ago, and since has been subject to some reflection. In the intervening years,
    there has been considerable change in the necessary tasks of IETF administration
    and in the world around the IETF, and in how the IETF raises funds and finances
    its work. The IASA 2.0 process seeks to address which administrative arrangements
    will best support the IETF going forward.</p>"
