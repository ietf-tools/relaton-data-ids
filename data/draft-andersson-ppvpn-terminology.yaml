abstract:
- content: "<p>The provider provisioned VPN solutions has attracted a great deal of
    interest. Memos proposing different and overlapping solution have been discussed
    on the PPVPN mailing list and in the Working Group meetings. This has lead to
    a development of a partly new set of concepts used to describe the set of VPN
    services. To a certain extent there are more than one term covering the same concept
    and sometimes the same term covers more than on concept. The terminology needs
    to be made clearer and more intuitive. This document seeks to fill at least part
    of that need.</p>"
