abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobility management signaling of PMIPv6 includes PBU/PBA message.
    Both messages use the IPv6 mobility header, which is an expansion of IPv6 header,
    to carry signaling information. The transport protocol has not been used, which
    can not guarantee the reliability of transmission. This draft proposes to extend
    PMIP to make it has transport protocol support and negotiation mechanism. The
    advantage of this extension is that transport protocol can provide more reliable
    transportation especially in the scenario that MAG and LMA are connected by a
    congested IP network.</p>"
