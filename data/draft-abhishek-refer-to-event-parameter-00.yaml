abstract:
- content: '<p>This document extends the REFER method, defined in RFC 3515, to convey
    feature parameters defined in RFC 3840. Terminology In this document, the key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described
    in RFC 2119 [1]. To simplify discussions of the REFER method and its extensions,
    three new terms are used throughout the document: - REFER-Issuer: the UA issuing
    the REFER request - REFER-Recipient: the UA receiving the REFER request - REFER-Target:
    the UA designated in the Refer-To URI Introduction This document extends the SIP
    REFER method defined in RFC 3515 to be used with feature parameters defined in
    RFC 3840. Feature tags are used by a UA to convey to another UA information about
    capabilities and features. This information can be shared by a UA using a number
    of mechanisms, including OPTIONS responses. Feature tag information can be very
    useful to another UA. It is especially useful prior to the establishment of a
    subscription, triggered only through REFER method. This is valid only for the
    request containing parameter "method=SUBSCRIBE" in Refer-To header. While sending
    this request if there is no mechanism to indicate as to which event is to be subscribed,
    the REFER-Recipient may send SUBSCRIBE with an undesired event. For example, if
    a REFER-Issuer knows (through an OPTIONS query, for example) that the remote REFER-Target
    supports events like dialog the REFER-Recipient might subscribe with dialog or
    any other event as specified. This extension to the REFER method provides a mechanism
    by which the REFER-Issuer can provide this useful information about the REFER-Target
    capabilities and functionality to the REFER-Recipient by including feature tags
    in the Refer-To header field in a REFER request. Examples</p>'
