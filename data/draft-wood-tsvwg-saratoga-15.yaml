abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Saratoga transfer protocol. Saratoga was
    originally developed to transfer remote-sensing imagery efficiently from a low-Earth-orbiting
    satellite constellation, but is useful for many other scenarios, including ad-hoc
    peer-to-peer communications, delay-tolerant networking, and grid computing. Saratoga
    is a simple, lightweight, content dissemination protocol that builds on UDP, and
    optionally uses UDP-Lite. Saratoga is intended for use when moving files or streaming
    data between peers which may have permanent, sporadic or intermittent connectivity,
    and is capable of transferring very large amounts of data reliably under adverse
    conditions. The Saratoga protocol is designed to cope with highly asymmetric link
    or path capacity between peers, and can support fully-unidirectional data transfer
    if required. Saratoga can also cope with very large files for exascale computing.
    In scenarios with dedicated links, Saratoga focuses on high link utilization to
    make the most of limited connectivity times, while standard congestion control
    mechanisms can be implemented for operation over shared links. Loss recovery is
    implemented via a simple negative-ack ARQ mechanism. The protocol specified in
    this document is considered to be appropriate for experimental use on private
    IP networks.</p>"
