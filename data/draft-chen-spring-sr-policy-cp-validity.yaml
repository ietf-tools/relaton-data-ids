abstract:
- content: "<p>SR Policy architecture are specified in [RFC9256]. An SR Policy comprises
    one or more candidate paths (CP) of which at a given time one and only one may
    be active (i.e., installed in forwarding and usable for steering of traffic).
    Each CP in turn may have one or more SID-List of which one or more may be active;
    when multiple SID- List are active then traffic is load balanced over them. However,
    a candidate path is valid when at least one SID-List is active. This candidate
    path validity criterion cannot meet the needs of some scenarios. This document
    defines the new candidate path validity criterion.</p>"
