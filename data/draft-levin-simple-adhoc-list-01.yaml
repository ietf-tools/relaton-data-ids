abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing to a homogeneous list
    of resources. Instead of the subscriber sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource
    individually, the subscriber can define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to
    it, and maintain it – all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state
    of the resources are reported using the same dialog in any standard SIMPLE format
    for conveying notifications for lists of resources or individual resources and
    agreed during the SUBSCRIBE dialog establishment.</p>"
