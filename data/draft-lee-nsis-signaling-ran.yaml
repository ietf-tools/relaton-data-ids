abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF NSIS WG is standardizing IP signaling protocols with QoS signaling
    as the first use case. It is desirable to consider QoS signaling procedures for
    resource reservations in an IP-based RAN where mobide nodes undergo frequent handoffs.
    In this draft, we describe general QoS signaling procedures for an IP-based RAN,
    which are based on the analysis of the existing QoS signaling solutions in mobile
    wireless networks. We also present a specific QoS signaling scheme based on the
    proposed general signaling procedures.</p>"
