abstract:
- content: "<p>TLS 1.2 is in widespread use and can be configured such that it provides
    good security properties. TLS 1.3 is also in widespread use and fixes some known
    deficiencies with TLS 1.2, such as removing error-prone cryptographic primitives
    and encrypting more of the traffic so that it is not readable by outsiders. Since
    TLS 1.3 use is widespread, new protocols must require and assume its existence.
    This prescription does not pertain to DTLS (in any DTLS version); it pertains
    to TLS only.</p>"
