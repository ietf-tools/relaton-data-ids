abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) that
    was developed jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications, and Speechworks,
    Inc. It is published as an RFC as input for further IETF development in this area.
    MRCP controls media service resources like speech synthesizers, recognizers, signal
    generators, signal detectors, fax servers, etc., over a network. This protocol
    is designed to work with streaming protocols like RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol)
    or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), which help establish control connections
    to external media streaming devices, and media delivery mechanisms like RTP (Real
    Time Protocol). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
