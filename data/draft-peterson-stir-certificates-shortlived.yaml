abstract:
- content: "<p>When certificates are used as credentials to attest the assignment
    of ownership of telephone numbers, some mechanism is required to provide certificate
    freshness. This document specifies short-lived certificates as a means of guaranteeing
    certificate freshness for secure telephone identity (STIR), in particular relying
    on the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) to allow signers to
    acquire certifcates as needed.</p>"
