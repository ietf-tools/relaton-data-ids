abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP State Management Cookies are used for a wide variety of tasks on
    the Internet, from preference handling to user identification. An important privacy
    and security feature of cookies is that their information can only be sent to
    a servers in a limited namespace, the domain. The variation of domain structures
    that are in use by domain name registries, especially the country code Top Level
    Domains (ccTLD) namespaces, makes it difficult to determine what is a valid domain,
    e.g. example.co.uk and example.no, which cookies should be permitted for, and
    a registry-like domain (subTLDs) like co.uk where cookies should not be permitted.
    This document specifies an imperfect method using DNS name lookups for cookie
    domains to determine if cookies can be permitted for that domain, based on the
    assumption that most subTLD domains will not have an IP address assigned to them,
    while most legitimate services that share cookies among multiple servers will
    have an IP address for their domain name to make the user's navigation easier
    by omitting the customary "www" prefix.</p>
