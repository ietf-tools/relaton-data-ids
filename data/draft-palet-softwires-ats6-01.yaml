abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents the basis for a procedure that enables a host
    or router to automatically setup an IPvX in IPvY tunnel. Basically, the document
    considers several scenarios, from the most common today "dominant IPv4" networks
    to new "dominant IPv6" networks, which can even support the use of multicast.
    A basic requirement is that the host or router is a dual stack node and it will
    have either native IPv4-only access (dominant IPv4 network) or native IPv6-only
    access (dominant IPv6 network). Consequently, either IPv6 will be transported
    in the existing IPv4- only infrastructure, or IPv4 will be transported in the
    existing IPv6-only infrastructure. Other combinations are possible, such as IPv6
    in IPv6 (for example to support IPv6 multicast in an IPv6- unicast-only infrastructure).
    The procedure follows the work from [1], [2], [3], [4] and mainly [5], trying
    to be compliant with the requirements enumerated in those documents.</p>
