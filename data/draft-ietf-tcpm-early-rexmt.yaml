abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a new mechanism for TCP and Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) that can be used to recover lost segments when a connection's
    congestion window is small. The "Early Retransmit" mechanism allows the transport
    to reduce, in certain special circumstances, the number of duplicate acknowledgments
    required to trigger a fast retransmission. This allows the transport to use fast
    retransmit to recover segment losses that would otherwise require a lengthy retransmission
    timeout. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
