abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for
    IPv4 and IPv6. It is version three (3) of the protocol and it is based on VRRP
    (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and on draft-ieft-vrrp-ipv6-spec-08.txt.
    VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for
    a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP router controlling
    the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master,
    and forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. VRRP Master routers
    are configured with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses and VRRP Backup routers infer
    the address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on the transport
    protocol. Within a VRRP router the virtual routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6
    address families are a domain unto themselves and do not overlap. The election
    process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding responsibility should the
    Master become unavailable. For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a
    higher availability default path without requiring configuration of dynamic routing
    or router discovery protocols on every end-host. For IPv6, the advantage gained
    from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switch over to back up routers than can
    be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discover (RFC 2461) mechanisms.</p>"
