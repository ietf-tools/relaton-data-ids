abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents MPLS TE Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications
    extending the current concept of preemption with the goal of reducing/eliminating
    traffic disruption of preempted TE LSPs. Under present RSVP-TE signaling methods,
    LSPs are immediately displaced upon preemption. The introduction of a new preemption
    pending flag helps more gracefully mitigate the re-route process of displaced
    LSPs. For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though
    not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect overbooked until the LSP can be
    re-routed. For this reason, the feature is primarily interesting in packet oriented
    MPLS networks with Diffserv and TE capabilities.</p>"
