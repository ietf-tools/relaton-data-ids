abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a bandwidth saving method for exporting flow
    or packet information using the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) protocol. As
    the PSAMP protocol is based on IPFIX, these considerations are valid for PSAMP
    exports as well. This method works by separating information common to several
    flow records from information specific to an individual flow record. Common flow
    information is exported only once in a data record defined by an option template,
    while the rest of the specific flow information is associated with the common
    information via a unique identifier.</p>"
