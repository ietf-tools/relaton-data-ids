abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses policy concepts for management of Quality of
    Services (QoS) of applications in heterogeneous Internet environment. A framework
    is given for definitions of policies for configuration and automated adaptation
    of network resources, application transport parameters and QoS measurement scenarios
    dependent on the capabilities of heterogeneous access networks. Currently, the
    IETF QoS policy work is aimed at "specifying and representing policies that administer,
    manage and control access to network QoS resources" based on DiffServ and IntServ
    technologies [5]. To enhance this model, policies for management of QoS of heterogeneous
    network infrastructures are proposed in this document. Based on the capabilities
    of heterogeneous access networks, the QoS policies for heterogeneous environment
    allow dynamic configuration and adaptation of network resource reservations, application
    transport parameters and QoS measurement scenarios. The policies are defined for
    different actors, such as users, application service providers and network operators.
    The hierarchical policy management is based on rules specifying adaptation of
    parameters of policies of actors with hierarchical relationships.</p>
