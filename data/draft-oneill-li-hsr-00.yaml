abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo overviews the need for intra-domain Host specific routing
    (HSR) in the Internet. Host Specific Routing provides a number of benefits if
    route entry and look-up scalability issues can be adequately addressed. These
    benefits are the enabling of flat routing domains that eliminate the need for
    hierarchy and associated configuration, and the potential to support rapid movement
    of IP addresses through the routing fabric. This draft describes some of the current
    work in this area, including TORA and Wireless Internet Protocol (WIP), and the
    as yet unresolved research issues associated with large-scale host routing. This
    draft requires and makes no topological assumptions for HSR. Specifically it does
    not require a strict tree, as implied by CIP and HAWAII. These micro-mobility
    protocols do however share many of the scalability and inter- protocol issues
    associated with host specific routes.</p>"
