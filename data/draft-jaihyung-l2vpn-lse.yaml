abstract:
- content: "<p>LSE (Label Switched Ethernet) is a label switching technique for transmission
    of Ethernet frame. The method offers not only L2VPN connectivity but it also provides
    features for dynamic connection establishment and resource reservation. LSE does
    not require additional information fields other than 802.3 standard header because
    it uses destination address and source address as labels. As a result, compatibility
    with legacy Ethernet is maintained and it provides label switching service from
    terminal to terminal. Equipments that support LSE are connected via Ethernet tunnel
    merging tree or TLSP (Tunnel LSP) tree across legacy network equipment. User terminals
    establish connections using modified ARP protocol. Use of merging tree structure
    helps reducing signaling overhead as well as improving scalability of LSE network.
    LSE also provides unified mechanism for unicasting, multicasting and wireless
    terminal mobility.</p>"
