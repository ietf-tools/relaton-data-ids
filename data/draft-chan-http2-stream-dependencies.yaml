abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing HTTP/2 prioritization scheme relies purely on integer
    values to indicate priorities. This simple scheme misses critical support for
    priority grouping, and does not support other features like resource ordering.
    This draft proposes using stream dependencies to solve the lack of priority grouping,
    as well as provide other features.</p>"
