abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes actions by or against a CA or independent repository
    manager in the RPKI that can adversely affect the Internet Number Resources (INRs)
    associated with that CA or its subordinate CAs. The analysis is done from the
    perspective of an affected INR holder. The analysis is based on examination of
    the data items in the RPKI repository, as controlled by a CA (or independent repository
    manager) and fetched by Relying Parties (RPs). The analysis does not purport to
    be comprehensive; it does represent an orderly way to analyze a number of ways
    that errors by or attacks against a CA or repository manager can affect the RPKI
    and routing decisions based on RPKI data.</p>"
