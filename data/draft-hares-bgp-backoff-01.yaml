abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mechanisms for methods for damping the oscillations
    of BGP-4 [1] peers by increasing the time between automatic start functions of
    the BGP peers. The increase of time between automatic start functions will be
    denoted as a backoff of the automatic start functions by this draft. This draft
    is an informational RFC which provides a description of mechanisms for back-off
    of the automatic start function in bgp-4 peer reconnections. This Informational
    RFC includes descriptions about the back-off mechanisms and how this information
    is recorded in the BGP-4 MIB version 2 [2]. The expontential back-off mechanism
    contained in this draft was first recorded in a draft of the bgp-4 specification.
    The author requests that anyone with information regarding the original authors
    of that work contact the author. The lack of credit for those authors is based
    on the author's lack of knowledge the originators of the expotential back-off.</p>"
