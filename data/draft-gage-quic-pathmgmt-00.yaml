abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines path management procedures for QUIC that operate
    independently of the connection management procedures defined in RFC9000. The
    path management procedures enable a multipath configuration between endpoints
    by allowing QUIC packets associated with any connection identifier to be transported
    over any of the paths established between the endpoints. As a consequence, the
    principles and operations of RFC9000 are retained regardless of the path used
    to a convey QUIC packet.</p>"
