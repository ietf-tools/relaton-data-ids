abstract:
- content: <p>Distributed computing is a tool that service providers can use to achieve
    better service response time and optimized energy consumption. In such a distributed
    computing environment, providing services by utilizing computing resources hosted
    in various computing facilities aids support of services such as computationally
    intensive and delay sensitive services. Ideally, compute services are balanced
    across servers and network resources to enable higher throughput and lower response
    times. To achieve this, the choice of server and network resources should consider
    metrics that are oriented towards compute capabilities and resources instead of
    simply dispatching the service requests in a static way or optimizing solely on
    connectivity metrics. The process of selecting servers or service instance locations,
    and of directing traffic to them on chosen network resources is called "Computing-Aware
    Traffic Steering" (CATS). This document provides the problem statement and the
    typical scenarios for CATS, which shows the necessity of considering more factors
    when steering traffic to the appropriate computing resource to best meet the customer's
    expectations and deliver the requested service.</p>
