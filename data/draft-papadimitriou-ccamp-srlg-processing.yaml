abstract:
- content: "<p>The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]
    and extended in [CCAMP-SRG] is considered as one of the most important criteria
    concerning the constraint-based path computation of optical channel routes. By
    applying the SRLG disjointness criteria to the constraint-based path computation,
    one can select a route taking into account both resource and logical structure
    disjointness. That implies a lower probability of simultaneous optical channel
    failure. This document describes the various physical and logical resource types
    considered in the SRLG concept. The proposed method focuses on the inference of
    SRLG information between the network physical and logical layers and the logical
    structures representing geographical locations. The main applications of the proposed
    model are related to the Constraint-based Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm
    for optical channel route computation and the aggregation of the SRLG information
    flooded throughout traffic engineering extensions of the IGP routing protocols
    (such as OSPF and IS-IS).</p>"
