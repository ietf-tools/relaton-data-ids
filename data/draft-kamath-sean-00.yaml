abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Simple Extended Area Network (SEAN) architecture
    to offer comprehensive services as part of a Full Service Network (FSN) by service
    providers. The motivation for this document is that today's networks are far too
    complicated to design, deploy and operate, and incurs network overhead and inefficiencies
    that would soon drive up the costs and the rates to consumers. This cost and complexity
    situation is also a barrier to deploy advanced and useful network services that
    offer audio-visual communications. There are technologies like XDSL available
    today that can simplify network implementations and operations and at the same
    time provide the bandwidth and other capabilities that allows migration to a simpler
    network architecture in the future. This document describes the current problems
    that thwart progress and offers a solution based on XDSL technology to overcome
    or avoid unnecessary complexities and limitations. This document does not specify
    an Internet Standard of any kind. It is presented for discussion purpose only.</p>"
