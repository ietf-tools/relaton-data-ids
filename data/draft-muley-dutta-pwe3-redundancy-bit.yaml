abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism for standby status signaling of
    redundant PWs between their termination points. A set of redundant PWs is configured
    between PE nodes in SS-PW applications, or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications.
    In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW path to forward to
    one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate a preferential forwarding
    status of active or standby for each PW in the redundancy set. In addition, a
    second status bit is defined to allow peer PE/T-PE nodes to coordinate a switchover
    operation of the PW/MS-PW path. Conventions used in this document The key words
    "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
    "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in RFC-2119 [1].</p>
