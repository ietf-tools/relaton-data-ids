abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the origination AS validation process, it can be desirable
    to automatically consider the validation state of routes in the BGP decision process.
    The purpose of this document is to provide a specification for doing so. The document
    also defines a new BGP opaque extended community to carry the validation state
    inside an autonomous system to influence the decision process of the IBGP speakers.</p>"
