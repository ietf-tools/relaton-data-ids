abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/2 can be run under TLS as a transport if the origin for the request
    is an https: URL. There is a desire to encrypt much more web traffic than just
    the traffic that is already encrypted with TLS. This document proposes a method
    to establish unauthenticated encryption within normal HTTP/2 flows to prevent
    passive surveillance using as few as zero additional round trips. The method described
    here is definitely less robust than normal TLS and is thus not offered as an alternative
    to TLS for https: URLs; it is only offered as a fast way within HTTP/2 to cause
    unauthenticated encryption.</p>"
