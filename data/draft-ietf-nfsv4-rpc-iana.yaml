abstract:
- content: "<p>Network services based on RPC [RFC1831] use program numbers rather
    than well known transport ports to permit clients to find them, and use authentication
    flavor numbers to define the format of the authentication data passed. The assignment
    of RPC program numbers and authentication flavor numbers is still performed by
    Sun Microsystems, Inc. This is inappropriate for an IETF standard protocol, as
    such work is done well by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This
    document defines how IANA will maintain and assign RPC program numbers and authentication
    flavor numbers.</p>"
