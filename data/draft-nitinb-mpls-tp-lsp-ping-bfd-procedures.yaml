abstract:
- content: "<p>LSP-Ping and BFD for MPLS are existing and widely deployment OAM mechanisms
    for MPLS LSPs. This document describes ACH encapsulation for LSP-Ping, to enable
    use of LSP-Ping when IP addressing is not in use. This document also clarifies
    the use of BFD for MPLS LSPs using ACH encapsulation, when IP addressing may not
    be available and/or it may not be desirable to encapsulate BFD packets in IP.</p>"
