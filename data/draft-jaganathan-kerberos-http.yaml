abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how the Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) and
    Internet Information Services (IIS) incorporated in Microsoft Windows 2000 use
    Kerberos for security enhancements of web transactions. The Hypertext Transport
    Protocol (HTTP) auth-scheme of "negotiate" is defined here; when the negotiation
    results in the selection of Kerberos, the security services of authentication
    and, optionally, impersonation (the IIS server assumes the windows identity of
    the principal that has been authenticated) are performed. This document explains
    how HTTP authentication utilizes the Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation
    mechanism. Details of Simple And Protected Negotiate (SPNEGO) implementation are
    not provided in this document. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
