abstract:
- content: "<p>This document makes recommendations for the use of ECN with retransmitted
    data packets, for an ECN-capable TCP connection. This document supplements RFC
    2481 [RFC2481], which did not address the issue of retransmitted data packets.
    This document recommends that for ECN-capable TCP implementations, the ECT bit
    (ECN-Capable Transport) in the IP header SHOULD NOT be set on retransmitted data
    packets, and that the TCP data receiver SHOULD ignore the ECN field on arriving
    data packets that are outside of the receiver's current window. This is for greater
    security against denial-of-service attacks.</p>"
