abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft offers a proposal for a fragment of the SDP usage rules
    for RTCWEB: Requirements for supporting resolution negotiation. It proposes to
    use SDP both for initial and within-call resolution configuration, and suggests
    that COP should be mentioned as an optional, not mandatory, mechanism.</p>"
