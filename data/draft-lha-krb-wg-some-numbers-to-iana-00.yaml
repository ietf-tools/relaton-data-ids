abstract:
- content: "<p>Kerberos have many registers where only some have been registered,
    this document tries to cover the rest of them. There is a private space but that
    can not be used for implementation in released software. Also private is not avaible
    for all types. This document moves control over the numbers to an IANA number
    registerty.</p>"
