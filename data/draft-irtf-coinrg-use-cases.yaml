abstract:
- content: "<p>Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of deploying
    processing functionality on networking devices, such as switches and network interface
    cards. While such functionality can be beneficial, it has to be carefully placed
    into the context of the general Internet communication and it needs to be clearly
    identified where and how those benefits apply. This document presents some use
    cases to demonstrate how a number of salient COIN-related applications can benefit
    from COIN. It further identifies their essential requirements, using normative
    language to provide a formalized structure for a subsequent analysis. It is a
    product of the Computing in the Network Research Group (COINRG). It is not an
    IETF product and it is not a standard.</p>"
