abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF is an international group that conducts most of its business
    using electronic mail however three times a year it conducts an open meeting for
    one week. For the most part the actual mechanics of the meeting are organised
    by the IETF secretariat but there are some requirements placed on the organisation
    hosting the meeting. This document attempts to provide some guidelines for organisations
    that wish to volunteer to act as host for one of these open meetings. As the IETF
    growth pattern mirrors the Internet itself this document expresses sizes as a
    percentage of the expected attendance rather than use fixed numbers as we expect
    these numbers to change for each meeting. At the last meeting, in Washington DC
    there were just over 1900 attendees.</p>"
