abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for
    group key management to support secure group communications. The GDOI manages
    group security associations, which are used by IPSEC and potentially other data
    security protocols running at the IP or application layers. These security associations
    protect one or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared
    by group members. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
