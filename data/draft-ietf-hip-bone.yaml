abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a framework to build HIP-based (Host Identity
    Protocol) overlay networks. This framework uses HIP to perform connection management.
    Other functions, such as data storage and retrieval or overlay maintenance, are
    implemented using protocols other than HIP. These protocols are loosely referred
    to as "peer protocols". This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>
