abstract:
- content: "<p>All IPv6 nodes must be able to process Routing Header [IPV6] and Home
    Address [MIPV6] Options. With these, packet filter access lists can be tricked
    (among other things) as the destination and source addresses, respectively, are
    being rewritten as the packet traverses the network. Some of the security considerations
    of these features are analyzed, and a few possible solutions presented. It will
    be shown that with the current architecture, the network-based security does not
    seem to scale to the requirements of Mobile IPv6; it seems possible that unless
    security is taken seriously when implementing the nodes, the new Mobile IPv6 requirements
    might not be allowed to be used at all in some circumstances.</p>"
