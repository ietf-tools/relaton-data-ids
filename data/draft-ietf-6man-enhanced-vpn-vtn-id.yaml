abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide different customers with logically
    separated connectivity over a common network infrastructure. With the introduction
    and evolvement of 5G and other network scenarios, some existing or new customers
    may require connectivity services with advanced characteristics comparing to traditional
    VPNs. Such kind of network service is called enhanced VPNs (VPN+). VPN+ can be
    used to deliver IETF network slices, and could also be used for other application
    scenarios. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which
    consists of a set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated from the
    physical underlay network, and is associated with a customized logical network
    topology. VPN+ services can be delivered by mapping one or a group of overlay
    VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as the virtual underlay. In packet forwarding, some
    fields in the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs
    to, so that VTN-specific processing can be performed on each node the packet traverses.
    This document proposes a new Hop-by-Hop option of IPv6 extension header to carry
    the VTN related information in data packets, which could used to identify the
    VTN specific processing to be performed on the packets. The procedure of processing
    the VTN option is also specified.</p>"
