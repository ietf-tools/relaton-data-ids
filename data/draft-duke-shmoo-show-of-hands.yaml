abstract:
- content: "<p>This is the specification for an experimental show of hands tool for
    the Meetecho system to be used in online meetings to help chairs quickly poll
    the meeting. This tool is different from the previous experimental virtual hum
    tool as it addresses a different use case with different functionality. Following
    mixed feedback in the IETF 108 post-meeting survey, the experimental virtual hum
    tool has been withdrawn from the Meetecho client for IETF 109.</p>"
