abstract:
- content: <p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic framework
    supporting multiple types of authentication methods. The EAP Re-authentication
    Protocol (ERP) specifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to support
    an EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authentication between the
    peer and an EAP re-authentication server through any authenticator. Authenticated
    Anticipatory Keying (AAK) is a method by which cryptographic keying material may
    be established prior to handover upon one or more candidate attachment points
    (CAPs), AAK uses the AAA infrastructure for key transport. This document specifies
    the extensions necessary to enable AAK support in ERP. Status of This Memo This
    Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of
