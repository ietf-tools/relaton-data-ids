abstract:
- content: "<p>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanismsare critical
    building blocks in network operations that are used for service assurance, fulfillment,
    or service diagnosis, troubleshooting, and repair. The current practice is that
    many technologies rely on their own OAM protocols that are exclusive to a given
    layer. There is little consolidation of OAM in either data plane or management
    plane nor well-documented inter-layer OAM operations. Vendors and Operators dedicate
    significant resources and effort through the whole OAM life-cycle each time when
    a new technology is (to be) introduced. This is even exacerbated when dealing
    with integration of OAM across multiple technologies. This document describes
    the problem space and defines an architecture for the generic and integrated OAM
    with a focus of multi-layer and cross-layer considerations.</p>"
