abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to enable ID/Locator split in CCN
    protocol. We enable this through the notion of forwarding-label (FL) object, which
    is an optional hop-by-hop payload in the Interest message with locator name which
    identifies a network domain, router, or a host. Depending on the application and
    trust context FL object is subjected to policy based actions by the forwarders
    such as invoking security verification or enabling other service-centric actions
    such as FL object replacement. FL can be inserted by the applications or by the
    network. To enable dynamic name resolution FL can be modified in the network by
    designated points such as the edge routers. Enabling ID/Locator split in CCN has
    several applications such as towards routing optimization, mobility, handling
    indirections in manifests, and routing scalability.</p>"
