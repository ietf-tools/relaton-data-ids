abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an option to the OSPF Version 2 specification which
    allows the partial suppression of flooding between neighboring routers. This suppression
    acts much like a floodgate, opening and closing automatically when triggered by
    the proper conditions. Two types of flooding suppression are described, 1-Way
    and 2-Way. The option applies to standard areas, stub areas, and NSSAs. It works
    over any OSPF interface. Routers with this option configured are backward compatible
    with routers running an OSPFv2 compliant implementation as defined in RFC 2328,
    and can be restricted to a subset of the OSPF routing domain. This option is applied
    only between neighboring OSPF routers.</p>"
