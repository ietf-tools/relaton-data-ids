abstract:
- content: <p>Data compression algorithms benefit from blocks of tuning data called
    "dictionaries". These can greatly improve data compression speed and/or ratios,
    but their use and application has numerous potential security issues of concern
    to the communities using them. This document enumerates security issues known
    about compression dictionaries at the time of publication so that future proposals
    for use of dictionaries can benefit from this collected material.</p>
