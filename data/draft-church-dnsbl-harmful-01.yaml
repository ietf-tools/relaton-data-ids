abstract:
- content: <p>As spam continues to grow throughout the Internet, various countermeasures
    have been developed. Among these is the "DNS blacklist", a DNS server configured
    to return a "good" or "bad" response to a query on a given IP address; mail servers
    can be configured to automatically query such a server and reject messages which
    are flagged "bad". If the blacklist is accurate, this allows mail servers to reject
    spam without wasting the time of the human recipient or the resources of the server.
    However, between delays in responding to environmental changes and arbitrary operational
    decisions by blacklist operators, such blocking of mail in fact causes significant
    harm to innocent third parties. This memo describes the issues concerning these
    blacklists and suggests ways to resolve the attendant problems.</p>
