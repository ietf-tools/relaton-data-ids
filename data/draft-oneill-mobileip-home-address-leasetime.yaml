abstract:
- content: "<p>With the introduction of NAIs for identifying Mobile Nodes, RFC 2794
    also enabled the Home Agents to be able to assign IP addresses to the Mobile Nodes
    during the initial registration. Though the concept of NAI-based home address
    assignment is referenced in both RFC 2794 and RFC 3344, a comprehensive procedure
    for achieving such a NAI-based home address assignment has not been outlined.
    More particularly, the lifetime of the assigned address is undefined and the address
    status when deregistering from the HA, such as when returning to the home network,
    is also undefined. This document first defines a default address lifetime for
    RFC3344 MIP entities to resolve this ambiguity. The document then specifies a
    dynamic home address leasetime, as well as two new MIP extensions and associated
    procedures to facilitate management of a dynamic home address leasetime between
    the MN and the HA.</p>"
