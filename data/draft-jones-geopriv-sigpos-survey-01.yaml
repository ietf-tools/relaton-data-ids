abstract:
- content: "<p>Location Information Servers rely on signal surveys to create a signal
    map allowing for subsequent device location determination. This document describes
    a method by which a Survey Device is able to provide indoor location related measurement
    data to a LIS for positioning purposes. Location related measurement information
    comprises observations concerning properties related to the position of a Survey
    Device and the radio, electromagnetic, and other observable environmental measures
    as perceived by the Survey Device. These measurements could be data about Wi-Fi
    signals, Bluetooth signals, barometric pressure, or any other environmental measurement
    which could sent to a LIS for subsequent processing to help determine the location
    of devices that later enter the venue. A basic set of location-related measurements,
    data rights disclosure and location types are defined. This document also describes
    the use of HTTP/TLS as transport for the data object.</p>"
