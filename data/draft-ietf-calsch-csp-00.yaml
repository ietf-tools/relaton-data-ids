abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of mail enabled applications such as calendaring and scheduling
    has grown considerably in the last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business
    has become dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this information
    technology. The store-and-forward characteristic of electronic messaging technologies
    has been shown to be complementary to the asynchronous nature of group communications.
    However, the longer term growth of mail enabled applications, such as calendaring
    and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of Internet standards for the
    message content types that these groupware applications are based on. This specification
    is intended to progress the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar
    calendaring and scheduling applications that communicate using an SMTP or MIME
    transport. This specification defines a usage profile for the MIME Calendaring
    and Scheduling Content Type [MIME-CAL]. Any MIME based calendaring and scheduling
    application that supports this MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type profile
    will be able to interoperate with other MIME based calendaring and scheduling
    applications using a broad range of scheduling functions.</p>"
