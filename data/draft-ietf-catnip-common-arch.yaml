abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a common architecture for the network layer protocol.
    The Common Architecture for Next Generation Internet Protocol (CATNIP) provides
    a compressed form of the existing network layer protocols. Each compression is
    defined so that the resulting network protocol data units are identical in format.
    The fixed part of the compressed format is 16 bytes in length, and may often be
    the only part transmitted on the subnetwork.</p>"
