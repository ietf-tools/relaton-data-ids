abstract:
- content: "<p>It is desirable to allow firewalls and intrusion detection systems
    to be able to inspect the payload of an ESP packet that has been encrypted with
    the NULL cipher. This would allow a firewall to read the contents and apply the
    normal policies to it. However, a device in the network cannot reliably determine
    which ESP packets are NULL encrypted, and cannot easily determine other ESP format
    parameters such as the ICV length. These issues can cause misclassification of
    packets and wasted computational resources. This document solves this problem
    by defining an authentication-only profile of ESP and reserving IP protocol numbers
    for it.</p>"
