abstract:
- content: "<p>An e-mail message with OpenPGP encryption and/or signature has standard
    form. However, some mail transport agents damage those forms in transit. A user-friendly
    mail user agent that encounters such a mangled message may wish to try to process
    it anyway, despite the message's non-standard structure. This document aims to
    be a sort of bestiary of common message mangling patterns, along with guidance
    for implementers for how to cope with messages structured in these common ways.</p>"
