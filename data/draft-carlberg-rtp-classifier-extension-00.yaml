abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new RTP header extension. The purpose of
    the extension is to provide an additional information that further distinguishes
    the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams containing the same type
    of payload. Specifically, a classifier field is defined in the extension header
    that contains value such as 'emergency'. RTP compliant implementations that do
    not recognize the classifier extension header must continue to process the packet
    and not take no adverse action. Criteria for inserting the values in the classifier
    header, and any QoS treatment of the packet based on those values, is outside
    the scope of this specification.</p>"
