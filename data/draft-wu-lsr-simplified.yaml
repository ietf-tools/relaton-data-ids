abstract:
- content: "<p>This distributed routing protocol aims to facilitate information exchange
    and path calculation between routers to ensure efficient data transmission in
    the network. Each router initializes adjacency matrices, neighbor tables, routing
    tables, and flood flags during setup. In operation, routers periodically broadcast
    Hello packets to update neighbor tables and detect changes in neighbor relationships,
    broadcasting update packets accordingly. Nodes receiving update packets process
    them based on flood flags, optimizing network performance through scheduled flood
    flag resets, controlling link occupancy rates, and utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm
    to compute shortest paths when adjacency matrices are complete, storing results
    in routing tables for optimal path selection.</p>"
