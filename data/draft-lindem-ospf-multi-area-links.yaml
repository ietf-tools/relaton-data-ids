abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents an extension to OSPF to allow a single physical
    link to be shared by multi-areas. This is necessary to allow the link to be considered
    as an intra-area link in multiple areas and be preferred over high cost intra-area
    paths. Unlike existing mechanisms, this extension does not require additional
    layer 2 encapsulations or secondary addresses.</p>"
