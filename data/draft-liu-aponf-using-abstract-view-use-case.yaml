abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a use case of Application Policy on Network
    Functions (APONF) that presents how service developers can profit by using an
    abstract view of the network during the programming and development process, instead
    of manipulating individual devices. In this way one can write software that programs
    an arbitrary network. APONF can be used to interface the programmed arbitrary
    network into network management policies, i.e., device configuration models.</p>"
