abstract:
- content: "<p>DECADE is an in-network storage infrastructure which is under discussions
    and constructions. It can be integrated into Peer-to- Peer (P2P) applications
    to achieve more efficient content distributions. This document represents two
    detailed examples of how to integrate DECADE into P2P applications (live streaming
    and file sharing). Specifically, it describes mainly about: 1) a preliminary DECADE
    client API; 2) a P2P live streaming integration with DECADE; 3) a P2P file sharing
    integration with DECADE; 4) tests on our DECADE integrarions and 5) an application
    performance analysis from the tests.</p>"
