abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes Layered TCP (LTCP for short), a simple layering
    technique for the congestion window response of TCP to make it more scalable in
    highspeed networks. LTCP is a two dimensional congestion control framework - the
    macroscopic control uses the concept of layering to quickly and efficiently make
    use of the available bandwidth whereas microscopic control extends the existing
    AIMD algorithms of TCP to determine the per-ack behavior. This document provides
    the general intuition and framework for the LTCP protocol modifications. Using
    a simple design, the effectiveness of using layering for improving the efficiency
    without sacrificing the convergence properties of TCP, is illustrated. The chosen
    design is evaluated using mathematical analysis, ns-2 based simulations and emulation
    on a Linux testbed. The results show that LTCP has promising convergence properties,
    is about an order of magnitude faster than TCP in utilizing high bandwidth links,
    employs few parameters and is easy to understand. The flexible framework opens
    a whole class of design options for improving the performance of TCP in highspeed
    networks. This document is an effort to solicit more experimentation and feedback
    from the broader networking community.</p>"
