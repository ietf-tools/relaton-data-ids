abstract:
- content: "<p>Network security incidents, such as system compromises, worms, viruses,
    phishing incidents, and denial of service (DoS), typically result in the loss
    of service, data, and resources both human and system. Network Providers (NPs)
    need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing security
    incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack.
    This paper outlines a proactive inter-network communication method to facilitate
    sharing incident handling data and integrate existing tracing mechanisms across
    NP boundaries to identify the source(s) of an attack. The various methods implemented
    to detect and trace attacks must be coordinated on the NPs' network as well as
    provide a communication mechanism across network borders. It is imperative that
    NPs have quick communication methods defined to enable neighboring NPs to assist
    in reporting or tracking a security incident across networks. A complete solution
    integrating incident detection, source identification, reporting and communication
    capabilities, and methods to stop attack traffic is necessary to attain higher
    security levels on networks. Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended
    and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the security recommendations and
    considerations.</p>"
