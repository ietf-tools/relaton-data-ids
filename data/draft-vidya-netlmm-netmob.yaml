abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements for Network-based Local Mobility Management protocol
    [8] indicate the need to develop a protocol where mobility management within an
    administratively defined local domain is done by network entities without the
    involvement of the end host, referred to as a Mobile Station in this document.
    This document proposes one method of providing network- based mobility for mobile
    stations in a simple and scalable manner.</p>"
