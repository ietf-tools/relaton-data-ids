abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to do Per VPN routing for L3 PPVPNs.
    The solution uses BGP for auto-discovery of VPN membership, but uses Per VPN RIP
    instances and dynamic MPLS tunnel interfaces to exchange customer routes. The
    document proposes modifications to the RIP protocol to the make the solution scalable.
    The framework presented also supports deployment of multicast routing and forwarding
    for L3 PPVPNs without enabling multicast in the core.</p>"
