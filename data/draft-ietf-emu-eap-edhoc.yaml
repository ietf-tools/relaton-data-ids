abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748,
    provides a standard mechanism for support of multiple authentication methods.
    This document specifies the use of EAP-EDHOC with Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over
    COSE (EDHOC). EDHOC provides a lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange
    with ephemeral keys, using COSE (RFC 9052, RFC 9053) to provide security services
    efficiently encoded in CBOR (RFC 8949). This document also provides guidance on
    authentication and authorization for EAP-EDHOC.</p>"
