abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for information distribution in autonomic
    networks. Information distribution is categorized into two different modes: 1)
    instantaneous distribution; 2) publication for retrieval. In the former case,
    the information is sent, propagates and is disposed of after reception. In the
    latter case, information needs to be stored in the network. The capabilities to
    distribute information are basic and fundamental needs for an autonomous network
    (cf. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference- model]). This document describes typical use
    cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI, such that rich
    information distribution can be natively supported. The document proposes extensions
    to the autonomic nodes and suggests an implementation based on GRASP extensions
    as a protocol on the wire.</p>"
