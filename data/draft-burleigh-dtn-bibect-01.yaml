abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), a Delay-Tolerant
    Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) "convergence layer" protocol that tunnels
    BP "bundles" through encapsulating bundles. The services provided by the BIBE
    convergence-layer protocol adapter encapsulate an outbound BP "bundle" in a BIBE
    convergence-layer protocol data unit for transmission as the payload of a bundle.
    Security measures applied to the encapsulating bundle may augment those applied
    to the encapsulated bundle. The protocol includes a mechanism for recovery from
    loss of an encapsulating bundle, called "custody transfer". This mechanism is
    adapted from the custody transfer procedures described in the experimental Bundle
    Protocol specification developed by the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research group
    of the Internet Research Task Force and documented in RFC 5050.</p>
