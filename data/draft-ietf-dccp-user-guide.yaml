- content: "<p>This document is an informative reference discussing strategies for
    using DCCP as the transport protocol for various applications. The focus is on
    how applications can make use of the capabilities, and deal with the idiosyncrasies,
    of DCCP. Of particular interest is how UDP applications, which have traditionally
    ignored congestion control issues, can adapt to a congestion controlled transport.</p>"
