abstract:
- content: <p>[RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
    cost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, "the route reflection
    approach may not yield the same route selection result as that of the full IBGP
    mesh approach." One practical implication of this assertion is that the deployment
    of route reflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing. Hot
    potato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egress point in cases
    where no higher priority policy dictates otherwise. As a consequence of the route
    reflection method, the choice of exit point for a route reflector and its clients
    will be the egress point closest to the route reflector - and not necessarily
    closest to the RR clients. Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach
    and a set of constraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment of
    route reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full mesh approach. Such
    a deployment approach would make route reflection compatible with the application
    of hot potato routing policy. As networks evolved to accommodate architectural
    requirements of new services, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized
    route reflectors became commonplace. This is one type of common deployment where
    it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described in Section 11 of
    [RFC4456]. Yet, in such an environment, hot potato routing policy remains desirable.
    This document proposes two new solutions which can be deployed to facilitate the
    application of closest exit point policy centralized route reflection deployments.</p>
