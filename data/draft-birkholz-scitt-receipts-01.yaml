abstract:
- content: "<p>A transparent and authentic ledger service in support of a supply chain's
    integrity, transparency, and trust requires all peers that contribute to the ledgers
    operations to be trustworthy and authentic. In this document, a countersigning
    variant is specified that enables trust assertions on Merkle-tree based operations
    for global supply chain ledgers. A generic procedure for producing payloads to
    be signed and validated is defined and leverages solutions and principles from
    the Concise Signing and Encryption (COSE) space.</p>"
