abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the concept of the Shared Link Risk Group (SRLG)
    based logical ring configuration and recovery method using ring SRLG for the purpose
    of PCE-based backup path computation. In this restoration architecture, backup
    paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path which follows from
    the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment of backup path
    disjoint from the working path at all levels. To take advantage of bandwidth considerations
    and fast restoration mechanisms, a centralized Controller is used to provide dedicated
    protection to Optical Transport Networks using the SRLG concept.</p>"
