abstract:
- content: "<p>With current Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support, all communications
    to and from mobile network nodes must go through the MR-HA tunnel when the mobile
    network is away. This results in increased length of packet route and increased
    packet delay. To overcome these limitations, one might have to turn to route optimization
    (RO) for NEMO. This memo documents various types of route optimization in NEMO,
    and explores the benefits and tradeoffs in different aspects of NEMO route optimization.</p>"
