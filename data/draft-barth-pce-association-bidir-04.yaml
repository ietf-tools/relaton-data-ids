abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in
    response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. This document defines PCEP extensions
    for grouping two reverse unidirectional MPLS TE LSPs into an Associated Bidirectional
    LSP when using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs as
    well as when using a Stateless PCE.</p>"
