abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. This memo suggests that the existing
    threat model, while important and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient to
    cater for the pressing security issues in the Internet. For instance, it is also
    necessary to protect systems against endpoints that are compromised, malicious,
    or whose interests simply do not align with the interests of the users. While
    such protection is difficult, there are some measures that can be taken. It is
    particularly important to ensure that as we continue to develop Internet technology,
    non-communications security related threats are properly understood. While the
    consideration of these issues is relatively new in the IETF, this memo provides
    some initial ideas about potential broader threat models to consider when designing
    protocols for the Internet or when trying to defend against pervasive monitoring.
    Further down the road, updated threat models could result in changes in RFC 3552
    (guidelines for writing security considerations) and RFC 7258 (pervasive monitoring),
    to include proper consideration of non-communications security threats. It may
    also be necessary to have dedicated guidance on how systems design and architecture
    affects security.</p>"
