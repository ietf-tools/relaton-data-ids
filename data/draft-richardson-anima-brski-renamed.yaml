abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control
    Plane. To do this a Secure Key Infrastructure is bootstrapped. This is done using
    manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's
    authorizing service, both online and offline. We call this process the Bootstrapping
    Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device
    can occur using a routable address and a cloud service, or using only link-local
    connectivity, or on limited/ disconnected networks. Support for deployment models
    with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete
    when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully
    deployed to the device. The established secure connection can be used to deploy
    a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</p>"
