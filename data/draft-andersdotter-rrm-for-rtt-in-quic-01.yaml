abstract:
- content: "<p>The latency spin bit is an optional feature included in the QUIC transport
    protocol, as standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It enables
    passive, on-path observations for estimation of latency. This document presents
    the results of an inquiry into the potential of using randomized response mechanisms
    (RRM) to reduce privacy loss in latency measurements. It concludes that RRM could
    be used to introduce choice for clients in preserving privacy in latency measurements.
    But the trade-offs, especially since the latency spin bit is already optional,
    do not favour RRM.</p>"
