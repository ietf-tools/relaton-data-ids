abstract:
- content: <p>Much work has been put into adding authentication methods (DKIM, ARC),
    source verification (SPF) and policy support (DMARC) to email flows, however all
    these specifications have focused on looking backwards through email flow only,
    and only add new headers to messages, causing them all to be susceptible to replay
    or re-use. In particular, in early 2022, a type of attack called "DKIM Replay"
    was widely seen, where correctly DKIM-signed messages were sent to a different
    envelope sender. The "To" address would not be aligned, but such messages can
    also be the result of legitimate mailflow, so these messages were delivered to
    end-recipient mailboxes, and caused reputation issues for the signers of the original
    message.</p>
