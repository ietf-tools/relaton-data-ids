abstract:
- content: "<p>There exist many extensions to Internet addressing, as it is defined
    in [RFC0791] for IPv4 and [RFC8200] for IPv6, respectively. Those extensions have
    been developed to fill gaps in capabilities beyond the basic properties of Internet
    addressing. This document outlines those properties as a baseline against which
    the extensions are categorized in terms of methodology used to fill the gap together
    with examples of solutions doing so. While introducing such extensions, we outline
    the issues we see with those extensions. This ultimately leads to consider whether
    or not a more consistent approach to tackling the identified gaps, beyond point-wise
    extensions as done so far, would be beneficial. The benefits are the ones detailed
    in the companion document [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing], where,
    leveraging on the gaps identified in this memo and scenarios provided in [I-D.jia-intarea-scenarios-problems-addressing],
    a clear problem statement is provided.</p>"
