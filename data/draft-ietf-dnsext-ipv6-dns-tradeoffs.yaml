abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has two different proposals on the table for how to do DNS
    support for IPv6, and has thus far failed to reach a clear consensus on which
    approach is better. This note attempts to examine the pros and cons of each approach,
    in the hope of clarifying the debate so that we can reach closure and move on.</p>"
