abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP-TE [RSVPTE] can signal explicit paths with loose or strict hops
    in a MPLS network. Using loose hops can shorten the ERO, but can not reduce the
    overhead associated with an RSVP signaled LSP since path states are still created
    on every hop along the path. In this paper, we propose a mechanism that can reduce
    the signaling and maintenance overhead associated with loose hops in an RSVP signaled
    LSP in an LDP enabled network. The mechanism can also be generalized to work with
    other tunneling technologies such as GRE or IP-in-IP.</p>"
