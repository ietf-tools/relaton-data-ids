abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
    for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks. It is assumed
    that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an external network interface and
    their internal network. The extended IPv6 ND called vehicular ND can support vehicle-to-infrastructure
    communications as well as vehicle-to-vehicle communications. This document defines
    new ND options to allow a vehicle to announce the network prefixes and services
    inside its internal network to another vehicle or RSU.</p>"
