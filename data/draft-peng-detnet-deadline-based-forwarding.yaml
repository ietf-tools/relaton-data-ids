abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a deterministic forwarding mechanism to IP/
    MPLS network, as well as corresponding resource reservation, admission control,
    policing, etc, to provide guaranteed latency. Especially, latency compensation
    with core stateless is discussed to replace reshaping to be suitable for Diff-Serv
    architecture [RFC2475].</p>"
