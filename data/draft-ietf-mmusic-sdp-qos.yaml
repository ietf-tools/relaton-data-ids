abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how network QoS and security establishment
    can be made a precondition to participation in sessions described by SDP. These
    preconditions require that the participant reserve network resources (or create
    a secure media channel) before continuing with the session. In the case of SIP,
    this effectively means that the 'phone won't ring' until the preconditions are
    met. These preconditions are described by new SDP parameters, defined in this
    document. The preconditions can be defined independently for each media stream.</p>"
