abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States Government has published the National Security Agency
    (NSA) Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic
    algorithm policy for national security applications. This document specifies the
    conventions for using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite
    algorithms with the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell
    Authentication Protocol. It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation
    of all components of US National Security Systems (described in NIST Special Publication
    800-59) that employ Secure Shell (SSH). This document is also appropriate for
    all other US Government systems that process high-value information. It is made
    publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other
    system deployments.</p>"
