abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses techniques to improve the performance of TCP
    over satellite-ATM networks. ATM provides the ABR, UBR and GFR service categories
    for data traffic. TCP experiences poor performance over UBR due to bursty packet
    losses during congestion. Buffer management and guaranteed rate techniques to
    improve TCP performance over UBR are presented. The performance of TCP over ABR
    and the interaction of ABR congestion control mechanisms with TCP congestion control
    mechanisms are also described. This document is intended to be in informational
    document for the efficient transport of TCP over satellite-ATM networks.</p>"
