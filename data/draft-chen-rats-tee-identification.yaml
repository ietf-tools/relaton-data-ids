abstract:
- content: "<p>In security considerations, identities of devices like certifications,
    private keys should be protected and cannot be exposed in public in plaintext
    during whole lifecycle. When using these identities to make authentications a
    unified architecture to prevent identity information leakage is needed. This document
    creates a secure and trusted TEE authentication architecture to authenticate a
    device's identity based on EAP-TLS and TEE. In this architecture, certificate
    and handshake keys which are used for EAP- TLS will be executed in TEE. Communication
    establishment with EAP- TLS Server will be executed in REE. A middle layer is
    introduced to communicate between TEE and REE to compose the original function
    of EAP-TLS Client. TEE authentication could be used in LAN or WLAN scenarios.</p>"
