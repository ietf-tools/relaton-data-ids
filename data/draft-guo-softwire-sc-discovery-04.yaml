abstract:
- content: "<p>Several types of Carrier Grade NATs have been proposed to simplify
    IPv4/IPv6 transition of the edge network by integrating tunnels and NAT. A very
    common scenario is that many users set up softwires to a softwire concentrator
    for public or private access services. In order to establish softwires successfully,
    a new mechanism is required to enable users in the edge network to discover the
    information of the concentrator. This document describes how a host or Customer
    Premises Equipment discovers the remote softwire concentrator or CGN in a hub
    and spoke network using DHCP. Based on two new Softwire Concentrator Discovery
    DHCP Options, proposed in the document, a user can obtain the information of the
    softwire concentrator or CGN and then set up a tunnel to it.</p>"
