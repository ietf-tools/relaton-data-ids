abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
    mechanism for a challenge-based authentication using MD5 in conjunction with the
    hash algorithm used to store the password within an identity store. This document
    defines the EAP-LDAP method, which provides one-way authentication and MD5 key
    generation. As a result, the EAP-LDAP method, when used by it self, is only appropriate
    for use on networks where physical security can be assumed. These methods SHOULD
    NOT be used on wireless networks, or over the Internet, unless the EAP conversation
    is protected. This can be accomplished using technologies such as IPsec or TLS.</p>"
