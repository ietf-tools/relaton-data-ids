abstract:
- content: "<p>A Frame Relay pseudowire (PW) with Multilink Frame Relay UNI/NNI (FRF.16)
    is a mechanism that can be used for transporting the Frame Relay Protocol Data
    Units (PDUs) got after reassembling the FRF.16 fragments over a MPLS packet switched
    network (PSN). The goal of this document is to describe the encapsulation that
    is required for this.</p>"
