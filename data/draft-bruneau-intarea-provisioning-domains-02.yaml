abstract:
- content: "<p>An increasing number of hosts and networks are connected to the Internet
    through multiple interfaces, some of which may provide multiple ways to access
    the internet by the mean of multiple IPv6 prefix configurations. This document
    describes a way for hosts to retrieve additional information about their network
    access characteristics. The set of configuration items required to access the
    Internet is called a Provisioning Domain (PvD) and is identified by a Fully Qualified
    Domain Name (FQDN). This identifier, retrieved using a new Router Advertisement
    (RA) option, is associated with the set of information included within the RA
    and may later be used to retrieve additional information associated with the PvD
    by the mean of an HTTP request.</p>"
