abstract:
- content: "<p>In many Opportunistic Security scenarios end-to-end encryption is automatized
    for Internet users. In addition, it is often required to provide the users with
    easy means to carry out authentication. Depending on several factors, each communication
    channel to different peers may have a different Privacy Status, e.g., unencrypted,
    encrypted and encrypted as well as authenticated. Even each message from/to a
    single peer may have a different Privacy Status. To display the actual Privacy
    Status to the user, this document defines a Privacy Rating scheme and its mapping
    to a traffic-light semantics. A Privacy Status is defined on a per-message basis
    as well as on a per-identity basis. The traffic-light semantics (as color rating)
    allows for a clear and easily understandable presentation to the user in order
    to optimize the User Experience (UX). This rating system is most beneficial to
    Opportunistic Security scenarios and is already implemented in several applications
    of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</p>"
