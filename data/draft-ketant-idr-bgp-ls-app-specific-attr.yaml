abstract:
- content: "<p>Various link attributes have been defined in link-state routing protocols
    like OSPF and IS-IS in the context of the MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS.
    BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions have been defined to distribute these attributes
    along with other topology information from these link-state routing protocols.
    Many of these link attributes can be used for applications other than MPLS TE
    or GMPLS. Extensions to link-state routing protocols have been defined for such
    link attributes which enable distribution of their application specific values.
    This document defines extensions to BGP-LS address- family to enable advertisement
    of these application specific attributes as a part of the topology information
    from the network.</p>"
