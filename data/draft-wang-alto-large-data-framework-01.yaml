abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol provides
    network information with the goal of improving both application performance and
    network resource utilization. As data transfers become larger (e.g., due to big
    data analysis), more data transfers are concurrent but with service requirements,
    and more network capabilities are emerging (e.g., SDN allowing a data transfer
    to request specific routes or Qos), the management of large data transfers has
    become an increasingly challenging issue. This document introduces Data Transfer
    Coordinator (DTC), a centralized data transfer scheduling framework which provides
    Scheduling Hub Service (SHS) to coordinate and schedule large data transfers.
    DTC considers all three components: data transfer requirements, (ALTO) network
    information, and SDN control capabilities. This document specifies not only the
    basic framework of DTC, but also a key component, service API for SHS to specify
    data transfers and their relations.</p>"
