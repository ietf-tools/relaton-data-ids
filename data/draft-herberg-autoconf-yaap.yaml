abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes automatic configuration of MANET router interfaces,
    as well as prefix delegation to MANET routers. This autoconfiguration protocol
    is characterized by (i) adhering strictly to the Internet addressing architecture,
    (ii) being able to configure both MANET interface addresses and handle prefix
    delegation, and (iii) being able to configure both stand-alone MANETs, as well
    as MANETs connected to an infrastructure providing, e.g., globally scoped addresses/prefixes
    for use within the MANET.</p>"
