abstract:
- content: "<p>The MVPN specifications allow the use of several different kinds of
    P-tunnel technology, such as mLDP P2MP, RSVP-TE P2MP and PIM SSM. It is common
    for such a P-tunnel having a multicast-specific path. Bit Index Explicit Replication
    (BIER) is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring
    intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific
    BIER header. [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn] delivers a solution of MVPN using SPF based
    BIER defined in [RFC8279]. It can not, however, support a multicast- specific
    path well, something common in legacy MVPN deployment. [RFC8279] provides a solution
    to support mid nodes without BIER- capability. It can not, however, support deployment
    on a network that has edge nodes without BIER-capability, which is common in some
    SP-networks. This document introduces a seamless transition mechanism from legacy
    MVPN to MVPN using P2MP based BIER while preserving existing features such as
    multicast-specific PATH and Live-Live protection. It also introduces a seamless
    Live-Live protection mechanism by re-using the Entropy field of the BIER header,
    and two methods to deploy BIER when edge nodes and/or mid nodes don't have BIER-capability.</p>"
