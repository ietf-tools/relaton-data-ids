abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyzes how current TCP implementations process TCP
    urgent indications, and how the behavior of some widely-deployed middle-boxes
    affect how urgent indications are processed by end systems. This document updates
    the relevant specifications such that they accommodate current practice in processing
    TCP urgent indications, and raises awareness about the reliability of TCP urgent
    indications in the current Internet.</p>"
