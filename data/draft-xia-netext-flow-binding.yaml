abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 that allows
    networks dynamically binding IP flows to different interfaces of a mobile node.
    Mobile Access Gateways can move flows to other mobile access gateways by establishing
    flow bindings at the local mobility anchor. Local mobility anchor sends packets
    from the offloaded flow seamlessly to the new mobile access gateway.</p>"
