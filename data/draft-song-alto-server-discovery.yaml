abstract:
- content: "<p>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims to provide
    distributed applications with information to perform better-than- random initial
    peer selection when multiple peers in the network are available to provide a resource
    or service. In order to discover an Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
    Server, a set of mechanisms are required. These mechanisms enable applications
    to find an information source which provides them with information regarding the
    underlying network. This document discusses various scenarios of ALTO discovery
    and specifies the use of several available options such as DHCP or DNS.</p>"
