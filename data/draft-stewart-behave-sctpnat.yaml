abstract:
- content: "<p>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable
    communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to TCP [RFC0793].
    With the widespread deployment of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized
    code has been added to NAT for TCP that allows multiple hosts to reside behind
    a NAT and yet use only a single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts
    (behind the NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection. This additional
    code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port Translation or NAPT.
    To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet been added to most NAT's so that
    only pure NAT is available. The end result of this is that only one SCTP capable
    host can be behind a NAT. This document describes an SCTP specific variant of
    NAT which provides similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point
    traversal scenario.</p>"
