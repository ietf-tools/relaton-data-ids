abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the procedures for interconnecting two or more
    Network Virtualization Overlays (NVOs) via NVO over IP-only network. The solution
    interconnects Ethernet VPN network by using NVO with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to facilitate
    the interconnect in a scalable fashion. The motivation is to support extension
    of Layer-2 and Layer- 3, Unicast &amp; Multicast, VPNs without having to rely
    on typical Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS. The requirements
    for the interconnect are similar to the ones specified in [RFC7209] "Requirements
    for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)". In particular, this document describes the difference
    of the Gateways (GWs) procedure and incremental functionality from [RFC9014] "Interconnect
    Solution for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Overlay Networks", which this solution is interoperable
    to. This document updates and replaces all previous version of [SHARMA-MULTI-SITE].</p>
