abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients
    and servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS protocol defined
    by RFC 2246, "The TLS Protocol Version 1.0.", and the extensions to the FTP protocol
    defined by RFC 2228, "FTP Security Extensions". It describes the subset of the
    extensions that are required and the parameters to be used, discusses some of
    the policy issues that clients and servers will need to take, considers some of
    the implications of those policies, and discusses some expected behaviours of
    implementations to allow interoperation. This document is intended to provide
    TLS support for FTP in a similar way to that provided for SMTP in RFC 2487, "SMTP
    Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security", and HTTP in
    RFC 2817, "Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1.". This specification is in accordance
    with RFC 959, "File Transfer Protocol". It relies on RFC 2246, "The TLS Protocol
    Version 1.0.", and RFC 2228, "FTP Security Extensions". [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
