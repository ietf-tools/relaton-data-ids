abstract:
- content: "<p>As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new
    interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on intent rather
    than detailed specifics. An intent-based language is need to enable customers
    to easily describe their diverse intent for network connectivity to the network
    management systems. This document describes the problem Intent-Based NEtwork Modelling
    (IB- NEMO) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use cases that demonstrate
    this problem, and a proposed scope of work. Part of the scope is the validation
    of the language as a minimal (or reduced) subset. The IB-NEMO language consists
    of commands exchanged between an application and a network manager/controller.
    Some would call this boundary between the application and the network management
    system as northbound interface (NBI). IB-NEMO focuses on creating minimal subset
    of the total possible Intent-Based commands to pass across this NBI. By creating
    a minimal subset (about 20% of the total possible) of all intent commands, the
    IB-NEMO can be a simple Intent interface for most applications (hopefully 80%).
    Part of validation of this command language is to to provide test cases where
    a set of commands are used to convey information for a use case which result in
    a particular data model in the network controller.</p>"
