abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys the general problem area on IP-based vehicular
    networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems
    (ITS). The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) networking. This document deals with
    some critical aspects in vehicular networking, such as IP address autoconfiguration,
    vehicular network architecture, routing, mobility management, and security. This
    document also surveys standard activities for vehicular networks. In addition,
    this documment surveys the use cases of IP-based vehicular networking for ITS.
    Finally, this document summarizes and analyzes the previous research activities
    that use IPv4 or IPv6 for vehicular networking.</p>"
