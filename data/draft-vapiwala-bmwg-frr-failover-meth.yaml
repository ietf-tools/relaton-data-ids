abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking the failover time
    of local protection (aka Fast Reroute). The failover to a backup tunnel could
    happen at the headend of the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the backup could
    offer link or node protection. It becomes vital to benchmark the failover time
    for all the cases and combinations. The failover time could also greatly differ
    based on the design and implementation and by factors like the number of prefixes
    carried by the tunnel, the number of primary tunnels affected by the event that
    caused the failover, number of primary tunnels the backup protects and type of
    failure etc. All the required benchmarking criteria and benchmarking topology
    required for measuring failover time of local protection is described Conventions
    used in this document</p>"
