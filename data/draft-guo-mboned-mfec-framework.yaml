abstract:
- content: "<p>At present, the multimedia services such as IPTV are gaining importance.
    Multicast technologies play an inevitable role in these multimedia services. The
    main factors affecting the multicast technologies are the convergence speed and
    the capacity of the multicast routing table. One of the easiest and the most commonly
    practiced methods in nowadays multicast deployment is to push the data to the
    end router by static configurations (igmp static group). This will reduce the
    delay in channel switching. The data flow of multiple channels from one or several
    servers are transmitted along the distribution tree. The distribution tree for
    multiple channels may be composed of only one same distribution tree. A router,
    however, maintains separate protocol-status and provides separate protocol-packets
    content for each channel. This prolongs the route convergence, increases the status-space
    and reduces the exchange rate of protocol-packets. This document proposes a solution
    to speed up the route convergence, reduce the states in the multicast forwarding
    table and increase the exchange rate of packets. This can be achieved by using
    the same state for the data flows that passes the same path in the distribution
    tree. This same state is called Multicast Forwarding Equivalent Class (MFEC).
    In other words, MFEC is a group of multicast packets that are forwarded over the
    same path with the same traffic handling treatment. This solution extends various
    multicast protocols such as PIM- SSM, PIM-SM, Bidir-PIM, PIM-DM and DVMRP, and
    perfects application of multicast.</p>"
