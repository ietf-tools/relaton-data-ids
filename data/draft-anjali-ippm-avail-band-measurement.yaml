abstract:
- content: "<p>Available bandwidth along a path is an important metric that can be
    useful to provide insight into the state and performance of the network. Some
    methods have been proposed in literature for measurement of available bandwidth
    but they face the problems of scalability and high intrusiveness. In this draft,
    we propose a method to measure path available bandwidth using an active approach
    that probes the path. The probing mechanism used is based on TCP New Reno. Once
    the samples for the available bandwidth measurement are obtained, more accurate
    results are calculated using a prediction filter.</p>"
