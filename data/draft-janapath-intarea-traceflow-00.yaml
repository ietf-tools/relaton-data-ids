abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new OAM protocol - TraceFlow that captures
    information pertaining to a traffic flow along the path that the flow takes through
    the network. TraceFlow is ECMP and link-aggregation aware and captures the information
    about constituent members through which the traffic flow passes. TraceFlow gathers
    information that is relevant to the flow such as outgoing interface Layer 3 address,
    Next-hop to which the packet of the flow is forwarded, effect of network policies
    such as access control lists on the flow. This draft requires the Traceflow protocol
    to be processed by Layer 3 devices only. Devices such as Layer 2 devices, MPLS
    LERs/LSRs along the way are passed through without any processing as if in a pass-through
    mode. IP tunnels such as IP-in-IP, IP-in-GRE mechanisms are expected to pass the
    Traceflow packets through them using the pass through mode. For achieving its
    purpose Traceflow advocates the use of a specific UDP destination port to be assigned
    from IANA.</p>"
