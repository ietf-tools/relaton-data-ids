abstract:
- content: <p>The terms on-path attacker and MITM Attack have been used in a variety
    of ways, sometimes interchangeably, and sometimes meaning different things. Increasingly
    people have become uncomfortable with the gendered term "Man" in the middle and
    have sought alternatives. This document offers an update on terminology for network
    attacks, retaining some acronyms terms while redefining the expansion, and clarifying
    the different kinds of attacks. Consistent terminology is important in describing
    what kinds of attacks a particular protocol defends against, and which kinds the
    protocol does not.</p>
