abstract:
- content: "<p>The 128 bits of IPv6 address space is considerably bigger than the
    32 bits of address space in IPv4. In particular, the IPv6 subnets to which hosts
    attach will by default have 64 bits of host address space. As a result, traditional
    methods of remote TCP or UDP port scanning to discover open or running services
    on a host will potentially become far less computationally feasible, due to the
    larger search space in the subnet. This document discusses that property of IPv6
    subnets, and describes related issues for site administrators of IPv6 networks
    to consider, which may be of importance when planning site address allocation
    and management strategies.</p>"
