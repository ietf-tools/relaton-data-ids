abstract:
- content: "<p>To cumulate design lessons from our protocol development efforts, this
    document provides a preliminary comparison between two transport protocol designs,
    Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) and Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC).
    We identify their commonalities and differences, summarize the characteristics
    of QUIC which we believe represent progresses in transport protocol designs. We
    hope this draft useful in helping others to gain further understanding of both
    SCTP and QUIC, and in future protocol design efforts.</p>"
