abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this draft is to describe mechanisms for exchanging
    routing information between IP routers and optical networks, and between optical
    sub-networks. Such information exchange would allow automated establishment of
    end-to-end paths in an optical network comprising of multiple sub-networks. Furthermore,
    it would allow optical network clients, specifically IP routers, to discover their
    remote peers dynamically. Determination of reachability could be the first step
    in dynamic provisioning of optical paths using signaling. (A postscript version
    of this draft with figures is available as draft-optical-routing-00.ps).</p>"
