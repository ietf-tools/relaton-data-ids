abstract:
- content: "<p>The OSI service/protocol and Internet TCP/IP suite are typical protocol
    architectures for data transport in computer communications. A protocol architecture
    designs its own addressing scheme to distinguish communication objects. The OSI
    domain has developed an addressing system based on ITU-T Recommendation X.200
    | ISO/IEC 7498 OSI Reference Model while the Internet has advertised its own way
    of addressing. It is necessary to understand them and to analyze the mapping relationship
    between them so that OSI services and protocols can be adapted over IP-based networks
    or a transport layer protocol can be developed for both OSI and IP networks. Additionally
    this memo can serve as a reference in order to produce an address interpretation
    scheme between SCN (Switched Circuit Network) and IP network.</p>"
