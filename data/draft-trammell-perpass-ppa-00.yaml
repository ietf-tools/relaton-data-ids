abstract:
- content: "<p>This document elaborates a threat model for the Perfect Passive Adversary
    (PPA): an adversary with an interest in eavesdropping that can passively observe
    network traffic at every layer at every point in the network between the endpoints.
    It is intended to demonstrate to protocol designers and implementors the observability
    and inferability of information and metainformation transported over their respective
    protocols, to assist in the evaluation of the performance of these protocols and
    the effectiveness of their protection mechanisms under pervasive passive surveillance.</p>"
