abstract:
- content: <p>IKEv2 supports multiple authentication mechanisms like public key signatures,
    shared secrets and EAP. EAP based authentication requires server to maintain information
    about the client until EAP completes. Public key based authentication mechanisms
    are highly computational intensive and demands server CPU resources. Redirect
    Mechanism for IKEv2 proposes a mechanism for IKEv2 that enables a VPN gateway
    to redirect the VPN client to another VPN gateway, for example, based on the load
    condition. IKEv2 Session Resumption proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows
    a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner,
    utilizing a previously established IKE SA. Redirect mechanism can also be used
    to redirect a client to another router (trust anchor) to do mutual authentication
    and an optional proxy session negotiation on behalf of the server. This redirection
    happens during the IKE_SA_INIT and server does not maintain any information about
    the redirected client. After mutual authentication and optional proxy session
    negotiation trust anchor redirects the client back to the server with an Access
    Token which can be used as a dynamic pre-shared key between the server and client
    for password based IKE_AUTH exchange. Mechanism described here allows servers
    to compute the same pre-shared key dynamically, without contacting trust anchors,
    based on the information provided by the client during IKE_AUTH exchange. Access
    Token based authentication permits IDr of the responder to be different from that
    specified in Ticket and permits client to reuse the proxy session (negotiated
    between client and trust anchor) between client and server. Such a mechanism is
    useful especially for low power devices like handsets. For example, a mobile node
    can redirect a correspondent node to its home agent. Home agent can form a proxy
    session with correspondent node and then redirect it back to mobile node. Status
