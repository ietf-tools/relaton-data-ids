abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet access providers for residential customers provide only
    one dynamic IPv4 address to their clients. This document proposes in such cases
    to use an IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel with IPSec (this gives a static global routable
    address or prefix with security) and to implement the processing at the server
    end of unsolicited neighbor advertisements for overriding the IPv4 address at
    the client end when it changes.</p>"
