abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF CATS WG addresses the problem of how the network infrastructure
    can steer traffic between clients of a service and sites offering the service,
    considering both network metrics (such as bandwidth and latency), and compute
    metrics (such as processing, storage capabilities, and capacity). This document
    defines new extensions and procedures for a terminal connected to a network infrastructure,
    to benefit from transparent service migration adapting to specific connectivity
    and computing requirements, so traffic is always steered to an instance meeting
    both requirements. Both CATS-aware and -unaware terminals are considered. Exemplary
    signaling control messages and operation extending the well-known Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 protocol are also defined.</p>"
