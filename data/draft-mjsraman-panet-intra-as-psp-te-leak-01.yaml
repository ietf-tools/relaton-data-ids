abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we propose a framework to reduce the aggregate power
    consumption of an Autonomous System (AS) using a collaborative approach between
    areas within an AS. We identify the low-power paths within non-backbone areas
    and then use Traffic Engineering (TE) techniques to route the packets along the
    stitched paths from non- backbone areas / backbone area to other non-backbone
    areas. Such low- power paths can be identified by using the power-to-available-
    bandwidth (PWR) ratio as an additional constraint in the Constrained Shortest
    Path First (CSPF) algorithm. For routing the data traffic through these low-power
    paths, the Inter-Area Traffic Engineered Label Switched Path (TE-LSP) that spans
    multiple areas can be used. Extensions to the Interior Gateway Protocols like
    OSPF and IS-IS that support TE extensions can be used to disseminate information
    about low-power paths in the respective areas (backbone or non-backbone) that
    minimize the PWR ratio metric on the links within the areas and between the areas
    thereby creating a collaborative approach to reduce the power consumption. The
    feasibility of our approaches is illustrated by applying our algorithm to an AS
    with a backbone area and several non-backbone areas. The techniques proposed in
    this paper for the Inter-Area power reduced paths require a few modifications
    to the existing features of the IGPs supporting TE extensions. The proposed techniques
    can be extended to other levels of Internet hierarchy, such as Inter-AS paths,
    through suitable modifications as in [11]. When link state routing protocols like
    OSPF or ISIS are used to discover TE topology, there is the limitation that traffic
    engineered paths can be set up only when the head and tail end of the label switched
    path are in the same area. There are solutions to overcome this limitation either
    using offline Path Computation Engine (PCE) that attach to multiple areas and
    know the topology of all areas. This document proposes an alternative approach
    that does not require any centralized PCE and uses selective leaking of low-power
    TE path information from one area into other areas.</p>"
