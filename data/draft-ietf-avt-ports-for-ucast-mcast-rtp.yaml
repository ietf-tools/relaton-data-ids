abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a port mapping solution that allows RTP receivers
    to choose their own ports for an auxiliary unicast session in RTP applications
    using both unicast and multicast services. The solution provides protection against
    denial-of-service or packet amplification attacks that could be used to cause
    one or more RTP packets to be sent to a victim client.</p>"
