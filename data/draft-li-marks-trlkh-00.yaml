abstract:
- content: "<p>Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the multicast key
    management problem. An efficient multicast key management in the case of large
    dynamic group with preplanned eviction is MARKS in which one receiver's join or
    preplanned leave has no side effect on other receivers. However, there is no effective
    mechanism in MARKS to expel a malicious member dynamically. An improved MARKS
    in which a malicious member can be expelled scalablely by rekeying an intermediate
    key is introduced. And a two-layer Logical Key Tree based on coincident leave
    time (called TR-LKH) which is used to maintain the intermediate key is proposed
    here. The described approach has outstanding performance in terms of scalability,
    where one member's join or preplanned leave has no side effect on other members,
    furthermore, the number of rekeying messages needed to expel a member depends
    little on the group size.</p>"
