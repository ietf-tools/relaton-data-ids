abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) and its optional
    extensions can be used for Edge-To-Edge (E2E) active measurement. In Situ Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) data fields can be used for recording and
    collecting Hop-By- Hop (HBH) and E2E operational and telemetry information. This
    document extends STAMP to reflect MPLS Network Action Sub-Stacks for HBH and E2E
    active measurements, for example, using IOAM data fields.</p>"
