abstract:
- content: "<p>The rapid growth of Forwarding Information Base (FIB) has raised concerns
    among many Internet Service Providers. One potential solution to this problem
    is FIB aggregation, i.e. letting each router aggregate its FIB entries without
    affecting the forwarding paths taken by data traffic. It is a simple local software
    optimization within a router, requiring no changes to routing protocols or router
    hardware. To understand the effectiveness of using FIB aggregation to extend router
    lifetime, in this draft we present several FIB aggregation algorithms and evaluate
    their performance using routing tables and updates collected from tens of networks.
    Our results show that FIB aggregation can reduce the FIB table size by as much
    as 70% with small computational overhead. We also show that the computational
    overhead can be controlled through various mechanisms.</p>"
