abstract:
- content: "<p>The deployment of IP Network Address Translators (NATs) for IPv4 has
    become very pervasive in the last 10-12 years. The original goal of NAT was to
    conserve IP address space, but the technology has now become very popular in home
    and SOHO type networks, as well as many larger organisations, for a variety of
    reasons. At the same time, the introduction of NAT adds a cost for application
    and service developers. This document presents a brief overview of the history
    of NAT, alongside a list of ongoing work related to NAT workarounds for current
    IETF protocol designs. The document intends to present a neutral view of the cost
    of NAT for discussion in the IETF and wider community.</p>"
