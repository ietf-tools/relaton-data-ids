abstract:
- content: "<p>In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable
    object with a name such as a named data chunk. Different from host- centric connectivity,
    ICN connects named entities using name-based routing and forwarding. At the same
    time, network entities, end devices, and applications have variant demands to
    verify the integrity and authenticity of these entities through names. This document
    proposes a generic naming schema, called PID, which supports trust provenance,
    content lookup, routing, and inter-domain resolution for ICN. With PID schema,
    a name consists of three components: principal(s), identifier(s), and domain(s).
    In this draft, we only illustrate the principles and concepts of PID and the functional
    role of each component, and leave encoding approaches as implementation options.</p>"
