abstract:
- content: "<p>Various applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require
    the exchange of information between endpoints that is potentially too large to
    reasonably send directly in a SIP message. This Internet- Draft defines requirements
    for a mechanism to indirectly specify such information so that a more appropriate
    non-SIP channel may be used for the transfer.</p>"
