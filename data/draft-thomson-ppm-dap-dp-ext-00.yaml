abstract:
- content: "<p>The Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) can be a key component of
    a system that provides differentially-private guarantees for participants. Extensions
    to DAP are defined to support these guarantees. This includes bindings of reports
    to specific options, so that the aggregation service can better implement privacy
    budgeting and replay protections.</p>"
