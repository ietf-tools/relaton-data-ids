abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs, are URL-safe JSON-based security
    tokens that contain a set of claims that can be signed and/or encrypted. JWTs
    are being widely used and deployed as a simple security token format in numerous
    protocols and applications, both in the area of digital identity and in other
    application areas. This Best Current Practices (BCP) specification updates RFC
    7519 to provide actionable guidance leading to secure implementation and deployment
    of JWTs. This BCP specification furthermore replaces the existing JWT BCP specification
    RFC 8725 to provide additional actionable guidance covering threats and attacks
    that have been discovered since RFC 8725 was published.</p>"
