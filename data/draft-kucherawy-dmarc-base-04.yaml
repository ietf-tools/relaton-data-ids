abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a proposal for a scalable mechanism by which a mail
    sending organization can express, using the Domain Name System, domain-level policies
    and preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, and a mail
    receiving organization can use those policies and preferences to improve mail
    handling. The email ecosystem currently lacks a cohesive mechanism through which
    email senders and receivers can make use of multiple authentication protocols
    to establish reliable domain identifiers, communicate policies about those identifiers,
    and report about mail using those identifiers. This lack of cohesion has several
    effects: receivers have difficulty providing feedback to senders about authentication,
    senders therefore have difficulty evaluating their authentication deployments,
    and as a result neither is able to make effective use of existing authentication
    technology. The enclosed proposal is not intended to introduce mechanisms that
    provide elevated delivery privilege of authenticated email. The proposal presents
    a mechanism for policy distribution that enables a continuum of increasingly strict
    handling of messages that fail multiple authentication checks, from no action,
    through altered delivery, up to message rejection.</p>"
