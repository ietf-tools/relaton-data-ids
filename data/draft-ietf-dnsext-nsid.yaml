abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increased use of DNS anycast, load balancing, and other mechanisms
    allowing more than one DNS name server to share a single IP address, it is sometimes
    difficult to tell which of a pool of name servers has answered a particular query.
    While existing ad-hoc mechanisms allow an operator to send follow-up queries when
    it is necessary to debug such a configuration, the only completely reliable way
    to obtain the identity of the name server that responded is to have the name server
    include this information in the response itself. This note defines a protocol
    extension to support this functionality. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
