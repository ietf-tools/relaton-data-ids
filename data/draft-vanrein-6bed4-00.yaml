abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of 6bed4 is to support IPv6-only applications, even on
    IPv4-only networks. A specific area of concern is that of peer-to- peer protocols
    such as SIP or document exchange during a chat session. Such protocols are designed
    to run in any environment, which means that they cannot rely on IPv6 for themselves,
    or for their peers. The 6bed4 tunnel mechanism ensures that IPv6 can be assumed
    on all peers. The 6bed4 mechanism is meant as a fallback mechanism for IPv6 connectivity
    on networks that do not support it natively, by running a tunnel over UDP and
    IPv4. The IPv4 address is used to support traceability of the traffic originator,
    which means that no user account or other configuration is needed. The tunnel
    mechanism encapsulates IPv6 in UDP/IPv4 and builds on existing IPv6 mechanisms;
    it employs Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862] to setup an IPv6 address
    on a 6bed4 Peer, and Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] to find the most direct route
    to a remote 6bed4 Peer.</p>"
