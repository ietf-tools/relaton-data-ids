abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast has become increasingly important with the emergence of network-based
    applications such as IP telephony and video conferencing. The Internet community
    has done a significant amount of work on IP multicast over the last decade [1-10]
    and as a result, there are a number of multicast applications that are used today
    on the Mbone, the multicast-capable virtual network that is layered on top of
    (portions of) the Internet [10]. However, while today's multicast schemes are
    scaleable in the sense that they can support very large multicast groups, there
    are scalability issues when a network needs to support a very large number of
    distinct multicast groups. This document describes a new scheme for multicast
    that complements the existing schemes. Whereas the existing schemes can support
    a limited number of very large multicast groups, the scheme described here can
    support a very large number of small multicast groups.</p>"
