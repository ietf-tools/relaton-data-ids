abstract:
- content: "<p>NSIS Quality of Service (QoS) signaling enables applications to perform
    QoS reservation along a data flow path. When the data flow path contains IP tunnel
    segments, NSIS QoS signaling has no effect within those tunnel segments. Therefore,
    the resulting tunnel segments could become the weakest QoS link and invalidate
    the QoS efforts in the rest of the end-to-end path. The problem with NSIS signaling
    within the tunnel is caused by the tunnel encapsulation that masks packets' original
    IP header fields. Those original IP header fields are needed to intercept NSIS
    signaling messages and classify QoS data packets. This document defines a solution
    to this problem by mapping end-to-end QoS session requests to corresponding QoS
    sessions in the tunnel, thus extending the end-to-end QoS signaling into the IP
    tunnel segments. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
    community.</p>"
