abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing SAV schemes can not effectively defend against IP Spoofing
    DDoS under incremental deployment. This document proposes SAV-D, an SAV-honeynet
    based distributed defense architecture to enhance SAV's defense. The main idea
    of SAV-D is to collect and aggregate more threat data from existing SAV devices
    and then distribute crucial knowledge to widespread devices, thus significantly
    expanding defense across the entire network.</p>"
