abstract:
- content: "<p>Many home user networks or enterprise networks are using the address
    translation technology (NAT[1]) at the boundary of their end-networks for various
    reasons. One disadvantage of the use of the address translation technology is
    that it might disable two-way transparent communication. This document specifies
    the enhancement of the address translation technology, which it adds 'sub-address'
    to current IP address space to enable NAT inside/outside hosts to setup transparent
    communication in both direction through enhanced NAT routers. This enhancement
    is called 'C-NATS' (Capsulated Network Address Translation with Sub-Address) and
    the word 'NATS' used in this document implies 'C-NATS'.</p>"
