abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet draft presents a best industry practice for ingesting
    encoded live media to media processing entities. Two profiles of the media ingest
    are defined covering the most common use cases. The first profile facilates active
    media processing and is based on the fragmented MPEG-4 format. The second profile
    enables efficient ingest of media streaming presentations based on established
    streaming protocols by also adding a manifest besides the fragmented MPEG-4 stream.
    Details on carriage of metadata markers, timed text, subtitles and encryption
    specific metadata are also included.</p>"
