abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an option to the OSPF Version 2 specification which
    allows multiple areas to share the same OSPF link. One area is always configured
    as the link's primary area. The link's remaining areas are termed secondary. Two
    border routers adjacent across the same secondary area may forward the area's
    intra-area traffic across the link. This option applies to standard areas, stub
    areas, and NSSAs. It works over any OSPF interface. Routers with this option configured
    are backward compatible with routers running the standard OSPF Version 2 compliant
    implementation as defined in RFC 2328. Please send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.</p>"
