abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) Protocol defines
    a technique for establishing, terminating and otherwise managing calls between
    entities in differing administrative domains. The RIPT Inbound extension brings
    this to end clients, such as a browser. However, it defines a different technique
    for media that cannot directly use the webRTC APIs, and require a change to them.
    This specification provides an extension to RIPT for webRTC compatibility, enabling
    media to flow from browser to server as is done with RIPT, or from browser to
    browser as is done with webRTC. It also discusses techniques for sending e2e encrypted
    media.</p>"
