abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain topologies, it is not necessary to run a multicast rout-
    ing protocol. It is sufficient to learn group membership informa- tion and simply
    forward based upon that information. This draft describes a mechanism for forwarding
    based solely upon IGMP member- ship information. This document is a product of
    an individual. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author.</p>"
