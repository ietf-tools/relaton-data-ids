abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the principle of privacy partitioning, which
    selectively spreads data and communication across multiple parties as a means
    to improve the privacy by separating user identity from user data. This document
    describes emerging patterns in protocols to partition what data and metadata is
    revealed through protocol interactions, provides common terminology, and discusses
    how to analyze such models.</p>"
