abstract:
- content: "<p>Organisations such as BBC Monitoring monitor radio and television broadcasts
    worldwide. Traditional monitoring methods incur expensive international telephone
    call charges. This document describes a system whereby remote broadcasts can be
    monitored using a computer connected to a radio or television receiver and to
    the Internet, using inexpensive local calls to its local Internet Service Provider.
    This document also defines the protocol used between the central server and the
    remote clients which implement this system.</p>"
