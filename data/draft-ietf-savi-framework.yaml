abstract:
- content: "<p>Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) methods were developed
    to prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's IP addresses,
    so as to complement ingress filtering with finer-grained, standardized IP source
    address validation. This document is a framework document that describes and motivates
    the design of the SAVI methods. Particular SAVI methods are described in other
    documents.</p>"
