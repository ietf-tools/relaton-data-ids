abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo explores some choices that arise when IPsec is to be used
    to implement secure 'virtual links' interconnecting customer premises VPN devices
    and/or network based virtual routers. The main focus is on the network based cases.
    Requirements are proposed and some relevant aspects of the IPsec protocol suite
    are discussed. A number of different protocol architectures for virtual links
    are then evaluated. This memo is informational in nature; it is intended that
    it will focus discussion toward a standard in this area.</p>"
