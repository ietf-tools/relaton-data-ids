abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents steps undertaken for developing a methodology
    to map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion
    and protection of Human Rights, particularly the right to freedom of expression
    and association. It aims to facilitate and build the work done by the Human Rights
    Protocol Considerations research group in the IRTF, as well as other authors within
    the IETF. Exemplary work [RFC1984] [RFC6973] [RFC7258] has already been done in
    the IETF on privacy issues that should be considered when creating an Internet
    protocol. But, beyond privacy considerations, concerns for freedom of expression
    and association were also a strong part of the world-view of the community involved
    in developing the first Internet protocols. Indeed, promoting open, secure and
    reliable connectivity is essential for these rights. But how are this concepts
    addressed in the protocol level? Are there others? This ID is intended to explain
    research work done so far and to explore possible methodological approaches to
    move further on exploring and exposing the relations between standards and protocols
    and the promotion and protection of the rights to freedom of expression and association.
