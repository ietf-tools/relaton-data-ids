abstract:
- content: "<p>Public wireless Internet access zones based on IEEE 802.11 [1] wireless
    LAN technology are becoming common. However, many issues are impeding further
    adoption of the technology by end-users, in particular the inability or difficulty
    to roam between the networks of different providers. This document aims to document
    these issues, show how they are different from roaming in other contexts such
    as dialup access to the Internet or GSM roaming, and how current solutions do
    not fully address these issues. Future documents will try to address these issues
    with practical solutions.</p>"
