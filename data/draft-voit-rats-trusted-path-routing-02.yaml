abstract:
- content: "<p>There are end-users who believe encryption technologies like IPSec
    alone are insufficient to protect the confidentiality of their highly sensitive
    traffic flows. These end-users want their flows to traverse devices which have
    been freshly appraised and verified. This specification describes Trusted Path
    Routing. Trusted Path Routing protects sensitive flows as they transit a network
    by forwarding traffic to/from sensitive subnets across network devices recently
    appraised as trustworthy.</p>"
