abstract:
- content: "<p>Implementors of systems that use public key cryptography to exchange
    symmetric keys need to make the public keys resistant to some predetermined level
    of attack. That level of attack resistance is the strength of the system, and
    the symmetric keys that are exchanged must be at least as strong as the system
    strength requirements. The three quantities, system strength, symmetric key strength,
    and public key strength, must be consistently matched for any network protocol
    usage. While it is fairly easy to express the system strength requirements in
    terms of a symmetric key length and to choose a cipher that has a key length equal
    to or exceeding that requirement, it is harder to choose a public key that has
    a cryptographic strength meeting a symmetric key strength requirement. This document
    explains how to determine the length of an asymmetric key as a function of a symmetric
    key strength requirement. Some rules of thumb for estimating equivalent resistance
    to large-scale attacks on various algorithms are given. The document also addresses
    how changing the sizes of the underlying large integers (moduli, group sizes,
    exponents, and so on) changes the time to use the algorithms for key exchange.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
