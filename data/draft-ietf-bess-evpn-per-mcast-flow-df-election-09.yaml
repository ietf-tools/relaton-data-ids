abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7432] describes mechanism to elect designated forwarder (DF) at
    the granularity of (ESI, EVI) which is per VLAN (or per group of VLANs in case
    of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service). However, the current level of granularity
    of per-VLAN is not adequate for some applications.[RFC8584] improves base line
    DF election by introducing HRW DF election. [RFC9251] introduces applicability
    of EVPN to Multicast flows, routes to sync them and a default DF election. This
    document is an extension to HRW base draft [RFC8584] and further enhances HRW
    algorithm for the Multicast flows to do DF election at the granularity of (ESI,
    VLAN, Mcast flow).</p>"
