abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how International Standard Text Work Codes
    (ISTCs; persistent and unique identifiers for textual works) can be supported
    within the URN framework and the syntax for URNs defined in RFC 2141 [Moats].
    Analysis is in part based on the ideas expressed in RFC 2288 [Lynch], which analysed
    the use of ISSN, ISBN and SICI as URNs. Chapter 5 contains a URN namespace registration
    request modelled according to the template in RFC 2611 [Daigle et al.].</p>"
