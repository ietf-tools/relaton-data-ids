abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains featuring no or only timely
    limited connectivity between involved components. It addresses connectivity to
    backend services supporting enrollment like a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    and also to the connectivity between pledge and registrar. For this it enhances
    the use of authenticated self-contained objects in BRSKI also for request and
    distribution of deployment domain specific device certificates. The defined approach
    is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol allowing the application
    of existing and potentially new certificate management protocols.</p>"
