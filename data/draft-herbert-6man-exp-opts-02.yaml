abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the experimental IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destinations
    Option types can concurrently support different experimental options. This is
    accomplished by employing a format in the Option Data for experimental option
    types. The format contains an experiment identifier that indicates an experimental
    option contained in the trailing Option Data. This approach is robust to experiments
    that are not registered and to those that do not use this sharing mechanism. It
    is recommended for all new Destination and Hop-by-Hop options that use experimental
    codepoints.</p>"
