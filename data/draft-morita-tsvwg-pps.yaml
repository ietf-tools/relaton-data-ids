abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework of a new scheme for traffic control
    to achieve end-to-end QoS for interactive multimedia services. The scheme is based
    on end-to-end measurement of network resources by end systems. The network is
    assumed to fully support the priority control scheme specified in the Diffserv
    architecture for QoS and SIP [1] for session control. Since the scheme relies
    on the behavior of the end systems, this document also touches on mechanisms for
    monitoring end-system behavior.</p>"
