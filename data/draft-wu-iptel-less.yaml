abstract:
- content: "<p>In Internet telephony, end systems can take a large role in providing
    services, especially in networks without pre-configured infra-structure, such
    as peer-to-peer networks. Since we believe that end system services differ in
    their requirements from network services, we define a new service creation scripting
    language called the Language for End System Services (LESS). LESS inherits man
    characteristics from the Call Processing Language (CPL). It contains commands
    and events for direct user interaction and the control of media applications.
    This document defines the basic elements of LESS and several commonly used LESS
    extensions.</p>"
