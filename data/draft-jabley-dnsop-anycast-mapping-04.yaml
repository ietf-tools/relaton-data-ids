abstract:
- content: "<p>Anycast is a deployment technique commonly employed for authoritative-only
    servers in the Domain Name System (DNS). L-Root, one of the thirteen root servers,
    is deployed in this fashion. Various techniques have been used to map deployed
    anycast infrastructure externally, i.e., without reference to inside knowledge
    about where and how such infrastructure has been deployed. Motivations for performing
    such measurement exercises include operational troubleshooting and infrastructure
    risk assessment. In the specific case of L-Root, the ability to measure and map
    anycast infrastructure using the techniques mentioned in this document is provided
    for reasons of operational transparency. This document describes all facilities
    deployed at L-Root to facilitate mapping of its infrastructure and serves as documentation
    for L-Root as a measurable service.</p>"
