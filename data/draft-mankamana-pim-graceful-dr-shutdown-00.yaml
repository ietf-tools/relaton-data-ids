abstract:
- content: "<p>On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected as a Designated
    Router (DR). On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is responsible for tracking local
    multicast listeners and forwarding traffic to these listeners if the group is
    operating in PIM-SM. In case of a network maintenance, where we want to bring
    down the current DR, there is currently no way to gracefully handover the PIM
    DR role to a new DR on the shared LAN. In this document, we propose a modification
    to the PIM-SM protocol that allows PIM DR to gracefully shutdown or go down for
    maintenance. We also provide a procedure for PIM DR to gracefully handover its
    role to a new PIM DR in the network.</p>"
