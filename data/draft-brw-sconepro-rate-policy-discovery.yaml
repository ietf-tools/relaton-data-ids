abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic exchanged over an attachment circuit may be subject to rate-
    limit policies. These policies may be intentional policies (e.g., enforced as
    part of the activation of the attachment circuit and typically agreed upon service
    subscription) or be reactive policies (e.g., enforced temporarily to manage an
    overload or during a DDoS attack mitigation). Networks already support mechanisms
    to advertize a set of network properties to hosts using Neighbor Discovery options.
    Examples of such properties are link MTU (RFC 4861) and PREFIX64 (RFC 8781). This
    document complements these tools and specifies a Neighbor Discovery option to
    be used in Router Advertisements (RAs) to communicate these policies to hosts.
    For address family parity, a new DHCP option is also defined.</p>"
