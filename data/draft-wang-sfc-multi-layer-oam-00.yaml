abstract:
- content: "<p>Since there are different notions of service chain, such as fully abstract
    notion named SFC, half-fully abstraction notion named SFP and fully specific notion
    named RSP, and there are different components defined in SFC architecture, it
    seems reasonable to define differentiated OAM for these different service chains.
    This document tries to discuss the multi-layer OAM requirements in SFC domain
    and provides a multi-layer OAM solution for different service chains.</p>"
