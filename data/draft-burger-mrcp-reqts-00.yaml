abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol to
    control distributed speech processing of audio streams. By speech processing,
    this document specifically means automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech.
    Other IETF protocols, such as SIP and RTSP, address rendezvous and control for
    generalized media streams. However, speech processing presents additional requirements
    that none of the extant IETF protocols address.</p>"
