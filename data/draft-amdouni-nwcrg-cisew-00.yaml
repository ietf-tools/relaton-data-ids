abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details an online coding method for network coding called
    CISEW: Coding Interval-based Sliding Encoding Window. The method is proposed as
    a building block that could be integrated in a complete network coding protocol.
    This building block is responsible of: - decoding: maintaining and decoding of
    the set of received coded payloads, - recoding: selecting the content of generated
    coded payloads, - signaling: allowing for nodes to collect the information on
    the state of their neighbors. CISEW is based on a sliding window method; it generates
    coded payloads using only a small subset of original payloads. This allows for
    some real-time decoding (online decoding). CISEW is a overhaul and redesign of
    a similar method called SEW, part of the previously proposed protocol DRAGONCAST.
    CISEW refines the signaling and algorithms of SEW, and makes them more general.
    CISEW offers a general framework for online network coding, with associated signaling.
    From this framework, several online coding policies can be implemented.</p>"
