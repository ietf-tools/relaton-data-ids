abstract:
- content: "<p>Randomness is a crucial ingredient for TLS and related transport security
    protocols. Weak or predictable cryptographically-strong pseudorandom number generators
    (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes. See the Dual EC random
    number backdoor for a relevant example of this problem. This document describes
    a way for security protocol participants to mix their long-term private key into
    the entropy pool from which random values are derived. This may help mitigate
    problems that stem from broken CSPRNGs.</p>"
