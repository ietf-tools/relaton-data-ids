abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP is the routing protocol used to tie the Autonomous Systems (ASes)
    of the Internet together. The ongoing stability of BGP in the face of arbitrary
    inputs, both malicious and unintentional, is of primary importance to the overall
    stability of the Internet. The overall issue is not a new one. Previously, one
    aspect of stability, known as route flap damping was originally discussed in RFC
    2439. In the intervening years, a great deal of experience with flap damping and
    other stability concerns has been accumulated. Most recently, the issue of BGP
    stability has been highlighted in RAWS. This document describes the experience
    that has been gained concerning stability in the intervening years, hypotheses
    about remaining problems, suggestions for experiments to be performed, and proposals
    for possible alternatives.</p>"
