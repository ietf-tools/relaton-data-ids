abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF 6LoWPAN working group has defined a number of optimizations
    to adapt traditional IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for Low-power and Lossy Networks
    (LLNs). As these two ND protocols are incompatible, and Neighbor Discovery has
    link-local scope, a side effect of these optimizations is that communication between
    Full Function Devices (FFDs) and 6LoWPAN nodes (6LNs) becomes impossible within
    the same link, unless the proper proxy mechanisms are applied. This document specifies
    guidelines for such proxy mechanisms to enable transparent communication between
    FFDs and 6LNs within the same network link.</p>"
