abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delay-Tolerant-Networking Bundle Protocol includes a custody transfer
    mechanism to provide acknowledgements of receipt for particular bundles. No checksum
    is included in the basic DTN Bundle Protocol, however, so it is not possible to
    verify that bundles have been either forwarded or passed through various convergence
    layers without errors having been introduced. This document partially rectifies
    the situation by defining a Bundle Protocol extension for carrying payload checksums
    and describes how its use can be integrated with both custody transfer and fragmentation.</p>"
