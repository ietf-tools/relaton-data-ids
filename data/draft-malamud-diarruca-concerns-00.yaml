abstract:
- content: "<p>The U.S. Congress, having hit a home run with the do-not-call list,
    has decided that since computers are like telephones, a do-not-email list ought
    to win them the pennant. You have an opportunity to block that metaphor. The FTC
    has issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and has given the public
    until March 31, 2004 to respond. This document tells you how and explains the
    issues.</p>"
