abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label
    stack to support ancillary data in the packet and high level requirements on that
    ancillary data. This work is the product of the IETF MPLS Open Design Team. Requirements
    are derived from a number of new proposals for additions to the MPLS label stack
    to allow forwarding or other processing decisions to be made, either by a transit
    or terminating LSR (i.e. the LER), based on application data that may be in or
    below the bottom of the label stack.</p>"
