abstract:
- content: <p>The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) changes the way in which two Internet
    hosts communicate. One key advantage over other schemes is that HIP does not require
    modifications to the traditional network- layer functionality of the Internet,
    i.e., its routers. In the current Internet, however, many devices other than routers
    modify the traditional network-layer behavior of the Internet. These "middleboxes"
    are intermediary devices that perform functions other than the standard functions
    of an IP router on the datagram path between source and destination hosts. Whereas
    some types of middleboxes may not interfere with HIP at all, others can affect
    some aspects of HIP communication, and others can render HIP communication impossible.
    This document discusses the problems associated with HIP communication across
    network paths that include specific types of middleboxes, namely, network address
    translators and firewalls. It identifies and discusses issues in the current HIP
    specifications that affect communication across these types of middleboxes. This
    document is a product of the IRTF HIP Research Group. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
