abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Location Information Server receives a request for location
    information (using the locationRequest message), described in the base HTTP Enabled
    Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the source IP address of arriving
    message as a pointer to the location determination process. This is sufficient
    in environments where the location of a Device can be determined based on its
    IP address. Two additional use cases are addresses by this document. In the first,
    location configuration requires additional or alternative identifiers from the
    source IP address provided in the request. In the second, an entity other than
    the Device requests the location of the Device. This document extends the HELD
    protocol to allow the location request message to carry Device identifiers. Privacy
    and security considerations describe the conditions where requests containing
    identifiers are permitted.</p>"
