abstract:
- content: <p>In addition to its use as a subnetwork layer for IP (e.g., via RFC 7668),
    in various IoT web applications Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can serve as a "local
    interconnect", connecting devices locally (i.e., not over IP) for use as a source
    of information and a target for actuation. In order to fully use these capabilities
    in applications using web technologies, there is a need for a method for addressing
    the resources, i.e., a URI scheme, and definition of the representation of the
    data exchanged between the application and devices, i.e., media types. This document
    is a straw man proposal for such a URI scheme and media types for interacting
    with the Bluetooth GAP and GATT protocols.</p>
