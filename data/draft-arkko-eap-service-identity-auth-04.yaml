abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP is typically used in an arrangement where the actual service (such
    as a wireless LAN access point) is separated from the authentication server. However,
    EAP itself does not have a concept of a service identity or its parameters, and
    thus the client usually does not authenticate any information about the service
    itself, even when a mutually authenticating EAP method is used. This document
    specifies a backward compatible extension to popular EAP methods for authenticating
    service related information, such as the identity and type of the offered service.
    A common parameter name space is created in order to ensure that the same kinds
    of identifiers can be authenticated independent of the choice of the EAP authentication
    method, retaining the EAP media independence principle.</p>"
