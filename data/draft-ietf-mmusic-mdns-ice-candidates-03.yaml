abstract:
- content: "<p>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of
    creating peer-to-peer connections. To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer
    connection, the endpoint's local IP addresses are included in this candidate collection.
    However, these addresses are typically private and, as such, their disclosure
    has privacy implications. This document describes a privacy-preserving way to
    share local IP addresses with other endpoints by concealing the addresses with
    dynamically generated Multicast DNS (mDNS) names.</p>"
