abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes syntax for conveying key origin attestation
    information to a Certification Authority (CA) or other entity, so that they may
    decide how much trust to place in the management of the private key. For example,
    a reliant party may use this information to support a decision about whether to
    issue a certificate. In contrast to other key attestation formats, the one defined
    in this document requires only ASN.1 and the standard PKIX modules.</p>"
