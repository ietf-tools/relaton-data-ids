abstract:
- content: "<p>TrustChain is a protocol for a networked datastructure, designed to
    act as a trust ledger. This protocol acts as a decentral alternative to platforms
    like eBay, Airbnb, and Uber. It is specifically designed to record transactions
    among strangers without central control, support high transaction volumes, be
    application neutral, and avoid vendor lock-in. The protocol defines recording
    transactions in an ordered list using an append-only datastructure, a new communication
    overlay, and a horizontally scalable consensus protocol based on checkpoint consensus,
    called CHECO. Trustchain has resistance to traditional blockchain attacks, such
    as the 51 percent majority attack. This is achieved by using a graph-based append-only
    datastructure combined with a personal blockchain for each participant with their
    own genesis block.</p>"
