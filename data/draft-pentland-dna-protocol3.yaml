abstract:
- content: "<p>Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the following
    two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link to identify
    the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers on the link to consistently
    respond to such a query with minimal delay (Fast RA). Solving the link identification
    based strictly on RFC 2461 is difficult because of the flexibilities offered to
    routers in terms of prefixes advertised in a router advertisement (RA) message.
    Similarly, the random delay in responding to router solicitation messages imposed
    by RFC 2461 makes to it difficult to achieve fast RA. In this memo, an integrated
    solution is presented. Monitoring of prefixes by both hosts and routers is used
    to achieve link identification while router advertisements are sent rapidly in
    a deterministic order by combining router solicitation source addresses with hash-based
    router tokens.</p>"
