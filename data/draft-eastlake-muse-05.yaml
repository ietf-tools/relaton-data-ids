abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure electronic mail can provide authentication of the source of
    mail and confidentiality for its contents. These features are becoming increasingly
    important as the Internet grows exponentially and email is increasingly used for
    critical, sensitive, and confidential communications. In addition, authentication
    can make mail filtering more effective and ubiquitous encryption indirectly makes
    all mail more secure be defeating traffic analysis based on distinctions between
    encrypted and non-encrypted mail and defeating bulk searching through insecure
    mail. However, use of secure mail is not widespread due to the problems of key
    distribution and lack of migration to secure mail enabled user agents. This draft
    proposes partial solutions to these two problems by using coarser grained identity
    to permit some authentication and confidentiality without user agent change, and
    secure DNS for key distribution. These changes also support limited host and domain
    level mail security policies.</p>"
