abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS was designed to have as few hard upper limits as possible to allow
    for future extensibility. However, the lack of a clear upper limit leads to vulnerabilities,
    and several attack methods have been reported. This document proposes reasonable
    upper-limit values for DNS protocols as a Best Current Practice.</p>"
