abstract:
- content: "<p>Transaction Tokens (Txn-Tokens) enable workloads in a trusted domain
    to ensure that user identity and authorization context of an external programmatic
    request, such as an API invocation, is preserved and available to all workloads
    that are invoked as part of processing such a request. Txn-Tokens also enable
    workloads within the trusted domain to optionally immutably assert to downstream
    workloads that they were invoked in the call chain of the request.</p>"
