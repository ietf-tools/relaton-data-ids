abstract:
- content: "<p>In a SDN environment, path computation element protocol(PCEP)(RFC 5440)
    is used between a controller and the network devices, using which controller can
    setup and tear down Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) based label switched
    paths(LSPs) in the network having Path Computation Client (PCC) as Label Switched
    Router (LSR). Draft draft-sivabalan-pce-segment-routing extends PCEP specification
    in order to support setup and teardown of Segment Routing(SR) Label Switched Path(LSR).
    In a mixed environment where some of the LSPs are setup using PCEP use RSVP and
    some LSPs are based on Segment routing(SR). The specifications lacks a method
    to advertise the LSP preference to use one type of LSP over other when those are
    setup using PCEP. This draft defines a method to advertise the preference for
    any LSP setup by PCEP. This document proposes new optional TLV that can be used
    to announce the preference of LSP which is being setup using PCEP.</p>"
