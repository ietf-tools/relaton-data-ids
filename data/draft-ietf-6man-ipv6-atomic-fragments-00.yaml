abstract:
- content: <p>The IPv6 specification allows packets to contain a Fragment Header without
    the packet being actually fragmented into multiple pieces. Such packets typically
    result from hosts that have received an ICMPv6 "Packet Too Big" error message
    that advertises a "Next-Hop MTU" smaller than 1280 bytes, and are currently processed
    by some implementations as "fragmented traffic". Thus, by forging ICMPv6 "Packet
    Too Big" error messages an attacker can cause hosts to employ "atomic fragments",
    and then launch any fragmentation-based attacks against such traffic. This document
    discusses the generation of the aforementioned "atomic fragments", the corresponding
    security implications, and formally updates RFC 2460 and RFC 5722 such that fragmentation-based
    attack vectors against traffic employing "atomic fragments" are completely eliminated.</p>
