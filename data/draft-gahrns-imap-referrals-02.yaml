abstract:
- content: "<p>When dealing with large amounts of users, messages and geographically
    dispersed IMAP4 [RFC-2060] servers, it is often desirable to distribute messages
    amongst different servers within an organization. For example an administrator
    may choose to store user's personal mailboxes on a local IMAP4 server, while storing
    shared mailboxes remotely on another server. This type of configuration is common
    when it is uneconomical to store all data centrally due to limited bandwidth or
    disk resources. Additionally, users may be frequently moved from one IMAP4 server
    to another because of hardware failures or organizational changes. Referrals allow
    clients to seamlessly access mailboxes that are distributed across several IMAP4
    servers or to transparently connect to an alternate IMAP4 server. A referral mechanism
    can provide efficiencies over the alternative 'proxy method', in which the local
    IMAP4 server contacts the remote server on behalf of the client, and then transfers
    the data from the remote server to itself, and then on to the client. The referral</p>"
