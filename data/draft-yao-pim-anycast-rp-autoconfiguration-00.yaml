abstract:
- content: "<p>Anycast RP (Rendezvous Point) is widely supported by router vendors.
    Each RP in the anycast RP set is configured with the RP Address (RPA), and the
    addresses of all members/routers in the anycast-RP set. If the number of anycast
    RP members is more than 1, manual configuration of RP information is prone to
    inconsistency which can cause connectivity problems, especially when the addresses
    are IPv6 address or the members of anycast RP set need to be changed (e.g.some
    new members are added, or some old members are removed from the anycast RP set).
    Aiming to this problem, this document provides a mechanism to automatically configure
    anycast RP members/routers. In this mechanism,only one RP member/router in the
    anycast RP set needs to be configured firstly, so it knows the anycast RP address
    and the addresses of all members in the anycast RP set. It sends anycast RP configuration
    information (including the anycast RP address and an address list) to each of
    other member in the anycast-RP set. Other members will check the information and
    configure itself after receiving the anycast RP configuration information,and
    respond the firstly configured RP with checking results and configuration results.</p>"
