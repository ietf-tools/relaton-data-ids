abstract:
- content: "<p>Modulated optical interfaces with coherent detection receivers are
    in widespread use in Internet networking equipment. Various implementations are
    in deployment since 2012 but there is no standard available defining those interfaces,
    nor their capabilities. This document identifies the need for work on control
    plane aspects pre- standard coherent optical DWDM applications.</p>"
