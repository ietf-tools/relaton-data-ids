abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the One Way Latency (OWL) utilization for enhancing
    multipath TCP (MPTCP) transmission, which is a potential and beneficial technology
    in MPTCP Working Group (WG). Several representative usages of OWL, such as retransmission
    policy, crucial data scheduling, are analyzed. Two kinds of OWL measurement approaches
    are also provided and compared. We believe that more explorations related with
    OWL will be important for MPTCP.</p>"
