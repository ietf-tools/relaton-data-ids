abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC encrypts its Initial Packets using keys derived from well-known
    constants, meaning that observers can inspect the contents of these packets and
    successfully spoof them. This document proposes a new version of QUIC that encrypts
    Initial Packets more securely by leveraging a Public Key distributed via the Domain
    Name System (DNS) or other out-of-band system. Discussion of this work is encouraged
    to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository
    which contains the draft: https://github.com/martinduke/quic-version-aliasing.</p>"
