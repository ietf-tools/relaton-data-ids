abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides an architectural framework, called IPv6
    Label Switching Architecture or 6LSA, for an end-to-end, IP-centric packet transmission
    technique that uses the IPv6 packet header Flow Label to establish IPv6-based
    label switched paths. The label switched paths, called 6LSPs, provide application
    and user specified routes for efficient transport of packets and as means for
    quality of service (QoS) delivery, IPv4 tunneling, VPN and other mechanisms. Through
    look-ups of 20-bit labels instead of 128-bit IPv6 addresses, the architecture
    may provide potential memory and processing savings, the latter through significantly
    reduced address fetches for the low- powered, handheld devices. The label has
    two components comprising Global Label value and Local Label value. The Global
    Label value from the source is delivered to the destination unmodified. However,
    the intermediate network nodes in 6LSA are allowed to temporarily replace the
    Local Label value with a value of local significance. This enables 6LSA flows
    to be hop-specific although session-based and as such a unique QoS delivery technique
    for bandwidth constrained media. 6LSA also enhances security since label generation
    and assignment algorithms can be modified periodically. Finally, it must be pointed
    out that the 6LSA concept of temporary flow label assignment is applicable to
    the 6LSA domain only. The concept is not applicable to domains outside the 6LSA.</p>"
