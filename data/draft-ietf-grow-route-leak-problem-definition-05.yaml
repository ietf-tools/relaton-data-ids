abstract:
- content: <p>A systemic vulnerability of the Border Gateway Protocol routing system,
    known as 'route leaks', has received significant attention in recent years. Frequent
    incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet routing are labeled
    "route leaks", but to date a common definition of the term has been lacking. This
    document provides a working definition of route leaks, keeping in mind the real
    occurrences that have received significant attention. Further, this document attempts
    to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on
    observed events on the Internet. The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers
    several forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern to Internet
    user community as well as the network operator community.</p>
