abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) and its corresponding protocol
    extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do stateful control of Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP). One
    application that stateful PCE can realize is data traffic reoptimization among
    the LSPs. Data traffic traversed in a LSP can be switched to another PCE-initiated
    LSP. Moreover, data traffic can be balanced to multiple PCE-initiated LSPs and
    may also be policed based on a signaling bandwidth of a PCE-Initiated LSP using
    stateful PCE. This document specifies the extensions to Path Computation Element
    Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to do switchover, balancing and policing
    of data traffic with PCE-initiated LSPs. This document also specifies the extensions,
    usage and handling of stateful PCEP messages and the expected behavior of PCC
    as the RSVP-TE headend.</p>"
