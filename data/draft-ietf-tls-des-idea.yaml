abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC
    4346) include cipher suites based on DES (Data Encryption Standard) and IDEA (International
    Data Encryption Algorithm) algorithms. DES (when used in single-DES mode) and
    IDEA are no longer recommended for general use in TLS, and have been removed from
    TLS version 1.2 (RFC 5246). This document specifies these cipher suites for completeness
    and discusses reasons why their use is no longer recommended. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
