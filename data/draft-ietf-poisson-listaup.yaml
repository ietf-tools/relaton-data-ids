abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
    furthers the development and specification of Internet technology through discussion
    of technical issues, and hosts discussions of IETF direction, policy, meetings,
    and procedures. As this is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude
    is allowed. Advertising, whether to solicit business or promote employment opportunities,
    falls well outside the range of acceptable topics, as do discussions of a personal
    nature. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
