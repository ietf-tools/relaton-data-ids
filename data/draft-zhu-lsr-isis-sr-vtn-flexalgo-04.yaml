abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
    underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used as the underlay
    for one or a group of VPN+ services. The topological constraints of a VTN can
    be defined using Flex-Algo. In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated
    with a unique Flex-Algo, and the set of network resources allocated to a VTN can
    be instantiated as layer-2 sub-interfaces or member links of the layer-3 interfaces.
    This document describes the mechanisms to build the SR based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo
    and IGP L2 bundle with minor extensions.</p>"
