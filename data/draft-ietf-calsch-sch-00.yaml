abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a MIME message format for openly scheduling meetings
    with others across the Internet. This definition is independent of any particular
    scheduling application. A new MIME Content-Type 'APPLICATION/CALENDAR' is defined
    to contain scheduling data, including appointments, appointment requests for single
    events, appointment requests for recurring events, appointment responses. The
    scope of this revision of the draft is the MIME format for meeting requests and
    responses. This the 'on the wire' format; no attempt is made to define the storage
    format for the calendar information.</p>"
