abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a framework for interoperation between the Context
    Transfer Protocol (CTP) and the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) protocols. The
    main goals we are trying to achieve are: to provide a seamless handover, to establish
    QoS and other states required by NSIS, to have this process appropriately secured,
    and to tradeoff between security, complexity and performance.</p>"
