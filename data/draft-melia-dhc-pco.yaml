abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to convey Protocol Configuration Options
    (PCO) [24008] from/to the access network to/from the Mobile Node (MN). There are
    scenarios defined in 3GPP (TS 23.402) and WiMax forum NWG where the mobile node
    accessing the non-3GPP trusted system needs to convey such information to the
    Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) functionality implemented in the serving gateway
    (S-GW). The MAG requires the PCO field to send such information to the Local Mobility
    Agent (LMA) (implemented in the PDN gateway, P-GW) in a Proxy Binding Update (PBU)
    message. PCO options are exchanged between the MN and the LMA to transport information
    such as P-CSCF address, DNS server address.</p>"
