abstract:
- content: "<p>Experience has shown that it is extremely difficult to deploy proper
    PKIX certificates for TLS in multi-tenanted environments, since certification
    authorities will not issue certificates for hosted domains to hosting services,
    hosted domains do not want hosting services to hold their private keys, and hosting
    services wish to avoid liability for holding those keys. As a result, domains
    hosted in multi-tenanted environments often deploy non-HTTP applications such
    as email and instant messaging using certificates that identify the hosting service,
    not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept
    a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in obvious security implications.
    This document defines two methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for
    proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. The first method
    enables the TLS client associated with a user agent or peer application server
    to obtain the end-entity certificate of a hosted domain over secure HTTP as an
    alternative to standard PKIX techniques. The second method enables a hosted domain
    to securely delegate a non-HTTP application to a hosting service using redirects
    provided by HTTPS itself or by a pointer in a file served over HTTPS at the hosted
    domain. While this approach was developed for use in the Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association prooftype, it can be
    applied to any non-HTTP application protocol.</p>"
