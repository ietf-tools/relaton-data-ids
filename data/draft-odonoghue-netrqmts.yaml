- content: "<p>The IETF Meeting Network has become integral to the success of any
    physical IETF meeting. Building such a network, which provides service to thousands
    of heavy users and their multitude of devices, spread throughout the event venue,
    with very little time for setup and testing is a challenge. This document provides
    a set of requirements, derived from hard won experience, as an aid to anyone involved
    in designing and deploying such future networks.</p>"
