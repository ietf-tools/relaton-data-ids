abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The user
    of DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of all features provided by SCTP and its
    extensions, especially support of o multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking.
    o multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance. o unordered delivery.
    o partial reliable data transfer.</p>"
