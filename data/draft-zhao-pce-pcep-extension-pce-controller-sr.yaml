abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across
    a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic
    demands. PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs),
    which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element
    Communication Protocol (PCEP). But SDN has a broader applicability than signaled
    (G)MPLS traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine
    paths in a range of use cases. PCEP has been proposed as a control protocol for
    use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller.
    A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed
    control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely
    replacing it. Thus, the LSP can be calculated/set up/initiated and the label forwarding
    entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network
    device along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as
    possible. This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions when a PCE-based
    controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions on the routers,
    in addition to computing the paths for packet flows in a segment routing (SR)
    network and telling the edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as
    they enter the network. PCECC is further enhanced for SR SID (Segment Identifier)
    allocation and distribution.</p>"
