- content: "<p>This document describes a secure key exchange scheme that extends the
    Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) [RFC6238] de facto enrollment method to prevent
    compromise of the non-expiring TOTP key by photographic capture of the QR code
    or by intentional or unintentional persistence of the key string in email, SMS,
    or other systems outside of the TOTP authenticator system itself.</p>"
