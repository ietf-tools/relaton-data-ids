abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC8402 introduces Segment Routing architecture that leverages source
    routing and tunneling paradigms and can be directly applied to the Multi Protocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) data plane. A node steers a packet through a controlled
    set of instructions called segments, by prepending the packet with Segment Routing
    header. SR architecture defines different types of segments with different forwarding
    semantics associated. RFC8287 defines the extensions to MPLS LSP Ping and Traceroute
    for Segment Routing IGP-Prefix and IGP-Adjacency Segment Identifier (SIDs) with
    an MPLS data plane. RFC8287 defines the Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs and the procedures
    to apply RFC8029 on SR architecture with MPLS data plane. This document defines
    the Target FEC Stack Sub-TLVs and the extension required for other SR Segments.</p>"
