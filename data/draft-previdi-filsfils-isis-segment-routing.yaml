abstract:
- content: '<p>Segment Routing (SR) enables any node to select any path (explicit
    or derived from IGPs SPT computations) for each of its traffic classes. The path
    does not depend on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (neither LDP nor RSVP). It
    only depends on a set of "segments" that are advertised by the IS-IS routing protocol.
    These segments act as topological sub-paths that can be combined together to form
    the desired path. There are two forms of segments: node and adjacency. A node
    segment represents a path to a node. An adjacency segment represents a specific
    adjacency to a node. A node segment is typically a multi- hop path while an adjacency
    segment is a one-hop path. SR''s control- plane can be applied to IPv6 and MPLS
    dataplanes. Segment Routing control-plane can be applied to the MPLS dataplane:
    a node segment to node N is instantiated in the MPLS dataplane as an LSP along
    the shortest-path (SPT) to the node. An adjacency segment is instantiated in the
    MPLS dataplane as a cross-connect entry pointing to a specific egress datalink.
    This document describes the Segment Routing functions, a set of use cases it addresses
    and the necessary changes that are required in the IS-IS protocol.</p>'
