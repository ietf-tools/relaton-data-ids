- content: "<p>This memo describes the lifecycle of MUD as seen from the perspective
    of a network operator. It is informational and intended to help provide perspective
    around the operation of a network which connects MUD-supporting devices and uses
    MUD- supporting network infrastructure. All phases of network operation that involves
    or affects MUD will be described. Considerations specific to device manufacturers
    will be described elsewhere. Considerations relevant to network equipment manufacturers
    and networking software authors will be described where appropriate where MUD
    behavior is affected.</p>"
