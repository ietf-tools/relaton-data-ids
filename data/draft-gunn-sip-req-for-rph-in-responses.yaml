abstract:
- content: <p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource Priority Header (RPH),
    in its current form, is ignored in SIP responses. This was a design choice during
    RFC 4412's development. This is now considered a bad design choice in certain
    scenarios. The Internet Draft "Allowing SIP Resource Priority Header in SIP Responses"
    (draft-polk-sip-rph-in-responses-00) describes a modification to RFC4412 to permit
    RPH in responses. This document describes one of the requirements associated with
    systems using RPH, that could be satisfied by the modification of RFC 4412 to
    permit RPH on responses, and is not easily met by other methods. This ID provides
    additional motivation for SIP RPH in Responses. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
    "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</p>
