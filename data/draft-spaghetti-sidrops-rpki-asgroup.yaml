abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected
    content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to carry
    a general-purpose listing of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) and/or pointers
    to other groupings of ASNs, called an ASGroup. Additionally, the document specifies
    a mechanism for ASN holders to opt-out of being listed in a given ASGroup. The
    objective is to offer a RPKI-based successor to plain-text RFC 2622 'as-set' class
    objects. When validated, an ASGroup confirms that the respective ASN holder produced
    the ASGroup object.</p>"
