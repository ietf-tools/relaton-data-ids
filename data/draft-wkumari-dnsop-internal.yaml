abstract:
- content: '<p>It has become clear that many users would like to use the DNS resolution
    system for names which do not have meaning in the global context but do have meaning
    in a context internal to their network. This document reserves the string ".internal"
    for this purpose. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background
    information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc. They
    will be removed before publication. RFC Editor: Please remove these before publication.
    ] [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-internal.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ] [ Ed note: This document
    is intended to drive discussion. It is clear that there has been a desire for
    an "RFC 1918-style" TLD for a long time; in its absence, people have just started
    using whatever seemed convenient. This document requests that the allocation of
    .internal for this use. There is no existing process for this - some of the purpose
    of this document is to explore the process implications. ]</p>'
