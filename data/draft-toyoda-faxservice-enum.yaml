abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the functional specification and the definition
    of the ENUM NAPTR record, for IFax service. IFax is 'Facsimile using Internet
    Mail'. For this use, the DNS returns the email address of the referenced IFax
    system. This mechanism allows email-based fax communication to use telephone numbers,
    rather than requiring that the sender already know the recipient email address.</p>"
