abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5888 defines a mechanism for semantically grouping media sections
    in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). One difficulty that has arisen in several
    applications of SDP is the need to uniquely identify these groups either in other
    protocols or elsewhere in the SDP itself. This document proposes a simple, backwards-compatible
    mechanism that provides unambiguous identifiers for RFC 5888 groups. This document
    updates RFC 5888.</p>"
