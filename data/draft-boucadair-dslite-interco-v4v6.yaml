abstract:
- content: "<p>Dual-Stack lite requires that the AFTR must have IPv4 connectivity.
    This forbids a service provider who wants to deploy AFTR in an IPv6- only network.
    This memo proposes an extension to implement a stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation
    in the AFTR so that AFTR can be deployed in an IPv6-only network.</p>"
