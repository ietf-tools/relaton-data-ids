abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications, which
    have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to
    provide a desired resource. This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect
    performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the
    topological distance. The ultimate goal is to improve performance (or Quality
    of Experience) in the application while reducing resource consumption in the underlying
    network infrastructure. The present document addresses the case of ALTO transactions
    involving a peers connected via a mobile core network. It proposes specific scopes
    and use cases for mobile core networks and as a first step, properties of paths
    and endpoints that allow to facilitate ALTO transaction within such a scope.</p>"
