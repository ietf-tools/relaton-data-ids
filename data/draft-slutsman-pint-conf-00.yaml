abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents contains the description of Conference Call Services
    for PINT (CCSP) and defines the procedures for invoking PSTN teleconferencing
    services from an IP host. In addition, CCSP allows for the following options:
    o automated negotiation of conference parameters, such as date, agenda, and etc.,
    before the PSTN resources are committed; o monitoring the real-time conference
    status, such as keeping track of participants leaving/joining the conference bridge.
    The document also provides the list of basic APIs to support CCSP. Mapping these
    APIs into appropriate PINT protocol(s) messages would be addressed in the forthcoming
    documents. This document is intended for the PSTN-Internet Interworking (PINT)
    working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and
    SHOULD be addressed to the working group's mailing list at pint@lists.research.bell-labs.com
    and/or the authos.</p>"
