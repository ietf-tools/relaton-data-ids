abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profiles for
    compression of RTP/UDP-Lite/IP packets (Real-Time Transport Protocol, User Datagram
    Protocol Lite, Internet Protocol) and UDP-Lite/IP. These profiles are defined
    based on their differences with the profiles specified in [RFC-3095] for UDP [RFC-768].
    Although both transport protocols are very similar, ROHC profiles must be defined
    separately for robust compression of UDP-Lite headers because it does not share
    protocol identifier with UDP. Also, the UDP-Lite Checksum Coverage field does
    not share the semantics of the corresponding UDP Length field and as a consequence
    cannot always be inferred anymore.</p>"
