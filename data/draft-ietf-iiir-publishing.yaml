- content: "<p>Anonymous FTP Archives are a popular method of making material available
    to the Internet user community. This document specifies a range of indexing information
    that can be used to describe the contents and services provided by such archives.
    This information can be used directly by the user community when visiting parts
    of the archive. Furthermore, automatic indexing tools can gather and index this
    information, thus making it easier for users to find and access it.</p>"
