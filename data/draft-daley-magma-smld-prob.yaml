abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) is used by IPv6 routers to discover
    the presence of multicast listeners (i.e. nodes that wish to receive multicast
    packets) on their directly attached links, and to discover which multicast addresses
    are of interest to those neighbouring nodes. The existing protocol specification
    (MLDv2) discusses the effects of on-link forgery of MLD packets but provides no
    protection from on-link attacks. By taking advantage of or abusing Multicast Listener
    Discovery, bogus devices may cause incorrect state and disruption to multicast
    or unicast packet delivery. This memo considers the trust models for the MLD protocols,
    and their interaction as well as their interaction with link-layer and multicast
    proxy devices. It provides a security and threat analysis for each model.</p>"
