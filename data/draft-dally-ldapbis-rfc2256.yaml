abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object
    classes defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the IS0/IEC 9594 and
    X.500 documents, in particular those intended for use by directory clients. This
    is the most widely used schema for LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema
    definitions for white pages objects use it as a basis. This document does not
    cover attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, nor does
    it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.</p>"
