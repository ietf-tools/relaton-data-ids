abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a credential service that allows Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UAs) to use a SIP event package to discover the certificates
    of other users. This mechanism allows User Agents that want to contact a given
    Address-of-Record (AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the
    credential service, which returns an authenticated response containing that certificate.
    The credential service also allows users to store and retrieve their own certificates
    and private keys. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
