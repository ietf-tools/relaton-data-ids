abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to use the SIP REFER method and the dialog
    package to manipulate conversations, dialogs, and sessions on remote User Agents.
    Specifically it extends the REFER mechanism to allow the specification of a response
    that a UA should send in a dialog. This functionality is most useful for collections
    of loosely coupled User Agents that wish to present a coordinated user experience.
    It does not require a Third-Party Call Control controller to be involved in any
    of the manipulated dialogs.</p>"
