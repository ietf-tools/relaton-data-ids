abstract:
- content: "<p>There are scenarios in which home agent initiated flow binding operations
    towards the mobile node is needed such as revoking a flow binding or moving a
    flow from one interface to another because of network resource availability. This
    document defines one new Mobility Header, two messages, several actions and two
    new sub- options to perform home agent initiated interactions for flow bindings
    in a mobile node. Home agent initiated flow bindings are supported for both IPv4
    and IPv6 enabled mobile nodes.</p>"
