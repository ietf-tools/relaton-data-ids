abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling required
    to support a upstream label set when a bidirectional path is set up. In the existing
    drafts on GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling, a upstream label for the upstream path has
    to be reserved at an intermediate node before Path message is transmitted to the
    next-hop node. On the other hand, a label set that includes one or more labels
    for the downstream path is carried by Path message and then Resv message reserves
    a label at each interme- diate node on the route or a source node. This document
    proposes the way to support the upstream label set as is the case of the Label
    Set for downstream.</p>"
