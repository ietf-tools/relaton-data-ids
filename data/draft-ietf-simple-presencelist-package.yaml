- content: "<p>This document presents a SIP event package for subscribing to a list
    of presentities. Instead of the subscriber sending a SUBSCRIBE to each presentity
    individually, the subscriber can subscribe to their presence list as a whole,
    and then receive notifications when the state of any of the presentities on the
    list changes.</p>"
