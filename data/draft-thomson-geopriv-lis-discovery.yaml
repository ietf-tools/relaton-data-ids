- content: "<p>A method is described for the discovery of a Location Information Server.
    The method consists of attempting to use a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) option, followed by a URI-enabled NAPTR (U-NAPTR). DHCP options are defined
    for both IPv4 and IPv6 DHCP. This document also defines a U-NAPTR Application
    Service for a LIS, with a specific Application Protocol for the HTTP Enabled Location
    Delivery (HELD) protocol.</p>"
