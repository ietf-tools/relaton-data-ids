abstract:
- content: "<p>As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul network,
    automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path becomes very important.
    But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE path, explicit path or affinity property
    has to be introduced for the path computation. This causes the complexity of MPLS
    TE path design. The document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF extensions
    to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path. MPLS TE networks are divided
    into different traffic engineering layers and areas according to the characteristics
    of the network topology. MPLS TE path can compute automatically based on traffic
    engineering layers and areas to satisfy major requirements to bear mobile network
    services.</p>"
