abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861 going back to RFC 1970) was defined
    at a time when link-local multicast was as reliable and with the same network
    cost (send a packet on a yellow-coax Ethernet) as unicast and where the hosts
    were assumed to be always on and connected. Since 1996 we've seen a significant
    change with both an introduction of wireless networks and battery operated devices,
    which poses significant challenges for the old assumptions. We are also seeing
    datacenter networks where virtual machines are not always on and connected, and
    scaling of multicast can be challenging. This specification contains extensions
    to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery which remove most use of multicast and make sleeping
    hosts more efficient. The specification includes a default mixed mode where a
    link can have an arbitrary mix of hosts and/or routers - some implementing legacy
    Neighbor Discovery and some implementing the optimizations in this specification.
    The optimizations provide incremental benefits to hosts as soon as the first updated
    routers are deployed on a link.</p>"
