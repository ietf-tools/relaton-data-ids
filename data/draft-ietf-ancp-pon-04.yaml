abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of the Access
    Node Control mechanism to PON-based broadband access. The need for an Access Node
    Control mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex
    (a combination of Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network Termination
    (ONT) elements) is described in a multi-service reference architecture in order
    to perform QoS-related, service-related and Subscriber-related operations. The
    Access Node Control mechanism is also extended for interaction between components
    of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control mechanism will
    ensure that the transmission of information between the NAS and Access Node Complex
    (ANX) and between the OLT and ONT within an ANX does not need to go through distinct
    element managers but rather uses a direct device-to-device communication and stays
    on net. This allows for performing access link related operations within those
    network elements to meet performance objectives.</p>"
