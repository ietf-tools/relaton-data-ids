abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the Sonet/SDH traffic engineering extensions
    required for existing IGP protocols in support of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) signalling
    as defined in [RFC-3471] and [GMPLS-SONET-SDH]. Using [GMPLS-RTG] as guideline,
    this memo specifies the GMPLS routing traffic engineering extensions to ISIS for
    Sonet/SDH networks. Based on the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions defined in
    [ISIS- TE], the proposed approach is aligned with link bundling as defined in
    [MPLS-BDL] and extends the set of Extended IS Reachability sub- TLVs proposed
    in [GMPLS-ISIS] to Sonet/SDH networks. The proposed extensions do not preclude
    any further integration with the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor specified
    in [GMPLS-ISIS].</p>"
