abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes security threats for the larger (intra-domain,
    or inter-domain) multicast routing infrastructures. Only Protocol Independent
    Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its three main operational modes:
    the traditional Any Source Multicast (ASM) model, Source-Specific Multicast (SSM)
    model, and the ASM model enhanced by the Embedded RP group-to-RP mapping mechanism.
    This memo also describes enhancements to the protocol operations to mitigate these
    threats.</p>"
