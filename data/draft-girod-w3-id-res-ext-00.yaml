abstract:
- content: "<p>WIRE extends HTTP with a new type of redirect response that permits
    a resolver to explicitly delegate a resolution to other resolvers and protocols.
    WIRE is an effort to make delegation more explicit, redirection more flexible,
    and resolution processes more efficient through the use of hints. This document
    defines WIRE and describes the expected behaviors of resolvers and clients using
    WIRE. WIRE is an extension of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and is intended
    to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 and above [4][5]. WIRE encourages use of long-lived
    URIs and at the same time supports protocol evolution without having to change
    currently deployed URIs or URI schemes. The extension is based on a simple URI
    resolution model that allows an application to dynamically request metadata describing
    where and how to access a resource. The model can use any generic metadata description
    language (e.g. RDF) and as the metadata itself is interpreted as a first class
    resource, metadata resources are no different than any other resource on the Web.</p>"
