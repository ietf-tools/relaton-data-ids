abstract:
- content: "<p>This document's goal is to organize the discussion of a potential 'Internet
    Scale Event Notification Service' (ISENS) working group effort by defining a model
    of Event Notification Service (ENS), identifying a taxonomy of design choices
    and their tradeoffs, sketching some usage scenarios, and briefly evaluating a
    host of candidate solutions, old and new. [NOTE: this edition is largely unchanged
    from an August 13th, 1998 draft presented at the Chicago NOTIFY BOF.]</p>"
