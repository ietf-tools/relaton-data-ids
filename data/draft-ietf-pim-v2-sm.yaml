abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for efficiently routing to multicast
    groups that may span wide-area (and inter-domain) internets. We refer to the approach
    as Protocol Independent Multicast--Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) because it is not dependent
    on any particular unicast routing protocol, and because it is designed to support
    sparse groups as defined in [1][2]. This document describes the protocol details.
    For the motivation behind the design and a description of the architecture, see
    [1][2]. Section 2 summarizes PIM-SM operation. It describes the protocol from
    a network perspective, in particular, how the participating routers interact to
    create and maintain the multicast distribution tree. Section 3 describes PIM-SM
    operations from the perspective of a single router implementing the protocol;
    this section constitutes the main body of the protocol specification. It is organized
    according to PIM-SM message type; for each message type we describe its contents,
    its generation, and its processing.</p>"
