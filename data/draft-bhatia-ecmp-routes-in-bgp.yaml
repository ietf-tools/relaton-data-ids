abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extensible mechanism that will allow a BGP
    [BGP4] speaker to advertise ECMP routes for a destination to its peers. It uses
    an existing, Multi Hop Capability [M-HOP], to advertise multiple paths that it
    is using to its peers. The mechanism described in this document is only applicable
    to routers that have the ability to inject multiple routing entries in their forwarding
    table.</p>"
