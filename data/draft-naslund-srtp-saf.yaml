abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the use of so called store-and-forward cryptographic
    transforms within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). The motivation
    is to support use cases when two end-points communicate via one (or more) store-and-forward
    middleboxes that are not fully trusted to access the media content. One of the
    main aspects of the transform is to make the confidentiality and message authentication
    independent of the RTP header. Another central aspect is to enable identification
    of the cryptographic context (keys etc.). Besides the security of the end- points,
    also trust assumptions regarding the store-and-forward middleboxes are addressed.</p>"
