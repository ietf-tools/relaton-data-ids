abstract:
- content: "<p>As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul network,
    automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path becomes very important.
    But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE path, explicit path or affinity property
    has to be introduced for the path computation. This causes the complexity of MPLS
    TE path design. The document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF and
    ISIS extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path. MPLS TE
    networks are divided into different traffic engineering layers and areas according
    to the characteristics of the network topology. MPLS TE path can compute automatically
    based on traffic engineering layers and areas to satisfy major requirements to
    bear mobile network services.</p>"
