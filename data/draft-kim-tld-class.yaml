abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a structural organization of Internet top level
    domain names based on the International Schedule of Classes of Goods and Services.
    This structure intends to provide a framework for classification such that web
    content providers can differentiate their goods and services and minimize the
    probability of name confusion and collision. Under each class, as specified by
    the International Schedule of Classes of Goods and Services, single or multiple
    top level domain names should be specified each appropriately partitioning the
    class of goods or service into an appropriate sub-categorization. A method will
    further be described to incorporate additions/modifications as becomes necessary
    by as of yet unforseen future developments. This document does not address the
    delegation or the administration of top level domain names which the author feels
    should be considered separately. However, the author does acknowledge that some
    form of centralized authority should be in place to properly control the structure
    to be described.</p>"
