abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of a P-Original-Dialog-ID
    header. The header is used to correlate two different dialogs across a B2BUA that
    is non-transparent to dialogs. The contents of the header identify the original
    dialog (Call-id, From tag, To tag) associated with the SIP entity that inserted
    the header into a request. When the same instance of the header is received at
    that SIP entity in a different request, then it is used to correlate the two different
    dialogs.</p>"
