abstract:
- content: "<p>ACTN is a practical approach to repurpose existing and well-defined
    technologies, and underpinning them with SDN principle. It provides a hierarchal
    architecture to scale and support multi-vendor multi- domain interworking using
    RESTconf(YANG Model)/PCEP/BGP-LS. This document contains a test case proposal
    focused multi-domain, multi-vendor interoperation test cases for the ACTN framework.
    These test cases cover four test scenarios, including topology abstraction, E2E
    service provisioning, DC load balancing and inter- domain restoration, to demonstrate
    the fundamental ideas of the ACTN framework and standards.</p>"
