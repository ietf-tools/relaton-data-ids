abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success
    in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive,
    IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions,
    but it also has been extended to better fit the specificities of the different
    use cases. For Internet addressing in particular, as it is defined in RFC 791
    for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist many extensions. Those
    extensions have been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities beyond the
    basic properties of Internet addressing. This document proposes a set of use cases
    showcasing the continuing need to extend the Internet addressing model and the
    methods used for doing so. It further outlines the properties of Internet addressing
    as a baseline against which the extensions are categorized in terms of methodology
    used to extend the addressing model, together with examples of solutions doing
    so. The most important aspect of the analysis and discussion in this document
    is that it represents a snapshot of the discussion that took place in the IETF
    (on various mailing lists and several meetings) in the early 2020s. While the
    community did not converge on specific actions to be taken, the content of this
    document may nonetheless be of use at some point in the future should the community
    decides so.</p>"
