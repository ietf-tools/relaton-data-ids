abstract:
- content: <p>Many service providers offer "BGP/MPLS IP VPN" service to their customers.
    Existing IETF standards specify the procedures and protocols that a service provider
    uses in order to offer this service to customers who have IP unicast and IP multicast
    traffic in their VPNs. It is also desirable to be able to support customers who
    have MPLS multicast traffic in their VPNs. This document specifies the procedures
    and protocol extensions that are needed to support customers who use the Multicast
    Extensions to Label Distribution Protocol (mLDP) as the control protocol for their
    MPLS multicast traffic. Existing standards do provide some support for customers
    who use mLDP, but only under a restrictive set of circumstances. This document
    generalizes the existing support to include all cases where the customer uses
    mLDP, without any restrictions.</p>
