abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP servers
    to cryptographically bind security tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens) to
    TLS connections. We describe both first-party and federated scenarios. In a first-
    party scenario, an HTTP server is able to cryptographically bind the security
    tokens that it issues to a client -- and that the client subsequently returns
    to the server -- to the TLS connection between the client and the server. Such
    bound security tokens are protected from misuse, since the server can generally
    detect if they are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other TLS connections.
    Federated Token Bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically
    bind security tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a different
    server than the one issuing the token. This document is a companion document to
    "The Token Binding Protocol Version 1.0" (RFC 8471).</p>
