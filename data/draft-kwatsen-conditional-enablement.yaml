abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a cross-cutting technique whereby a NETCONF server
    can support conditional enablement of configuration nodes. That is, whether the
    node is active or not depends on the evaluation of an expression. Two expression
    types are defined herein, one for latent configuration (present but not actualized)
    and another for temporal configuration (actualized based on time). This soluton
    presented is extensible so that additional expression types may be added in the
    future.</p>"
