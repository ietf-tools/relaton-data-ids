abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents discusses the use of ALTO proxies running on home devices
    such as gateways or home NAS servers. An ALTO home proxy caches ALTO information
    obtained from an origin ALTO server, and uses that information to serve queries
    originating from the home network. ALTO home proxies reduce ALTO traffic and query
    latency, improve scalability, and enhance user privacy.</p>"
