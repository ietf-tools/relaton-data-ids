abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Function Virtualization (NFV), conceptualized by the European
    Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) NFV Industry Specification Group
    (ISG) , is gaining significant momentum within the the telecoms industry. A key
    area currently being discussed within the ETSI NFV ISG is the reliability and
    availability of the network service implemented by a set of Virtualized Network
    Functions (VNFs) building on top of the virtualization infrastructure. This document
    mainly focus on problem statement and gap analysis. It provides an overview of
    the problem space related to NFV reliability, it then briefly reviews an applicable
    architecture to scope potential solution space. Finally it identifies the gaps
    of several existing approaches to NFV reliability for potential reuse and extension.</p>"
