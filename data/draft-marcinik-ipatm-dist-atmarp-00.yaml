abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the basic limitations of the ATMARP service model specified
    in RFC 1577 [LAUB94] is the requirement that only one ATMARP server be utilized
    to provide the address resolution service for a given LIS. Besides introducing
    a single-point-of-failure into a LIS, this model also presents obvious scaling
    issues. A proposal was put forth in 'Classical IP and ARP over ATM Update' [LAUB95]
    to resolve these shortcomings through the introduction of a model supporting multiple
    ATMARP servers that maintain fully-replicated, synchronized address resolution
    databases. This model necessitates a certain amount of complexity introduced by
    the addition of a server database synchronization protocol. This synchronization
    protocol also requires additional packet types and formats as well as associated
    semantics. It is felt, however, that a fully-replicated, synchronized database
    scheme is not required to provide a reasonably robust ATMARP service that addresses
    the limitations of the basic model.</p>"
