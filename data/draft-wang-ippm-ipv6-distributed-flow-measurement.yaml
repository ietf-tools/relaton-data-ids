abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6 networks, performance measurements such as packet loss, delay
    and jitter of real traffic can be carried out based on the Alternate-Marking method.
    Usually, the controller needs to collect statistical data on network devices,
    calculate and present the measurement results. This document proposes a distributed
    method for on-path flow measurement, which is independent of the controller.</p>"
