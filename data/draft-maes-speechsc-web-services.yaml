abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use of the web service framework based on
    XML protocols to implement speech engine remote control protocols (SERCP). This
    document is informational. It illustrates how web services could be used. It is
    not a detailed specification. This is expected to be the output of the SPEECHSC
    activity, if it is decided to go in this direction. It also enumerates the requirements
    that have led to selecting a web service framework. Speech engines (speech recognition,
    speaker, recognition, speech synthesis, recorders and playback, NL parsers, and
    any other speech processing engines (e.g. speech detection, barge-in detection
    etc) etc...) as well as audio sub-systems (audio input and output sub-systems)
    can be considered as web services that can be described and asynchronously programmed
    via WSDL (on top of SOAP), combined in a flow described via WSFL, discovered via
    UDDI and asynchronously controlled and via SOAP that also enables asynchronous
    exchanges between the engines. This solution presents the advantage to provide
    flexibility, scalability and extensibility while reusing an existing framework
    that fits the evolution of the web: web services and XML protocols [15]. This
    document proposes using web services as a framework for SERCP. The proposed framework
    enables speech applications to control remote speech engines using the standardized
    mechanism of web services. The control messages may be tuned to the controlled
    speech engines.</p>"
