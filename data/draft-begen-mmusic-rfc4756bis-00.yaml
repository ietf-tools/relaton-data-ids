abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media lines.
    SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source and Forward
    Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows. However, the semantics that were defined
    in RFC 4756 generally fail to provide the specific grouping relationships between
    the source and repair flows when there are more than one source and/or repair
    flows in the same group. Furthermore, the existing semantics also do not support
    additive repair flows and prioritization among the repair flows protecting one
    or more source flows. This document addresses these issues by introducing new
    FEC grouping semantics.</p>"
