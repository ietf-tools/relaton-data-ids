abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches assuming
    that the information provided is static for a longer period of time. But in some
    cases network operators reallocate IP subnets from time to time which in turn
    changes the mapping partitions[I- D.ietf-alto-deployments]. Since the ALTO clients
    are unaware of the map information changes, clients need to query the servers
    for every service request and many such requests are redundant because the information
    was not changed. The purpose of this memo is to propose a mechanism where ALTO
    clients can subscribe for event notifications from the server</p>"
