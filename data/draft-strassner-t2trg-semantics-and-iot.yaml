abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines how semantics help different deployments in
    an Internet of Things (IoT) environment interoperate. IoT data, device, and system
    interoperability requires semantics to ensure that the meaning of terms and objects
    in one device or system are not lost or altered when they are exchanged and used
    by other devices or systems.</p>"
