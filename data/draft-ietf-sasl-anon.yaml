abstract:
- content: <p>On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to
    various services. Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text password
    mechanism using "anonymous" as the user name and using optional trace information,
    such as an email address, as the password. As plain-text login commands are not
    permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed
    within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.
