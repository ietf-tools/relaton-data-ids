abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the use of the Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP) protocol in building sensors and other devices that employ cellular networks
    as a communications medium. Building communicating devices that employ these networks
    is obviously well known, but this memo focuses specifically on techniques necessary
    to minimize power consumption.</p>"
