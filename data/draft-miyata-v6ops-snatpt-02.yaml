abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism to provide
    accessibility for IPv6 node to IPv4 node, and vice-versa. The goal of this document
    is not providing the most fundamental technology which could works well with additional
    technology. We used to have an technology called NAT-PT[RFC2766]. NAT-PT was designed
    to work with problematic DNS Application Level Gateway. So, it was changed to
    historical state by [RFC4966]. This document attempts to simplify NAT-PT specification,
    removing dependability on Application Layer Gateway as well as resolving problems
    pointed in [RFC4966].</p>"
