abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Core needs to be expandable to allow it to be usable on
    low-end devices with poor connectivity to be able to access internet resources
    in a seamless way on the application layer. this concept suggests that one way
    of how that can happen is through the stacking and unstacking of bits on the physical
    and datalink layers. Bycntainerising the input bytes into a bundle of 103bits
    and unstaking them on the other end of the communication layer using a different
    way f arrangement and encoding that can be interpreted by another protocol on
    the network layer. this can run parallel to the existing internet protocols and
    frameworks on the physical ,datalink and network layers</p>"
