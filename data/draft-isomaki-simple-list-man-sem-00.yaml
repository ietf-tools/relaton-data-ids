abstract:
- content: "<p>In SIMPLE based presence and messaging applications, it is necessary
    for the user to be able to configure a number of pieces of information. One of
    the most common types of information is a list of URIs. List management is useful
    outside the scope of SIMPLE as well, for instance in conferencing. There are many
    reasons why it would be beneficial to manage the lists in a similar fashion regardless
    of the application. Before the selection of the actual protocol(s) to manage the
    lists there is a need to describe their semantics on an abstract level. This document
    proposes the semantics for SIMPLE list manipulation protocol.</p>"
