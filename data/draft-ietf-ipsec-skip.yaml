abstract:
- content: "<p>There are occasions where it is advantageous to put authenticity and
    privacy features at the network layer. The vast majority of the privacy and authentication
    protocols in the literature deal with session oriented key-management schemes.
    However, many of the commonly used network layer protocols (for example, IPv4
    and IPv6) are session-less datagram oriented protocols. We describe a key-management
    scheme that is particularly well suited for use in conjunction with a session-less
    datagram protocol like IPv4 or IPv6. SKIP has been designed to work with the IP
    Security Protocols AH and ESP [8, 9, 10] which are specified for both IPv4 and
    IPv6.</p>"
