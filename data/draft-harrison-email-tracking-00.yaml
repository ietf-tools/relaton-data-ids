abstract:
- content: "<p>In much the same way one can track a parcel, this document proposes
    a simple method for returning the trace record of an e-mail to the SMTP originator
    (sender) as it passes through relays and gateways; passively, without the recipient's
    intervention. Delays can thus be explained and important e-mails (or paranoid
    e-mailers) can rest knowing their message has at least arrived at its destination.
    Much like parcel tracking, this is more of a gimmick than useful!</p>"
