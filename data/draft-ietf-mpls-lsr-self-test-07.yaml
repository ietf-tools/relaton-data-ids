abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a means for a Label-Switching Router (LSR) to
    verify that its data plane is functioning for certain key Multi-Protocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) applications, including unicast forwarding and traffic engineering
    tunnels. A new Loopback FEC type is defined to allow an upstream neighbor to assist
    in the testing at very low cost. MPLS Verification Request and MPLS Verification
    Reply messages are defined to do the actual probing.</p>"
