abstract:
- content: "<p>During the initial deployment of IPv6, hosts in native IPv6 networks
    will need to maintain connectivity with hosts and/or applications who can only
    be reached through IPv4. The Dual Stack Transition Mechanism (DSTM) provides a
    method to assure this connectivity based on the use of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels
    and the temporal allocation of a global IPv4 address to hosts requiring such communication.
    This document defines the processes and architecture required for this transition
    mechanism.</p>"
