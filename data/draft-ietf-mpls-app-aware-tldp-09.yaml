abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent Targeted Label Distribution Protocol (tLDP) applications, such
    as remote Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs) and BGP auto-discovered pseudowires, may
    automatically establish a tLDP session with any Label Switching Router (LSR) in
    a network. The initiating LSR has information about the targeted applications
    to administratively control initiation of the session. However, the responding
    LSR has no such information to control acceptance of this session. This document
    defines a mechanism to advertise and negotiate the Targeted Application Capability
    (TAC) during LDP session initialization. As the responding LSR becomes aware of
    targeted applications, it may establish a limited number of tLDP sessions for
    certain applications. In addition, each targeted application is mapped to LDP
    Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) elements to advertise only necessary LDP FEC
    label bindings over the session. This document updates RFC 7473 for enabling advertisement
    of LDP FEC label bindings over the session.</p>"
