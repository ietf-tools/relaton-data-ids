abstract:
- content: "<p>It is commonly recognized that the Internet routing and addressing
    architecture is facing challenges in scalability, multihoming, and inter-domain
    traffic engineering. This document presents, as a recommendation of future directions
    for the IETF, solutions that could aid the future scalability of the Internet.
    To this end, this document surveys many of the proposals that were brought forward
    for discussion in this activity, as well as some of the subsequent analysis and
    the architectural recommendation of the chairs. This document is a product of
    the Routing Research Group. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
