abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer mode
    capability. Therefore it is quite natural that there appears following demands.
    (1)Transmit specific IP flow through a certain isochronous channel of IEEE1394
    bus. (2)Transmit specific AV flow (such as MPEG2-TS with CIP header[61883]) through
    a certain isochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus (and control these flows by IP applications).
    To realize these, this draft proposes the protocol with following features. (1)Notify
    the relation between channel ID and IP flow. (2)Notify the bandwidth of the isochronous
    channel. (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow transmitted through the channel.
    (4)Notify the attribute of the flow. This protocol is defined as the extension
    of MCAP (Multicast Channel Allocation Protocol).</p>"
