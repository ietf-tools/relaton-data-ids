abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet
    of Things. It was created as a common language for use in the development of the
    One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions. Tools convert this format
    to database formats and other serializations as needed. An SDF specification describes
    definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events, Actions,
    Properties), as well as the Data types for the information exchanged in those
    interactions. A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 is defined in this document.
    (This is a republication of draft-onedm-t2trg-sdf-00 as an IETF ASDF Working Group
    document, with no technical changes, a superfluous figure removed, and some tool
    version induced reformatting.)</p>"
