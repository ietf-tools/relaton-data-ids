abstract:
- content: <p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) makes use of signed objects
    called manifests. A manifest lists each file that a publisher intends to include
    within an RPKI repository, and can be used to detect certain forms of attack against
    a repository. Manifests include a "manifest number" (manifestNumber), which the
    publisher must increment whenever it issues a new manifest, and Relying Parties
    (RPs) are required to verify that a newly-retrieved manifest for a given Certification
    Authority (CA) has a higher manifestNumber than the previously-validated manifest.
    However, the manifestNumber field is 20 octets in length (i.e. not unbounded),
    and no behaviour is specified for when a manifestNumber reaches the largest possible
    value. This document specifies publisher and RP behaviour for this scenario.</p>
