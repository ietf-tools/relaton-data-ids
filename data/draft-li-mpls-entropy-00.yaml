abstract:
- content: "<p>Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) forwarding is an essential function in
    distributing traffic across parallel paths. Packets within a flow must be kept
    on a single path to avoid reordering, while different flows must be distributed
    across paths to achieve parallelism. Previously, MPLS has addressed this through
    the use of an entropy label, providing up to 20 bits of entropy that can be added
    to the label stack to distinguish different flows. [RFC6790] With the interest
    in MPLS Network Actions, there are proposals to embedding entropy into alternate
    structures, so it is an appropriate time to consider how many bits should be used
    for entropy in the future. [I-D.bocci-mpls-miad-adi-requirements][I-D.andersson-mpls-mna-fwk]
    In this document, we examine the question of how to provide adequate entropy through
    a simple stochastic simulation. This is not intended to be a comprehensive and
    extensive treatise, but rather a simple investigation to build intuition into
    the issues.</p>"
