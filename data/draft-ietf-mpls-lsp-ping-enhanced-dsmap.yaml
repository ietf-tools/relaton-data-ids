abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes methods for performing LSP ping (specified
    in RFC 4379) traceroute over MPLS tunnels and for traceroute of stitched MPLS
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The techniques outlined in RFC 4379 are insufficient
    to perform traceroute Forwarding Equivalency Class (FEC) validation and path discovery
    for an LSP that goes over other MPLS tunnels or for a stitched LSP. This document
    deprecates the Downstream Mapping TLV (defined in RFC 4379) in favor of a new
    TLV that, along with other procedures outlined in this document, can be used to
    trace such LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
