abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most widely deployed protocol
    for securing network traffic. It provides mutual authentication, data confidentiality
    and integrity, key generation and distribution, and security parameters negotiation.
    However, missing from the protocol is a way to multiplex single-application multiple-stream
    applications that commonly use parallel connections to the same logical and/or
    physical server application data. This document describes a mechanism to multiplex
    single-application multiple-stream over TLS. It extends TLS to multiplex parallel
    connections of a given application over a single TLS session, avoiding additional
    delay related to the TLS/TCP session/connection setup.</p>"
