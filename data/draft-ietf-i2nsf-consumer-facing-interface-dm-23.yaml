abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an information model and the corresponding YANG
    data model for the Consumer-Facing Interface of the Security Controller in an
    Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) system in a Network Functions
    Virtualization (NFV) environment. The information model defines various types
    of managed objects and the relationship among them needed to build the flow policies
    from users' perspective. This information model is based on the "Event- Condition-Action"
    (ECA) policy model defined by a capability information model for I2NSF, and the
    YANG data model is defined for enabling different users of a given I2NSF system
    to define, manage, and monitor flow policies within an administrative domain (e.g.,
    user group).</p>
