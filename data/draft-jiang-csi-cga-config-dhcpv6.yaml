abstract:
- content: "<p>A Cryptographically Generated Address (CGA) is an IPv6 addresses binding
    with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA specifications are lack
    of procedures to enable proper management of CGA generation. Administrators should
    be able to configure parameters used to generate CGA. The Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), which enables network management to dynamically configure
    hosts, can be used in the CGA configuration. Furthermore, CGA generation consumes
    large computation power. This computational burden can be delegated to the DHCPv6
    server. A new DHCPv6 options are also defined in this document to enable hosts
    delegate CGA generation to a DHCPv6 server.</p>"
