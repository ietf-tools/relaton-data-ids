abstract:
- content: <p>GMPLS has been extended to support connection establishment in both
    SONET/SDH [RFC4606] and OTN [RFC4328] networks. However support for the configuration
    of the supervision functions is not specified. Both SONET/SDH and OTN implement
    supervision functions to qualify the transported signals. This document defines
    extensions to RSVP-TE for SONET/SDH and OTN OAM configuration based on the OAM
    Configuration Framework defined in [GMPLS-OAM-FWK].Requirements Language The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
    as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
