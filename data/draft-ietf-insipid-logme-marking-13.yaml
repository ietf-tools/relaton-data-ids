abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to diagnose user-reported
    problems and to perform regression testing if network or user agent (UA) software
    is upgraded. As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection
    via transit networks, it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling
    will take between user agents and therefore impractical to monitor SIP signaling
    end to end. This document describes an indicator for the SIP protocol that can
    be used to mark signaling as being of interest to logging. Such marking will typically
    be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and is
    not used in normal user agent signaling. Operators of all networks on the signaling
    path can agree to carry such marking end to end, including the originating and
    terminating SIP user agents, even if a session originates and terminates in different
    networks.</p>"
