abstract:
- content: "<p>The TCP Opportunistic Security (OPSEC) option enables cooperating peers
    to opportunistically negotiate the use of an end to end security protocol on a
    per connection basis. The negotiated protocol is used to transparently secure
    application data for the life of the connection, providing protection against
    all passive and some active attacks. Security protocols may operate anonymously
    or make opportunistic use of available key material. Backwards compatibility with
    non-OPSEC-aware hosts is maintained, thereby permitting incremental deployment
    of this mechanism.Comments and Discussion Please send feedback on this draft to
    tsv-area@ietf.org.</p>"
