abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method of providing scope-limited Source-
    Specific Multicast (SSM) channels by filtering at boundary routers. The filtering
    prevents SSM traffic from being forwarded through a scope boundary. Each administrative
    domain that wishes to enforce scoping can choose the sub-range of SSM channels
    that it wishes to scope -- no globally-scoped address range is defined. The method
    described here does not require extending the current SSM range allocation to
    include a new 'scoped SSM' range. The method described is primarily intended to
    provide scoping for IPv4 SSM channels, since IPv6 integrates multicast scoping
    into the basic addressing architecture.</p>"
