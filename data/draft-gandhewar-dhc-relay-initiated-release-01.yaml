abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is initiated by a DHCP
    client. A DHCP server can force DHCP client to send DHCPRENEW by sending a DHCPFORCERENEW
    message. There may be multiple DHCP network devices connected in between a DHCP
    client and a server, each one reserving resources for the DHCP client. There are
    no DHCP messages that a relay can initiate in order to control the client binding.
    A DHCP client may not always send a DHCPRELEASE message when it no longer needs
    the IP address and network resources for the associated services it is using.
    This document specifies a way to request release message to be initiated by an
    intermediate DHCP network device, e.g. DHCP relay, on behalf of DHCP client. This
    helps to relinquish network resources sooner than the lease expiration time.</p>"
