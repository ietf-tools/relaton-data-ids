abstract:
- content: "<p>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding
    architecture which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol and doesn't
    require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast state. BIER is applicable
    in a multi-tenant data center network environment for efficient delivery of Broadcast,
    Unknown-unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic while eliminating the need for maintaining
    a huge amount of multicast state in the underlay. This document describes BGP
    extensions for advertising the BIER-specific information. These extensions are
    applicable in those multi-tenant data centers where BGP instead of IGP is deployed
    as an underlay for network reachability advertisement. These extensions may also
    be applicable in other scenarios.</p>"
