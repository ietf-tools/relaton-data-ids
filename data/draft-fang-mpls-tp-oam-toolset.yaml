abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the MPLS-TP OAM toolset, which
    consists of MPLS-TP fault management and performance monitoring. This overview
    includes a brief recap of MPLS-TP OAM requirements and functions, and of the generic
    mechanisms created in the MPLS data plane to support in-band OAM. The importance
    of using IANA assigned code point under G-Ach when supporting MPLS-TP OAM is also
    discussed. The protocol definitions for each individual MPLS-TP OAM tool are specified
    in separate RFCs or Working Group documents which are referenced by this document.</p>"
