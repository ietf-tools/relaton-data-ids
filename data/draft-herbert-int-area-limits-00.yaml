abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification provides guidance for limiting the size of protocol
    headers in packets. Intermediate nodes that perform deep packet inspection (DPI),
    particularly hardware implementations, are often limited as to how many bytes
    of protocol headers they can process. We recommend that 256 bytes be established
    as the minimum number of bytes of headers that intermediate nodes are expected
    to be able to process. This limit is explicitly not intended to be a standard
    requirement, however it can be used as a guideline in hardware design, protocol
    design, as well as a useful constraint in implementation or configuration.</p>"
