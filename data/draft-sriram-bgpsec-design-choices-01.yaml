abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has been written to capture the design rationale for
    the draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification (I-D.ietf-sidr- bgpsec-protocol-00).
    It lists the decisions that have been made in favor of or against each design
    choice, and presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision
    process. A similar document can be published in the future as the BGPSEC design
    discussions make further progress and additional design considerations are discussed
    and finalized.</p>"
