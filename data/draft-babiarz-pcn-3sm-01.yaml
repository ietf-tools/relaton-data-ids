abstract:
- content: '<p>This document proposes a mechanism for admission control and flow termination.
    It is based on the concept of pre-congestion notification (PCN) using three different
    codepoints: "no pre- congestion", "admission-stop", and "excess-traffic" for packet
    marking. Therefore, the proposal is called three state marking (3sm). The behaviour
    of edge nodes is presented which distinguishes from other proposals through little
    complexity and its ability to cope with multipath routing. Algorithms required
    for packet metering and marking are explained in detail.</p>'
