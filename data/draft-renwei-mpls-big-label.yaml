abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies encoding and encapsulation methods for MPLS
    big labels. Big labels are required for accessing virtual networks in data centers
    by using, for example, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs. Data center virtualization encapsulation
    methods and protocols such as VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3 are being standardized to
    support a few millions of virtual networks, but the currently label format can
    support up to one million of labels. When the BGP/MPLS IP VPN method, for example,
    is used by an enterprise/customer to access its corresponding virtual networks,
    more than one million of labels are required to map VPN labels and Virtual Network
    Identifiers.</p>"
