abstract:
- content: <p>Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) builds on the concepts of RFC 3168,
    "The addition of Explicit Congestion Notification to IP". However, Pre-Congestion
    Notification aims at providing notification before any congestion actually occurs.
    Pre-Congestion Notification is applied to real-time flows (such as voice, video
    and multimedia streaming) in DiffServ networks. As described in [CL-DEPLOY], it
    enables "pre" congestion control through two procedures, flow admission control
    and flow pre-emption. The draft proposes algorithms that determine when a PCN-enabled
    router writes Admission Marking and Pre-emption Marking in a packet header, depending
    on the traffic level. The draft also proposes how to encode these markings. We
    present simulation results with PCN working in an edge-to-edge scenario using
    the marking algorithms described. Other marking algorithms will be investigated
    in the future.</p>
