abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) appoints candidates to most
    IETF leadership committee. RFC8713 provides criteria for membership on Nomcom
    that attempts to ensure that NomCom volunteers are members of the loosely defined
    IETF community, by requiring in-person attendance in three of the past five in-
    person meetings. In 2020 and 2021, the IETF had six consecutive fully online plenary
    meetings that drove rapid advancement in remote meeting technologies and procedures,
    including an experiment that included remote attendance for NomCom eligibility.
    This document updates RFC8713 by building a new set of eligibility criteria from
    first principles, with consideration for the increased salience of remote attendance.</p>"
