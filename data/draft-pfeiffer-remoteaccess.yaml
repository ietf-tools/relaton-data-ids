abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this document is to standardize remote access options to
    parameters of embedded devices with limited resources. Typically such devices
    are based on 8-bit or 16-bit microcontrollers with limited memory (64K or less)
    and a low operating frequency (20 MHz or less). The protocol described in this
    document uses existing markup formats to specify modifiable parameters of embedded
    devices and existing protocols to transfer these parameters between clients and
    servers.</p>"
