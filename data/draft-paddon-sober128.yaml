abstract:
- content: "<p>SOBER-128 is a fast software-oriented stream cipher based on simple
    32-bit operations. Keys of up to 128 bits and optional nonces of arbitrary length
    are supported. SOBER-128 may be configured to calculate an arbitrary length Message
    Authentication Code (MAC) as part of the encryption or decryption process. Source
    code for SOBER-128 is freely available, and use of this source code, or independent
    implementations, is permitted for any purpose under a fee free license.</p>"
