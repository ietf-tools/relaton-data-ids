abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at restarting the discussion on what a site network
    administrator should publish in the global DNS and what they should not. The latest
    attempt was documented in a previous draft [4] was was ultimately an unsuccessful
    effort to clarify what to do with IPv4 private addresses RFC1918 [1] in the DNS.
    Since then, a number of similar issues coming from the IPv6 world have arisen
    and there is a sense that the situation needs to be clarified by a BCP document.</p>"
