abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a proposal for a new Internet protocol, which
    should improve the relevance of results of search requests for information in
    the WWW. It contains a description of the basic model and the minimum set of commands
    necessary to run properly. It is neither meant to nor should be regarded as a
    definitive version, but rather as a suggestion to a new way of looking at the
    relations between the search engines on one hand and hosts running WEB servers
    on the other.</p>"
