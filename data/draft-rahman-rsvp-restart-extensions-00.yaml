abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the extensions needed by certain features for
    the purpose of RSVP Graceful Restart. One of these extensions refers to the ability
    of a node to recover the ERO in the case it has performed an ERO expansion before
    control plane restart. Also a small modification is proposed in the basic procedure
    to support simultaneous multiple node restarts in a network. Specifically, a node
    should use a non- zero Recovery Time while in the recovery phase. This allows
    a node to determine at restart time if any of its neighbors has previously restarted
    and it is currently in the recovery phase.</p>"
