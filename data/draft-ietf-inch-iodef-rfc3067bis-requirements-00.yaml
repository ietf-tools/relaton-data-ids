abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the Incident Object Description and Exchange Format
    is to define a common data format for describing and exchanging incident information
    between collaborating Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). The
    specific goals and requirements of the IODEF are described in [2]. One of the
    design principles in the IODEF is compatibility with the Intrusion Detection Message
    Exchange Format (IDMEF) [3] developed for intrusion detection systems. For this
    reason, IODEF is heavily based on the IDMEF and provides upward compatibility
    with it.</p>"
