abstract:
- content: "<p>Software releases can't always wait for some document to become an
    RFC. As the result some software products are released when they implement a non-final
    version of an IMAP [IMAP4] extension. This may cause substantial interoperability
    problems between clients and servers that implement different revisions of the
    same document, as syntax and semantics of operations may change substantially
    between revisions of the same IMAP extension draft.</p>"
