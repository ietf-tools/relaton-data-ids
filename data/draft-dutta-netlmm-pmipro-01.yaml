abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique that
    helps to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes when Proxy MIP
    is used as the mobility protocol. This routing optimization technique is most
    useful when the two communicating hosts are away from home and need to communicate
    with each other using an optimized path. It takes advantage of the data packet
    between LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data path between the communicating
    hosts. This route optimization technique is applicable to both the intra-LMA and
    inter-LMA scenarios.</p>"
