abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the application of the HyperText Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP) [HTTP] for the purpose of SNMP [SNMP] and CMIP [CMIP] management. It shows
    how SNMP and CMIP resources can be managed by using the standard HTTP protocol
    by defining a mapping between SNMP/CMIP protocols and HTTP. The mapping is very
    simple and based on strings which can easily be handled by any programming and
    scripting language. This will allow light and simple HTTP-based applications to
    be created, since they have not to include any management service like encoding/decoding
    nor to handle complex data types. This document does not cover management of HTTP
    [Hazewinkel].</p>"
