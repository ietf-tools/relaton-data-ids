abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast support in a MPLS network has yet to be defined. This document
    discusses both dense-mode and sparse-mode IP multicast within the context of a
    MPLS network. Unlike unicast routing, dense-mode multicast routing trees are established
    in a data-driven manner and it is not possible to topologically aggregate such
    trees, which are rooted at different sources. In sparse-mode multicast, source-specific
    trees may coexist with a core/shared tree, and it is not possible to assign a
    common label to traffic from different sources on a branch of the shared tree.
    This leads us to suggest a per-source traffic-driven label allocation scheme for
    supporting all three types of multicast (dense mode, shared tree, source tree)
    routing trees in a MPLS network.</p>"
