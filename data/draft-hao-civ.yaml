abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an extension to the INVITE header of the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) to support the Caller ID Verification (CIV) protocol
    proposed by Wang et al. in ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (2023). CIV
    authenticates the caller ID of an incoming call through a challenge-and-response
    process. When receiving a call with a claimed phone number, the called party holds
    the call and sends an INVITE request to that number, carrying a short 4-digit
    challenge embedded as part of the caller ID. A genuine caller should receive the
    challenge and respond by echoing the same digits, e.g., through DTMF (Dual-Tone
    Multi- Frequency). The proposed extension involves two changes to the INVITE header.
    First, it adds a new options tag, "civ", in the Supported header field. This tag
    indicates that the calling party supports CIV. Second, it adds a special value
    "civ-veri-call" for the Purpose parameter of the Call-Info header field. This
    value indicates that the purpose of the INVITE request is to verify the caller
    ID based on CIV. Compared with STIR/SHAKEN, CIV authenticates the caller ID (not
    the carrier), does not require trusted certificate authorities and works with
    both IP and non-IP networks.</p>
