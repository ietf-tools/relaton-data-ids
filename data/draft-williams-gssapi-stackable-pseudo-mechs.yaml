abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable pseudo-
    mechanisms for the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface
    (GSS-API) and introduces a framework to support stackable pseudo-mechanisms and
    mechanism compositing. Stackable GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition
    of new mechanisms that combine features from multiple mechanisms. Stackable mechanisms
    that add support for Perfect Forward Security (PFS), data compression, additional
    authentication factors, etc... are facilitated by this document.</p>"
