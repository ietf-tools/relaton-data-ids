abstract:
- content: "<p>With 4K technology, we can get more details compared to traditional
    HD screens of the same size. However, 4K content increases the demand for higher
    network throughput, which poses a big challenge for delivering 4K content by TCP.
    This document proposes a target throughput based method for increasing TCP's congestion
    window (cwnd). Experimental results show that the proposed method can reach the
    required throughput much more rapidly than traditional TCP congestion algorithms,
    such as Reno, Cubic. Moreover, this method prevents cwnd from increasing when
    cwnd reaching to the required throughput.</p>"
