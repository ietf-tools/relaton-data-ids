abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a new approach intended to lead to a simple
    roadmap from the IPv4 Internet to a pure IPv6 one. With it, applications, protocol
    stacks and customer edge devices need only one standardized intermediate v5 version
    between v4 and v6. Internet service providers upgrade their v4 service to two
    intermediate services: one with a v4 address and a v6 prefix, and one with only
    a v6 prefix but with access to transition tools within the network. Provision
    is also made for a standardized upgrade of 3GPP networks.</p>"
