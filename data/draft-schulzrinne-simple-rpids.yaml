abstract:
- content: "<p>The Rich Presence Information Data Format for SIP (RPIDS) adds elements
    to the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) that provide additional information
    about the presentity and its contacts. This information can be translated into
    call routing behavior and/or be delivered to watchers. The information is designed
    so that much of it can be derived automatically, e.g., from calendar files or
    user activity.</p>"
