abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains the information
    of Label Switched Path (LSP) and resource availability within a domain, so multiple
    stateful PCEs are able to provide traffic engineering inter-domain routing through
    cooperating with each other. This document introduces the applicability of cooperative
    stateful PCE for establishing inter-domain inter-vendor LSP which is initiated
    by PCE.</p>"
