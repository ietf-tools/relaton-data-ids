- content: "<p>This short NANO draft proposes scenarios for using Mobile Routers at
    fixed scenes. The routers connect by their egress interfaces and need to allow
    their Local Fixed Nodes to communicate directly. What if the Mobile Network Prefixes
    are stored in special Router Advertisements sent by each Mobile Router on their
    egress interface. What are the issues and can it work.</p>"
