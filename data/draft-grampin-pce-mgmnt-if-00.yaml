abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture provide a framework
    to support the Constraint-Based Routing (CBR) functionality for traffic engineering
    systems in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. The model define the PCC and PCE entities at
    the Control Plane, which communicate using a Request/Reply protocol. The PCE architecture
    enable network operators a tight control of the resource assignment by means of
    the administrative constraints that are included in the Traffic Enginnering Database
    (TED), and used in the path computation process. Moreover, appropriate objective
    funtions assist operators in the fulfillment of the overall network objectives.
    This document present a system architecture for the PCE, namely Routing and Management
    Agent (RMA), with a standard management interface, which permit established management
    frameworks to rely on the PCE for the CBR functionality and inject network-wide
    policies into the PCE path computation process. Some reliability issues of the
    PCE Architecture are addressed in the document.</p>"
