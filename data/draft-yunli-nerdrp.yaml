abstract:
- content: "<p>To reliably hand over data packets to the destination in Delay Tolerant
    Networks (DTNs), many dissemination-based routing protocols are proposed. Dissemination-based
    routing protocols assure nodes including intermediate nodes and destinations have
    more chances to receive packets, which will increase the probability that the
    packets can be correctly received by the destination. However, the existing error
    recovery mechanisms in network layer use the simple CRC to check the data packets
    independently, and discard the error packets even if one correct packet can be
    obtained from more than one partly error packets. This document describes Dissemination-based
    Routing Protocol with Network-layer Error Control (NER-DRP). NER-DRP divides a
    data packet into RS blocks and inserts redundancy to each block. So the intermediate
    nodes and destinations can recover a correct data packet from multiple partially
    error copies of the same packet.</p>"
