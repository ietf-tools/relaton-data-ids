abstract:
- content: "<p>The Context Replication (CR) mechanism [3] for Robust Header Compression
    (ROHC) uses an existing compression context for creating a new compression context,
    thus, saves sending some of the header information from the compressor to the
    decompressor during context initialization. The current CR mechanism could also
    save sending an IP address from the header information. However, it either sends
    a whole IP address or doesn't send an IP address. This Internet Draft enhances
    the CR mechanism by providing an option of sending compressed IP address.</p>"
