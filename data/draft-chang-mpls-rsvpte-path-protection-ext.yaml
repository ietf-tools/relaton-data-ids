abstract:
- content: "<p>To deliver reliable service, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS)
    requires a set of procedures to enable -protection of the traffic carried on -
    label switched paths (LSPs). Thus existing signaling mechanisms must be extended
    appropriately to support such functionality. Recently, RSVP-TE [1] has introduced
    extensions to RSVP to support the establishment of LSP tunnels. This draft extends
    RSVP-TE to support path protection [2] in MPLS. Specifically, we provide signaling
    support for establishing backup LSPs and for propagating fault notification upon
    LSP failure.</p>"
