abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the treaties administered by the International Telecommunications
    Union is the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose
    is to promote the development of telecommunication services. The 1988 version
    of the ITRs opened the way for privatisation, liberalization, and the growth of
    the Internet and mobile networks. [Hill-2013a, p. 8] Given the subsequent significant
    structural and technological changes, the ITU Member States agreed to meet in
    2012 to revise the ITRs. While consensus was found on an overwhelming majority
    of the treaty text, some provisions proved to be controversial, leading to a split
    in the membership and sharp criticism of selected provisions. As a result, some
    ITU Member States did not sign the treaty. This document analyses that criticism
    and attempts to place it in context; it identifies problems that may arise if
    states to not accede to the treaty, and suggests a way forward, concluding that
    not acceding may have undesirable results for the citizens of non-signatory countries
    and for interoperability in general.</p>"
