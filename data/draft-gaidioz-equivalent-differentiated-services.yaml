abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes EDS (Equivalent Differentiated Services), a
    new building-block for a simple, robust, free and scalable end-to-end service
    differentiation in IP networks. The EDS schema aims to provide a spectrum of 'different
    but equal' network services that offer to the end-to-end flows a trade-off between
    delay and loss rate. The EDS schema can be deployed incrementally in the Internet.</p>"
