abstract:
- content: "<p>Given the large installed base of ring fiber-plants and the extensive
    experience operators have gained in operating SONET (SDH) ring networks, optical
    rings are becoming increasingly important. As such, optical rings will play a
    crucial role in the migration from existing TDM-based SONET (SDH) architectures
    to more dynamic lightpath provisioning paradigms. To date, various optical ring
    concepts have been tabled, proposing multi-services support and mirroring the
    fast protection switching capabilities of existing SONET (SDH) rings. Nevertheless,
    the emerging IP-based MPL(ambda)S framework for optical networks is largely based
    upon (optical) mesh routing concepts.</p>"
