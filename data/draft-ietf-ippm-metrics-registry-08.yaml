abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM). It
    assigns and registers an initial set of OBJECT IDENTITIES to currently defined
    metrics in the IETF. This memo also defines the rules for adding IP Performance
    Metrics that are defined in the future and for encouraging all IP performance
    metrics to be registered here. IANA has been assigned to administer this new registry.
    This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community,
    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
