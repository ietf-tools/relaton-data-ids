abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to support more flexible replication methods, it is desirable
    to specify some manner in which an LDAP client may retrieve a set of changes that
    have been applied to an LDAP server's database. The client, which may be another
    LDAP server, may then choose to update its own replicated copy of the data. This
    document specifies an object class that may be used to represent changes applied
    to an LDAP server. It also specifies a method for discovering the location of
    the container object that holds these change records, so that clients and servers
    have a common rendezvous point for this information.</p>"
