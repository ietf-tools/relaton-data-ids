abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamically provisionable optical crossconnects (OXCs) will play an
    active role in future optical networks and the MPL(ambda)S control plane will
    be used to establish, teardown, and reroute optical trails through the network.
    This document specifies extensions to RSVP to address some of the unique requirements
    of such optical trails. Specifically, we propose extensions to RSVP that allow
    an upstream node to make a Label suggestion to a downstream node when establishing
    an optical trail and allow both directions of a bi- directional optical trail
    to be established simultaneously. A new message type is also defined so that an
    RSVP node can notify (possibly non-adjacent) RSVP nodes when network failures
    occur, without affecting the RSVP states of intermediate RSVP nodes. Finally,
    we propose a modification to allow bundle messages to be sent to non-adjacent
    RSVP nodes.</p>"
