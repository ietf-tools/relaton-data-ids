abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an architecture for secure IP multicast. It
    identifies the basic components and their functionalities, and specifies how these
    components interact with each other and with the surrounding systems. The main
    design principles followed in developing this architecture are simplicity, flexibility,
    ease of incorporation within existing systems. In particular, the design attempts
    to mimic the IPSec architecture, and to re-use existing IPSec mechanisms wherever
    possible. The proposed architecture is able to accommodate many of the existing
    proposals for multicast key management. In this draft, we concentrate on the architectural
    building blocks required to enable a group member (either a receiver or a sender
    of data) to use secure IP multicast. Design of the group controller(s) is left
    to future documents.</p>"
