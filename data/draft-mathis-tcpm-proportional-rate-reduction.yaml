abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental algorithm, Proportional Rate
    Reduction (PPR) and related algorithms to improve the accuracy of the amount of
    data sent by TCP during loss recovery. Standard Congestion Control requires that
    TCP and other protocols reduce their congestion window in response to losses.
    This window reduction naturally occurs in the same round trip as the data retransmissions
    to repair the losses, and is implemented by choosing not to transmit any data
    in response to some ACKs arriving from the receiver. Two widely deployed algorithms
    are used to implement this window reduction: Fast Recovery and Rate Halving. Both
    algorithms are needlessly fragile under a number of conditions, particularly when
    there is a burst of losses that such that the number of ACKs returning to the
    sender is so small that the effective window falls below the target congestion
    window chosen by the congestion control algorithm. Proportional Rate Reduction
    avoids these excess window reductions such that at the end of recovery the actual
    window size will be as close as possible to the window size determined by the
    congestion control algorithm. It is patterned after rate halving, but using the
    fraction that is appropriate for target window chosen by the congestion control
    algorithm. In addition we propose two slightly different algorithms to bound the
    total window reduction due to all mechanisms, including application stalls, the
    losses themselves and inhibit further window reductions when possible.</p>"
