abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the More Instant Messaging Interop (mimi) Transport
    Protocol (MTP)- a protocol for inter-provider persistent group chat. MIMI utilizes
    Messaging Layer Security (MLS) for end-to- end encryption of content. The MIMI
    Transport Protocol plays the role of the Delivery Service (DS) defined by the
    MLS protocol. MTP is meant to represent the minimal protocol required to enable
    provider to provider federation for messaging exchange using MLS. It is not suitable
    for client to provider communications. MTP is based on a pull architecture, wherein
    message delivery from provider A to provider B is accomplished by having provider
    B pull messages from provider A. This provides better scalability and reliability
    and is amenable to implementation in modern cloud software architectures, while
    also reducing spam risk. MTP serves as a transfer protocol for opaque message
    content, the format of which is specified in a separate document. MTP is also
    designed to prevent spam, and does so by introducing a layer of authorization
    for the establishment of connections and addition to group chats.</p>"
