abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of vendor-specific RADIUS attributes
    designed to support the use of Microsoft's proprietary dialect of PPP CHAP (MS-CHAP)
    in dial-up networks. MS-CHAP is derived from and (where possible) consistent with
    PPP CHAP [1]; the differences between PPP CHAP and MS-CHAP are significant enough
    to warrant the definition of new RADIUS attributes, however.</p>"
