abstract:
- content: "<p>Network function virtualization (NFV) promises improved operations
    in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and manageability, but orchestration, in
    general, and recursive orchestration, in particular, is still an item of ongoing
    research. We summarize the current state of the art in open-source initiatives
    in this area and present current directions of research and development in terms
    of orchestration, resource decomposition and federation, policy-based resource
    management, measurement and analytics, and virtual network function (VNF) elasticity.</p>"
