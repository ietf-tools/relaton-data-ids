abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a way for an Intermediate System to Intermediate
    System (IS-IS) router to advertise multiple types of supported Maximum SID Depths
    (MSDs) at node and/or link granularity. Such advertisements allow entities (e.g.,
    centralized controllers) to determine whether a particular Segment ID (SID) stack
    can be supported in a given network. This document only defines one type of MSD:
    Base MPLS Imposition. However, it defines an encoding that can support other MSD
    types. This document focuses on MSD use in a network that is Segment Routing (SR)
    enabled, but MSD may also be useful when SR is not enabled.</p>"
