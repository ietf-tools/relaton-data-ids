abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension of the Quality of Service (QoS)
    architecture to support differentiated resilience requirements of IP services.
    Several architectures offering Quality of Service in IP-based networks are defined
    by the IETF community. The two most important of them are the Integrated Services
    (IntServ) model with the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) as the recommended
    signaling protocol and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) model. Recently,
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) emerged introducing extended traffic engineering
    methods into IP and therefore also may support QoS. Due to the growing commercial
    importance of the Internet and the transport of mission-critical services, survivability
    became a main service requirement in addition to the traditional QoS.</p>"
