abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses rendezvous mechanisms for the Host Identity
    Protocol (HIP). Rendezvous mechanisms, such as HIP Rendezvous Servers, improve
    operation when HIP nodes are multi-homed or mobile. They can also facilitate communication
    between HIP and non-HIP nodes. Possible rendezvous mechanisms differ in performance,
    compatibility, and impact on the HIP and Internet architectures.</p>"
