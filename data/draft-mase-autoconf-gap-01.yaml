abstract:
- content: <p>We consider Internet connectivity of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET),
    where two or more fixed or mobile nodes (MNs) may have a wired or wireless interface
    to the fixed Internet in addition to the wireless interface for the MANET. The
    points of attachment of MNs to the Internet are termed as "Access Routers (ARs),"
    A stationary MN, that has wired connection with the Internet may become an AR
    itself. Typically, only a single AR is used as the Internet Gateway (IGW) in a
    MANET. Two or more IGWs may be used, but the number of the IGWs should be kept
    to a minimim. This minimizing feature is named "Gateway Aggregation." MANET routing
    protocol runs on the MBGs, and both routing control messages and data packets
    of the MANET are tunneled between an MN and its associated AR, between an AR and
    its selected IGW, and also between an IGW and its peer IGW. The IGW advertises
    the network prefix for the MNs to configure their global care-of-addresses. An
    MN configures its care-of-address with the prefix advertised by one of the IGWs.
    Once it obtains its global address, it does not have to change it during its stay
    in the MANET.</p>
