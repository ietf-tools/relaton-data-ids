abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc networks,
    called the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing (MZR). MZR is a source-initiated
    on-demand protocol, in which a multicast delivery tree is created using a concept
    based on the zone routing mechanism. It belongs to the family of source-tree-based
    protocols, in which a delivery tree rooted at the source is created for each active
    multicast session. MZR does not depend on any underlying unicast protocol for
    a global routing substructure. The protocol's reaction to topological changes
    is restricted to a node's neighborhood and is not propagated throughout the network.</p>"
