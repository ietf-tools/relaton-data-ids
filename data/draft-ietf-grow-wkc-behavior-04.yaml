abstract:
- content: "<p>Popular BGP implementations manipulate Well-known Communities differently
    from one another. This results in difficulties for operators. Network operators
    are encouraged to deploy consistent community handling across their networks,
    taking the inconsistent behaviors from the various BGP implementations they operate
    into consideration. This document recommends specific action items to limit future
    inconsistency, namely BGP implementors are expected to not create any further
    inconsistencies from this point forward.</p>"
