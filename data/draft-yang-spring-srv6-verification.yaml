abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a path verification mechanism for SRv6, which
    adopts a hop-by-hop cryptographic computation on the destination segment identifier
    at each node, combined with an end-to-end verification at the last hop. Although
    the HMAC mechanism specified in RFC 8754 can verify the integrity of the entire
    SID List, if we want to force the SRv6 endpoints the packet must pass through
    during forwarding, it is necessary to retain some information each time the packet
    passes through an SRv6 endpoint. This draft proposes an enhancement to HMAC specificed
    by RFC 8754 that provides the capability to enforce the packet's forwarding path
    to go through all or certain SRv6 endpoints in the SID List. And this approach
    also significantly reduces the processing overhead associated with hop- by-hop
    path verification.</p>"
