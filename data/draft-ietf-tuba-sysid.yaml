abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies an upward-compatible extension to the OSI End System--Intermediate
    System routing protocol (ISO 9542:1988) to allow end systems which are autoconfiguring
    their network layer (NSAP) addresses to suggest a value to be used as the System
    ID. It is primarily intended for use in the TUBA environment, but is also applicable
    to a CATNIP or pure OSI environment as well. This document specifies an experimental
    protocol for use in the Internet. In addition, this document will be submitted
    to ISO for consideration as an addendum to the ISO 9542 standard. Two interoperable
    implementations of this protocol extension currently exist.</p>"
