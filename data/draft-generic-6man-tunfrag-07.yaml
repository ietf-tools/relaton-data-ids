abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.
    Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) must either
    drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or
    perform link-specific fragmentation and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation")
    at a layer below IPv6. This latter category of links is often performance-challenged
    to accommodate steady-state link adaptation. A common case that exhibits these
    link characteristics is seen for IPv6-in-IP tunnels. Additionally, IPv6 nodes
    can avoid path MTU discovery issues even when no link adaptation is necessary
    by performing a small amount of fragmentation and/or by probing the path as necessary.
    This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better
    accommodate path MTU issues.</p>
