abstract:
- content: "<p>Rather than forcing the client to decide whether IPv4 or IPv6 is more
    convenient to reach a web server; this document proposes to let the web server
    check whether there is IPv6 connectivity to the client; then the web server can
    do a HTTP redirect to the force the client to use IPv6. This is done easily by
    a script within the server HTML pages and does not require any change in the client
    applications or configuration. The client still can control whether he/she wants
    to enabled IPv6. This draft could be discussed on the Applications Discuss mailing
    list, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/apps-discuss.</p>"
