abstract:
- content: <p>Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) IP Neighbor Discovery (IPND), is
    a method for otherwise oblivious nodes to learn of the existence, availability,
    and addresses of other DTN participants. IPND both sends and listens for small
    IP UDP announcement "beacons." Beacon messages are addressed to an IP unicast,
    multicast, or broadcast destination to discover specified or unspecified remote
    neighbors, or unspecified local neighbors in the topology, e.g. within wireless
    range. IPND beacons advertise neighbor availability by including the DTN node's
    canonical endpoint identifier. IPND beacons optionally include service availability
    and parameters. In this way, neighbor discovery and service discovery may be coupled
    or decoupled as required. Once discovered, new neighbor pairs use advertised availabilities
    to connect, exchange routing information, etc. This document describes DTN IPND.</p>
