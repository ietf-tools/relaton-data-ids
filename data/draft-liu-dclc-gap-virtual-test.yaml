abstract:
- content: "<p>In virtual network, the VSwitch become an important element in the
    network. It is in charge for both forward management and virtual network function.
    We figure out that to evaluate the performance of VSwitch is not like the test
    on hardware (like using RFC2544). This draft introduce the gap of testing for
    virtual network performance. On chapter 2 we introduce the test practices which
    is the virtual test bad setup and benchmark test. On chapter three, we analysis
    the gap of virtual network performance test.</p>"
