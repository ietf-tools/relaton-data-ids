abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the CPaceOQUAKE+ protocol, a hybrid asymmetric
    password-authenticated key exchange (aPAKE) that supports mutual authentication
    in a client-server setting secure against quantum-capable attackers. CPaceOQUAKE+
    is the result of a KEM-based transformation from the hybrid symmetric PAKE protocol
    called CPaceOQUAKE that is also described in this document. This document recommends
    configurations for CPaceOQUAKE+.</p>"
