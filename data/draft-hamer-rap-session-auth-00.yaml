abstract:
- content: "<p>Establishing multimedia streams must take into account requirements
    for end-to-end QoS, authorization of network resource usage and accurate accounting
    for resources used. During session set up, policies may be enforced to ensure
    that the media streams being requested lie within the bounds of the service profile
    established for the requesting host. Similarly, when a host requests resources
    to provide a certain QoS for a packet flow, policies may be enforced to ensure
    that the required resources lie within the bounds of the resource profile established
    for the requesting host.</p>"
