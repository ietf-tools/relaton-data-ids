abstract:
- content: "<p>ARIS (Aggregate Route-based IP Switching) [ARIS] is a protocol which,
    in coordination with network-layer routing protocols, establishes link-layer switched
    paths through a network of Integrated Switch Routers (ISR). This memo describes
    ARIS protocol mechanisms which enable LAN media switching of IP packets. In addition,
    this memo describes the functional behavior of ISRs which are interconnected via
    LAN media (e.g., ethernet, token ring, FDDI). The proposed mechanisms are designed
    to permit easy implementation using emerging LAN switching technology.</p>"
