abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the MANEMO architecture including possible topology
    configuration and addressing assignment. The issues of MANEMO (previously known
    as nested NEMO) are already summarized in several documents. However, there are
    several ways how to comprehend what is MANEMO. The MANEMO problems are related
    to several existing working groups. This document provides the MANEMO architecture
    model and differences of existing solutions so that IETF can classify the problems
    and start working on the solutions.</p>"
