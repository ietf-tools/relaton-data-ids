abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a need to connect (a) TRILL based data centers or (b) TRILL
    based networks which provide Provider Backbone like functionalities or (c) Campus
    TRILL based networks over the WAN using one or more ISPs that provide regular
    IP+GRE or IP+MPLS transport. A few solutions have been proposed as in [1] in the
    recent past that have not looked at the PB-like functionality. These solutions
    have not dealt with the details as to how these services could be provided such
    that multiple TRILL sites can be inter-connected with issues like nick-name collisons
    for unicast and multicast being taken care of. It has been found that with extensions
    to BGP the problem statement which we will define below can be handled. Both control
    plane and data plane operations can be driven into the solution to make it seamlessly
    look at the entire set of TRILL sites as a single entity which then can be viewed
    as one single Layer 2 cloud. MAC moves across TRILL sites and within TRILL sites
    can be realized. This document / proposal envisions the use of BGP-MAC-VPN vrfs
    both at the IP cloud PE devices and at the peripheral PEs within a TRILL site
    providing Provider Backbone like functionality. We deal in depth with the control
    plane and data plane particulars for unicast and multicast with nick-name election
    being taken care of as part of the solution.</p>"
