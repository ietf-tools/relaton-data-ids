abstract:
- content: "<p>[1] describes how to encode an MPLS label stack as a ''shim'' between
    the data link and network layer headers of a labeled frame, but [1] does not require
    that this encoding be used to encode the top of the label stack on LAN media.
    This document examines the alternative encapsulations that have been proposed
    for LANs. One alternative is to use the shim as the MPLS encapsulation on LAN
    interfaces [2]. Another alternative is to encode the top label in the MAC header,
    rather than in the shim [3]. We describe the implications of each approach.</p>"
