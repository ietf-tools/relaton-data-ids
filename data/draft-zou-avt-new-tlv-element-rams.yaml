abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] defines a method for rapid
    acquisition of multicast sessions (RAMS). Upon accepting the first RAMS-R message,
    RS MUST echo an RAMS-I message as a response to RR. This document proposes to
    optionally convey a parameter called unicast backspace in the RAMS-I message.
    Unicast backspace is the RTP timestamp difference between the first unicast burst
    packet to be sent and the latest primary multicast packet in the buffer of RS.
    The RTP timestamps values for these packets are taken from the primary multicast
    stream. The parameter is a constant once RS chooses a starting point for the unicast
    burst. This parameter can be used by RR to determine when to join the primary
    multicast session. RR would not rely on RAMS-I to revise the earliest multicast
    join time after the burst rate is changed by RS and therefore is immune to the
    lose of RAMS-I. Moreover, if this parameter is known, RR with appropriate playback
    control can reduce the additional end-to-end delay introduced by the RAMS process
    or can enable the RS to serve the RR with shorter burst duration and therefore
    save the bandwidth of RS export and the burst forwarding path.</p>"
