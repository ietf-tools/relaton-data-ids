abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents the observations and results obtained from two test-beds
    designed to study and evaluate the performance and feasibility of rapid fault
    notification via flooding. Flooding-based fault notification [2,3] is an alternative
    to signaling-only notification approaches, which has the advantages of: scalability
    and the ability to meet bounded recovery-time constraints, if needed. We implemented
    flooding-based notification at both the transport and packet layers. For optical
    transport networks the flooding mechanism (e.g. [3]), was realized using enhancements
    to the Link Management Protocol (LMP), while for packet/MPLS networks the flooding
    was realized using enhancements to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). We present
    experiences and performance measurements from these implementations on FreeBSD/Linux
    platforms, and also present the protocol enhancements that were made to LMP and
    OSPF, respectively, to realize the rapid flooding function.</p>"
