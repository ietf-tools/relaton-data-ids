abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses the general security requirements of both v4
    and v6 versions of DHCP. This document lists security requirements and proposes
    as security model, which meets scaling requirements, security requirements and
    efficiency requirements. The proposed security model uses public key cryptography
    and a proposed trusted key distribution mechanism to authenticate clients and
    servers. The authentication protocol can also exchange keying material for more
    efficiently protecting successive communication between client and server. The
    security model also addresses securing relay agents.</p>"
