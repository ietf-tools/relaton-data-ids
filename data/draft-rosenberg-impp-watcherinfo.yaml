abstract:
- content: "<p>Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to)
    presence information about a user. There is fairly complex state associated with
    this subscription, and this state is dynamic. As a result, it is possible, and
    indeed useful, to subscribe to the watcher information for a particular subscriber.
    In order to enable this, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers.
    This specification describes an XML document format for such state.</p>"
