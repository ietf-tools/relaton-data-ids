abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes tools for the evaluation of simulation and
    testbed scenarios used in research on Internet congestion control mechanisms.
    We believe that research in congestion control mechanisms has been seriously hampered
    by the lack of good models underpinning analysis, simulation, and testbed experiments,
    and that tools for the evaluation of simulation and testbed scenarios can help
    in the construction of better scenarios, based on better underlying models. One
    use of the tools described in this document is in comparing key characteristics
    of test scenarios with known characteristics from the diverse and ever-changing
    real world. Tools characterizing the aggregate traffic on a link include the distribution
    of per-packet round-trip times, the distribution of connection sizes, and the
    like. Tools characterizing end-to-end paths include drop rates as a function of
    packet size and of burst size, the synchronization ratio between two end-to-end
    TCP flows, and the like. For each characteristic, we describe what aspects of
    the scenario determine this characteristic, how the characteristic can affect
    the results of simulations and experiments for the evaluation of congestion control
    mechanisms, and what is known about this characteristic in the real world. We
    also explain why the use of such tools can add considerable power to our understanding
    and evaluation of simulation and testbed scenarios.</p>"
