abstract:
- content: "<p>As Enterprises and Service Providers try to decide whether or not to
    upgrade their brown field or green field MPLS/SR core to an IPv6 transport, Multiprotocol
    BGP (MP-BGP)now plays an important role in the transition of their Provider (P)
    core network as well as Provider Edge (PE) Edge network from IPv4 to IPv6. Operators
    must be able to continue to support IPv4 customers when both the Core and Edge
    networks are IPv4-Only. This document details an important External BGP (eBGP)
    PE-CE Edge IPv4-Only peering design that leverages the MP-BGP capability exchange
    by using IPv4 peering as pure transport, allowing both IPv4 Network Layer Reachability
    Information (NLRI) and IPv6 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI)to be
    carried over the same (Border Gateway Protocol) BGP TCP session. The design change
    provides the same Dual Stacking functionality that exists today with separate
    IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions as we have today. With this design change from a control
    plane perspective a single IPv4 is required for both IPv4 and IPv6 routing updates
    and from a data plane forwarindg perspective an IPv4 address need only be configured
    on the PE and CE interface for both IPv4 and IPv6 packet forwarding. This document
    provides a IPv4-Only PE design solution for use cases where operators are not
    yet ready to migrate to IPv6 or SRv6 core and would like to stay on IPv4-Only
    Core short to long term and maybe even indefinitely. With this design, operators
    can now remain with an IPv4-Only Core and do not have to migrate to an IPv6-Only
    Core. From a technical standpoint the underlay can remain IPv4 and still transport
    IPv6 NLRI to support IPv6 customers, and so does not need to be migrated to IPv6-Only
    underlay. With this IPv4-Only PE Design solution , IPv4 addressing only needs
    to be provisioned for the IPv4-Only PE-CE eBGP Edge peering design, thereby eliminating
    IPv6 provisioning at the Edge. This core and edge IPv4-Only peering design can
    apply to any eBGP peering, public internet or private, which can be either Core
    networks, Data Center networks, Access networks or can be any eBGP peering scenario.
    This document provides vendor specific test cases for the IPv4-Only peering design
    as well as test results for the five major vendors stakeholders in the routing
    and switching indusrty, Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Nokia and Huawei. With the test
    results provided for the IPv4-Only Edge peering design, the goal is that all other
    vendors around the world that have not been tested will begin to adopt and implement
    this new Best Current Practice for eBGP IPv4-Only Edge peering. This Best Current
    Practice IPv4-only eBGP peering design specification will help in use cases where
    operators are not yet ready to migrate to IPv6 or SRv6 core or for very lage operator
    core with thousdands of nodes where it maybe impractical to change the underlay
    infrastructure to IPv6, and can now keep the existing IPv4 data plane IP, MPLS
    or SR-MPLS underlay intact indefinitely. This document also defines a new IPv4
    next hop encoding for IPv6 NLRI over IPv4 Next Hop to uses 4 byte IPv4 address
    for the next hop and not a IPv4 mapped IPv6 address. This encoding has been adopted
    by the industry but has not been standardized until now with this document.</p>"
