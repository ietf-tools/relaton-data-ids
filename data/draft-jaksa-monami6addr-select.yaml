abstract:
- content: <p>When a correspondent node (CN) initiates a session with a multi-homed
    Mobile Node (MN), it should choose the "best" destination address based on the
    available information about the MN. Presently there is no mechanism allowing the
    MN to indicate on which interface (i.e., address) a CN may reach it. This draft
    documents a method whereby the MN may communicate to the CN address selection
    preferences so that the CN may initiate a session to the desired address (interface)
    for of the MN. The method is based on the notion of storing address selection
    preference information for the MN in the DNS.</p>
