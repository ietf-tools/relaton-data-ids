abstract:
- content: "<p>This document limits the Domain Name System (DNS) KEY Resource Record
    (RR) to only keys used by the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).
    The original KEY RR used sub-typing to store both DNSSEC keys and arbitrary application
    keys. Storing both DNSSEC and application keys with the same record type is a
    mistake. This document removes application keys from the KEY record by redefining
    the Protocol Octet field in the KEY RR Data. As a result of removing application
    keys, all but one of the flags in the KEY record become unnecessary and are redefined.
    Three existing application key sub-types are changed to reserved, but the format
    of the KEY record is not changed. This document updates RFC 2535. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
