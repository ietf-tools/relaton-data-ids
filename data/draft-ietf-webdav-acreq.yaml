abstract:
- content: "<p>To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within a
    distributed World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary to furnish a
    methodology which controls access to objects. Access control may include the ability
    to read an object, modify an object, or perform other more advanced functions
    upon an object. Access control is necessary to prevent unauthorized access or
    modification of objects within the authoring environment which could lead to unintended
    loss, damage or disclosure of data. This document proposes requirements for the
    support of access control within a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)
    environment. It describes a model for the representation and interpretation of
    access control policies, and a set of operations needed to manage policies in
    that form. It is intended that these requirements be supported within the framework
    of the proposed WebDAV extensions [WEBDAV1] to HTTP [HTTP], in the form of additional
    protocol operations and compliance requirements for clients and servers</p>"
