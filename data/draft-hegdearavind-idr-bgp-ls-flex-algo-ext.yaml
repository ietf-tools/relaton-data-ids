abstract:
- content: "<p>Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows some routing protocols
    (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user- defined
    (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics. The computation is performed by
    routers participating in the specific network in a distributed manner using a
    Flexible Algorithm Definition. This Definition is provisioned on one or more routers
    and propagated through the network by OSPF and IS-IS flooding. BGP Link-State
    (BGP-LS) enables the collection of various topology information from the network.
    BGP-LS supports the advertisement of Flexible Algorithm Definition and other Flexible
    Algorithm related advertisements as a part of the topology information from the
    network. This document specifies the advertisement of further Flexible Algorithm
    related extensions in BGP-LS.</p>"
