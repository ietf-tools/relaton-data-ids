abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an optimization to the Routing Information Protocol
    (RIP) routing protocol for use in embedded RF IPv6 internets such as those used
    in 6lowpan [7] networks. RIPless specifies the minimal changes to RIP, as specified
    in RIPng [2], RIP [3] and RIPv2 [4] to allow the protocol to be used in a "lossy"
    RF networks where the routing fabric of the network is built upon powered nodes
    and that only the edge devices may be battery powered.</p>
