abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the "tag" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    scheme. Tag URIs (also known as "tags") are designed to be unique across space
    and time while being tractable to humans. They are distinct from most other URIs
    in that they have no authoritative resolution mechanism. A tag may be used purely
    as an entity identifier. Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over the
    common practice of using "http" URIs as identifiers for non-HTTP-accessible resources.
