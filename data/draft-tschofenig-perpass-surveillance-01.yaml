abstract:
- content: "<p>Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's communications
    or activities. Surveillance is one of several privacy /security threats engineers
    try to take into account in their designs. The reports about pervasive monitoring
    of Internet traffic have, however, surprised many since the scale was not envisaged
    during the design of many Internet protocols even though the ambition to offer
    end-to-end security on the Internet dates back even to the 70ies. The approach
    to get access to meta-data as well as to communication content has taken forms
    that are largely indistinguishable from ordinary attacks. This document explains
    the attacks in context of the larger Internet eco-system.</p>"
