abstract:
- content: "<p>Performing pre-call probing to discover a reasonable value for the
    available bandwidth, is useful information that can be utilized by bandwidth sensitive
    or bandwidth intensive network devices (e.g., video encoders). The method described
    herein is intended to produce an initial bandwidth value. Applications using this
    mechanism should also employ appropriate rate adaptation techniques. In addition
    to bandwidth, latency and bufferbloat can also be measured. No modification is
    needed on the server side.</p>"
