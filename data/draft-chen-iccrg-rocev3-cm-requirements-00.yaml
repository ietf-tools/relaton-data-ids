abstract:
- content: "<p>On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2 protocol.
    RoCEv2 specification does not define the strong congestion management mechanisms
    and load balancing methods. RoCEv2 relies on the existing Link-Layer Flow-Control
    IEEE 802.1Qbb(Priority-based Flow Control, PFC)to provide a lossless fabric. RoCEv2
    Congestion Management(RCM) use ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification, defined in
    RFC3168) to signal the congestion to the destination and use the congestion notification
    to reduce the rate of injection and increase the injection rate when the extent
    of congestion decreases. More and more practice of congestion management for RoCEv2
    appear in the industry, such as DCQCN(Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification).
    There is a demanding for the new RoCEv3 protocol to provide stronger congestion
    management and load balancing mechanisms for RDMA deployment in modern datacenter.</p>"
