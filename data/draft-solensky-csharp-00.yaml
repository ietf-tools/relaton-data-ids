abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents an extension to the method of classifying and assigning
    IP network numbers. It is intended to provide a work-around to the imminent exhaustion
    of assignable Class B network numbers (and, to a lesser extent, the recent growth
    of routes that need to be tracked in the NSFNet routing database) by defining
    the format of Class C-sharp (C#) IP addresses, consuming the upper half of the
    existing Class C numbering space. The manner in which these changes impact existing
    systems is also discussed. It is a product of a 'birds-of-a-feather' (BoF) discussion
    held on July 31, 1991 at the twenty-first IETF conference in Atlanta, GA and subsequent
    discussions on the mailing list. It should be noted that this document does NOT
    solve the limitations inherent in the current routing architectures and technology
    that are discussed. These must wait until new architectures are developed. Specifically,
    the issue of scaling the size of future routing tables is only indirectly addressed.</p>"
