abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP is attracting more and more attention as a valuable tool to enable
    and support voice and multimedia communications over the Internet. However, a
    significant number of potential customers for SIP-based services are for various
    reasons unable to, or choose not to, use voice communication technologies. This
    document offers a proposed set of requirements and identifies some of the key
    issues that need resolution to allow full accessibility for this group to SIP-based
    Internet communications. This document is intended to continue the discussion
    begun in a previous draft (see Acknowledgements) and to lay a foundation for design
    and implementation discussions in future drafts.</p>"
