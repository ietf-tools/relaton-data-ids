abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to RFC
    2598. The primary motivation for this draft is that the definition of EF PHB given
    in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition of the EF PHB, and has been determined
    to be unimplementable in a manner compliant with the definition. In particular,
    no work-conserving scheduler, including all of the schedulers listed in the Implementation
    Examples section of RFC 2598, can comply with the definition given in that RFC.
    This draft gives a rigorous definition of EF PHB which in our opinion preserves
    the spirit of the EF PHB as intended by RFC 2598 while allowing a number of reasonable
    compliant implementations. The document also provides implementation guidance
    and lists several possible implementation examples which conform to the definition
    given in this draft.</p>"
