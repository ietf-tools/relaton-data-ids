abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes BGMP, a protocol for inter-domain multicast
    routing. BGMP builds shared trees for active multicast groups, and allows receiver
    domains to build source-specific, inter-domain, distribution branches where needed.
    Building upon concepts from CBT and PIM-SM, BGMP requires that each multicast
    group be associated with a single root (in BGMP it is referred to as the root
    domain). BGMP assumes that at any point in time, different ranges of the class
    D space are associated (e.g., with MASC [MASC]) with different domains. Each of
    these domains then becomes the root of the shared domain-trees for all groups
    in its range. Multicast participants will generally receive better multicast service
    if the session initiator's address allocator selects addresses from its own domain's
    part of the space, thereby</p>"
