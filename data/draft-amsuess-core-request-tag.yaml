abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an optional extension to the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP, [RFC7252] and [RFC7959]) that allows matching of request blocks.
    This primarily serves to transfer the security properties that Object Security
    of CoAP (OSCOAP, [I-D.ietf-core-object-security]) provides for single requests
    to blockwise transfers. The security of blockwise transfer in OSCOAP is reflected
    on in a dedicated section.</p>"
