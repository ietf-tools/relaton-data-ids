abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims to propose guidelines for human rights considerations,
    similar to the work done on the guidelines for privacy considerations (RFC 6973).
    The other parts of this document explain the background of the guidelines and
    how they were developed. This document is the first milestone in a longer-term
    research effort. It has been reviewed by the Human Rights Protocol Considerations
    (HRPC) Research Group and also by individuals from outside the research group.</p>"
