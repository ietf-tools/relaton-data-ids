abstract:
- content: <p>This document performs an analysis of the security and privacy implications
    of different types of "transient numeric identifiers" used in IETF protocols,
    and tries to categorize them based on their interoperability requirements and
    their associated failure severity when such requirements are not met. Subsequently,
    it provides advice on possible algorithms that could be employed to satisfy the
    interoperability requirements of each identifier category, while minimizing the
    negative security and privacy implications, thus providing guidance to protocol
    designers and protocol implementers. Finally, it describes a number of algorithms
    that have been employed in real implementations to generate transient numeric
    identifiers, and analyzes their security and privacy properties. This document
    is a product of the Privacy Enhancement and Assessment Research Group (PEARG)
    in the IRTF.</p>
