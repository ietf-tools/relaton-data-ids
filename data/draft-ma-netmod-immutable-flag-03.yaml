abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a YANG extension named "immutable" to indicate
    that specific "config true" data nodes are not allowed to be created/deleted/updated.
    To indicate that specific entries of a list/leaf-list node or instances inside
    list entries cannot be updated/deleted after initialization, a metadata annotation
    with the same name is also defined. Any data node or instance marked as immutable
    is read-only to the clients of YANG-driven management protocols, such as NETCONF,
    RESTCONF and other management operations (e.g., SNMP and CLI requests). This document
    aims to provide more visibility into immutability characteristic of particular
    schema or instance nodes by defining a standard mechanism to allow the server
    to document the existing immutable configuration data, while this doesn't mean
    attaching such restrictions is encouraged.</p>
