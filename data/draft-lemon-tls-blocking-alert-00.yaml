abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts connecting to the Internet should generally be able to connect
    to all available services. However, as a matter of policy, need or preference,
    some services may be blocked by the network. TLS correctly treats attempts to
    communicate the reason for such blockage to the client as an attack. This memo
    describes a safe way for hosts to be notified using the TLS alert mechanism that
    a connection has been blocked by the network.</p>"
