abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo registers MIME [RFC-MIME] Content-Types for a number of file
    formats common to the Microsoft Windows environment. The intention is to aid interoperability
    between mail systems, and to enumerate possible conversions at gateways. This
    document does not provide detailed descriptions of individual formats, since published
    descriptions are already available from other sources, notably [SDK4], and are,
    in some cases, quite complex.</p>"
