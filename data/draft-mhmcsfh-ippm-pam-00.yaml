abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a set of metrics for networking services with
    performance requirements expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLO). These metrics,
    referred to as Precision Availability Metrics (PAM), can be used to assess the
    service levels that are being delivered. Specifically, PAM can be used to determine
    the degree of compliance with which service levels are being delivered relative
    to pre-defined SLOs. PAM can be used to provide a service according to its SLO
    as part of accounting records, to account for the actual quality with which services
    were delivered and whether or not any SLO violations occurred. Also, PAM can be
    used to continuously monitor the quality with which the service is delivered.</p>"
