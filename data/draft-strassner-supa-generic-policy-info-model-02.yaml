abstract:
- content: "<p>Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines an interface to
    a network management function that takes high-level, possibly network-wide policies
    as input and creates element configuration snippets as output. SUPA addresses
    the needs of operators and application developers to represent multiple types
    of policy rules, which vary in the level of abstraction, to suit the needs of
    different actors. This document defines a single common extensible framework for
    representing different types of policy rules, in the form of a set of information
    model fragments, that is independent of language, protocol, repository, and the
    level of abstraction of the content of the policy rule. This enables a common
    set of concepts defined in this set of information models to be mapped into different
    data models that use different languages, protocols, and repositories to optimize
    their usage. The definition of common policy concepts also provides better interoperability
    by ensuring that each data model can share a set of common concepts, independent
    of its level of detail or the language, protocol, and/or repository that it is
    using. Specifically, this document defines three information models:</p>"
