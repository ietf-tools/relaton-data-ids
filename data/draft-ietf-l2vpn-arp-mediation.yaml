abstract:
- content: <p>The Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), detailed in RFC 4664, provides
    point-to-point connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices. It does
    so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device with a Provider
    Edge (PE) device) to a pseudowire (connecting the two PEs). In general, the Attachment
    Circuits must be of the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet or both ATM), and
    the pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology. However, if it is known
    that the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide
    a point-to-point connection in which the pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits
    of different technologies. This requires the PEs to perform a function known as
    "Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Mediation". ARP Mediation refers to the process
    of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution protocols are used on
    either Attachment Circuit. The methods described in this document are applicable
    even when the CEs run a routing protocol between them, as long as the routing
    protocol runs over IP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
