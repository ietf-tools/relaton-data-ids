abstract:
- content: <p>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers
    a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment
    can represent topological or service based instructions. A segment can further
    be associated with a set of network resources used for executing the instruction.
    Such a segment is called resource-aware segment. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN)
    is a virtual underlay network which is associated with a network topology, and
    is allocated with a set of dedicated or shared resources from the underlay physical
    network. Resource-aware Segment Identifiers (SIDs) may be used to build SR paths
    with a set of reserved network resources. In addition, a group of resource-aware
    SIDs may be used to build SR based virtual underlay networks, which provide customized
    network topology and resource attributes required by one or a group of customers
    and/or services. Such virtual underlay networks are the SR instantiations of VTNs.
    This document describes a suggested approach to build SR based VTNs using resource-aware
    SIDs.</p>
