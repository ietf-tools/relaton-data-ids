abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents the problem statement and use cases for a sub-
    path transport layer. A sub-path is a portion of a network path that has localized
    characteristics that are of interest to an operator to manage. The structure for
    managing a sub-path is the "sub-path transport layer". A sub-path transport layer
    can provide transport layer mechanisms, such as reliability and congestion control,
    over the aggregate of packets traversing the sub-path. Additionally, a sub-path
    transport layer can provide performance measurements of traffic over a sub-path
    which in turn can be input to operations and management. The sub-path transport
    layer implies the possibility that traffic may be subject to two transport layer
    control loops, that of the sub-path and that of a higher layer transport protocol,
    any such solution must consider the ramifications of that.</p>
