abstract:
- content: "<p>Many domain registries, especially sponsored TLDs and ccTLDs, have
    specific policy that calls for the server to perform additional backend processing
    before it completes a transform operation on an object requested by a client.
    When the pending action is completed, the server must notify the client about
    the outcome. However, current EPP core specifications do not address the notification
    messaging in a generic way. As a result, a registry has to resort to defining
    a new schema as extension to the object mapping concerned for this purpose. Inspired
    by recent discussions on the 'ietf-provreg' mailing list on related topics, this
    draft presents a strawman proposal for uniform treatment of server notification
    for pending action in the base EPP protocol. A new OPTIONAL child element is added
    to &lt;poll&gt; response as basic notification content, which consists of the
    transaction ID that triggered the pending action and the outcome of the pending
    action. In addition, object specific data and extension information can be piggybacked
    in existing child elements of &lt;response&gt;. The required modification to the
    EPP base protocol is kept to the minimum and incurs no change to the EPP base
    object mappings. Most importantly, the proposed solution is applicable to any
    object mapping, ensuring EPP's extensibility beyond domain registry applications.
    Strong interests by the registry community in deploying this feature warrant that
    it be best handled as a generic but optional feature in the EPP base protocol.
    This allows any registry to handle pending action without the need to define a
    new schema, eliminating the proliferation of ad hoc object extensions repetitively
    defined by disparate registries for the very same purpose.</p>"
