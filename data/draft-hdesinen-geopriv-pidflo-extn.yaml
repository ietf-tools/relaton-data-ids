abstract:
- content: <p>The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification
    provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information. The
    XML Schema presented in this memo extends the 'geopriv' element defined in PIDF-LO
    with a complex XML element called "device-loc-capabilities". A device can specify
    this element inside a 'geopriv' element to communicate the position determination
    methods and the location solutions supported by it to a location server. Knowledge
    of the device's location capabilities can permit a server along the path of an
    emergency voice over IP call to immediately initiate position determination update
    procedures when needed.</p>
