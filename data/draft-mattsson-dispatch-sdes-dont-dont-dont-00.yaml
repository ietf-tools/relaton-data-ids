abstract:
- content: "<p>Key exchange without forward secrecy enables pervasive monitoring.
    Massive pervasive monitoring attacks relying on key exchange without forward secrecy
    have been reported, and many more have likely happened without ever being reported.
    If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman is used, access to long-term keys enable
    passive attackers to compromise past and future sessions. Entities can get access
    to long-term key material in different ways: physical attacks, hacking, social
    engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding access to keying material
    with or without a court order. Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions
    (RFC 4568) does not offer PFS and has a large number of additional significant
    security weaknesses. This document specifies that use of the SDP Security Descriptions
    is NOT RECOMMENDED. New deployments SHOULD forbid support of SDP Security Descriptions.
    This document reclassifies RFC 4568 (SDP Security Descriptions) to Historic Status
    and also obsoletes RFC 4568. This document updates RFC 7201 (Options for Securing
    RTP Sessions) to note that SDP Security Descriptions SHOULD NOT be used.</p>"
