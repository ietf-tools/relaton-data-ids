    It outlines the components of a monitoring infrastructure designed to support
    ISP requirements. It discusses deployment and inter-operability issues. Related
    IETF working groups are identified. The goal of this document is to open a discussion
    on whether there should be a BOF addressing this issue at the next IETF (Vienna,
    July 2003).</p>"
