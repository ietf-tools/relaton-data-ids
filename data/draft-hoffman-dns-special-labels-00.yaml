abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an new IANA registry for special labels in the
    DNS. The registry is useful because the labels cause special handling in DNS entities
    such as stub resolvers, recursive resolvers, and applications that use DNS, and
    developers of software for those entities should be aware of the many types of
    special labels in use. [[ A GitHub repo for this document is at https://github.com/paulehoffman/dns-special-labels
    ]]</p>"
