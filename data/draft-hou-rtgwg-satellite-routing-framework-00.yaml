abstract:
- content: "<p>The inter-satellite routing is the premis to ensure that the satellite
    network provides end-to-end stable service covering the whole globe. However,
    the mature terrestrial network technologies are difficult to directly apply to
    the satellite network because of the highly dynamic network topology and the limited
    on-board resources. This issue is further exacerbated in LEO mega- constellations.
    In view of this challenge, this document presents a routing framework for LEO
    mega-constellation. Based on the orbit position characteristic and the predictable
    topology, this framwork realizes flexible region division, establishes intra-region
    and inter-region path, as well as completes end-to-end data forwarding.</p>"
