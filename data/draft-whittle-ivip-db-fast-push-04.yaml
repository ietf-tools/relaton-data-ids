abstract:
- content: "<p>draft-whittle-ivip-db-fast-push-03 was relevant to Ivip before the
    introduction (2010-02-26) of Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM). While these
    techniques might be of interest for other purposes, they are no longer part of
    Ivip. This -04 version is simply a notice to this effect. Please see draft-whittle-ivip-drtm.</p>"
