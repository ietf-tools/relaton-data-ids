abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC-2476] defines a new protocol used for message submission. In many
    circumstances it could be located on port different from the traditional SMTP
    port. The fate of a message may depend on whether particular server is Submit
    or SMTP server, because even inside the same organization Submit and SMTP servers
    may inforce different policy. Thus the correct discovering of submit server location
    is important.</p>"
