abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol is a key management
    standard defined in RFC 3830 for streaming and real-time applications. In these
    applications, the MIKEY protocol may be used to provide group key management.
    With the base protocol, the change of one group member triggers the unicast transmission
    of a new group key to all members. In the context of an application delivering
    multicast streams to end-users located at multiple capillary networks, the key
    update messages may scale in proportion to the number of nodes; thus creating
    a substantial overhead. This I-D proposes an extension to the MIKEY protocol allowing
    the management of the group as a set of clusters, but with fewer changes to the
    RFC 3830 standard. Clustering helps in reducing the communication overhead produced
    during key update by using unicast mode only with nodes that belong to clusters
    where group membership changes</p>"
