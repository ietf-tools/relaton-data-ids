abstract:
- content: "<p>To improve scalability of MPLS TE it may be useful to aggregate TE
    LSPs. The aggregation is accomplished by (a) an LSR creating a TE LSP, (b) the
    LSR forming a forwarding adjacency out of that LSP (advertising this LSP as a
    link into ISIS/OSPF), (c) allowing other LSRs to use forwarding adjacencies for
    their path computation, and (d) nesting of LSPs originated by other LSRs into
    that LSP (by using the label stack construct). This document describes the mechanisms
    to accomplish this.</p>"
