abstract:
- content: "<p>When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains can
    be resolved authoritatively by the network-provided DNS resolver. DNS clients
    that don't always use this resolver might wish to do so for these domains. This
    specification describes how clients can confirm the local resolver's authority
    over these domains.</p>"
