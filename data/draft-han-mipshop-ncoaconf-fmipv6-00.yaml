abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new care-of address (NCoA) configuration and
    confirmation scheme for the Mobile IPv6 fast handover protocol (FMIPv6). The goal
    of this proposal makes FMIPv6 address configuration and confirmation 'very fast'
    and its confirmation result 'always successful'. The proposed scheme can become
    a supplementary function implemented in only nodes which play a role of new access
    router in FMIPv6.</p>"
