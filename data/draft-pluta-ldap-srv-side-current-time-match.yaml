abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    to support server side current time matching. Matching of time-stamp attribute
    values against an LDAP server's current time offers advantages for example in
    case third party products' LDAP client configuration directives (e.g. LDAP filter
    statements) do not offer support to dynamically rewrite/replace a filter's assertion
    value for each request. Using the matching rules defined in this document the
    client is able to provide a constant matching rule assertion value to trigger
    the server side comparison of the given/stored 'Generalized Time' syntax based
    attribute value against the LDAP server's current time. Therefore this document
    specifies four matching rules and two dedicated assertion syntaxes to be used
    in conjuntion with the well known 'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute values.</p>"
