abstract:
- content: "<p>The process of producing today's Internet through a culture of open
    participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly efficient and effective,
    and it is distinctive among standards organizations. Historically participation
    in the IETF and its antecedent was almost entirely composed of well-funded, American,
    white, male engineers, establishing a distinctive and challenging group dynamic,
    both in management and in personal interactions. In the case of the IETF, interaction
    style can often demonstrate singularly aggressive behavior, often including singularly
    hostile tone and content. Groups with greater diversity make better decisions.
    Obtaining meaningful diversity requires more than generic good will and statements
    of principle. Many different behaviors can serve to reduce participant diversity
    or participation diversity. This paper discusses the nature and practicalities
    of IETF attention to its diverse participation and to the requirement for professional
    demeanor.</p>"
