abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
    protocols intentionally separate the handling of prefixes for their purposes:
    these prefixes can be different for the same link even if it may be uncommon in
    practice; validation for these purposes is expected to be performed separately
    and independently. Despite the revised text of the latest versions of these protocol
    specifications, it appears that the idea of this separation can still be easily
    misunderstood. This document clarifies the idea even more explicitly in order
    to set the common understanding of the intent of the current specifications.</p>"
