abstract:
- content: "<p>An overview of a tag switching architecture is provided in [Rekhter].
    This document defines the Tag Distribution Protocol (TDP) referred to in [Rekhter].
    TDP is a two party protocol that runs over a connection oriented transport layer
    with guaranteed sequential delivery. Tag Switching Routers use TDP to communicate
    tag binding information to their peers. TDP supports multiple network layer protocols
    including but not limited to IPv4, IPv6, IPX and AppleTalk. We define here the
    PDUs and operational procedures for this TDP and specify its transport requirements.
    We also define aspects of the protocol that are specific to the case where it
    is run over an ATM datalink.</p>"
