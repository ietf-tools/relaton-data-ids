abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the CONNECT-IP HTTP method.
    This extension defines a new Flow Forwarding Mode which supports optimization
    for individual IP flows forwarded to the targeted peer. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This
    draft exists only to demonstrate the feasibility of defining CONNECT-IP Flow Forwarding
    Mode as an extension to CONNECT-IP. The overwhelming majority of the content in
    this draft was copied from draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip- 01. A list of changes
    from that design is available in an appendix to this document. All credit for
    flow forwarding should go to the authors of that document. However, all blame
    for any errors in this draft should be attributed to its editor. The editor's
    intent is to step down as editor of this draft and have the authors of draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip
    take on that role. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before publishing
    as an RFC. Discussion of this document takes place on the Multiplexed Application
    Substrate over QUIC Encryption Working Group mailing list (masque@ietf.org), which
    is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/masque/.</p>"
