abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv4 base protocol
    [RFC2002] enabling mobile nodes and mobility agents to dynamically setup security
    associations. Mobile IP is therefore employed as a supporting protocol for SA
    negotiation. The proposed mechanism is based on RSA cryptography [RSA78], entities
    acting as key distribution centers and Diffie-Hellman exchanges [DH76].</p>"
