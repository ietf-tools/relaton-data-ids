abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains how to map a geodetic datum to a civic address
    and vice versa. Server accepts an HTTP POST with one form of user specified location
    addresses and return whatever other form it has. [Open Issue : re-frame this draft
    as more about the inclusion of a &lt;presence&gt; element in a HELD request, rather
    than about geocoding specifically, since there are other applications. E.g., we
    might provide a rough location in our request to help the server provide us with
    GPS assistance data.]</p>"
