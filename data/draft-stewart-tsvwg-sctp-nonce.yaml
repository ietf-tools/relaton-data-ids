abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the addition of the ECN-nonce RFC 3540 [RFC3540]
    to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC 2960 [RFC2960]. The ECN-nonce
    reduces the vulnerability of ECN senders to misbehaving receivers that conceal
    congestion signals like ECN marks and packet losses. The ECN-nonce approach is
    different in SCTP because SCTP uses chunks for extensible protocol features and
    is selective acknowlegement (SACK)-based; this document describes those differences.
    In particular this document describes (1) protocol extensions in the form of a
    single new parameter for the INIT/ INIT-ACK chunks, and a single bit flag in the
    SACK chunk, and (2) rules governing the sender and receiver side implementation.
    This document outlines a minimum response that an SCTP sender should apply after
    detecting a misbehaving receiver.</p>"
