abstract:
- content: "<p>ALC and FLUTE are reliable content delivery protocols designed mainly
    for scalable multicast distribution. However, this does not preclude their deployment
    in the Unicast distribution mode over connectionless or connection-oriented transport
    protocols. A method for framing ALC and FLUTE packets onto connection-oriented
    transport is presented. A definition of the descriptors of the framing method
    for those protocols is also given.</p>"
