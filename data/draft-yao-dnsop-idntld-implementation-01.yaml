abstract:
- content: "<p>ICANN is pushing the IDN TLD into the root server. Some IDN TLD has
    the variants. Currently, there are two proposals to implement the IDN TLD variants
    in the root servers:1, implement it with the DNAME record; 2, implement it with
    NS record. The IDN TLD variants may be reserved or activated. If the IDN TLD variants
    are activated, these variants will be allocated to the same TLD manager in order
    to avoid the possible phishing problems. How to deal with the IDN TLD variant
    issue is a big challenge ahead of us. This document discusses the IDN TLD variants
    implementation issues related with DNAME and NS resource record way. This memo
    also gives a proposal about how to avoid the possible phishing problem after putting
    the IDN TLD variants into the root.</p>"
