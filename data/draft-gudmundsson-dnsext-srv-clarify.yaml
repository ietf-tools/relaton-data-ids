abstract:
- content: <p>The DNS SRV record has been specified in RFC 2052 and RFC 2782 for use
    in dynamic service discovery for a domain. These two RFCs did not clearly specify
    an IANA registry for the names of the services and their underlying protocols.
    This document clarifies RFC 2782 regarding the formation and use of the Service
    Prefix in the owner name of SRV records, based on the unified IANA "Service Name
    and Transport Protocol Port Number" registry and provides a few other corrections,
    clarifications, and usage recommendations.</p>
