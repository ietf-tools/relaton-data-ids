abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a protocol for decentralizing IPv4 NAT to the customer-premises
    equipment (CPE) such that no state information is kept on the central NAT device.
    The CPE uses a restricted source port set that is encoded in its provisioned IPv4
    WAN address. The NAT device performs only strictly stateless address (not port)
    translation.</p>"
