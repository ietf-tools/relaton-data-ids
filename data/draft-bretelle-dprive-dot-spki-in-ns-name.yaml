- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to exchange the Subject Public
    Key Info (SPKI) ([RFC5280] Section 4.1.2.7) fingerprint associated with a DNS-over-TLS
    (DoT [RFC7858]) authoritative server by encoding it as part of its name. The fingerprint
    can thereafter be used to validate the certificate received from the DoT server
    as well as being able to discover support for DoT on the server.</p>"
