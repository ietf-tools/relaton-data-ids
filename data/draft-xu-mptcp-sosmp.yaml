abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a new stochastic optimal scheduler for the Multipath
    Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP). The new scheduler is based on the Lyapunov
    optimatization technique, which can make online control decision for data scheduling.
    Considering the payment of users for different paths, this memo makes a trade
    off between the throughput utility and the cost. The new scheduler can not only
    satisfy the demand of service, but also minimize the cost as much as possible.</p>"
