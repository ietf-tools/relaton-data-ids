abstract:
- content: "<p>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides
    mobility and multihoming support by introducing the concept of 'upper layer thread
    ID', which is associated with some shared secret that is applied with some secure
    hash or authenticated encryption algorithm to protect authenticity of the origin
    of the FSP packets. It is able to provide following services to the upper layer
    application: o Stream-oriented send-receive with native message boundary o Flexibility
    to exploit authenticated encryption o On-the-wire compression o Light-weight session
    management</p>"
