abstract:
- content: "<p>When an RTP receiver joins a multicast session, it may need to acquire
    and parse certain Reference Information before it can process any data sent in
    the multicast session. Depending on the join time, length of the Reference Information
    repetition (or appearance) interval, size of the Reference Information, and the
    application and transport properties, the time lag before an RTP receiver can
    usefully consume the multicast data, which we refer to as the Acquisition Delay,
    varies and can be large. This is an undesirable phenomenon for receivers that
    frequently switch among different multicast sessions, such as video broadcasts.
    In this document, we describe a method using the existing RTP and RTP Control
    Protocol (RTCP) machinery that reduces the acquisition delay. In this method,
    an auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to the receiver
    precedes or accompanies the multicast stream. This unicast RTP flow can be transmitted
    at a faster than natural bitrate to further accelerate the acquisition. The motivating
    use case for this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time compressed
    audio and video. However, this method can also be used in other types of multicast
    applications where the acquisition delay is long enough to be a problem. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
