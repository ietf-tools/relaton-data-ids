- content: "<p>This document proposes the VoxelVideo format, a file structure designed
    specifically for the efficient handling, playback, and livestreaming of 3D voxel-based
    videos. The format is intended for applications in gaming, virtual reality, live
    sports, and interactive media, providing a robust framework for managing complex
    3D data with spatial precision and color fidelity. This document describes the
    current JSON-based version and outlines future plans to adopt a more efficent,
    compressed format.</p>"
