abstract:
- content: "<p>While conventional wisdom has it that Wireless Access Points are strictly
    Layer 2 bridges, such devices today perform some higher layer functions of routers
    or switches in wired Infrastructure in addition to bridging the wired and wireless
    networks. For example, in 802.11 networks, Access Points can function as Network
    Access Servers. For this reason, Access Points have IP addresses and can function
    as IP devices.</p>"
