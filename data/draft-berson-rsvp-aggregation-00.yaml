abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[2] has a fundamental
    scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at all routers and end-systems
    supporting a flow. This draft examines the use of aggregation as a technique to
    reduce the amount of state needed to provide IIS, and describes the modifications
    to RSVP to support aggregation. In our approach, routers at the edge of a region
    doing aggregation keep detailed IIS state, while in the interior of this region,
    routers keep a greatly reduced amount of state. Packets will be tagged at the
    edge with scheduling information that will be used in place of the detailed IIS
    state. The aggregation scheme described will allow large scale deployment of IIS
    without overloading routers with state and associated processing.</p>"
