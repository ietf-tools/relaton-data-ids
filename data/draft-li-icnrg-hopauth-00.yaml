abstract:
- content: "<p>The unpredictability of consumers, routers, copyholders, and publishers
    for the in-network data retrievals in Content-Centric Networking (CCN) / Named
    Data Networking (NDN) poses a challenge to design an authentication mechanism
    to inhibit the malicious consumers to flood data requests and prevent the fake
    data from being provided. Signature is adopted as the fundamental function in
    CCN / NDN, which however can only provide publisher authentication with additional
    certificate acquisition. This document describes the the Hop-by-Hop Authentication
    mechanism (HopAuth) integrating certificate collection and packet forwarding potentially
    with the assistance from certificate authority to provide consumer authentication,
    copyholder authentication and path authentication to enable the in-network data
    retrieval to be trustworthy, besides the publisher authentication.</p>"
