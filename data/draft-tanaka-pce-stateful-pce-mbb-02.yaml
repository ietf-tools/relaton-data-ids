abstract:
- content: <p>Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding protocol
    extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do stateful control of MPLS
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP). Stateful PCE supports manipulating
    the existing LSP's state and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and route) and also creating
    totally new LSPs in the network. In the current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE,
    LSPs are often controlled by "make-before-break (M-B-B)" signaling by headend
    for the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization. In most cases, it is an
    essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data disruption. This document
    specifies the procedure of applying stateful PCE's control to make-before-break
    RSVP-TE signaling. In this document, two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures
    are defined, implicit mode and explicit mode. This document also specifies the
    usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages, expected
    behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several extensions of additional PCEP objects.</p>
