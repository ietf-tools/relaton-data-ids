- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for discovering multicast reachability
    between end systems within/between multicast enabled networks. It uses request/response
    messages to verify multicast reachability between the local site and a remote
    site. With this utility, multicast users can test if they can successfully join
    a multicast group of a remote source and receiver its data.</p>"
