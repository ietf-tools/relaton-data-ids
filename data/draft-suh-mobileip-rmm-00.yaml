abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new protocol, namely, Regional Mobile IPv6
    mobility management (RMM/RMIPv6). RMM mechanism satisfies the LMM requirements.
    This document therefore describes methods to be used to reduce the amount of signaling
    to the Home Agent and Correspondent Nodes. In addition, this scheme is flexible
    enough to adapt to any network topology assumed by IPv6. The network that using
    RMM/RMIPv6 is robust against the failure or the performance degradation. The mechanism
    is intended to reuse the Care of Address. Moreover, the forwarding tunnel length
    from an anchor point to a Mobile Node can be a controllable or configurable.</p>"
