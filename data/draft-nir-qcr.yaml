abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that allows
    for faster crash recovery using a saved token method. When an IPsec tunnel between
    two IKEv2 implementations is disconnected due to a restart of one peer, it can
    take as much as several minutes to recover. In this text we propose an extension
    to the protocol, that allows for recovery within a few seconds of the reboot.</p>"
