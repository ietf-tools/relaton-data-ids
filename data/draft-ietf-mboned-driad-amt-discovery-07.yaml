abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 7450 (Automatic Multicast Tunneling, or AMT)
    by extending the relay discovery process to use a new DNS resource record named
    AMTRELAY when discovering AMT relays for source-specific multicast channels. The
    reverse IP DNS zone for a multicast sender's IP address is configured to use AMTRELAY
    resource records to advertise a set of AMT relays that can receive and forward
    multicast traffic from that sender over an AMT tunnel.</p>"
