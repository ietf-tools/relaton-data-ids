abstract:
- content: "<p>The number and type of Internet connected devices continues to grow
    rapidly. Sensors are a new category of devices that are becoming Internet connected.
    While sensors have existed for a long time, it is only now that we see sensors
    being capable of communicating via an IP stack. Sensors are used in a multitude
    of industries and applications. By enabling these devices to be Internet connected,
    they open up new vistas in terms of applications and uses. Most sensors are generally
    small with minimal power and processing capabilities. The ability to configure
    these devices is a challenge. However, in order to make the usage and deployment
    of Internet connected sensors easier, it is essential that there exist a well
    defined configuration, control, and service discovery mechanism. This document
    illustrates various use cases of sensors in different types of deployments and
    a solution for configuring and controlling them in addition to the ability for
    sensors and devices to discover services.</p>"
