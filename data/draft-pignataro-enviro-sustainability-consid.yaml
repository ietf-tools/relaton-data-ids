abstract:
- content: "<p>Embedding sustainability considerations at the design of new protocols
    and extensions is more effective than attempting to do so after-the-fact. Consequently,
    this document also gives network, protocol, and application designers and implementers
    sustainability- related advice and guidance. This document recommends to authors
    and reviewers the inclusion of a Sustainability Considerations section in IETF
    Internet-Drafts and RFCs.</p>"
