abstract:
- content: "<p>Once an Internet technology is specified and developed, it must be
    deployed and operated. Success of the Internet has relied on the combination of
    technical development, administrative assignment and operational interconnection.
    Just as Internet success frequently relies on central coordination for the creation
    of interoperable technologies, it frequently relies on central coordination for
    deployment and operation of the interoperable services that use those technologies.</p>"
