abstract:
- content: "<p>NSIS state management needs to track data path changes and update the
    states along the affected data paths. However, in certain scenarios, there are
    multiple concurrent paths involved in the communication. In this case, the normal
    NSIS scheme does not provide sufficient support for the state manipulation. Therefore,
    extra functionality for data path identification and distinction is necessary.
    In current Internet, with the increasing use of multi-homing devices and the employment
    of Mobile IP, the above issue is getting more prominent. This draft discusses
    in detail the problems and issues involved in the NSIS state management relevant
    to the data path differentiation. Specific scenarios for multi-homing and Mobile
    IP route optimization are studied. Potential solution and its impacts on current
    NSIS protocol design are discussed as well.</p>"
