abstract:
- content: "<p>Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes organizations
    and individuals making and/or receiving telephone calls. This eliminates trust
    gaps that malicious parties exploit. Like related technolgies such as SHAKEN,
    RCD, and BCID, VVP can bind cryptographic evidence to a SIP INVITE, and verify
    this evidence downstream. VVP can also let evidence flow the other way, proving
    things about the callee. VVP builds from different technical and governance assumptions
    than alternatives, and uses stronger, richer evidence. This allows VVP to cross
    jurisdictional boundaries easily and robustly. It also makes VVP simpler, more
    decentralized, cheaper to deploy and maintain, more private, more scalable, and
    higher assurance. Because it is easier to adopt, VVP can plug gaps or build bridges
    between other approaches, functioning as glue in hybrid ecosystems. For example,
    it may justify an A attestation in SHAKEN, or an RCD passport for branded calling,
    when a call originates outside SHAKEN or RCD ecosystems. VVP also works well as
    a standalone mechanism, independent of other solutions. An extra benefit is that
    VVP enables two-way evidence sharing with verifiable text and chat (e.g., RCS
    and vCon), as well as with other industry verticals that need verifiability in
    non-telco contexts.</p>"
