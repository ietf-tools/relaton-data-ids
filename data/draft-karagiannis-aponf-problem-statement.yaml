abstract:
- content: "<p>As more and more modern network management applications grow in scale
    and complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting communication
    network will increase. In particular, today network operators are challenged to
    create an abstract view of their network infrastructure and help service developers
    on using and programming this abstraction rather than manipulating individual
    devices. In this context, network management applications can be used to provide
    the required configuration and application programming interfaces to such service
    developers. The main goal of APONF is to (1) communicate the up to date abstract
    view of the network between the network management application systems and network
    management and controlling systems and (2) map the abstract view of the network
    into specific network management policies, i.e., device level configuration models.</p>"
