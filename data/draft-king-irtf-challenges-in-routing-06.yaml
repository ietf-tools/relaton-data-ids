abstract:
- content: <p>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an interface
    on a network device. Routing protocols were developed based on the assumption
    that a destination address had this semantic. Over time, routing decisions were
    enhanced to route packets according to additional information carried within the
    packets and dependent on policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers.
    Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing additional
    information into existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses, or by adding
    fields to the packets. The intent is to facilitate routing decisions based on
    these additional semantics in order to provide differentiated paths for different
    packet flows distinct from shortest path first or path vector routing. We call
    this approach "Semantic Routing". This document describes the challenges to the
    existing routing system that are introduced by Semantic Routing. It then summarizes
    the opportunities for research into new or modified routing protocols to make
    use of additional semantics. This document is presented as a study to support
    further research into clarifying and understanding the issues. It does not pass
    comment on the advisability or practicality of any of the proposals and does not
    define any technical solutions.</p>
