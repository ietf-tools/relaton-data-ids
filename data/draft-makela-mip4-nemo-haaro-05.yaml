abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Home Agent assisted Route Optimization functionality
    to IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol. The function is designed to facilitate optimal
    routing in cases where all nodes are connected to a single Home Agent, thus the
    use case is Route Optimization within single organization or similar entity. The
    functionality adds possibility to discover eligible peer nodes based on information
    received from Home Agent, Network Prefixes they represent, and how to establish
    direct tunnel between such nodes.</p>"
