abstract:
- content: "<p>DMARC allows for domain holders to request aggregate reports from receivers.
    This report is an XML document, and contains extensible elements that allow for
    other types of data to be specified later. The aggregate reports can be submitted
    to the domain holder's specified destination as supported by the receiver. This
    document (along with others) obsoletes RFC7489.</p>"
