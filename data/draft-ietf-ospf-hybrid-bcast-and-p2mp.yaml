abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network as
    a hybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes of OSPF operation.
    Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as Link State Advertisement (LSA) database
    synchronization are performed using the broadcast model, but the network is represented
    using the point-to-multipoint model in the router-LSAs of the routers connected
    to it. This allows an accurate representation of the cost of communication between
    different routers on the network, while maintaining the network efficiency of
    broadcast operation. This approach is relatively simple and requires minimal changes
    to OSPF. This document updates both OSPFv2 (RFC 2328) and OSPFv3 (RFC 5340). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
