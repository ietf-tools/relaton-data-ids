abstract:
- content: "<p>CoAP unicast and group communication for low-power and lossy networks
    (LLNs) are foreseen to be used for building and lighting control systems. Although
    unicast CoAP communication mandates DTLS for security, no similar existing security
    mechanisms exist to secure CoAP group communication. The draft, DTLS multicast
    security [I-D.keoh-dice-multicast-security], proposes a solution based on reusing
    the DTLS record layer to also secure CoAP group communication. Although that solution
    has advantages in terms of code reuse, it does not ensure source authentication
    within the group. This draft presents alternative CoAP group communication security
    solutions based on public key cryptographic signatures to also ensure source authentication
    within the group.</p>"
