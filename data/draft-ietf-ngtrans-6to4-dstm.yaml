abstract:
- content: "<p>It is desirable that most of IPv6 deployment is based on Dual Stack
    IPv4 and IPv6 nodes so that interoperability with the current IPv4 based Internet
    be seamless. The 6to4 transition mechanism offers a automated mechanisms for addressing
    an IPv6 site as well as interconnectivity with other IPv6 sites when no native
    IPv6 connectivity is available.[DSTM] provides a mechanism for dynamic IPv4 address
    allocation to Dual Stack nodes and a mechanism to send packets over a network
    that only supports IPv6 routing. By combining the two mechanisms we show how Dual
    Stack Intranets may be deployed with minimum need for IPv4 address space and no
    native IPv6 connectivity.</p>"
