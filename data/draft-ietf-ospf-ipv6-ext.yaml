abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the extensions to OSPF [1] to support IPv6.
    The fundamental mechanism of the protocol (flooding, DR election, area support,
    SPF calculations, etc.) and OSPF's options (on-demand circuits support, NSSA areas,
    multicast extensions, point-to-multipoint, etc.) remain the same. We give a functional
    overview followed by a description of the packet formats which have been extended
    to support IPv6 addressing. Link-state advertisements are introduced to support
    IPv6 addressing; these advertisements are the counterparts of the advertisements
    in the current version of OSPF.</p>"
