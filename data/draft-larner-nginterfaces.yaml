abstract:
- content: "<p>Part of the charter of the Protocol Design Group of the HTTP-NG project
    is to identify a set of formal interfaces that will allow the current functionality
    of the Web to be captured, as well as support future needs. Before delving into
    the specific interfaces, the kinds of concepts involved need to be described.
    The actual interface descriptions here are cast in terms of distributed object
    systems, the merits of which as a foundation for the Web have been discussed in
    'Migrating the Web toward Distributed Objects' (ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/webilu.html)
    and elsewhere. The intent is not to imply that what is presented here is complete
    or final, but rather to provide a starting point for how the Web should look in
    the future.</p>"
