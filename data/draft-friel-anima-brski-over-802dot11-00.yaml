abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the challenges associated with implementing
    Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures over IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.1x
    networks. Multiple options are presented for discovering and authenticating to
    the correct IEEE 802.11 SSID. This draft is a discussion document and no final
    recommendations are made on the recommended approaches to take. However, the advantages
    and downsides of each possible method are evaluated.</p>"
