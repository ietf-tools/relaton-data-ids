abstract:
- content: "<p>By and large, a correct operation of a RPL network requires border
    routers to be up. In many applications, it is beneficial for the nodes to detect
    a crash of a border router as soon as possible to trigger fallback actions. This
    document describes RNFD, an extension to RPL that expedites border router failure
    detection, even by an order of magnitude, by having nodes collaboratively monitor
    the status of a given border router. The extension introduces an additional state
    at each node, a new type of RPL Control Message Options for synchronizing this
    state among different nodes, and the coordination algorithm itself.</p>"
