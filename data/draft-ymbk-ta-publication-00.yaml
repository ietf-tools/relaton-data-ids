abstract:
- content: <p>Many Internet protocols and services rely on credentials which use asymmetric
    keys. Many of these are hierarchic structures having certification authorities
    (CAs) that act as trust anchors (TAs). There is little general guidance on procedures
    for how these trust anchors can be distributed or otherwise published with prudence.
    To quote a well known security expert, "It's a matter of oral tradition in security
    circles." This document attempts to capture some of that lore.</p>
