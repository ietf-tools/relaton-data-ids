abstract:
- content: "<p>This memorandum discusses the requirements for telephony signaling
    and device control over the Internet from the perspective of meeting the needs
    of Internet service providers (ISPs) and telecom carriers wishing to provide Internet
    services that include telephony. The requirements apply equally to various Internet
    telephony and non-Internet telephony devices. For the purpose of this Internet
    draft, the notion of telephony is broadened to include control of other types
    of streaming media sessions, such as RTSP based media server device control. Rather
    than severely restricting the device control framework to a particular set of
    devices, such as IP telephony gateways and telephony network access servers, this
    Internet draft presents requirements that are broad enough to satisfy the needs
    of any device that is expected to provide telephony and related services on the
    Internet.</p>"
