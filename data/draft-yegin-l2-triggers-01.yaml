abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless and mobile hosts are subject to changing their point of attachment
    from one access network to another. These changes result in link-layer events
    such as link up and link down. Information on these events can be conveyed to
    interested parties in the form of link-layer triggers. Primary consumers of this
    information are the modules implementing mobility related network-layer protocols.
    When provider and consumer of this information are co-located on the same IP node,
    required communication can take place via internal mechanisms. But when they are
    separate, as in the case of networks using wired-to-wireless bridges, a transport
    mechanism is needed to convey link-layer triggers. This draft defines a UDP based
    client- server protocol for transporting link-layer triggers between two IP nodes.</p>"
