abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new feature for L2TP: it allows for a change
    of LACs during the lifetime of a PPP session without the latency of re-creating
    a new PPP session where possible. This feature is specially useful for wireless
    data services where the foreign wireless service provider (WSP) may be different
    than the user's home service provider and where a user's mobility may result in
    a change of LAC during an on-going PPP session. This proposal presents 3 different
    methods of supporting this feature. The simplest method requires only minor changes
    to both LACs and LNSs. However, it may give a larger handover latency. The other
    two methods have shorter handover latency and allow us to extend the L2TP session
    by an additional hop.</p>"
