abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
    of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by a TRILL switch
    of sets of addresses such that all of the addresses in each set designate the
    same interface (port). For example, an EUI-48 MAC (Extended Unique Identifier
    48-bit, Media Access Control) address, IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported
    as all corresponding to the same interface. Such information could be use in some
    cases to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for the Address Resolution
    Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol, or the flooding of
    unknown MAC addresses.</p>"
