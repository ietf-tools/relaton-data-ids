abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Linearized Matrix (LM). LM is an extensible
    protocol for interoperability between messaging providers, using Matrix's (matrix.org
    (https://matrix.org)) decentralized room model. LM simplifies the Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DAG) persistence of Matrix while maintaining compatibility with non-linearized
    servers within a room. It does this by using a doubly-linked list of events/messages
    per room with hub and spoke fanout. LM's extensibility enables a wide range of
    transport protocol and end-to-end encryption possibilities. This document uses
    Matrix's room access control semantics supported by Messaging Layer Security (MLS),
    transported via HTTPS and JSON. The details of which server- to-server transport
    to use and what a is put over MLS are replaceable. The threat model of LM does
    not place trust in a central owning server for each conversation. Instead, it
    defines a hub server which handles maintaining linearized room history for other
    servers in the room. This model permits transparent interconnection between LM
    servers and Matrix servers, in the same room.</p>"
