abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop
    networks with arbitrary topology, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary
    loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL
    accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)
    link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a
    hop count. Since the TRILL base protocol was approved in March 2010, active development
    of TRILL has revealed a few errata in the original RFC 6325 and some cases that
    could use clarifications or updates. RFCs 6327, RFC 6439, and RFC XXXX, provide
    clarifications with respect to Adjacency, Appointed Forwarders, and the TRILL
    ESADI protocol. This document provide other known clarifications, corrections,
    and updates to RFCs 6325, 6327, and 6439.</p>"
