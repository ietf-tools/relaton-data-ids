abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides some exemplary use cases for service function
    chaining in mobile service provider networks. The objective of this draft is not
    to cover all conceivable service chains in detail. Rather, the intention is to
    localize and explain the application domain of service chaining within mobile
    networks as far as it is required to complement the SFC problem statement and
    architecture framework of the working group. Service function chains typically
    reside in a LAN segment which links the mobile access network to the actual application
    platforms located in the carrier's datacenters or somewhere else in the Internet.
    Service function chains (SFC) ensure a fair distribution of network resources
    according to agreed service policies, enhance the performance of service delivery
    or take care of security and privacy. SFCs may also include Value Added Services
    (VAS). Commonly, SFCs are typical middle box based services. General considerations
    and specific use cases are presented in this document to demonstrate the different
    technical requirements of these goals for service function chaining in mobile
    service provider networks. The specification of service function chaining for
    mobile networks must take into account an interaction between service function
    chains and the 3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) environment.</p>"
