abstract:
- content: "<p>Ad hoc network has no built-in infra-structure for communication among
    mobile nodes and operates in a stand-alone fashion, or may be connected to the
    public Internet. The nodes in ad hoc network need to have the capability to maintain
    or share all the resources of the network in a distributed fashion. One of the
    most important resources is the set of IP addresses configured with an addressing
    scheme. When a new node joins an ad hoc network, it has to be assigned a unique
    IP address or autoconfigure its own IP address as part of its initialization.
    Since ad hoc network's topology may change unpredictably, it is important to provide
    a resilient method for providing mobile nodes with such an IP address autoconfiguration
    in distributive environments. This document specifies the requirements for IP
    address autoconfiguration in ad hoc networks which have dynamic network topology.</p>"
