abstract:
- content: "<p>When the 'out-of-band' content coding ('OOB') is used for delivering
    a number of resources from a primary server via a secondary server, the additional
    round trips for OOB responses and load on the primary server can be a significant
    nuisance. In such situations, it is useful for the primary server to be able to
    provide the client with OOB response information for several resources in one
    go anticipating future client requests. This document describes a format for providing
    the client with the information, called a resource map, and how the resource map
    could be delivered to a client.</p>"
