abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes industry practices for providing secure identities
    to workloads in container orchestration, cloud platforms, and other workload platforms.
    It explains how workloads obtain credentials for external authentication purposes,
    without managing long-lived secrets directly. It does not take into account the
    standards work in progress for the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch] and
    other protocols, such as [I-D.ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol].</p>"
