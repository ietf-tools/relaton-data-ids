abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a clarification of the structure of management information
    (SMI) for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SMIv2 is
    defined in RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2] and 1904[4]. This version is a rough first draft
    as requested by the SNMPv2 WG at the SMI Documentation BOF during the June 1996
    IETF. This memo assumes that the reader has already read RFCs 1902-4 and generally
    understands the concepts defined in these documents.</p>"
