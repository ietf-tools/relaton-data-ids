abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the scenarios for IPv6 deployment within enterprise
    networks. It defines a small set of basic enterprise scenarios and includes pertinent
    questions to allow enterprise administrators to further refine their deployment
    scenarios. Enterprise deployment requirements are discussed in terms of coexistence
    with IPv4 nodes, networks and applications, and in terms of basic network infrastructure
    requirements for IPv6 deployment. The scenarios and requirements described in
    this document will be the basis for further analysis to determine what coexistence
    techniques and mechanisms are needed for enterprise IPv6 deployment. The results
    of that analysis will be published in a separate document. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
