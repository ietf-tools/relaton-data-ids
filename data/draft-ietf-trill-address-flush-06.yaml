abstract:
- content: "<p>The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol,
    by default, learns end station addresses from observing the data plane. In particular,
    it learns local Media Access Control (MAC) addresses and the edge switch port
    of attachment from the receipt of local data frames and learns remote MAC addresses
    and the edge switch port of attachment from the decapsulation of remotely sourced
    TRILL Data packets. This document specifies a message by which a TRILL switch
    can explicitly request other TRILL switches to flush certain MAC reachability
    learned through the decapsulation of TRILL Data packets. This is a supplement
    to the TRILL automatic address forgetting (see Section 4.8.3 of RFC 6325) and
    can assist in achieving more rapid convergence in case of topology or configuration
    change.</p>"
