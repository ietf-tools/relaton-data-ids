abstract:
- content: "<p>Protocol extensions to Interial Gataway Protocols (IGPs) have been
    specified for the flooding of Traffice Engineering (TE) information of the Inter-Autonomous
    System (AS) links into the local AS (RFC 5392 and RFC 5316), in which some information
    of the inter-AS links needs to be manually configured. This document proposes
    BGP extensions for dynamic advertisement of TE information of Inter-AS links between
    adjacent ASes. Such mechanism may also be used for the distribution of Inter-AS
    TE link information to some external entities, such as Path Computation Element
    (PCE).</p>"
