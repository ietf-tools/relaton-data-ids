abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a method of adding simple geographic position or
    region information to HTTP transactions using extension headers. It allows location-based
    services on the World Wide Web, without the additional overhead of geographic
    query requests and possibly graphical input. Extension headers transmit predefined
    or detected position information to reflect a location that the requesting agent
    is interested in. This information may be used by a server to present appropriate
    position-dependent responses, such as search engine results or weather maps.</p>"
