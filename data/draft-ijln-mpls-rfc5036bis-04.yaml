abstract:
- content: "<p>The architecture for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is described
    in RFC 3031. A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two Label Switching Routers
    (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels used to forward traffic between
    and through them. This common understanding is achieved by using a set of procedures,
    called a label distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another of label
    bindings it has made. This document defines a set of such procedures called LDP
    (for Label Distribution Protocol) by which LSRs distribute labels to support MPLS
    forwarding along normally routed paths.</p>"
