abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to IKEv2 that allows an endpoint
    which has authenticated to a gateway to request a short-term credential, possession
    of which proves the authentication. This allows it to prove to a security gateway
    that it was already authenticated by another trusted security gateway, thereby
    allowing the authentication of the endpoint without user intervention. This credential
    is a certificate issued by the authenticating gateway for a short period of time,
    which can be used to authenticate the user with IKE signature based authentication.</p>"
