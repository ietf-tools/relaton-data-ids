abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Working Group is considering
    the standardization of a framework for conveying application data through the
    INFO method. However, the INFO method is just one of several techniques available
    in SIP for the transfer of application data. Others include through the SIP events
    framework and through a media session. This document provides guidelines and litmus
    tests for determining which is the right technique to use.</p>"
