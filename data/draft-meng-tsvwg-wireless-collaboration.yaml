- content: "<p>Emerging applications (e.g., extended reality, cloud gaming, and teleoperation)
    impose stringent bandwidth, latency, reliability requirements on network transport,
    so as to deliver immersive and interactive user experience. That drives recent
    discussion on application-network collaboration, especially in wireless access
    networks. To motivate participation from content and network providers, this memo
    elaborates the necessity of such collaboration while focusing on wireless access
    scenarios.</p>"
