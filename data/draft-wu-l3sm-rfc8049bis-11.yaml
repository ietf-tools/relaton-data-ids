abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used for communication
    between customers and network operators and to deliver a Layer 3 provider-provisioned
    VPN service. This document is limited to BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs
    4026, 4110, and 4364. This model is intended to be instantiated at the management
    system to deliver the overall service. It is not a configuration model to be used
    directly on network elements. This model provides an abstracted view of the Layer
    3 IP VPN service configuration components. It will be up to the management system
    to take this model as input and use specific configuration models to configure
    the different network elements to deliver the service. How the configuration of
    network elements is done is out of scope for this document. This document obsoletes
    RFC 8049; it replaces the unimplementable module in that RFC with a new module
    with the same name that is not backward compatible. The changes are a series of
    small fixes to the YANG module and some clarifications to the text.</p>"
