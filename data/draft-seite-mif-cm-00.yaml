abstract:
- content: "<p>There is currently a need to present a coherent connection management
    behaviour for different terminal platforms (e.g. mobile phones, PCs, tablets,
    etc.). This document discusses how a connection manager can use the MIF API to
    provide this coherent behaviour and enhance the end user's experience when a terminal
    is able to connect to multiple interfaces. The goal of this document is not to
    define a connection manager specification, but to focus on the interaction with
    the MIF API and suggest relevant generic messages for the interface. This document
    is for discussion and its intention is to help clarifying the utilization of the
    MIF API in a connection management context and propose some relevant considerations.</p>"
