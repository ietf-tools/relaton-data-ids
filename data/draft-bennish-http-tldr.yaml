abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an HTTP extension that allows user agents to
    verify downloaded data. It provides a standardised way for an HTTPS URL (assumed
    trustworthy) to redirect to a non-HTTPS URL and give the user agent extra information
    about the resulting output (e.g. a downloaded file.) Once that is retrieved, it
    can check whether or not the data has been modified since the trustworthy site
    checked it (e.g. altered during transit or as a result of the destination site
    having been compromised.)</p>"
