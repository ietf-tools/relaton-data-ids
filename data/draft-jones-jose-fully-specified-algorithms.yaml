abstract:
- content: <p>This specification refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers that
    fully specify the cryptographic operations to be performed, including any curve,
    key derivation function (KDF), hash functions, etc., as being "fully specified".
    Whereas, it refers to cryptographic algorithm identifiers that require additional
    information beyond the algorithm identifier to determine the cryptographic operations
    to be performed as being "polymorphic". This specification creates fully- specified
    algorithm identifiers for all registered JOSE and COSE polymorphic algorithm identifiers,
    enabling applications to use only fully-specified algorithm identifiers.</p>
