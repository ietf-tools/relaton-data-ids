abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a routing method through sending detection frames
    including address of destination node to the neighbor nodes to reduce delay of
    data transmission because of the dormant nodes will increase data transmission
    delay in low power and lossy networks(LLNs). When receives the response from the
    neighbor nodes, the sending node can select a neighboring node as the next hop
    node to sent data, which has the lower cost parameter than the cost parameter
    between the sending node and the destination node stored in the routing table
    of sending node. This routing method finds a route in real-time by broadcasting
    detection frames. As long as any neighbor node that can reach the destination
    is active, data can be sent and then the data transmission delay will be reduced.</p>"
