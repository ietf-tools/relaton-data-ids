abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents an architecture and protocol for mobile network
    computing. The protocol described herein provides session control and reliable
    delivery services to accommodate mobile client access to internetworked applications
    within a 'client-agent-server' architecture. Client middleware based on this architecture
    can operate over wireless data networking services such as RAM, ARDIS, CDPD, PCS
    data services and wireless local area networks. This client middleware can be
    implemented using any standard application programming interface to a commercial
    UDP/IP stack on Hand-held PC's (HPC), personal digital assistants (PDA's), four-line
    browsers or 'smart' phones as well as laptop and desktop computers.</p>"
