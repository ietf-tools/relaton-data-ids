abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a new set of
    headers, which can significantly reduce the network traffic used for sending pages
    containing advertising banners and other related content. We begin by describing
    the problems generated by the use of 'cache-busting' techniques today and why
    the Hit-metering scheme [RFC2227], by itself, may not be adequate. We will then
    describe a new scheme which relies on collaboration between the content providers
    and the Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>"
