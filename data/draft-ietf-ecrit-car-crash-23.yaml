abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of emergency calls placed by vehicles (automatically
    in the event of a crash or serious incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle
    occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash
    or incident. Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic Crash Notification"
    (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the case of
    manual trigger. The "Advanced" qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer
    set of data. This document also registers a MIME media type and Emergency Call
    Data Type for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred to as "crash
    data" even though there is not necessarily a crash) and an INFO package to enable
    carrying this and related data in SIP INFO requests. An external specification
    for the data format, contents, and structure is referenced in this document. This
    document reuses the technical aspects of next-generation Pan- European eCall (a
    mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by in-vehicle systems (IVSs)
    within Europe and other regions). However, this document specifies use of a different
    set of vehicle (crash) data, specifically, the Vehicle Emergency Data Set (VEDS)
    rather than the eCall Minimum Set of Data (MSD). This document is an extension
    of the IETF eCall document, with the primary differences being that this document
    makes the MSD data set optional and VEDS mandatory, and it adds attribute values
    to the metadata/control object to permit greater functionality. This document
    registers a new INFO package (identical to that registered for eCall but with
    the addition of the VEDS MIME type). This document also describes legacy (circuit-switched)
    ACN systems and their migration to next-generation emergency calling, to provide
    background information and context.</p>
