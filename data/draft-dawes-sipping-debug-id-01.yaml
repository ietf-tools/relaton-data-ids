abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their users
    will frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes. Users will similarly
    frequently change their client software and the way they use the network. In order
    to allow troubleshooting and regression testing, it is useful to provide debugging
    as part of the network fabric. This draft describes a SIP private header that
    triggers logging of SIP signalling and identifies logs at mulitiple SIP entities
    as belonging to a single end-to-end session.</p>"
