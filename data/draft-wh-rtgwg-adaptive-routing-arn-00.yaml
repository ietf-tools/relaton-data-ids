abstract:
- content: "<p>Large-scale supercomputing and AI data centers utilize multipath to
    implement load balancing and improve link reliability. Adaptive routing (AR),
    which is widely used in direct topology such as dragonfly, can dynamically adjust
    routing policies based on path congestion and failures. When congestion or failure
    occurs, in addition for the local node to apply AR, the congestion/failure information
    also needs to be sent to other nodes in a timely and accurate manner, so as to
    enforce AR in other nodes to avoid exacerbating congestion on the path. This document
    specifies Adaptive Routing Notification (ARN) for disseminating congestion detection
    and congestion elimination proactively.</p>"
