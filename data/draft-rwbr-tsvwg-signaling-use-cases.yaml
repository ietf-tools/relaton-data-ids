abstract:
- content: "<p>Host-to-network (and vice versa) signaling can improve the user experience
    by informing the network which flows are more important and which packets within
    a flow are more important without having to disclose the content of the packets
    being delivered. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g.,
    packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission or session
    migration), or through cooperation of both the host and the network. This document
    outlines a set of use-cases that highlight the need for a mechanism to share metadata
    about flows between a host and its network in order to enable different traffic
    treatment. Such a mechanism is typically implemented using a signaling protocol
    between the host and a set of trusted netwrok elements.</p>"
