abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extension to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) service, which allows an SMTP client to specify the responsible submitter
    of an e-mail message. The responsible submitter is the e-mail address of the entity
    most recently responsible for introducing a message into the transport stream.
    This extension helps receiving e-mail servers efficiently determine whether the
    SMTP client is authorized to transmit mail on behalf of the responsible submitter's
    domain.</p>"
