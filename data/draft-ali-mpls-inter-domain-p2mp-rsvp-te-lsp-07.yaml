abstract:
- content: "<p>Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may
    be established using signaling techniques described in [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875]
    does not address many issues that come when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in inter-domain
    networks. Specifically, one of the issues in inter- domain networks is how to
    allow computation of a loosely routed P2MP-TE LSP such that it is re-merge free.
    Another issue is reoptimization of a P2MP-TE tree vs. reoptimization of an individual
    destination sub-LSP, as loosely routing domain border node is not aware of the
    reoptimization scope. This document provides a framework and required protocol
    extensions needed for establishing, controlling and reoptimizing P2MP MPLS and
    GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks. This document borrows inter-domain TE
    terminology from [RFC 4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document, a domain
    is considered to be any collection of network elements within a common sphere
    of address management or path computational responsibility. Examples of such domains
    include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).</p>"
