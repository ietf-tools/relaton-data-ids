abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource provisioning
    solution for Diffserv networks. This is an updated version of the old draft (previous
    version was submitted in April 2000) describing a concept called Load Control.
    Load Control addresses the following issues: 1. Admission control for real time
    data flows in stateless domains 2. Dropping of flows in case of exceptional events,
    such as severe congestion after re-routing</p>"
