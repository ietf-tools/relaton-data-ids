abstract:
- content: "<p>As the number of commercial services on the world wide web increases
    rapidly, the need arises for a means for these services to authenticate clients,
    and vice versa. A simple scheme can be based on keyed hash functions with a shared
    secret key for each client/server pair. Key management becomes impractical for
    both clients and servers when the number of participants is scaled up. This document
    describes a efficient scheme for using mutually trusted third parties to mediate
    authentication, as a direct extension of the digest access authentication scheme.
    The scheme is based upon public domain algorithms, and unlike encryption software,
    isn't subject to export restrictions. The main benefits to users include: avoiding
    having to enter separate user names and passwords for each service, and an ability
    to authenticate servers. It is proposed that the mediated digest authentication
    scheme be included in the proposed HTTP/1.1 specification.</p>"
