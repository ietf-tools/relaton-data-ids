abstract:
- content: <p>Crediting loyalty points and collecting digital coupons or gift certificates
    are common functions in purchasing and trading transactions. These activities
    can be generalized using the concept of a "voucher", which is a digital representation
    of the right to claim goods or services. This document presents a Voucher Trading
    System (VTS) that circulates vouchers securely and its terminology; it lists design
    principles and requirements for VTS and the Generic Voucher Language (GVL), with
    which diverse types of vouchers can be described. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>
