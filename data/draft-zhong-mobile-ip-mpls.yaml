abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the efficiency and simplicity
    of IP routing together with the high-speed switching of ATM. Mobile IP is a protocol
    that allows mobile users to maintain continuous IP network connectivity. In this
    document, we describe a scheme to integrate both the Mobile IP and MPLS protocols.
    The integration of both these protocols improves the scalability of the Mobile
    IP data forwarding process by leveraging on the features of MPLS which are fast
    switching, small state maintenance and high scalability. In addition, we have
    removed the need for IP-in-IP tunneling from Home Agent (HA) to Foreign Agent
    (FA) under this scheme. This document defines the signaling and control mechanisms
    required to integrate MPLS and Mobile IP.</p>"
