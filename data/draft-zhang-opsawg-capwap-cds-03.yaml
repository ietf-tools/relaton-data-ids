abstract:
- content: "<p>CAPWAP defines a specification to encapsulate a station's data frames
    between the Wireless Transmission Point (WTP) and Access Controller (AC) using
    CAPWAP. Specifically, the station's IEEE 802.11 data frames can be either locally
    bridged or tunneled to the AC. When tunneled, a CAPWAP data channel is used for
    tunneling. In many deployments it is desirable to encapsulate date frames to an
    entity different from the AC for example to an Access Router (AR). Further, it
    may also be desirable to use different tunnel encapsulations to carry the stations'
    data frames. This document provides a specification for this and refers to it
    as Alternate tunnel encapsulation. The Alternate tunnel encapsulation allows 1)
    the WTP to tunnel non-management data frames to an endpoint different from the
    AC and 2) the WTP to tunnel using one of many known encapsulation types such as
    IP-IP, IP-GRE, CAPWAP. The WTP may advertise support for Alternate tunnel encapsulation
    during the discovery or join process and AC may select one of the supported Alternate
    Tunnel encapsulation types while configuring the WTP.</p>"
