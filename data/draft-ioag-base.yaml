abstract:
- content: "<p>The Billing and Accounting System Exchange (BASE) protocol is intended
    for use for the data transfer between the subsystems of a distributed billing
    and accounting system. It defines the communication between central billing engines
    (BEs) and one or more locally or remotely installed billing agents (BAs). BAs
    are used to supply the BEs with load data used for billing and accounting purposes.
    BEs are responsible for the process of billing and accounting as well as for the
    configuration of the BAs and their connected source systems. This document defines
    and describes the BASE protocol.</p>"
