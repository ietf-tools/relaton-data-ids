abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require efficient IP
    configuration change detection procedures than traditional fixed hosts. DNA is
    defined as the process by which a host collects appropriate information and detects
    the identity of its currently attached link to ascertain the validity of its IP
    configuration. This document details best current practice for Detecting Network
    Attachment in IPv6 hosts using existing Neighbor Discovery procedures. Since there
    is no explicit link identification mechanism in the existing Neighbor Discovery
    for IP Version 6, the document describes implicit mechanisms for identifying the
    current link.</p>"
