    and Traffic Filtering Actions by making use of the BGP NLRI and the BGP Extended
    Community encoding formats. This document specifies a new BGP-FS component type
    to support community-level filtering. The match field is the community of the
    destination IP address that is encoded in the Flowspec NLRI. This function is
    applied in a single administrative domain.</p>"
