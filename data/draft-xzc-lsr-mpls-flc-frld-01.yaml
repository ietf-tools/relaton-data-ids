abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-ID Label (FL) is used for MPLS flow identification and flow- based
    performance measurement with alternate marking method. The ability to process
    Flow-ID labels is called Flow-ID Label Capability (FLC), and the capability of
    reading the maximum label stack depth and performing FL-based performance measurement
    is called Flow-ID Readable Label Depth (FRLD). This document defines a mechanism
    to signal the FLC and the FRLD using IGP and BGP-LS.</p>"
