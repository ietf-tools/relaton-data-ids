abstract:
- content: "<p>NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range
    of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a storage networking
    fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. For IP-based network,
    RDMA or TCP technology can be used to transport NVMe commands. When a network
    fault occurs, NVMe connections need to be switched over. Currently, no effective
    method is available for quick detection, switchover is performed only based on
    KA timeout, resulting in low performance. This document defines the basic framework
    of how network-assisted hosts and storage devices can quickly detect NVMe connection
    failures caused by network faults for NVMe IP-based SANs.</p>"
