abstract:
- content: "<p>With the extensions defined in this document Host Identity Protocol
    (HIP) can traverse legacy Network Address Translators (NATs) and certain firewalls.
    The extension will be useful as part of the base exchange and with the HIP Registration
    Extension. By using a rendezvous server an additional entity inside the network
    is utilized, which not only allows but also supports more restrictive NATs to
    be traversed.</p>"
