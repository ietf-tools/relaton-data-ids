- content: "<p>This draft describes a possible optimization to Duplicate Address Detection
    (DAD) which can be used to successfully terminate DAD early. The method is based
    on a positive RA message sent by an Neighbor Discovery Relay Agent that knows
    all the IPv6 addresses of the nodes currently attached to it.</p>"
