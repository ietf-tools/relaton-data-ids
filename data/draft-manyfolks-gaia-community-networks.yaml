abstract:
- content: '<p>This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network deployments",
    and a set of definitions and shared characteristics. This term includes a set
    of network access models emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet
    connectivity to people, using topological, architectural and business models different
    from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the network infrastructure
    for connecting the users, who pay for it. Several initiatives throughout the world
    have built large scale networks that are alternative to the traditional network
    operator deployments using predominately wireless technologies (including long
    distance) due to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum. Wired technologies
    such as Fiber are also used in some of these alternate networks. There are several
    types of such alternate network: networks such as community networks are self-organized
    and decentralized networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned by individuals
    who act as wireless internet service providers (WISPs), networks owned by individuals
    but leased out to network operators who use such networks as a low-cost medium
    to reach the underserved population and finally there are networks that provide
    connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users. The emergence of these
    networks can be motivated by different causes such as the reluctance, or the impossibility,
    of network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote
    areas. In these cases, the networks have self sustainable business models that
    provide more localised communication services as well as Internet backhaul support
    through peering agreements with traditional network operators. Some other times,
    networks are built as a complement and an alternative to commercial Internet access
    provided by "traditional" network operators. The present classification considers
    different existing network models such as Community Networks, open wireless services,
    user- extensible services, traditional local Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
    new global ISPs, etc. Different criteria are used in order to build a classification
    as e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the
    participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company
    or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc. According to the developed taxonomy,
    a characterization of each kind of network is presented, in terms of specific
    network characteristics related to architecture, organization, etc.</p>'
