abstract:
- content: "<p>Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly important
    functionalities that need to be provided in the Internet. This document motivates
    and describes a framework for the path- coupled configuration of Metering Entities
    to record monitoring and measurement data and report it to a data collector. Different
    scenarios are described where such a path-coupled configuration is useful. Currently,
    the focus is on two scenarios: accounting and QoS measurement. Moreover, this
    document gathers requirements for a path-coupled configuration protocol of Metering
    Entities. Finally, the applicability of the NSIS architecture for this purpose
    is discussed. The protocol itself is specified in a separate document [I-D.dressler-nsis-metering-nslp]</p>"
