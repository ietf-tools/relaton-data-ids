abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes a mechanism called "guaranteed Latency Based Forwarding"
    (gLBF) as part of DetNet for hop-by-hop packet forwarding with per-hop deterministically
    bounded latency and minimal jitter. gLBF is intended to be useful across a wide
    range of networks and applications with need for high-precision deterministic
    networking services, including in-car networks or networks used for industrial
    automation across on factory floors, all the way to ++100Gbps country-wide networks.
    Contrary to other mechanisms, gLBF does not require network wide clock synchronization,
    nor does it need to maintain per-flow state at network nodes, avoiding drawbacks
    of other known methods while leveraging their advantages. Specifically, gLBF uses
    the queuing model and calculus of Urgency Based Scheduling (UBS, [UBS]), which
    is used by TSN Asynchronous Traffic Shaping [TSN-ATS]. gLBF is intended to be
    a plug-in replacement for TSN-ATN or as a parallel mechanism beside TSN-ATS because
    it allows to keeping the same controller-plane design which is selecting paths
    for TSN-ATS, sizing TSN-ATS queues, calculating latencies and admitting flows
    to calculated paths for calculated latencies. In addition to reducing the jitter
    compared to TSN-ATS by additional buffering (dampening) in the network, gLBF also
    eliminates the need for per-flow, per-hop state maintenance required by TSN-ATS.
    This avoids the need to signal per-flow state to every hop from the controller-plane
    and associated scaling problems. It also reduces implementation cost for high-speed
    networking hardware due to the avoidance of additional high-speed speed read/write
    memory access to retrieve, process and update per-flow state variables for a large
    number of flows.</p>
