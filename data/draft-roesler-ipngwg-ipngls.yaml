abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the forwarding of IPv6 packets using label switching
    techniques, with the same advantages of the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    architecture. The document proposes the mapping of all MPLS header fields into
    the IPv6 header, raising several advantages like the simplicity of the model,
    the decrease of overhead, and others. This mapping was called IP Next Generation
    Label Switching, or just IPngLS, and can work concurrently with MPLS, i.e. IPv6
    packets are forwarded with IPngLS and IPv4 packets are forwarded with MPLS.</p>"
