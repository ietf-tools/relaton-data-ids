- content: "<p>The multiple Destination option on IPv6(MDO6) is an elastic multicast
    delivery system. MDO6 uses a list of final unicast addresses of each destination
    node that is embedded into an optional routing header, as the destination of a

    routing table. MDO6 has several advantages as follows.</p>"
