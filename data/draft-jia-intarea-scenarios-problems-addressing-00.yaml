abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success
    in information technology of the last half century. As Internet become pervasive,
    IP start replacing communication technology for domain-specific solutions. However,
    domains with specific requirements as well as communication behaviors and semantics
    still exists and represent what [RFC8799] recognizes as "limited domains". When
    communicating within limited domains, the address semantic and format may differ
    with respect to the IP address one. As such, there is a need to adapt the domain-specific
    addressing to the Internet addressing paradigm. In certain scenarios, such adaptation
    may raise challenges. This document describes well-recognized scenarios that showcase
    possibly different addressing requirements which are challenging to be accommodated
    in the IP addressing model. These scenarios highlight issues related to the Internet
    addressing model and call for starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve
    the addressing model so to better accommodate different domain-specific requirements.</p>
