abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new authenticated encryption mode of operation
    of block ciphers called 'Integrity Aware Parallelizable Mode (IAPM)' which is
    simple, efficient, highly parallelizable, and provably secure. One of the main
    features distinguishing the new mode (IAPM) from existing modes is that along
    with providing confidentiality of the payload, the new mode also pro- vides authenticity
    of the payload. This is particularly relevant to the ESP security protocol of
    IPsec.</p>"
