abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64 prefix
    [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but declares
    it to be a non-special name in that specification's Domain Name Reservation Considerations
    section. Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the name,
    'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain Names registry as a
    name with special properties. As a result of this omission, in cases where software
    needs to give this name special treatment in order for it to work correctly, there
    was no clear mandate authorizing software authors to implement that special treatment.
    Software implementers were left with the choice between not implementing the special
    behavior necessary for the name queries to work correctly, or implementing the
    special behavior and being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC. This document
    formally declares the actual special properties of the name, and adds similar
    declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping names.</p>"
