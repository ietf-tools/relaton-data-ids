abstract:
- content: "<p>Typically applications developers have requested static IANA assignments
    for their applications, even if the applications would typically be only used
    within a site, between consenting sites, or would not eventually even use multicast
    at all. This memo describes this problem space, and summarizes a number of proposed
    approaches to mitigating these problems.</p>"
