abstract:
- content: "<p>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of
    the DSField in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet header to carry the Diffserv Codepoint
    (DSCP). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of
    assigned DSCP values. This update to RFC2474 requests a change to the IANA assignment
    method for Pool 3 of the registry to change this to Standards Action assignment.
    The update also removes permission for Local Use of the codepoints that form Pool
    3 of the DSCP registry.</p>"
