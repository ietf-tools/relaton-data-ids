abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an inter-domain SAVNET architecture that serves
    as a comprehensive framework for the development of inter- domain source address
    validation (SAV) mechanisms. The proposed architecture empowers AS to generate
    SAV rules by leveraging SAV- specific Information communicated between ASes, and
    during the incremental/partial deployment of the SAV-specific Information, it
    can leverage the general information such as the routing information from the
    RIB to generate the SAV table when the SAV-specific Information for an AS's prefixes
    are not available. Instead of delving into protocol extensions or implementations,
    this document primarily focuses on proposing the SAV-specific Information and
    general information for deploying an inter-domain SAV mechanism, and defining
    the architectural components and interconnections between them for generating
    the SAV table.</p>"
