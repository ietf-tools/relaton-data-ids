abstract:
- content: "<p>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses
    the global routing system in a number of ways. One of the most costly stresses
    is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware simply because the FIB has
    run out of space, and router vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB.
    FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected
    RIB entries into the FIB. Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA) is a simple form of
    Virtual Aggregation (VA) that allows any and all edge routers to shrink their
    RIB and FIB requirements substantially and therefore increase their useful lifetime.
    S-VA does not increase FIB requirements for core routers. S-VA is extremely easy
    to configure considerably more so than the various tricks done today to extend
    the life of edge routers. S-VA can be deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation
    between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</p>"
