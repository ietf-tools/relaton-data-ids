abstract:
- content: "<p>When a local LAN running spanning tree protocol connecting to TRILL
    campus via more than one RBridge, there are several ways to perform loop avoidance.
    One of them illustrated by RFC6325 [RFC6325] A.3 was to make relevant ports on
    edge RBridges involving in spanning tree calculation. When edge RBridges are emulated
    as a single highest priority root, the local bridged LAN will be naturally partitioned
    after running spanning tree protocol. This approach achieves better link utilization
    and intra-VLAN load balancing in some scenarios. This document describes how the
    edge RBridges react to topology change occurring in bridged LAN in order to make
    the abovementioned spanning tree approach function correct.</p>"
