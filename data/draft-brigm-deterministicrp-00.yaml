abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Deterministic Rendezvous Point (D-RP) mechanism
    for Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Sparse Mode (SM) networks. It intends
    to provide a simple and robust RP service. The mechanism is deterministic since
    it elects the highest priority candidate to be the D-RP from those available for
    each IP address family. If a D-RP fails, the election process begins again using
    the remaining C-RPs for the IP address family. If no candidates are availabe,
    the network will transition to PIM Dense Mode (DM) routing for that IP address
    family. In the future if C-RPs emerge for the address family, the network will
    elect a new D-RP and return to operations with PIM SM routing.</p>"
