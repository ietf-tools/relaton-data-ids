abstract:
- content: "<p>In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary to
    define and accommodate requirements for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
    Since the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) working group is
    already focused on defining these requirements, this document attempts to leverage
    that work. It contains the requirements that would have to be supported by a AAA
    service to formulate a solution for CDN peering.</p>"
