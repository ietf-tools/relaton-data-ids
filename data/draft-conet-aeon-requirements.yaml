abstract:
- content: "<p>Identification and treatment of application flows are important to
    many application providers and network operators. Historically, this functionality
    has been implemented to the extent possible using heuristics, which inspect and
    infer flow characteristics. But many application flows in current usages are dynamic,
    adaptive, time- bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, asymmetric, used on multipurpose
    devices, and have different priorities depending on direction of flow, user preferences,
    and other factors. Any combination of these properties renders heuristic based
    techniques less effective and may result in compromises to application security
    or user privacy. The document states requirements for a solution that enables
    identification and treatment of application flows without suffering the limitations
    that plague existing solutions.</p>"
