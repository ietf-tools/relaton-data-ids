abstract:
- content: "<p>The completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the Regional
    Internet Registries (RIRs) is causing service providers around the world to question
    how they will continue providing IPv4 connectivity service to their subscribers
    when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per subscriber.
    Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging based around the idea
    of shared IPv4 addressing. These solutions give rise to a number of issues, and
    this memo identifies those common to all such address sharing approaches. Such
    issues include application failures, additional service monitoring complexity,
    new security vulnerabilities, and so on. Solution-specific discussions are out
    of scope. Deploying IPv6 is the only perennial way to ease pressure on the public
    IPv4 address pool without the need for address sharing mechanisms that give rise
    to the issues identified herein. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
