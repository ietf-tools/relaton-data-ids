abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, there are network management applications that present specific
    demands on a communication network. This document describes the APONF basic architecture,
    its elements and interfaces. The main APONF architecture entities are the Network
    Management Application Agent (NMAA), which is a network entity that creates and
    runs network services, and Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD), which supports
    classified application models. Each of these models support application demands
    that are similar in nature and therefore can be grouped/classified together. Moreover,
    the ABPD maps the classified application models into network capabilities, e.g.,
    network management and controlling policies.</p>"
