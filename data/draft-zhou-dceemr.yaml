abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we discuss the delay-constrained energy efficient multicast
    routing problem in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. A cognitive radio ad hoc network
    is a wireless multi-hop network established by secondary users on varying available
    spectrum bands. The routing research is a hotspot in the field of cognitive radio
    ad hoc networks. However, multicast routing algorithm study of cognitive radio
    ad hoc networks is still in starting stage. In this paper, we proposed a novel
    delay-constrained energy efficient multicast routing algorithm (DCEEMR) in cognitive
    radio ad hoc networks. The DCEEMR guarantees that the multicast tree can be found
    if it exists, and the multicast tree satisfies the delay bound and has low energy
    consuming. The algorithm uses delay-energy function to construct the multicast
    tree based on the spectrum selection. Through an example with randomly network
    topology, we demonstrate that our algorithm is better in terms of energy cost
    of multicast tree as compared to the existing algorithm QoS Dependent Multicast
    Routing (QDMR). Moreover, the algorithm does not suffer from high complexity common
    to the algorithm QDMR. Experiment results by NS-2 show that the delay and tree
    cost are lower than well-known Multicast ad- hoc On-demand Distance Vector (MAODV)
    protocol.</p>"
