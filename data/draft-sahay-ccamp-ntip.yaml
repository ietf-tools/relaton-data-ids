abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the transport network interface protocol (NTIP)
    for photonic cross connects (PXC). NTIP is implemented between a PXC and transport
    network element (TNEs), also known as line systems. NTIP is a protocol that uses
    TCP/IP for the transport of information related to defect notification, trace
    monitoring, adjacency discovery, and diagnostic messages between directly attached
    PXC and TNE. The use of TCP as the transport protocol ensures reliable and in-sequence
    delivery of NTIP messages.</p>"
