abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol has been
    standardized in RFC7285 to ease better-than-random overlay connection management.
    However, through the base protocol it is not possible to differenciate paths from
    a given source to a given destination and provide an ALTO client with a detailed
    information of sending traffic through these paths. This document describes an
    extension to the ALTO protocol allowing for representation of paths in the network
    maps, cost maps, and endpoint cost calculation. Morever, this document defines
    a new path computation service.</p>"
