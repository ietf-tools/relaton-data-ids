- content: "<p>Existing token types in privacy pass conflate attribution with rate
    limiting. This document describes a token type where the issuer attests to a set
    of properties of the client, which the client can then selectively prove to the
    origin. Repeated showings of the same credential are unlinkable, unlike other
    token types in privacy pass.</p>"
