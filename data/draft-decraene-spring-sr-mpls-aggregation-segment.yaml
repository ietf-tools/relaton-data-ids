abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the key features of IP that has helped IP Routing to scale is
    aggregation of IP prefixes. This is made possible with longest-match lookup in
    IP forwarding. Contrary to this, MPLS forwarding works on exact match on MPLS
    labels. This poses a challenge in aggregation of IP prefixes when the forwarding
    is based on the MPLS labels associated with those IP prefixes. This document introduces
    an Aggregation Segment for Segment Routing with MPLS data plane which can be used
    to aggregate IP prefixes along with their SR Prefix Segments. Aggregation Segments
    enable aggregation of IP prefixes to be performed at border routers to improve
    scalability of MPLS networks.</p>"
