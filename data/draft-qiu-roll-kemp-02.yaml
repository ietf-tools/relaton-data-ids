abstract:
- content: "<p>When a sensor node roams within a very large and distributed wireless
    sensor network, which consists of numerous sensor nodes, its routing path and
    neighborhood keep changing. In order to provide a high level of security in this
    environment, the moving sensor node needs to be authenticated to new neighboring
    nodes as well as to establish a key for secure communication. The document proposes
    an efficient and scalable protocol to establish and update the secure key in a
    dynamic wireless sensor network environment. The protocol guarantees that two
    sensor nodes share at least one key with probability 1 (100%) with less memory
    and energy cost, while not causing considerable communication overhead.</p>"
