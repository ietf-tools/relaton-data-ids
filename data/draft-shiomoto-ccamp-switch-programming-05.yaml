abstract:
- content: <p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) has been extended to support
    Traffic Engineering (TE) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) networks. The protocol enables signaling exchanges to establish Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) that traverse nodes and link to provide end-to-end data
    paths. Each node is programmed with "cross-connect" information as the signaling
    messages are processed. The cross-connection information instructs the node how
    to forward data that it receives. End points of an LSP need to know when it is
    safe to start sending data so that it is not misdelivered, and so that safety
    issues specific to optical data-plane technology are satisfied. Likewise, all
    label switching routers along the path of the LSP need to know when to program
    their data planes relative to sending and receiving control-plane messages. This
    document clarifies and summarizes the RSVP-TE protocol exchanges with relation
    to the programming of cross-connects along an LSP for both unidirectional and
    bidirectional LSPs. This document does not define any new procedures or protocol
    extensions, and defers completely to the documents that provide normative references.
    The clarifications set out in this document may also be used to help interpret
    LSP establishment performance figures for MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>
