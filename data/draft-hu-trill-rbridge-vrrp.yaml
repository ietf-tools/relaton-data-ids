abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL can be implemented in data center networks, which requires high
    reliability and stability. Whenever the egress RBridges or links break down, the
    TRILL rerouting time depends on the IS-IS topology convergence time, which may
    do not meet data center service requirements in terms of resiliency. VRRP provides
    a redundancy mechanism to avoid single point of failure and fast switching over.
    This draft proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL in data center networks.</p>"
