abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a TCP option for use by middleboxes to facilitate
    transparent detection of other middleboxes along the path of the TCP connection
    during the connection initiation phase. The option has no effect if an appropriate
    middlebox is not present on the path. The TCP end hosts are unaware of this option
    and its usage is strictly for use by TCP middleboxes. Multiple vendors of WAN
    optimization products have used similar (but incompatible and proprietary) mechanisms
    since at least 2004. Those existing vendor systems use multiple TCP option code
    points, all of which are officially unassigned by IANA. The goal of this memo
    is to standardize a single TCP option code point for this functionality. This
    memo is the product of discussion among some of the vendors currently using incompatible
    proprietary TCP options for middlebox discovery. It is a non-goal of this memo
    to achieve interoperability of middlebox discovery between multiple vendors. It
    needs to be noted that an earlier document [I-D.knutsen-tcpm-middlebox-discovery],
    is re-written as the current document after agreement from multiple vendors.</p>"
