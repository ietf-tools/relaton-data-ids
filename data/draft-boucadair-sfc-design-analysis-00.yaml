abstract:
- content: "<p>The objectives of this document are to analyze the various design options,
    and provide a set of recommendations to be followed during the design phase of
    the Service Function Chaining solution(s). Note: o The analysis does not claim
    to be exhaustive. The list includes a preliminary set of potential solutions;
    other proposals can be added to the analysis if required. o The analysis is still
    ongoing. The analysis text will be updated to integrate received comments and
    inputs. o Sketched recommendations are not frozen. These recommendations are provided
    as proposals to kick-off the discussion and to challenge them. o The analysis
    does not cover any application-specific solution (e.g., HTTP header) because of
    the potential issues inherent to (TLS) encrypted traffic. o The analysis will
    be updated to take into account the full set of SFC requirements.</p>"
