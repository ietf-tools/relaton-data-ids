abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub networks
    to adjacent infrastructure networks. This is applicable in cases such as constrained
    (Internet of Things) networks where there is a need to provide functional parity
    of service discovery and reachability between devices on the stub network and
    devices on an adjacent infrastructure link (for example, a home network).</p>"
