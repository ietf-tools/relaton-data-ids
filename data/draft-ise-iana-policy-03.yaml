abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries
    to track code points used by protocols such as those defined by the IETF and documented
    in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream. The Independent Submission Stream is another
    source of documents that can be published as RFCs. This stream is under the care
    of the Independent Submissions Editor (ISE). This document complements RFC 4846
    by providing a description of how the ISE currently handles documents in the Independent
    Submission Stream that request actions from IANA. Nothing in this document changes
    existing IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor does it change any
    previously documented processes.</p>"
