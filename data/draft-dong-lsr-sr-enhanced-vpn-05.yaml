abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support
    some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual
    underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network
    resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used to support
    one or a group of VPN+ services. This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with
    necessary extensions to build a set of Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs. Each VTN
    can have a customized topology and a set of network resources allocated. Multiple
    VTNs may shared the same topology, and multiple VTNs may share the same set of
    network resources on some network segments. This allows flexible combination of
    network topology and network resource attributes to build a relatively large number
    of VTNs with a small number of logical topologies. The proposed mechanism is applicable
    to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with
    IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
