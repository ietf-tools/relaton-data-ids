abstract:
- content: "<p>IS-IS is a widely deployed link-state protocol in routing networks.
    During the past decades, it has been operated and maintained through typical CLI,
    SNMP and NETCONF. With the expansion and complication of modern networks, the
    necessity for rapid and dynamic control has been increased. The I2RS is a standard-based
    interface which provides a programmatic way to achieve this goal. This document
    specifies a data model for the I2RS's interface to the IS-IS protocol based the
    I2RS IS-IS informational model (draft-ietf- wu-info-model-00). These two models
    satisfy the requirements suggested by the I2RS use case requirements for the IGPs.
    This yang data model can be used by I2RS client-agent protocol to program IS-IS
    routing entities.</p>"
