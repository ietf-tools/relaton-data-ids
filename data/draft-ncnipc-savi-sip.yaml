abstract:
- content: "<p>The session initiation protocol(SIP) which designed by IETF is also
    being considered as the core protocol for multimedia communication. This document
    describes a source address validation Improvement(SAVI) solution for SIP protocol
    or other security mechanisms. The SAVI was developed to prevent IP source address
    spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic redirection. The
    SAVI can be used in both IPV4/V6 networks. In the work we presented here, we describe
    the advantages of using SAVI in SIP and the approaches for using SIP in networks,
    whether in the registrar, redirect, and any procedures of the SIP protocol.This
    document describes different deployment scenarios, with solutions for when the
    nodes in the network using the SIP to contact each other.</p>"
