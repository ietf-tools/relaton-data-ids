abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for
    CCN. Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or multicast to multiple
    listening points. Notifications do not expect a Content Object response hence
    only requires the use of FIB state in the CCN forwarder. Emulating Notification
    as a PULL has performance and forwarding implications. The draft proposes a new
    fixed header primitive called Notification and a CCN message encoding using Content
    Object primitive to transport Notifications. These discussions are presented in
    the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal.</p>"
