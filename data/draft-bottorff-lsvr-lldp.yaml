abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE Std 802.1AB, known as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP),
    can be applied to LSVR neighbor discovery and configuration. This can be achieved
    by using a nearest router group address as the LLDP Scope MAC Address to target
    LSVR interfaces while advertising a set of LSVR-specific LLDP TLVs. These LSVR-specific
    TLVs are defined using LLDP Organizationally Specific TLVs, as specified by LLDP
    for use by individual organizations to allow them to define their own Type-Length-Value
    (TLV) objects for exchange over the LLDP protocol. The IETF Organizationally Specific
    TLVs for LSVR can be encoded using the IETF IANA OUI (RFC 7042). This document
    provides an overview of applying LLDP to LSVR neighbor discovery and configuration
    and specifies the IETF Organizationally Specific TLVs that support link discovery
    for LSVR routers. In addition, a brief discussion of the use of IEEE Connectivity
    Fault Management (CFM) as specified in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022 cl 18-22 for link
    liveliness is included.</p>"
