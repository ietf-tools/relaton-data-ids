abstract:
- content: "<p>YANG lacks re-usability of models defined outside of the grouping and
    augmentation mechanisms. For instance, it is almost impossible to reuse a model
    defined for a device in the context of the network, i.e by encapsulating it in
    a list indexed by device IDs. [RFC8528] defines the YANG mount mechanism, partially
    solving the problem by allowing to mount an arbitrary set of schemas at an arbitrary
    point. However, YANG mount is only focusing on deploy or runtime. This document
    aims to provide the same mechanism at design time.</p>"
