abstract:
- content: "<p>The cross stratum optimization approach aims for providing a jointly
    optimized provision of both IT and network resources according to the application
    demands. In order to do that, the path computation capabilities in the network,
    which are in charge of finding the optimal connectivity resources, should take
    into account a new set of requirements. This memo explores the new needs derived
    from the cross stratum optimization approach.</p>"
