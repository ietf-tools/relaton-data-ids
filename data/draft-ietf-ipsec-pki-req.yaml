abstract:
- content: "<p>The IKE protocol allows the use of the PKIX profile of X.509v3 certificates
    for encryption and authentication. Common practice in the IPsec community differs
    in some ways from these specifications made in the PKIX format specification and
    other specifications that have come from the PKIX WG. In order to promote interoperability
    in the IPsec market, this document lays out a profile for using PKIX in IKE.</p>"
