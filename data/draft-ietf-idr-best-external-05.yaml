abstract:
- content: "<p>The current BGP-4 protocol specification [RFC4271] states that the
    selection process chooses the best path for a given route which is added to the
    Loc-Rib and advertised to all peers. Previous versions [RFC1771] of the specification
    defined a different rule for Internal BGP Updates. Given that Internal paths are
    not re- advertised to Internal peers, it was specified that the best of the external
    paths, as determined by the path selection tie breaking algorithm, would be advertised
    to Internal peers. This document extends that procedure to operate in environments
    where Route Reflection [RFC4456] or Confederations [RFC5065] are used and explains
    why advertising the additional routing information can improve convergence time
    without causing routing loops. Additional benefits include reduction of inter-domain
    churn and avoidance of permanent route oscillation.</p>"
