abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to the authentication, encryption
    and digital signature methods described for use in MIKEY, employing elliptic-curve
    cryptography (ECC). These extensions are defined to align MIKEY with other ECC
    implementations and standards. It should be noted that this document is not self-contained;
    it uses the notations and definitions of [RFC3830].</p>"
