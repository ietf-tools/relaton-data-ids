abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] provides a standard method
    for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP also
    defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP), which can be used to negotiate
    authentication methods, as well as an Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) [RFC1968],
    used to negotiate data encryption over PPP links, and a Compression Control Protocol
    (CCP) [RFC1962], used to negotiate compression methods. The Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP) [EAP] is a PPP extension that provides support for additional authentication
    methods within PPP. The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol
    [ISAKMP] combined with the Oakley [Oakley] key exchange protocol enables secure,
    mutually authenticated security association exchanges between two endpoints. This
    document describes how ISAKMP provides for these mechanisms within EAP.</p>"
