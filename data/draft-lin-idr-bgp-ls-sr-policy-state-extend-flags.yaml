abstract:
- content: "<p>[draft-ietf-idr-bgp-ls-sr-policy]The SR Candidate Path State TLV conveys
    the operational status and attributes of an SR Policy at the candidate path level.
    The SR Candidate Path State is frequently extended to carry new attributes and
    states for CPaths. However, only a few bits remain unassigned in the Flags field
    of the current implementation. This document addresses the issue of insufficient
    flag bits in the SR Candidate Path State TLV by defining a variable-length SR
    Candidate Path State Extend TLV for BGP-LS SR-Policy. This enhancement ensures
    scalability and flexibility in signaling additional attributes and states for
    SR Policy candidate paths.</p>"
