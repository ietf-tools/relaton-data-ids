abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the IP Flow Information Export
    (IPFIX) protocol for the case of exporting and processing per-packet information.
    The main idea is to export two types of records per flow: the first one contains
    the usual flow information plus a unique flow identifier while the other one consists
    of the actual per-packet information plus a flow identifier that refers to the
    flow the specific packet belongs to -- that means the flow identifier is used
    to associate the packet data to its corresponding flow.</p>"
