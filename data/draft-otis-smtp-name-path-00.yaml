abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a safe means to register delivery paths used
    by a domain's messages. Message handling might be negatively affected without
    an apparent relationship between the sending system and the various email related
    source domains contain within either the message envelope or the message itself.
    Name based associations can be achieved within a single DNS transaction. The alternative
    has been to assemble a list of IP addresses for all systems employed to send messages
    for a domain. The IP address list approach may require hundreds of DNS transactions
    that endanger the network. The safer name based method accommodates an unlimited
    number of sending systems, without the overhead and size issues created by a list
    of IP addresses.</p>"
