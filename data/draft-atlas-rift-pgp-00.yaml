abstract:
- content: "<p>In a fat tree, it can be sometimes desirable to guide traffic to particular
    destinations or keep specific flows to certain paths. In RIFT, this traffic steering/engineering
    is done by using policy- guided prefixes with their associated communities. Routes
    based on policy-guided prefixes are preferred over regular routes. Any node can
    originate a policy-guided prefix and advertise it in both north and south directions,
    and the calculation in both directions are distance vector based.</p>"
