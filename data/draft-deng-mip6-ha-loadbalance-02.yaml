abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a dynamic load balance mechanism among multiple
    home agents by taking into account acceptable number of mobile nodes for each
    home agent up to now, with the goal of reducing and preventing traffic bottlenecks
    at the home agent. This mechanism can be used when a home agent is overloaded,
    wants to achieve better load-balancing with peer home agents, or is going offline
    for service.</p>"
