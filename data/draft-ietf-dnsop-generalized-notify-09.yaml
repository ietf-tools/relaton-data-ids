abstract:
- content: "<p>This document generalizes and extends the use of DNS NOTIFY (RFC 1996)
    beyond conventional zone transfer hints, to allow triggering other types of actions
    via the DNS that were previously lacking a trigger mechanism. Notifications merely
    nudge the receiver to initiate a predefined action promptly (instead of on a schedule);
    they do not alter the action itself (including any security checks it might employ).
    To enable this functionality, a method for discovering the receiver endpoint for
    such notification messages is introduced, via the new DSYNC record type. Notification
    types are recorded in a new registry, with initial support for parental NS and
    DS record updates including DNSSEC bootstrapping. TO BE REMOVED: This document
    is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify
    (https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized- notify). The
    most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available
    there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>"
