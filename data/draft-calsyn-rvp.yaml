abstract:
- content: "<p>A new kind of application is emerging on the Internet, driven by the
    desire of individuals to know instantly whether another individual is online,
    to be notified when another individual arrives online, and to send messages in
    \\021real time\\022. These are all special cases of the more general problem of
    Internet-wide notification. This protocol for facilitating rendezvous between
    users, known herein as RVP, is designed to enable such notifications and messages
    across a loosely coupled (federated) constellation of servers. RVP is designed
    to address the need for notification in a secure, reliable and scaleable fashion.
    RVP encompasses the client-server and server-server interactions. The authors
    recognize that there is significant overlap with between RVP and HTTP, though
    there are also significant differences. We expect RVP to evolve and either converge
    or diverge with HTTP and/or other existing protocols. The protocol described in
    this document represents a very viable starting point for a discussion of a standardized
    solution to the problem. Comments on this draft are solicited and should be sent
    to the authors or the RVP discussion list. To join the RVP discussion list, send
