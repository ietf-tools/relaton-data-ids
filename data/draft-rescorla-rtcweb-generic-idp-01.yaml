abstract:
- content: "<p>Security for RTCWEB communications requires that the communicating
    endpoints be able to authenticate each other. While authentication may be mediated
    by the calling service, there are settings in which this is undesirable. This
    document describes a generic mechanism for leveraging existing identity providers
    (IdPs) such as BrowserID or OAuth to provide this authentication service.</p>"
