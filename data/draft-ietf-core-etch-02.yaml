abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) methods only allow
    access to a complete resource, not to parts of a resource. In case of resources
    with larger or complex data, or in situations where a resource continuity is required,
    replacing or requesting the whole resource is undesirable. Several applications
    using CoAP will need to perform partial resource accesses. Similar to HTTP, the
    existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) GET method only allows the specification
    of a URI and request parameters in CoAP options, not the transfer of a request
    payload detailing the request. This leads to some applications to using POST where
    actually a cacheable, idempotent, safe request is desired. Again similar to HTTP,
    the existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) PUT method only allows to
    replace a complete resource. This also leads applications to use POST where actually
    a cacheable, possibly idempotent request is desired. This specification adds new
    CoAP methods, FETCH, to perform the equivalent of a GET with a request body; and
    the twin methods PATCH and iPATCH, to modify parts of a CoAP resource.</p>"
