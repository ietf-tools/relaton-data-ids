abstract:
- content: "<p>We compare the service received by TCP and UDP flows when they share
    either a link or an MPLS traffic trunk. Since traffic trunks allow non shortest
    path links also to be used, the total network throughput goes up with proper traffic
    engineering. If UDP and TCP flows are mixed in a trunk, TCP flows receive reduced
    service as the UDP flows increase their rates. Also, we found that in order to
    benefit from traffic engineering, MPLS trunks should be implemented end-to-end
    (first router to last router). If some part of the network is MPLS-unaware, the
    benefits are reduced or eliminated.</p>"
