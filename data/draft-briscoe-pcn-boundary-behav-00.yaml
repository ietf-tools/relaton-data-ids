abstract:
- content: '<p>The Pre-Congestion Notification Architecture document defines a PCN
    domain and the PCN-ingress and PCN-egress nodes that form its boundary. The present
    document is an attempt to describe the detailed behaviour of the PCN boundary
    nodes. It is a contribution toward the PCN WG milestone: "Suggested Flow Admission
    and Termination Boundary Mechanisms". This first version is expected to evolve
    with discussion and further thought toward a more precise and prescriptive view
    of boundary node behaviour.</p>'
