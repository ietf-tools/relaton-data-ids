abstract:
- content: "<p>To diagnose performance and connectivity problems, metrics on real
    (non-synthetic) transmission are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution.
    Such diagnostics may be real-time or after the fact, but must not impact an operational
    production network. The base metrics are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp.
    Metrics derived from these will be described separately. This document provides
    the background and rationale for the requirement for end-to- end response time.</p>"
