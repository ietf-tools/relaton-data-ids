abstract:
- content: "<p>Agentic AI systems require robust, verifiable identities to operate
    securely. While traditional certificate enrollment protocols like SCEP and EST
    can be extended to include remote attestation evidence, performing a full validation
    for every agent's certificate request presents significant scalability and privacy
    challenges. This document proposes two distinct, scalable models for integrating
    attestation into the enrollment lifecycle. The first model leverages Zero-Knowledge
    Proofs (ZKP) to provide private, efficient, and continuous attestation. The second
    model uses a one-time, high- assurance bootstrapping process to establish a trusted
    host environment, which is then authorized to endorse certificate requests for
    the agents it runs. Both models enable high-assurance identity for AI agents while
    addressing the performance bottlenecks of naive per-enrollment verification.</p>"
