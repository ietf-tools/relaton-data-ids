abstract:
- content: "<p>Draft [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies procedures
    that can be used for creation and deletion of PCE- initiated LSPs in the active
    stateful PCE model. However, this specification focuses on MPLS networks, and
    does not cover remote instantiation of paths in GMPLS-controlled networks. This
    document complements [I-D. draft-crabbe-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] by addressing the
    requirements for remote-initiated GMPLS LSPs.</p>"
