abstract:
- content: <p>This document is for discussion by the TSVWG. It provides guidance on
    the design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and to provide congestion control.
    Recommendations and requirements on this topic are distributed across many documents
    in the RFC series. This therefore seeks to gather and consolidate these recommendations
    in an annexe. Based on these specifications, and Internet engineering experience,
    the document provides input to the design of new congestion control methods in
    protocols. The present document is for discussion and comment by the IETF. If
    published, it plans to update or replace the Best Current Practice in BCP 41,
    which currently includes "Congestion Control Principles" provided in RFC2914.</p>
