abstract:
- content: '<p>[ Editor note: This originally included a mechanism to actually roll
    the keys (like RFC5011 does), but feedback from the Prague meeting indicated a
    strong preference for signalling only. ] This document describes a simple method
    for validating recursive resolvers to signal their configured list of DNSSEC trust
    anchors. This mechanism allows the trust anchor maintainer to monitor the progress
    of the migration to a new trust anchor, and so predict the effect before decommissioning
    the existing trust anchor. It is primarily aimed at the root DNSSEC trust anchor,
    but should be applicable to trust anchors elsewhere in the DNS as well. [ Ed note
    - informal summary: One of the big issues with rolling the root key is that it
    is unclear who all is using RFC5011, who all has successfully fetched and installed
    the new key, and, most importantly, who all will die when the old key is revoked.
    By having resolvers query for a special QNAME, comprised of the list of TAs that
    it knows about, we effectively signal "up stream" to the authoritative server.
    By querying for this name, the recursive exposes its list of TAs to this authoritative
    server. This allows the TA maintainer to gather information relating to the state
    of TAs on resolvers.] [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional
    background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings,
    etc. They will be removed before publication.] [ This document is being collaborated
    on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-trust-management.
    The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
    here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</p>'
