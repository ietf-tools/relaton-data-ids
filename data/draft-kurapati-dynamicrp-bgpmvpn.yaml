abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM Group-to-RP mappings are distributed dynamically using protocols
    such as BSR or Auto-RP. The BGP-MVPN specification provides for this information
    to be encapsulated in an I-PMSI or S-PMSI provider tunnel between the PEs in an
    MVPN environment. Since this is control information, it is desirable to signal
    this information in BGP between PEs, similar to carrying other customer control
    state such as C-Multicast routes. This document specifies the mechanisms and procedures
    to carry bootstrap information via BGP to provide true control and data plane
    separation.</p>"
