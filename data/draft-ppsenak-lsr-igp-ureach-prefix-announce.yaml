abstract:
- content: "<p>In the presence of summarization, there is a need to signal loss of
    reachability to an individual prefix covered by the summary in order to enable
    fast convergence away from paths to the node which owns the prefix which is no
    longer reachable. This document describes how to use existing protocol mechanisms
    in IS-IS and OSPF to advertise such prefix reachability loss.</p>"
