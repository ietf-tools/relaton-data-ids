abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to distribute secure key for optimizing
    AAA authentication procedure while a mobile node is away from it's home. The AAA
    infrastrucrue is used as an underlying framework which enables a Mobile-IPv6 node
    to get an global authentication by identifying it with an unique identifier NAI.
    The Diameter messages are exchanged to transfer information of mobile node between
    home and foreign AAA servers. The steps to complete an authentication procedure
    for mobile node in the visited link may be reduced by delegating the role for
    generating and synchronizing keys to AAA server in the visited domain. The implications
    to existing entities supporting mobility such as attendant, AAA server in home
    and visited domain are discussed. The delegation is introduced and the related
    security issues are pointed out.</p>"
