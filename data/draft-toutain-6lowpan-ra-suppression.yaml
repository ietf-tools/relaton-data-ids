abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose to strongly reduce the usage of Neighbor Discovery in WSN
    by ignoring the global IPv6 prefix inside the WSN. The IPv6 prefix will be added
    (resp. removed) by the Border Router during the header decompression (resp. compression).
    This proposal has three main advantages: (i) reduce the number of exchanges inside
    the WSN, (ii) reduce the time needed by a sensor node to join the WSN (this is
    important when sensors are moving inside the WSN) and finally (iii) simplify multi-homing
    management. This document also studies the impact of this proposal on different
    architectures (star, mesh, route over) with LOWPAN_IPHC Encoding Format.</p>"
