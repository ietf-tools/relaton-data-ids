abstract:
- content: "<p>Diffserv-Aware Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) can be used by Service Providers
    to perform fine grain bandwidth management of a subset, or sub-pool, of traffic
    flows. Typically in DS-TE a diffserv class will use a single Label Switch Path
    (LSP) that satisfies the bandwidth required. Where traffic with different diffserv
    characteristics must be mapped to a single LSP. Multi-Class DS-TE can be used
    to select an LSP that satisfy the bandwidth requirement of all classes required.
    This document specifies the PCEP extentions to support Multi-Class Type DS-TE
    where path computation is performed with the aid of a Path Computation Element
    (PCE).</p>"
