abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes JSON and CBOR serializations for SPHINCS+,
    a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) signature suite. This document does not define
    any new cryptography, only seralizations of existing cryptographic systems. This
    document registers key types for JOSE and COSE, specifically HASH. Key types in
    this document are specified by the cryptographic algorithm family in use by a
    particular algorithm as discussed in RFC7517. This document registers signature
    algorithms types for JOSE and COSE, specifically SPHINCS+256s and others as required
    for use of various parameterizations of the SPHINCS+ post-quantum signature scheme.
    Note to RFC Editor: SPHINCS+ is described and noted as a part of the 2022 PQC
    Selected Digital Signature Algorithims (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/selected-
    algorithms-2022) As a result, this document should not be proceed to AUTH48 until
    NIST completes paramter tuning and selection as a part of the PQC (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
    standardization process.</p>"
