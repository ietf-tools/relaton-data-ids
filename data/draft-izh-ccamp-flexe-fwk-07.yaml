abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the GMPLS control plane requirements, framework,
    and architecture for the FlexE technology. The document also discusses interoperation
    between the GMPLS control plane for FlexE and the control plane of any networking
    layer using the FlexE technology as a server layer. As different from earlier
    Ethernet data planes FlexE allows for decoupling of the Ethernet Physical layer
    (PHY) and Media Access Control layer (MAC) rates. Study Group 15 (SG15) of the
    ITU-T has endorsed the FlexE Implementation Agreement from Optical Internetworking
    Forum (OIF) and included it, by reference, in some of their Recommendations.</p>"
