abstract:
- content: "<p>The backbone for telephony consists of a digital network that is chiefly
    used for audio using the G.711 codec, which is also widely supported in VoIP telephony.
    This specification defines Subliminal Messaging as a general facility for opportunistic
    data exchange in the noise levels of audio codecs, with profiles for the G.711,
    G.722 and CLEARMODE codecs. The data exchange can be used to negotiate other codecs,
    UUID-identified services and call privacy/integrity.</p>"
