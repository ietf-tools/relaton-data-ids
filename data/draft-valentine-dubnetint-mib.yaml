abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of EuroModem
    v1.0 compliant Cable Network Interface Units. This memo specifies a MIB module
    in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2[RFC2578][RFC2579][RFC2580]. The
    set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.
    This memo is a product of the DVB/DAVIC interoperability consortium. Comments
    are solicited and should be addressed to the author</p>"
