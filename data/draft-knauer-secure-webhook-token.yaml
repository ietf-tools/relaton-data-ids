abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Webhook Token (SWT) is a specialized JSON Web Token (JWT)
    format designed for securely authorizing and verifying webhook requests. It defines
    a set of claims to ensure that the token is explicitly tied to webhook events
    and that its integrity can be reliably validated by the recipient. A key feature
    of SWT is the introduction of a unique claim, webhook, which encapsulates webhook-
    specific information, such as the event type. By providing a structured and secure
    approach to webhook authentication, SWT aims to be a lightweight and flexible
    solution while maintaining compatibility with typical JWT structures. It is designed
    with the best practices in mind and may serve as a foundation for future standardization
    efforts.</p>"
