abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines enhancements to the bootstrapping a remote secure
    key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995] ) to facilitate bootstrapping in domains
    featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain
    registrar. This specifically targets situations, in which the interaction model
    changes from a pledge-initiator-mode as in BRSKI to a pledge- responder-mode as
    desribed here. To support this functionality BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar-agent
    component, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during
    the bootstrapping phase. To support the establishment of a trust relation between
    a pledge and the domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on the exchange of authenticated
    self-contained objects (signature- wrapped objects). The defined approach is agnostic
    regarding the utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the registrar to communicate
    with the Domain CA.</p>"
