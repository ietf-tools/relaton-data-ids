abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agents operating
    Mobile IP for IPv4. The new extension option allows a foreign agent to supply
    an error code without disturbing the data supplied by the Home Agent within the
    Registration Reply message. In this way, the mobile node can verify that the Registration
    Reply message was generated by the Home Agent even in cases where the foreign
    agent is required by protocol to insert new status information into the Registration
    Reply message.</p>"
