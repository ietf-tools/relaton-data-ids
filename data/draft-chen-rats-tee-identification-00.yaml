abstract:
- content: "<p>In security considerations, identity of a device should be protected
    and cannot be exposed in public. Based on this purpose, this document specifies
    the architecture of TEE(Trust Execution Environment) identification based on EAP-TLS.
    In this architecture, TEE is in charge of protecting the certificate and generating
    handshake keys which will be used for EAP-TLS authentication. REE(Rich Execution
    Environment) is in charge of building communication with EAP-TLS Server. A middle
    layer is introduced to communicate with separate parts of EAP-TLS in TEE and REE
    to implement its original functionality. This architecture could be used in data
    link layer and also application layer to implement identity authentication under
    the protection of TEE and EAP-TLS.</p>"
