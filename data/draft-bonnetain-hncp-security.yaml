abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes how to secure HNCP. Based on asymmetric cryptography
    and trust relationships, it ensures integrity, authenticity and, to a lesser extent,
    secrecy and non-repudiation. This secrecy can be used to encrypt part of the shared
    data, or to secure other protocols, like the routing protocol.</p>"
