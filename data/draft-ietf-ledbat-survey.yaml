abstract:
- content: <p>This document provides a survey of transport protocols that are designed
    to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard
    TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it. Such protocols could be used
    for delay-insensitive "background" traffic, as they provide what is sometimes
    called a "less than" (or "lower than") best-effort service. This document is not
    an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>
