abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a backward-compatible extension to CT enabling
    log servers to obtain compact collective signatures from any number of well-known
    "witness" servers, which clients can check without gossip to verify that log server
    records have been widely witnessed. Collective signatures proactively protect
    clients from man-in-the- middle attackers who may have stolen the private keys
    of one or more log servers, even if the attacker controls the client's network
    access, the client is unwilling to gossip for privacy reasons, or the client does
    not wish to incur the network bandwidth and/or latency costs of gossip.</p>
