abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Federated Authentication of Entities (FedAE)
    framework, enabling secure machine-to-machine communication within a federation.
    Both clients and servers perform mutual TLS authentication, establishing trust
    based on a centrally managed trust anchor published by the federation. Additionally,
    FedAE ensures unambiguous identification of entities, as only authorized members
    within the federation can publish metadata, further mitigating risks associated
    with unauthorized entities impersonating legitimate participants. This framework
    promotes seamless and secure interoperability across different trust domains adhering
    to common policies and standards within the federation.</p>"
