abstract:
- content: "<p>The emerging multi-domain applications, such as flexible interdomain
    routing, distributed, federated machine learning and multi-domain collaborative
    dataset transfer, can benefit substantially from getting information from networks.
    The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] provides a northbound interface for applications
    to retrieve the network information. In particular, it specifies the communication
    between an ALTO client and an ALTO server, where the ALTO is implicitly assumed
    to be able to answer any query from the ALTO client. However, it does not specify
    the cases when the network information are originated from multiple domains (i.e.,
    administrative entities or geographically partitions). This document summarizes
    the discussion on the ALTO weekly meeting since IETF 108 on how to extend ALTO
    to support multi-domain applications. It identifies the key challenges for retrieving
    network information from multiple networks, reviews the existing efforts in the
    work group, and discusses the next steps to fully address the challenges.</p>"
