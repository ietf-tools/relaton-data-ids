abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to support Route Optimization for Mobile
    Nodes in IPv6 Mobile Network. The support is provided by Prefix Delegation. Mobile
    Router gets a prefix from an access router using Prefix Delegation protocol and
    advertises the delegated prefix to its subnet. Each Mobile Nodes makes its care-of
    address from the prefix and performs binding update. It allows the Mobile Nodes
    to communicate with Correspondent Nodes directly, avoiding ingress filtering.</p>"
