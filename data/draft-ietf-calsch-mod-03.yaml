abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols require the definition
    of objects to encapsulate an event to be scheduled, a calendar on which the event
    will be stored, and means for exchanging these objects across the Internet between
    calendars on behalf of people for whom the calendars are meaningful. This document
    gives an abstract model of the objects and the protocols necessary to accomplish
    this kind of information exchange. It will establish the context in which other
    Calendaring and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted. Included are brief introductions
    to the other components of Internet calendar protocols and definitions of nomenclature
    common to all documents defining these protocols. Reading this document will enable
    implementors and users of Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols to understand
    the goals and constraints chosen for related protocols.</p>"
