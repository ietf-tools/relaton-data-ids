abstract:
- content: "<p>Media recording enables the parties of a conversation to record all
    or part of the conversation. Automatic recording may bring great convenience to
    users. However, federal law requires the parties of a conversation to have a consent
    for media recording. In addition, FCC requires the recorded parties must be notified
    before the recording. These requirements make automatic recording impossible without
    defining a mechanism to negotiate the consent and send recording notifications.
    This document defines a SIP event package for recording event notifications and
    use the SIP CONSENT method to negotiate a consent among multiple parties for media
    recording.</p>"
