abstract:
- content: "<p>For efficient network operation, most network operators rely on traditional
    Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include proactive
    and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes. As networks increase
    in scale, they become more susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration
    errors. With the advent of programmable data-plane, emerging on-path telemetry
    techniques provide unprecedented flow insight and fast notification of network
    issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency, packet loss, significant bit error variations,
    and unequal load- balancing). This document outlines a reference architectural
    framework, In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT), which enumerates several
    high level components and describes how these components can be assembled to achieve
    a complete and closed-loop working solution for on-path telemetry. iFIT addresses
    several deployment challenges for on-path telemetry techniques, especially in
    carrier networks. As an open framework, it does not detail the implementation
    of the components as well as the interface between the components. Rather, the
    document summarizes the current status and analyzes the gaps on related standard
    developments.</p>"
