abstract:
- content: <p>Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own mechanism
    for securing the protocol packets on the wire. While most already have some method
    for accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in many cases the existing
    methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic algorithms that
    have been deprecated. The "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP)
    effort aims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms. This document has two main
    parts - the first describes the threat analysis for attacks against routing protocols'
    transports and the second enumerates the requirements for addressing the described
    threats. This document, along with the KARP design guide will be used by KARP
    design teams for specific protocol review and overhaul. This document reflects
    the input of both the IETF's Security Area and Routing Area in order to form a
    jointly agreed upon guidance.</p>
