abstract:
- content: <p>Multipath TCP (MPTCP), described in [4], is an extension to TCP to provide
    the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. draft-paasch-mptcp-application-authentication
    specifies "application layer authentication" for Multipath TCP, an alternatively
    negotiated keying mechanism for MPTCP. This allows keying material to be sourced
    from an application layer protocol in order to secure MP_JOIN handshakes. This
    document explains how to use the proposed application-layer authentication extension
    with TLS [6], in order to leverage securely exchanged keys for MPTCP security,
    whilst simultaneously freeing the MPTCP token to be used as a channel for additional
    information.</p>
