abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an OPTIONAL extension to the Internet Printing
    Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics (RFC 2911, RFC 2910). This extension allows
    a client to subscribe to printing related Events. Subscriptions are modeled as
    Subscription Objects. The Subscription Object specifies that when one of the specified
    Events occurs, the Printer delivers an asynchronous Event Notification to the
    specified Notification Recipient via the specified Push or Pull Delivery Method
    (i.e., protocol). A client associates Subscription Objects with a particular Job
    by performing the Create-Job-Subscriptions operation or by submitting a Job with
    subscription information. A client associates Subscription Objects with the Printer
    by performing a Create-Printer-Subscriptions operation. Four other operations
    are defined for Subscription Objects: Get-Subscriptions-Attributes, Get-Subscriptions,
    Renew-Subscription, and Cancel-Subscription. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
