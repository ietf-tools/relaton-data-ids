abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the feedback messages defined
    in the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF). The new Reference Picture Verification
    Information (RPVI) feedback message conveys information about available reference
    pictures in the decoded picture buffer of a video decoder in the receiver of an
    RTP video stream. By including information related to Decoded Picture Hash (DPH)
    values, media senders and media receivers can verify that reference pictures used
    for prediction by the video encoder and the video decoder are aligned. It is also
    possible to use the RPVI feedback message to indicate that a specific reference
    picture has incorrect sample values (i.e. a mismatch in the DPH value between
    encoder and decoder) or that a specific reference picture has been lost.</p>"
