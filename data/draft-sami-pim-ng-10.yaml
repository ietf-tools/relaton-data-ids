abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next generation
    or simply called PIM-NG. PIM-NG uses the underlying unicast routing information,
    but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily need to build unidirectional shared trees
    rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, due to the fact that the processes
    through which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point and a host finds the
    source of the multicast destination groups it needs are done in a whole new way
    and hence, the source of multicast group (G) is discovered faster. So at some
    points PIM-NG works faster than its predecessor. Also the new Domain concept,
    unique to PIM-NG, along the RPF check method used in PIM-NG specifications provides
    many features along a robust and flexible control and administration over multicast
    networks.</p>"
