abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Monitor, an additional Option for the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors. The Monitor
    Option complements the typical Observe pattern, enabling the tracking of a resource
    hosted by a node sleeping most of the time, by taking care of establishing and
    maintaining an Observe relationship with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of the
    (sleepy) client.</p>"
