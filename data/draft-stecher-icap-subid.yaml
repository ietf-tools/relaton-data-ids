abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) [1] provides simple,
    object-based content vectoring for HTTP services. User-defined header extensions
    are widely used by many ICAP client and server implementations. Some implementations
    have also introduced new ICAP methods. This document describes and defines a number
    of ICAP extensions to ensure ongoing interoperability between the implementations.</p>"
