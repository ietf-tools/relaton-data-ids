abstract:
- content: "<p>Sometimes an IP multicast distribution tree (MDT) traverses both MPLS-enabled
    and non-MPLS-enabled regions of a network. Typically the MDT begins and ends in
    non-MPLS regions, but travels through an MPLS region. In such cases, it can be
    useful to begin building the MDT as a pure IP MDT, then convert it to an MPLS
    Multipoint LSP (Label Switched Path) when it enters an MPLS-enabled region, and
    then convert it back to a pure IP MDT when it enters a non-MPLS-enabled region.
    [I-D.ietf-mpls-mldp-in-band-signaling] specifies the procedures for building such
    a hybrid MDT, using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) as the control protocol
    in the non-MPLS region of the network, and using Multipoint Extensions to Label
    Distribution Protocol (mLDP) in the MPLS region. This document extends those procedures
    so that they will work when the links between the MPLS and non-MPLS regions are
    [RFC4364] interfaces. While these procedures do not provide a good general multicast
    VPN solution, they are useful in certain specific situations.</p>"
