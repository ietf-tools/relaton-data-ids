abstract:
- content: "<p>The DMAP Message Access Protocol, Version 1 allows a client to access
    and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server, without revealing too much
    information about messages being accessed to the server. DMAP permits manipulation
    of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent
    to local folders. DMAP also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize
    with the server and for message submission. DMAP supports discovery of keys (signets)
    belonging to other users the client can communicate to. Syncronization and publication
    of keys (private key, might include certificates) and signets (public part, certificate).
    DMAP includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking
    for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC
    5322 and RFC 2045 parsing, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts,
    and portions thereof. Messages in DMAP are accessed by the use of numbers. These
    numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers. Note: This
    document is a very early draft and omission of specific syntax is intentional.
    It is intended to stimulate discussions about specific protocol syntax and general
    design.</p>"
