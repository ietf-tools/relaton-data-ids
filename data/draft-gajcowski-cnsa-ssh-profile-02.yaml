abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States Government has published the NSA Commercial National
    Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy
    for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for
    using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite algorithms with
    the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol and the Secure Shell Authentication
    Protocol. It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all
    components of US National Security Systems that employ IPSec. US National Security
    Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also appropriate
    for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. It is
    made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other
    system deployments.</p>"
