abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses mechanisms for supporting future changes to the
    functionality and behaviour of SNMP, without needing to introduce new versions
    of the protocol, or completely new protocol operations. It defines a Management
    Information Base (MIB) for advertising support for various extensions to traditional
    SNMP protocol capabilities, and proposes a mechanism for negotiating the use of
    such extensions on a per-request basis.</p>"
