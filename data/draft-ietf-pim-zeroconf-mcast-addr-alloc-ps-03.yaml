abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a network that requires unique multicast addresses
    to distribute data. Various challenges are discussed, such as the use of multicast
    snooping to ensure efficient use of bandwidth, limitations of switch hardware,
    problems associated with address collisions, and the need to avoid user configuration.
    After all limitations were considered it was determined that multicast addresses
    need to be dynamically-assigned by a decentralized, zero- configuration protocol.
    Requirements and recommendations for suitable protocols are listed and specific
    considerations for assigning IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are reviewed. The document
    closes with several solutions that are precluded from consideration.</p>"
