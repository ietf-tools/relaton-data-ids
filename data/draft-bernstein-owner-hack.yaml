abstract:
- content: "<p>The fundamental problem in managing a large mailing list is matching
    bounce messages to subscription addresses. Often a bounce message refers to a
    failing address that does not appear on the mailing list. One of the mailing list
    subscribers is forwarding messages to that address. Which subscriber? As the list
    grows, this question becomes more and more difficult to answer. The owner hack
    completely eliminates this problem _right now_. It automatically and reliably
    identifies the subscription address relevant to each bounce message. It provides
    the address in a form that is trivial for automated bounce handlers to parse.
    It requires support from the local mailer, but it does not require support from
    any other hosts.</p>"
