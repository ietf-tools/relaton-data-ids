- content: "<p>This draft is for consideration by the FCIP team in the IPS working
    group. Improvements to Fibre Channel Over TCP/IP (FCIP) [2] frame encapsulation
    mechanisms are proposed. The objectives of the improvements are two fold: increasing
    the reliability of Fibre Channel frame detection, and assisting with the handling
    of Fibre Channel E_D_TOV and R_A_TOV time-out processing.</p>"
