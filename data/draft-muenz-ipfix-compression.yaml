abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we discuss the benefits and possible realizations
    of IPFIX traffic compression. Experiments with real measurement data show that
    a significant compression gain can be achieved by applying the DEFLATE compression
    method to IPFIX data sets. Compression of IPFIX traffic can be based on underlying
    transport protocols, such as IPComp and TLS/DTLS, or realized as an extension
    of the IPFIX protocol.</p>"
