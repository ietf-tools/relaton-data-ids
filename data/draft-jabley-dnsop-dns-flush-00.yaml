abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS NOTIFY is a mechanism for prompt notification of zone changes between
    DNS authority servers that is usually employed to trigger immediate zone transfers.
    This document specifies an additional use of DNS NOTIFY to allow DNS authority
    servers to trigger cache flushes on recursive DNS servers. Such signalling is
    authenticated and is intended for use between cooperating DNS server operators.</p>"
