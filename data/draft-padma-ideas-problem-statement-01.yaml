abstract:
- content: "<p>The forthcoming deployment of 5G coupled with emerging applications
    such as augmented reality, virtual reality and 8k videos are likely to raise more
    stringent requirements in terms of ultra-low latency while ensuring session continuity.
    The emergence of IoT services also raises new challenges (with respect to their
    interoperability, discovery, naming and addressing) which may lead to identity-based
    designs. This problem statement examines how the existing solutions for networks
    whose forwarding scheme assumes the decoupling between the identifier and the
    locator information (called Identity Enabled Networks) will struggle to meet such
    requirements. It advocates for a standardized, secured common control plane with
    data integrity for Identity Services such as identifier registration, mapping
    and resolution. This memo also identifies several key areas to be further investigated
    for the architecture design of these services.</p>"
