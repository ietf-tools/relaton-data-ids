abstract:
- content: "<p>A taxonomy of textual representations for four-octet Autonomous System
    (AS) numbers is defined. The 'asdot' textual representation is recommended. The
    syntax chosen avoids ambiguity with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community string
    representation of AS numbers. It is recommended that this textual representation
    be used by all documents, systems and user interfaces referring to four-octet
    AS numbers.</p>"
