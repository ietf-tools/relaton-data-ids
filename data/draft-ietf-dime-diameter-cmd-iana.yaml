abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides a
    number of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands (i.e., messages
    used by Diameter applications) and applications as the most extensive enhancements.
    RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions that lead to the need to define a new Diameter
    application or a new command code. Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension,
    IETF actions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applications does not
    require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commands requires IETF consensus
    per RFC 3588. This has led to questionable design decisions by other Standards
    Development Organizations, which chose to define new applications on existing
    commands -- rather than asking for assignment of new command codes -- for the
    pure purpose of avoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF. In some cases,
    interoperability problems were an effect of the poor design caused by overloading
    existing commands. This document aligns the extensibility rules of the Diameter
    application with the Diameter commands, offering ways to delegate work on Diameter
    to other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to poor design choices.
