abstract:
- content: "<p>BIER specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data
    packets. As the [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] said, in the BIER domain, it does
    not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distributing trees, nor
    does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state. In some deployments,
    some specific multicast flows may be forwarded by special routing; it cannot be
    achieved by the forwarding rule that is provided. In this document we will defined
    a new routing list in BIER header, the packets will be steered according to the
    routing list.</p>"
