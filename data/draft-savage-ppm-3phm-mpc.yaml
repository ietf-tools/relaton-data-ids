abstract:
- content: "<p>A three party, honest majority system provides the most efficient protocols
    for Multiparty Computation (MPC). This document describes a concrete instantiation
    of addition and multiplication protocols that provide strong guarantees of security.
    The multiplication protocol provides low communication and computation costs,
    with addition being almost free. Any single dishonest party is detected with high
    probability.</p>"
