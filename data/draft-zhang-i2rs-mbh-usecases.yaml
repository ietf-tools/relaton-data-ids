abstract:
- content: "<p>In a mobile backhaul network, traditional configuration and diagnoses
    mechanisms based on device-level management tools and manual processing are ill-suited
    to meet the requirements of today's scalable, flexible, and complex network. Thanks
    to the new innovation of Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) programmatic
    interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], an alternative way is
    available to control the configuration and diagnose the operational results. This
    document discusses the use case for I2RS in mobile backhaul network.</p>"
