abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for
    NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the offer/answer
    model of session negotiation. ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport
    addresses for each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity
    checks based on Simple Traversal of UDP over NAT (STUN). ICE provides a general
    framework for describing alternates, but only defines UDP-based transport protocols.
    This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the ability to offer
    a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single stream.</p>"
