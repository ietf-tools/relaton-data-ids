abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how push notification mechanisms can be used
    to wake up idle Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications, in order to be
    able to receive and process SIP requests. The document defines new SIP URI parameters,
    that can be used in a SIP REGISTER request to provide push notification information
    from the SIP User Agent (UA) to the SIP entity (realized as a SIP proxy in this
    document) that will send a push request to the push server in order to trigger
    a push notification towards the SIP UA.</p>"
