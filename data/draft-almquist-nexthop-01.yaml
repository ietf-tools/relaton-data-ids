abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses how routers do, can, and should decide how to use
    the routing information available to them to route packets. It is particularly
    concerned with the problems of border routers and other routers which have to
    choose from among routes learned from the multiple routing domains, often using
    different routing protocols. Although this memo is not an official product of
    the Router Requirements working group, it is being published as an Internet Draft
    because it is required reading for those who wish to actively participate in the
    Router Requirements sessions during the IETF meeting in Atlanta.</p>"
