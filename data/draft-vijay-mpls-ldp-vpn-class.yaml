abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of LDP in establishing VPNs for transporting
    traffic that needs to be classified based on application flows. This document
    proposes extensions to existing LDP for establishing end-to-end VPN LSPs for transporting
    traffic meant for specific destination addresses and applications from specific
    applications. This document proposes to use a Flow FEC element, which contains
    the Layer 3 and transport information which is used for identifying the flow.
    The flow is mapped onto the appropriate VPN LSP.</p>"
