abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo evaluates the extent to which current multicasting protocols
    can be used to address common requirements for commercial, large-scale IP multicasting,
    but may be applicable to non-commercial deployments as well. Four existing possible
    multicasting architectures (with or without some form of access or content control)
    are presented. Then each architecture is analyzed with respect to how it can or
    cannot satisfactorily address each issue. This memo concludes that for many of
    these issues the possible architectures based on present standards as they now
    exist require non-standardized solutions to meet common use requirements. This
    memo recommends for requirements to be defined that would set the groundwork for
    framework(s) and solutions that sufficiently address these limitations.</p>"
