abstract:
- content: <p>Traffic analysis is used by various entities to derive "meta data" about
    Internet communications, such as who communicates with whom or what, and when.
    We analyze how meta-data can be extracted by monitoring IP headers, DNS traffic,
    and clear-text headers of commonly used protocols. We then propose a series of
    actions that would make traffic analysis more difficult.</p>
