abstract:
- content: "<p>ISPs wants to take advantage of MIF Transport protocols like SCTP,
    MPTCP to enhance their End User's experience when the End User has been offloaded
    on WLAN. In addition, WLAN are untrusted so ISPs MUST Secure at least some of
    their End Users's communications. For various reasons IPsec is the protocol they
    choose to secure the communications. Currently, IPsec is not adapted to Multiple
    Interfaces Environment. IPsec can hardly be configured in a proper way which may
    result in breaking End Users' communications. At least, it makes it very hard
    for the End Users to combine Security with MIF enhancements. MOBIKE partly address
    the problem for a single Interface. This draft provides the problem statement
    and defines the IPsec Security Requirements for MIF.</p>"
