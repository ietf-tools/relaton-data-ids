abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an NSIS QoS Signaling Policy model for networks
    that use the Resource Management in Diffserv (RMD) concept. RMD is a technique
    for adding admission control to Differentiated Services (Diffserv) networks. RMD
    complements the Diffserv architecture by pushing complex classification, conditioning
    and admission control functions to the edges of a Diffserv domain and simplifying
    the operation of internal nodes.</p>"
