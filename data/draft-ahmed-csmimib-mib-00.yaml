abstract:
- content: "<p>This document was issued by Time Warner Cable to the industry on December
    24, 1995 as a private extension to the SNMPv1 MIB. As issued by Time Warner, this
    memo defined a private portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use
    with network management protocols in the Internet community. It described objects
    used for managing Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum and the related configuration
    parameters allocated to different vendors' products in Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)
    networks. This document is submitted as it is for information purposes only and
    the authors plan to update the document consistent with the guidelines and structure
    of the Internet Drafts as specified in RFC 1543. The authors also plan to specify
    this MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically
    identical to the existing SNMPv1-based definitions. This memo does not specify
    a standard for the Internet community. It is presented for discussion purposes
    only.</p>"
