abstract:
- content: "<p>There is an interest in enhancing the performance of handover between
    access routers through the transfer of forwarding context [2]. To clearly understand
    the requirements for this transfer, it is useful to examine the requirements of
    specific feature contexts. This document reviews the requirements for transferring
    the context associated with RObust Header Compressions (ROHC [3]) in preparation
    for a handoff of the IP traffic being compressed.</p>"
