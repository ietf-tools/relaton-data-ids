- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of Network
    Address Translation and transparent bridging functionality within CableHome 1.0
    and 1.1 compliant residential gateways. This memo specifies a MIB module in a
    manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects is consistent
    with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.</p>"
