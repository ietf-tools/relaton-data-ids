abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file
    transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host.
    This document describes the TFTP multicast option. This option allows multiple
    clients to receive the same file concurrently through the use of Multicast packets.
    The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2]. Often when similar computers
    are booting remotely they will each download the same image file. By adding multicast
    into the TFTP option set, two or more computers can download a file concurrently,
    thus increasing network efficiency. This document assumes that the reader is familiar
    with the terminology and notation of both [1] and [2].</p>"
