abstract:
- content: "<p>Session recording is a critical requirement in many business communications
    environments such as call centers and financial trading floors. In some of these
    environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.
    In others, calls may be recorded for quality control or business analytics. Recording
    is typically done by sending a copy of the media to the recording devices. This
    document specifies requirements for a protocol that will manage delivery of media
    from an end-point that originates media or that has access to it to a recording
    device. This protocol is being referred to as Session Recording Protocol and will
    most likely be based on SIP.</p>"
