abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft forms part of a discussion on the appropriate use of the
    Reply-To header in e-mail messages. This draft argues for one particular proposed
    definition of the Reply-To header. It is not intended that this document ever
    become anything more than an Internet-Draft. If adopted, the text here, or a modified
    version of some parts of it, would be merged into the proposed replacement for
    RFC822.</p>"
