abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Protected Entertainment Rights Management
    (PERM) protocol for management of usage rights to digital entertainment content.
    PERM is not intended to replace existing copy protection and conditional access
    systems. Rather it is intended to complement such systems by providing standardized
    methods of device and user authentication, content protection and content rights
    management across heterogeneous data networks. PERM does not impose any content
    usage policy upon an implementation of the PERM protocol. PERM defines a common
    method for policy enforcement, and implementors are free to design and enforce
    their own policy by using the features and conventions of the PERM protocol.</p>"
