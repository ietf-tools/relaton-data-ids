abstract:
- content: "<p>The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17 characters alphanumeric
    code that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide. This code is standardized in
    ISO-3779 and ISO-3780; other standardization bodies' implementation of this code
    (NHTSA, SAE) is compliant with ISO standards. The VIN is mandatory for each vehicle
    and used as a unique identity. Some public information related to a vehicle can
    be obtained knowing its VIN code. An IPv6 address is 128 bit in length and its
    rightmost bits form the Interface Identifier (IID). When the IPv6 address is used
    with IPv6- over-Ethernet and Stateless Address Auto-Configuration, the length
    of the IID is 64 bit. This document presents an experimental method to convert
    an IPv6 Interface Identifier starting from the VIN code - the VIID. The conversion
    can be reverted - given a VIID formed from a VIN it easily possible to find out
    the original VIN.</p>"
