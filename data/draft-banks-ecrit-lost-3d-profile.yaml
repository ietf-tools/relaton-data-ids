abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new location profile containing three- dimensional
    (3D) shapes to be used with the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST)
    defined in RFC 5222. Registration of the 3D location profile in the "Location-to-Service
    Translation (LoST) Location Profiles" IANA registry is requested accordingly.
    Inconsistencies in RFC 5222 relating to additional location profiles are revised
    and additional clarification is given to assist implementors when using this profile.</p>
