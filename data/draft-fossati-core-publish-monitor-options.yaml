abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines two additional Options for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors: Publish and Monitor. The
    Publish Option enables opportunistic updates of a given resource state, by temporarily
    delegating the authority of the Publish'ed resource to a Proxy node. The whole
    process is driven by the (sleepy) origin -- which may actually never need to listen.
    The Monitor Option complements the typical Observe pattern, enabling the tracking
    of a resource hosted by a node sleeping most of the time, by taking care of establishing
    and maintaining an Observe relationship with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of
    the (sleepy) client.</p>"
