abstract:
- content: "<p>Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the group key management
    problem. The most promising are those based on Logical Key Hierarchies (LKH).
    An LKH reduces the size of the rekey messages, reducing also the storage and processing
    requirements. An improved LKH algorithm called LKH+2 is described here. Using
    LKH+2, a group manager can use keys already in the tree to derive new keys. Using
    previously known keys saves information to be transmitted to members when a membership
    change occurs and new keys have to be created or updated. LKH+2 achieves K log_2
    n message size (K is the size of a key) for leave operations. It is alsoshown
    that the LKH+2 algorithm does not increase the storage andprocessing requirements
    when compared to other LKH schemes.</p>"
