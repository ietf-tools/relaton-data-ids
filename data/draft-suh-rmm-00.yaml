abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new protocol, namely, Regional Mobile IPv6
    mobility management (RMM/RMIPv6). RMM mechanism satisfies the LMM requirements
    while it is more flexible mobility management scheme than existing solution, for
    example HMIPv6. This document therefore describes methods to be used to reduce
    the amount of signaling to the Home Agent and Correspondent Nodes. In addition,
    this scheme is flexible enough to adapt to any network topology assumed by IPv6.
    The network that using RMM/RMIPv6 is robust against the failure or the performance
    degradation. The mechanism is intended to reuse the Care of Address. Moreover,
    the forwarding tunnel length from an anchor point to a Mobile Node can be a controllable
    or configurable.</p>"
