abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft consider a couple of algorithms for Path MTU (PMTU) in QUIC
    to discovery optimal PMTU and resolve PMTU black hole problem. Fistly, a passive
    probing approach is adopted to discover the PMTU. The process of discovering the
    PMTU is not performed separately, but is performed simultaneously in the actual
    application data communication. That is, the actual application data is allowed
    to be carried in the process of discovering the PMTU. A probe packet is defined
    newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application data as well as a short
    packet header and a PING_EXT frame. Until the optimal PMTU is discovered, the
    size of the probe packet is changed according to the size of the PMTU candidate.
    Secondly, a PMTU black hole problem in secure and reliable transport protocol
    is discussed and a possible solution can be suggested from existing researches.</p>"
