abstract:
- content: "<p>Thanks to the extensions defined in [I-D. draft-ietf-pce-pce- initiated-lsp]
    and [I-D.draft-ietf-pce-remote-initiated-gmpls-lsp], it is possible to initiate
    LSP Setup in a Stateful PCE Model for MPLS and GMPLS scenarios. This document
    complements previous documents by providing an explanation of the use cases to
    use such PCEP extensions. This document presents single layer and multi-layer
    use cases, where not only the PCE is involved, but also other modules defined
    in IETF, such as Virtual Network Topology Manager and Provisioning Manager.</p>"
