abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes to extend the HTTP Digest Authentication by
    adding a set new algorithms. These algorithms use different hash functions and
    combination of various information such as user name, realm, password, salt, and/or
    other data, in order to achieve compatibility with existing mechanisms used to
    store user credentials in various authentication/autorization servers.</p>"
