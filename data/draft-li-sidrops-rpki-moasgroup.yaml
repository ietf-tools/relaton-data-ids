abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines a "Signed MOAS Group", a Cryptographic Message
    Syntax (CMS) protected content type for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) to authenticate the collective announcement of IP prefixes by Multiple
    Origin Autonomous System (MOAS). The Signed MOAS Group mainly includes two parts:
    an IP prefix and a list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) authorized to announce the
    prefix. At least one of these ASes SHOULD be authorized to announce the prefix
    by the prefix owner through a Route Origin Authorization (ROA). The validation
    of a Signed MOAS Group confirms that the authorized ASes and other listed ASes
    have collectively agreed to announce the prefix, ensuring that the announcement
    is legitimate, accurate, and mutually authorized.</p>'
