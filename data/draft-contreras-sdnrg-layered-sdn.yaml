abstract:
- content: "<p>Software Defined Networking proposes the separation of the control
    plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical centralization
    on a control entity. Most of the network intelligence is moved to this functional
    entity. Typically, such entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control
    functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion. The relocation of the control
    functions from a number of distributed network nodes to a logical central entity
    conceptually places together a number of control capabilities with different purposes.
    As a consequence, the existing solutions do not provide a clear separation between
    transport control and services that relies upon transport capabilities. This document
    describes a proposal named Cooperating Layered Architecture for SDN. The idea
    behind that is to differentiate the control functions associated to transport
    from those related to services, in such a way that they can be provided and maintained
    independently, and can follow their own evolution path.</p>"
