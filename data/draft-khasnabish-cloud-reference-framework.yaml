abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a cloud reference framework that intends to
    provide a basis for designing interoperable cloud services and their integration
    into existing open Internet and enterprise IT infrastructures. In general, a cloud-based
    system utilizes virtualized computing / communications / storage resources and
    applications, and allows their combined provisioning as complex infrastructure
    services. In the emerging cloud-based virtualized infrastructures and services
    are provisioned on on-demand basis, and configured for specific customer needs
    or tasks. The reference framework is based on the survey of the SDOs and WGs that
    are focusing on cloud-based systems and services (Cloud SDO, I-D.Khasnabish-cloud-sdo-survey),
    on-going standardisation activities and other research and developments in the
    cloud computing technology area. Both intra-cloud and inter-cloud reference frameworks
    are presented and the requirements to the general functional layers and components
    are discussed.</p>"
