abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is in response to a request made by the Traffic Engineering
    Working Group for a set of traffic engineering practices from a sample of the
    ISP engineering community. It reflects the current traffic engineering principles
    and practices that Cable &amp; Wireless uses for its global 'packet' networks
    (including IP and MPLS) at the time of publication. It will also identify some
    of the history that has lead to the specific principles and practices as well
    as some of the trade-offs between these methods and other possible approaches.
    It is not intended to be a detailed engineering guide or 'how-to' document.</p>"
