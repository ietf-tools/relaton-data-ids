abstract:
- content: "<p>CPEs are designed to provide IP connectivity to home networks. Most
    CPEs assign IP addresses to the nodes of the home network which makes it a good
    candidate for hosting the naming service. With IPv6, the naming service makes
    nodes reachable from the home network as well as from the Internet. However, CPEs
    have not been designed to host such a naming service exposed on the Internet.
    This may expose the CPEs to resource exhaustion which would make the home network
    unreachable, and most probably would also affect the home network inner communications.
    In addition, DNSSEC management and configuration may not be well understood or
    mastered by regular end users. Misconfiguration may also results in naming service
    disruption, thus these end users may prefer to rely on third party naming providers.
    This document describes a homenet naming architecture where the CPEs manage the
    DNS zone associates to its home network, and outsources the naming service and
    eventually the DNSSEC management on the Internet to a third party designated as
    the Public Authoritative Servers.</p>"
