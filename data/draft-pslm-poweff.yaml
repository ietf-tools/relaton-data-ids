abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a device YANG "dashboard" data model that allows
    devices to report which power measurement and control functions they offer. This
    basic YANG model is applicable to any kind of device, regardless of whether the
    device itself has any support for YANG-based management interfaces or not. The
    YANG model simply allows a device to describe what it can report, and which interfaces
    are available to request this data. Devices that lack any on-board YANG-based
    management interfaces provide this information in the form of a YANG instance
    data file. This file may be readable from an on-board web server on the device,
    or hosted anywhere else.</p>
