abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology provides an efficient
    memory-to-memory data path across a network. This draft addresses the requirements
    that an RDMA provider must satisfy to meet the needs of the NFS protocol and its
    implementations. It is a companion to the NFS RDMA Problem Statement which presents
    a case for applying RDMA technology to the NFS protocol.</p>"
