abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension block that may be used with the
    Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol. This Metadata Extension Block
    is designed to carry additional information that DTN nodes can use to make processing
    decisions regarding bundles, such as deciding whether to store a bundle or determining
    to which nodes to forward a bundle. The metadata that is carried in a metadata
    block must be formatted according to the metadata type that is identified in the
    block's metadata type field. One specific metadata type, for carrying URIs as
    metadata, is defined in this document. Other metadata types may be defined in
    separate documents. This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking
    Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication
    as an RFC were raised. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
