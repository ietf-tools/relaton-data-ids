abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function for
    packets with variable lengths. Through dynamically changing the length of BFD
    packets, it can detect both traditional faults such as link failure or route fault,
    as well as non-forwarding problem for packets with a length in a special range,
    which maybe caused by equipment's internal defects.</p>"
