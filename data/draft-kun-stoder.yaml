abstract:
- content: "<p>Spurious timeouts are not rare events in wireless wide-area network,
    e.g. GPRS or EDGE. It has been reported that spurious timeouts greatly decrease
    TCP's performance in many aspects. It is not only because of the unnecessary retransmission
    of the last window of data, but also the congestion control is falsely triggered.
    Existing proposals of detecting spurious timeouts either require additional information
    on each data packet, e.g., the timestamps option, or heuristically deduce spurious
    timeouts. These approaches need heuristic feedbacks from the receiver, and hence
    are vulnerable to misbehaving receivers. In this document, a novel algorithm that
    reliably detects spurious TCP retransmission timeouts, called STODER, is presented.
    STODER is a TCP sender algorithm and does not require any information attached
    on data packets. STODER exploits TCP repacketization to detect false retransmission
    and is well protected against malicious receivers. Therefore, a more aggressive
    response algorithm can be safely applied along with the STODER algorithm.</p>"
