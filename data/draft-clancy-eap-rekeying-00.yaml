abstract:
- content: "<p>A technique for fast rekeying with EAP is described here. The actual
    implementation is specific to each EAP method, but in general a master session
    key can be evolved with each client association such that the authentication requires
    as many packets exchanges as a 'canned success'. The concept is explained, with
    a specific implementation described for EAP-TLS with 802.11i.</p>"
