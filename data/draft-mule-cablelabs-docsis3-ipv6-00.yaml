abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the draft requirements for IPv6
    support in the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications. Our goal is to share high-level
    IPv6 requirements and design architecture in draft status with the IETF community.
    We first introduce the main network elements involved in the support of IPv6 in
    DOCSIS cable networks and expand on the deployment scenarios in scope of the DOCSIS
    3.0 efforts. We elaborate on the roles played by some network elements in enabling
    IPv6 in DOCSIS: the broadband access device (Cable Modem), the headend or network
    side equipment (Cable Modem Termination System) and the various backoffice servers.
    Some high-level requirements are then summarized with a special focus on three
    network services: IPv6 provisioning and management of cable modems, IPv6 transport
    via a DOCSIS network using a cable modem acting as an IPv6 bridge or router, and
    IP multicast. Finally, we conclude with a theory of operations section to provide
    more details and sample flows on how an IPv6-capable cable modem acquires its
    IPv6 address and configuration parameters over a DOCSIS 3.0 network. CableLabs,
    its members, the vendors participating in the DOCSIS specifications and the co-authors
    of this document are seeking general feedback from the IETF community on the overall
    DOCSIS IPv6 approach. The level of requirements provided in this document may
    vary; we also welcome feedback on where more details should be provided in future
    versions.</p>"
