abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts are often connected by multiple paths, but TCP restricts communications
    to a single path per transport connection. Resource usage within the network would
    be more efficient were these multiple paths able to be used concurrently. This
    should enhance user experience through improved resilience to network failure
    and higher throughput. This document outlines architectural guidelines for the
    development of a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how these architectural
    components come together in the development of a Multipath TCP (MPTCP). This document
    lists certain high-level design decisions that provide foundations for the design
    of the MPTCP protocol, based upon these architectural requirements. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
