abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a QoS PIF MIB (Quality-of-Service Programming-Interface
    Management-Information-Base) to be used as an SNMP-based programming interface
    for routers. This MIB is intended to be a programming interface for router QoS
    functions, especially DiffServ-related [RFC2475] functions including packet scheduling
    (queuing), dropping, and metering that must be modular and concisely described.
    Traffic-conditioning rules and metering rules for DiffServ-related functions are
    defined modularly by using 'virtual flow labels' and exclusive conditions in rules,
    and new classifications for packet-scheduling and packet-dropping functions are
    introduced. This document focuses on satisfying the requirements on programming
    interfaces or programming languages for router control. Thus, the focus is different
    from that of DiffServ MIB [DSMIB] or QoS PIB [QoSPIB].</p>"
