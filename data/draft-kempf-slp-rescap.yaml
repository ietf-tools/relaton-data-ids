abstract:
- content: "<p>The danger in defining a new protocol specifically for discovering
    resources on the Internet is that, like DNS, the protocol would probably be deployed
    internally as well. Developers would then have the opportunity to use the protocol
    to perform service discovery on the client side by downloading resources and inferencing
    over them rather than using protocols such as Service Location Protocol (SLP)
    or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) that inference on the server side.
    Besides the increased amount of network traffic involved in transferring attributes
    rather than the smaller query, every client would need to incorporate its own
    inferencing code. In this document, we discuss how the requirements for wide area
    resource discovery can be met by slightly modifying SLP to remove features more
    appropriate for internal networks and by establishing a few naming conventions.
    An added benefit of this design is that Internet clients can perform service discovery
    as well as simple resource discovery. It should be noted the proposals in this
    document are not meant to suggest that SLP is the only or even the best candidate
    for Internet resource discovery among existing protocols. The point of this paper
    is to emphasize the need for a concerted effort to make an existing discovery
    or directory services protocol fill the Internet resource discovery niche, rather
    than inventing yet another protocol offering discovery or directory services capabilites.</p>"
