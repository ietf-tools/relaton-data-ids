abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the objectives and requirements of flow aggregation
    in scaling networks and proposes a scheme by aggregating DetNet flows based on
    DetNet flow-specific classification in enhanced DetNet, and suggests the flow
    identification of aggregated-class be used to indicate the required treatment
    and forwarding behaviors. Toward the end, the draft discusses how the novel flow
    aggregation scheme could be applied to realize the flow aggregation in a 5GS logical
    DetNet node participating in enhanced DetNet.</p>"
