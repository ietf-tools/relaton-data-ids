abstract:
- content: "<p>The exploration of latency correlation patterns is of great significance
    for characterizing network states. However, existing measurement approaches have
    to confront multiple challenges in detecting latency correlation factors, such
    as probing speed, routing hops and geographical locations. In this paper, we conduct
    three tasks to handle these issues. The first is to construct relative latency
    measurement strategies for individual machines without any time synchronization
    and control plane requirements. The probing speed has been increased by 14.3%
    in the same hardware conditions. In 4G/5G heterogeneous edges enabled by different
    mobile operators, worldwide 5003 target servers are selected to acquire more than
    1TB network datasets. The second is to reveal the potential modes between latency
    and routing hops. Surprisingly, 91.2% available targets present non-positive characteristics
    in extreme cases. The third is to analyze the fine-grained relationship between
    latency and geographical locations. We found that the significance of mean backward
    receiving delay is higher than other parameters, with a maximum of 33%. Finally,
    we also made optimizations regarding latency compression and time accuracy in
    multipath networks. The experimental data have been released to an open-source
    community for further investigations.</p>"
