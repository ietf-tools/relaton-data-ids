abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when one
    signing operation is split between two cooperating parties. When performing split
    signing, the first party typically hashes the data to be signed and the second
    party signs the hashed data computed by the first party. This can be useful when
    communication with the party holding the signing private key occurs over a limited-bandwidth
    channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in which it is infeasible
    to send the complete set of data to be signed. The resulting signatures are identical
    in structure to those computed by a single party, and can be verified using the
    same verification algorithm without additional steps to preprocess the signed
    data.</p>"
