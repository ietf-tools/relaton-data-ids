abstract:
- content: "<p>As users' traffic faces more unpredictable attacks during transmission,
    there are more and more end-users now need high security data transmission guarantee,
    they need ISPs to provide security protection capabilities on the data forwarding
    path. Therefore, ISPs need to have real-time awareness of the security capabilities
    available in the network, then form a security capability map, finally provide
    security protection for users at the routing level. The goal of this draft is
    to collect the security capabilities of nodes, which will be one of the factors
    to form the routing topology, and use the routing programming capabilities to
    form a secure routing path. The security capability includes healthy information(such
    as the device software is up-to-date), security service information, device information(such
    as the manufacturer information of the equipment). The BGP-LS protocol is extended
    to carry the security capabilities of the node. The controller collects topology
    information, forms a topology path with security capabilities according to security
    requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending to execute node forwarding through
    programming.</p>"
