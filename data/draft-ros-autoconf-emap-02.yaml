abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile Ad Hoc Networks need an auto-configuration protocol being able
    to satisfy their self-deployment requirements while remaining flexible enough
    to accommodate special features for different devices. The Extensible Manet Auto-configuration
    Protocol (EMAP) tries to fullfil these requirements both for IPv4 and IPv6 mobile
    ad hoc networks. It provides auto-configuration mechanisms for isolated as well
    as hybrid MANETs, and is envisioned to be integrated within unicast routing protocols
    (like DYMO [1] or OLSRv2 [2]). EMAP allows nodes to create a (highly likely) unique
    IP address which can be used locally inside the MANET. In a similar way, nodes
    can auto-configure globally routable IP addresses when one (or more) gateways
    to the Internet are present in the network. The general framework provided by
    the protocol may be used as a service discovery protocol for MANETs. As an example,
    this document also specifies an optional feature which consists on the discovery
    of DNS servers reachable from the MANET. However, the approach is extensible to
    other services like SIP proxies, authentication entities, etc. Therefore, EMAP
    has been designed taking into consideration the possibility of extending it later
    on with new features, uses, and optimizations.</p>"
