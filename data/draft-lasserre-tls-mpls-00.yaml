abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transparent virtual LAN service (VLS) solution
    over MPLS, sometimes known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). VLS simulates an
    Ethernet virtual 802.1d bridge [6] [7] for a given set of users. It delivers a
    layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet
    MAC addresses that is closed to a given set of users. Many VLS services can be
    supported from a single PE node.</p>"
