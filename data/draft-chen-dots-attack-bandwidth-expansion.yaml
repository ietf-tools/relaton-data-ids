abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a DDoS Mitigation Request parameter used in
    the Signal Channel request, as an expansion of the signal channel for mitigating
    DDoS attack accurately with target-bandwidth. The proposed parameter will help
    to choose the appropriate mitigator or mitigators for mitigation, When An attack
    occurs that is greater than the maximum clean capability, this paramter can decide
    to be blackhole directly or to be drainaged for clean.</p>"
