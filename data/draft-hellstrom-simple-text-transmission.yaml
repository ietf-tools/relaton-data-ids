abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes conventions for exchange and presentation of text
    in SIP sessions through the Message Session Relay Protocol MSRP. It covers two
    different methods for taking the initiative to transmit. These methods are timer
    initiated real-time text and user requested en-bloc transmission in Messaging.
    The document gives specific guidance on handling of text presentation and presentation
    control of conversational sessions. It specifies how the capability to conduct
    MSRP sessions with real-time text is declared so that session negotiation can
    make decisions on what transport protocol to use and how to route the calls to
    get the desired support for text communication.</p>"
