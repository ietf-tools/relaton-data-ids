abstract:
- content: "<p>This document briefly outlines current approaches to indexing and searching,
    proposes some experimental mechanisms which might be deployed within HTTP [1]
    in support of these activities, and concludes with a discussion of the issues
    raised. The key features which are seen as desirable are a standardized way of
    providing a local search capability on the information being made available by
    an HTTP server, and a way of reducing both the bandwidth consumed by indexing
    agents and the amount of work done by HTTP servers during the indexing process.</p>"
