    to control the network resource and enhance network performance. The answer for
    this is Traffic Engineering. It is derived through the effort in MPLS wg. But
    current, the concept of Traffic Engineering seems to be limited to a few keywords,
    namely load balancing and restoration. The aim of this document is to enhance
    the concept of traffic engineering and point out some aspects of what it is capable
    of. The goal of this document is accomplished if this document could enlighten
