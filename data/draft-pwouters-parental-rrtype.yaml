abstract:
- content: <p>This document updates the DNS Parameters' Resource Record (RR) TYPEs
    registry by adding a field denotating "Parental RRtype" that instructs DNS name
    servers to store or query RRtypes that have this new field set at the parent side
    of a delegation instead of at the child side. These DNS protocol rules match those
    already in use for the Delegation Signer (DS) RRtype. It additonally reserves
    a small part of the "Reserved for future use" allocation space in the RRtype registry
    to mark a group of RRtypes values to have this new flag set. The goal of this
    document is to provide a general facility that future RRtypes can use without
    requiring to wait a period of many years for DNS implementations and deployments
    before these type of new RRtype become usable in practise. It is similar in goal
    to the support of Unknown DNS RRtypes as specified in RFC 3597. This document
    updates [many things which we should figure out].</p>
