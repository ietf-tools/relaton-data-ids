abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes to add mutual authentication, based on a human-memorizable
    password, to the basic, unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The proposed
    algorithm is called the Password-Authenticated Key (PAK) exchange. PAK allows
    two parties to authenticate themselves while performing the Diffie-Hellman exchange.
    The protocol is secure against all passive and active attacks. In particular,
    it does not allow either type of attacker to obtain any information that would
    enable an offline dictionary attack on the password. PAK provides Forward Secrecy.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
