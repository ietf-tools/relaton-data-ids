abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that
    rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network
    access, the need for a standard credentials provisioning layer is paramount. In
    particular, since EAP is deployed for authentication needs, the authors extend
    this use-case by including support for provisioning and management of credentials.
    In particular, this specification defines how to support the provisioning of strong
    credentials to users and/or devices without the need for providing IP connectivity.
    The use of EAP not only for provisiong but also for managing network credentials
    provides a general conduit that can be exploited in different environments (e.g.,
    Wired and WiFi networks credentials management).</p>"
