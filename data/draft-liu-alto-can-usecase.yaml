abstract:
- content: "<p>The ever-emerging new services are imposing more and more highly demanding
    requirements on the network. In order to meet these requirements, some new technology
    trends of network emerge as the times require. On the one hand, for the selection
    of service node and forwarding path, in addition to considering the network topology
    and link state, more factors are also considered, such as the computing properties
    of service node; On the other hand, network and application present the trend
    of mutual perception, including application to perceive the state of network path,
    or network to perceive the demand of application. This draft describes a new network
    scenario and architecture considering computational properties, and assumes that
    Alto could be used as an important node to realize the deployment of services,
    and to assist in the selection of service nodes.</p>"
