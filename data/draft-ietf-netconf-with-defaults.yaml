abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defines ways to read and
    edit configuration data from a NETCONF server. In some cases, part of this data
    may not be set by the NETCONF client, but rather a default value known to the
    server is used instead. In many situations the NETCONF client has a priori knowledge
    about default data, so the NETCONF server does not need to save it in a NETCONF
    configuration datastore or send it to the client in a retrieval operation reply.
    In other situations the NETCONF client will need this data from the server. Not
    all server implementations treat this default data the same way. This document
    defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows the NETCONF
    client to identify how defaults are processed by the server, and also defines
    new mechanisms for client control of server processing of default data. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
