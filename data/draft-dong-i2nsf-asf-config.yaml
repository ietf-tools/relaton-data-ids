abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines a network security function (NSF-) facing interface
    of the security controller for the purpose of configuring some advanced security
    functions. These advanced security functions include antivirus, anti-ddos, and
    intrusion prevention system (IPS). The interface is presented in a YANG data model
    fashion and can be used to deploy a large amount of NSF blocks that all support
    above mentioned functions in the software defined network (SDN) based paradigm.</p>"
