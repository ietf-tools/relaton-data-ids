abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a proposal for exchanging EPP (Extensible Provisioning
    Protocol) messages as XML documents between a client and a server via SOAP (Simple
    Object Access Protocol), using the SOAP request/response communication model.
    An EPP message is encapsulated in the SOAP Body, while the EPP session information
    is encoded in the SOAP header, enabling EPP session-oriented messaging over the
    SOAP protocol. It is designed to work on top of any transport bindings defined
    for SOAP, taking advantage of the variety of SOAP software tools and environments
    available for web services.</p>"
