abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the Source-Specific Multicast
    (SSM) service model which supports source-based multicast trees across multiple
    domains in the Internet. SSM realizes components of the EXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast
    service model in which there is a single source for every multicast channel, and
    channel membership is based on the unique combination of multicast group address
    (G) as well as the source's unicast address (S). End-hosts use version 3 of the
    IGMP protocol (IGMPv3) to register their interest in a particular source-group
    (S,G) pair. The PIM-SM protocol is then used to construct the multicast forwarding
    tree rooted at the source S. This document is intended as a starting point for
    implementing and deploying SSM services. It provides a brief architectural overview
    of SSM described in more detail in [HOLBOO] and describes associated deployment
    challenges. It summarizes changes to protocols and applications both at end-hosts
    and routers, with pointers to more detailed documents, wherever appropriate. Issues
    of interoperability with the current multicast architecture are also discussed.</p>"
