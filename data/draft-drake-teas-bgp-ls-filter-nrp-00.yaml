abstract:
- content: "<p>Future networks that support advanced services, such as those enabled
    by 5G mobile networks, envision a set of overlay networks each with different
    performance and scaling properties. These overlays are known as network slices
    and are realized over a common underlay network. In the context of IETF technologies,
    they are known as IETF network slices. In order to support IETF network slicing,
    as well as to offer enhanced VPN services in general, it is necessary to define
    a mechanism by which specific resources (buffers, queues, scheduling policies,
    etc.) of specific network topology components (links and/or nodes) of an underlay
    network can be used by a specific network slice, VPN, or set of VPNs. These collections
    of resources are known as Network Resource Partitions (NRPs). This document sets
    out such a mechanism for use of BGP-LS to construct and operate NRPs in Segment
    Routing networks.</p>"
