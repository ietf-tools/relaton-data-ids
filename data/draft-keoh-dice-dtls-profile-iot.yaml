abstract:
- content: "<p>This document collects various implementation challenges of DTLS on
    embedded systems, and proposes a profile of DTLS for CoAP-based Internet of Things
    (IoT) applications. Specially, this document investigate the application features
    and functionality of DTLS protocol, the fragmentation issue of DTLS Handshake
    protocol, and the complexity of the DTLS Handshake state machine. A RESTful DTLS
    Handshake which relies on CoAP Block-wise Transfer is proposed to address the
    fragmentation issue. The next step is to define a DTLS profile for embedded systems.</p>"
