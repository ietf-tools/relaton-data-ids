abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines a schema, object classes, and attributes, for
    Printers and print services, for use with directories that support the Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510). This document is based on the Printer attributes
    listed in Appendix E of "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics"
    (RFC 2911). Additional Printer attributes are based on definitions in "Printer
    MIB v2" (RFC 3805), "PWG Command Set Format for IEEE 1284 Device ID v1.0" (PWG
    5107.2), "IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (JPS3)" (PWG 5100.13), and "IPP
    Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14). This memo is an Independent Submission to the RFC Editor
    by the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer
    Working Group (PWG), as part of their PWG "IPP Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14) project
    for secure mobile printing with vendor-neutral Client software. This document
    obsoletes RFC 3712.</p>'
