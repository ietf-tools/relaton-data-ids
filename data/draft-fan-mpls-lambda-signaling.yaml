abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time optical path setup is a fundamental requirement for agile
    optical networks and signaling is a mechanism to achieve automatic fast path setup.
    Our objective is to define extensions to both CR- LDP and RSVP-TE that address
    this requirement. CR-LDP and RSVP-TE are defined in [CR-LDP] and [RSVP], respectively,
    for path setup within a MPLS domain. In this draft, we specify mechanisms, TLVs
    and Objects required to support Optical Label Switched Path setup.</p>"
