abstract:
- content: "<p>We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed to assess
    if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet a predefined Target Transport
    Performance by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths.
    The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to critical infrastructure,
    such as network interconnections or even individual devices, to accurately detect
    if any part of the infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting
    the Target Transport Performance. Model Based Metrics rely on peer-reviewed mathematical
    models to specify a Targeted Suite of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to assess
    whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet a predetermined Target
    Transport Performance over an Internet path. For Bulk Transport Capacity, the
    IP diagnostics are built on test streams that mimic TCP over the complete path
    and statistical criteria for evaluating the packet transfer statistics of those
    streams. The temporal structure of the test stream (bursts, etc) mimic TCP or
    other transport protocol carrying bulk data over a long path. However they are
    constructed to be independent of the details of the subpath under test, end systems
    or applications. Likewise the success criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics
    of the subpath against criteria determined by protocol performance models applied
    to the Target Transport Performance of the complete path. The success criteria
    also does not depend on the details of the subpath, end systems or application.
    Model Based Metrics exhibit several important new properties not present in other
    Bulk Transport Capacity Metrics, including the ability to reason about concatenated
    or overlapping subpaths. The results are vantage independent which is critical
    for supporting independent validation of tests by comparing results from multiple
    measurement points. This document does not define the IP diagnostic tests, but
    provides a framework for designing suites of IP diagnostic tests that are tailored
    to confirming that infrastructure can meet the predetermined Target Transport
    Performance.</p>"
