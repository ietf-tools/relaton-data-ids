abstract:
- content: "<p>As each global IPv4 address will be shared among more and more customers,
    and as more and more NATs will be deployed in ISP infrastructures, the lack of
    end-to-end transparency and the limited scalability of some NATs are likely to
    cause increasing difficulties to customers and to ISPs. This document introduces
    IPv4-IPv6 coexistence scenarios where IPv4 addresses are shared with good scalability
    and, in favorable configurations, with full IPv4 end-to- end transparency. For
    this, the key tool is the Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) of draft-despres-SAM-00,
    with in particular its extended IPv4 addressing (IPv4E) in which port prefixes
    are used as IPv4 address extensions. For each considered scenario, Static Address
    Mappers (SAMs) are deployed at scenario specific places.</p>"
