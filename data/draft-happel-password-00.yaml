abstract:
- content: "<p>User security has been compromised at many visited web sites due to
    the wide variety of password construction requirements being presented to Internet
    users. One single, flexible, password construction requirement accepted throughout
    the global Internet community would promote web site user security by establishing
    a construct, wherein any user established password would be universally acceptable
    to any web site contacted.</p>"
