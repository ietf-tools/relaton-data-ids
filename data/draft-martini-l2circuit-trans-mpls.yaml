abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes methods for transporting the Protocol Data Units
    (PDUs) of layer 2 protocols such as Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
    Adaption Layer 5 (AAL5), and Ethernet, and for providing a Synchronized Optical
    Network (SONET) circuit emulation service across an MPLS network. This document
    describes the so-called "draft-martini" protocol, which has since been superseded
    by the Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge Working Group specifications described
    in RFC 4447 and related documents. This memo defines a Historic Document for the
    Internet community.</p>
