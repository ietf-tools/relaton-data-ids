abstract:
- content: "<p>Many people believe that any LSA once flooded throughout the OSPF area
    can be monitored on all OSPF routers in the area. This is not always true, and
    a malicious OSPF router that pretends to be legal may want to, and be able to,
    hide malicious LSAs. This document proposes the modifications to OSPF specification
    to prevent hiding the malicious LSAs, and to make LSDB monitoring more successful
    (hence, secure).</p>"
