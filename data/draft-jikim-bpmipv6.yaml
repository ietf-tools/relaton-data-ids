abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an enhanced handover scheme on the Proxy Mobile
    IPv6 (PMIPv6) with bicasting for IP handover (B-PMIPv6). In B- PMIPv6, a mobile
    node (MN) performs binding update to Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in advance, and
    then the LMA begins the bicasting of data packets to the new Mobile Access Gateway
    (N-MAG) as well as the previous MAG (P-MAG). The B-PMIPv6 minimizes the possible
    packet losses and handover latency during handover.</p>"
