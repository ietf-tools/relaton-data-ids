abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an optional Quick-Start mechanism for transport
    protocols, in cooperation with routers, to determine an allowed sending rate at
    the start and, at times, in the middle of a data transfer (e.g., after an idle
    period). While Quick-Start is designed to be used by a range of transport protocols,
    in this document we only specify its use with TCP. Quick-Start is designed to
    allow connections to use higher sending rates when there is significant unused
    bandwidth along the path, and the sender and all of the routers along the path
    approve the Quick-Start Request. This document describes many paths where Quick-Start
    Requests would not be approved. These paths include all paths containing routers,
    IP tunnels, MPLS paths, and the like that do not support Quick- Start. These paths
    also include paths with routers or middleboxes that drop packets containing IP
    options. Quick-Start Requests could be difficult to approve over paths that include
    multi-access layer- two networks. This document also describes environments where
    the Quick-Start process could fail with false positives, with the sender incorrectly
    assuming that the Quick-Start Request had been approved by all of the routers
    along the path. As a result of these concerns, and as a result of the difficulties
    and seeming absence of motivation for routers, such as core routers to deploy
    Quick-Start, Quick-Start is being proposed as a mechanism that could be of use
    in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate
    for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
