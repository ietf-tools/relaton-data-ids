abstract:
- content: "<p>The SCIM 2.0 Core API defines a simple profile for searching for specific
    resource types using filters and qualifiers in combination with the HTTP GET verb.
    The Token Search specification defines the following additional features: o Specification
    of search terms within an HTTP POST verb to avoid accidental leakage of confidential
    information via HTTP GET URLs, o An optional result set token enabling clients
    to page through results in a state consistent fashion, and o The ability to search
    across multiple resource types (endpoints) and return one or more resource types.</p>"
