abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a post-quantum public-key algorithm extension
    for the OpenPGP protocol. Given the generally assumed threat of a cryptographically
    relevant quantum computer, this extension provides a basis for long-term secure
    OpenPGP signatures and ciphertexts. Specifically, it defines composite public-key
    encryption based on ML- KEM (formerly CRYSTALS-Kyber), composite public-key signatures
    based on ML-DSA (formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium), both in combination with elliptic
    curve cryptography, and SLH-DSA (formerly SPHINCS+) as a standalone public key
    signature scheme.</p>"
