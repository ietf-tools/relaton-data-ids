abstract:
- content: "<p>During RSVP-TE graceful restart (GR), the LSR communicates with its
    directly connected neighbors to synchronize LSP state to recover from control
    plane failure conditions. However, when the LSP has undergone a Fast Re-route
    (FRR), the directly connected neighbor of the Point of Local Repair (PLR) or Merge
    Point (MP) could be down. The FRR condition of the LSP could exist for a substantial
    period of time. During this period the network is vulnerable to traffic loss if
    control plane experiences a failure on the PLR or MP. This draft describes a mechanism
    to extend RSVP- TE GR to work under conditions where FRR has occurred.</p>"
