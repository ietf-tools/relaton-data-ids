abstract:
- content: '<p>With the rapid evolution of the aerospace industry, many "NewSpace"
    upstarts are actively deploying their mega-constellations in low Earth orbits
    (LEO) and building integrated space and terrestrial networks (ISTN), promising
    to provide pervasive, low-latency, and high-throughput Internet service globally.
    Due to the high manufacturing, launching, and updating cost of LEO mega- constellations,
    it is expected that ISTNs can be well designed and evaluated before the launch
    of satellites. However, the progress of designing, assessing, and understanding
    new network functionalities and protocols for futuristic ISTNs faces a substantial
    obstacle: lack of standardized evaluation methodology with acceptable realism,
    flexibility, and cost that can involve the unique dynamic behaviors of ISTNs.
    This memo first reviews the unique characteristics of LEO mega-constellations.
    Further, it analyzes the limitation of existing network evaluation and analysis
    methodologies under ISTN environments. Finally, it outlines the key requirements
    of future evaluation methodology tailored for ISTNs.</p>'
