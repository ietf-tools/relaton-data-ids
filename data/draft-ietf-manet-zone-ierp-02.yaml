abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Interzone Routing Protocol (IERP), the
    reactive routing component of the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP). IERP adapts existing
    reactive routing protocol implementations to take advantage of the known topology
    of each node's surrounding R-hop neighborhood (routing zone), provided by the
    Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP). The availability of routing zone routes allows
    IERP to suppress route queries for local destinations. When a global route discovery
    is required, the routing zone based bordercast service can be used to efficiently
    guide route queries outward, rather than blindly relaying queries from neighbor
    to neighbor. Once a route has been discovered, IERP can use routing zones to automatically
    redirect data around failed links. Similarly, suboptimal route segments can be
    identified and traffic re-routed along shorter paths.</p>"
