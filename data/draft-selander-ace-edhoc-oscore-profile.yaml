abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework. It utilizes Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
    Over COSE (EDHOC) for achieving mutual authentication between an OAuth 2.0 Client
    and Resource Server, and it binds an authentication credential of the Client to
    an OAuth 2.0 access token. EDHOC also establishes an Object Security for Constrained
    RESTful Environments (OSCORE) Security Context, which is used to secure communications
    when accessing protected resources according to the authorization information
    indicated in the access token. A resource-constrained server can use this profile
    to delegate management of authorization information to a trusted host with less
    severe limitations regarding processing power and memory.</p>"
