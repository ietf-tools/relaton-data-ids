abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Crededentials on the Internet often JSON Web Token (JWT) and
    CBOR Web Token (CWT), which depends on third parties to certify the keys used.
    This document improves on that situation by enabling the administrators of domain
    names to specify the keys used in that domain's digital credentials. This is accomplished
    by describing how to discover thumbprints for proof-of-possession keys, as described
    in RFC 7800 and RFC 8747, using TLSA Records as described in RFC 6698. This approach
    can be leveraged to develop revocation and assurance capabilities for digital
    credentials.</p>"
