abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new mechanism to represent inverse address
    mapping in the Domain Name System (DNS) for IP version 6 (IPv6). Documented in
    here are the changes needed for securing the binding and delegation of address
    ranges, to facilitate queries for the binding of address to host name. This document
    also defines a mechanism for dumb resolvers to query directly for the binding.
    The changes include a new resource record to delegate the address space in segments
    based on arbitrary bit boundaries. This proposal provides a mechanism that is
    self checking and can be traversed from both top and bottom. Additional processing
    requirements on IPv6 aware resolvers and servers are defined.</p>"
