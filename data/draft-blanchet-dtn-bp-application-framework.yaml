abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Bundle Protocol specifications define the syntax of service
    identifiers but do not identify how to make them interoperable. For example, there
    are currently no way to map a service identifier to a specific Bundle payload
    format for an application agent. This document proposes an application framework
    enabling interoperable implementations and deployments of the Bundle Protocol.
    It also creates a service identifier registry for the Bundle Protocol. Warning:
    this draft was initially done in 2012 against RFC5050 in DTNRG; some parts may
    need to be updated.</p>"
