abstract:
- content: "<p>Location Generators cannot always provide exact measures of particular
    locations. Instead, they estimate the location of objects. More precisely, they
    use filters to aggregate noisy sensor data and to calculate probability density
    distributions of estimated positions. In location tracking applications, typically
    Kalman-type, Gaussian-Sum, and Particle Filters are used. We believe that it is
    reasonable to use the outputs of those filters to describe a location estimate
    and its uncertainty, because they are the natural result of location tracking
    algorithms. In addition, the results of those filters can be feed into sensor
    fusion and decision making engines easily. Geometric representations such as polygons
    or ellipses might be demanded by an application. The output of filters can be
    converted to those application demanded shapes. However, these conversions come
    at the loss of precision and are not well understood scientifically. Thus, we
    think that transmitting filter results is a solution that is easier to implement.
    In this draft, we present a transmission format for PIDF-LO, which is based on
    the output of Kalman-type, Gaussian-Sum, and Particle Filters.</p>"
