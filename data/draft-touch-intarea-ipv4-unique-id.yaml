abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation and reassembly,
    and as currently specified is required to be unique within the maximum lifetime
    on all IP packets. If enforced, this uniqueness requirement would limit all connections
    to 6.4 Mbps. Because this is obviously not the case, it is clear that existing
    systems violate the current specification. This document updates the specification
    of the IP ID field to more closely reflect current practice and to more closely
    match IPv6, so that the field is defined only when a packet is actually fragmented
    and that fragmentation occurs only at originating hosts or their equivalent. When
    fragmentation occurs, this document recommends that the ID field be unique within
    the reordering context, rather than an arbitrary, unenforced upper bound on packet
    lifetime.</p>"
