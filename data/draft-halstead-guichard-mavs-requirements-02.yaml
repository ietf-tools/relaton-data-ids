abstract:
- content: "<p>This document complements [RFC-4031] and defines requirements that
    are specific to the delivery of BGP/MPLS-based [RFC-4364] VPN services across
    multiple administrative domains. These requirements are independent of underlying
    technologies or the number of Autonomous Systems such VPNs may span. It lists
    the requirements of the different parties that are involved in the administration
    of these Autonomous Systems and may therefore be involved in the delivery of the
    VPN service offerings.</p>"
