abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains our observation on the usability of IODEF [RFC5070],
    based on our experiments. We aim at developing an IODEF- capable incident response
    management systems in order to facilitate incident response activities. We started
    to design and implement the system for our university CERT, however, there are
    several technical issues while implementing and operating the system. This document
    shares the observation from our proto-type implementation and provides new sight
    from operational aspects.</p>"
