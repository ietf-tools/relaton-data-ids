abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [Hinden, 1998] defines the 'IPv4-mapped
    IPv6 address.' These addresses are used in the IPv6 basic API [Gilligan, 1999]
    to denote IPv4 addresses using AF_INET6 sockets. These addresses are used in protocol
    proposals such as SIIT [Nordmark, 2000] to denote IPv6 communication using AF_INET6
    sockets. Therefore, IPv4-mapped addresses have two different meanings, and they
    are not distinguishable from the user-land applications. This draft discusses
    security threats due to this ambiguity of IPv4-mapped address. It also discusses
    threats due to the additional complexities introduced by IPv4-mapped addresses.
    Finally, it proposes to resolve these problems by forbidding protocols from using
    IPv4-mapped addresses for IPv6 communications.</p>"
