abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown
    to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed networks, wireless
    technologies such as 3GPP and WiFi, long distance satellite links) and also in
    conflict with the needed, more isochronous, behaviors of VoIP, gaming, and videoconferencing
    traffic. Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes
    that significantly differ from the IETF's congestion control principles. Using
    these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications
    to both the traffic using the new congestion control and to traffic using the
    currently standardized congestion control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed with
    caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals. The goal of
    this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control
    algorithms within the IETF.</p>"
