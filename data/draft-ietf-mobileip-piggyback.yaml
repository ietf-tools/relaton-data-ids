abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies operations to allow inclusion of data along
    with a mobility header (from Mobile IPv6) containing a Binding Update or Binding
    Acknowledgement message. In this way, smoother handovers and reduced jitter and
    bandwidth utilization can be achieved. Interactions with IPsec-based verification
    of mobility messages are described; basically, establishment of such IPsec-based
    methods preclude the use of the mobility header specified in this document, unless
    simple modifications to IPsec (outside the scope of this document) can be utilized.</p>"
