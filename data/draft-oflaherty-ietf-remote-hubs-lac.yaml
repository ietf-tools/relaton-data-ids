abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes experiences and lessons learnt organizing remote
    sessions for working group meetings in Latin America. The main objective is to
    engage people in the IETF through small and informal meetings with people that
    share common interests. At the same time, remote participation for those already
    active in the IETF is more attractive and they help with IETF outreach sharing
    their experiences with newcomers. The local meetings are called remote IETF Working
    Group Hubs.</p>"
