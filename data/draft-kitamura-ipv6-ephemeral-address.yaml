abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new address type that is called "Ephemeral
    Addresses". Ephemeral Addresses are designed to be used as clients' source addresses
    of TCP / UDP sessions. An idea Ephemeral Addresses is simple enough. They are
    achieved by deriving existing "ephemeral ports" specifications. In other words,
    they are achieved by naturally upgrading their concept from the port space to
    the address space. Since Ephemeral Addresses functions are implemented only in
    the kernel side of the OS, we can use the Ephemeral Addresses functions in current
    exiting enormous client applications without modifying them. Ephemeral Addresses
    functions can contribute to various types of security enhancements that include
    privacy protections etc.</p>
