abstract:
- content: "<p>As the scale of MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs has grown, various implementation
    recommendations have been proposed to manage control plane state. However, the
    forwarding plane footprint of labels at a transit LSR has remained proportional
    to the total LSP state in the control plane. This draft defines a mechanism to
    prevent the label space limit on an LSR from being a constraint to control plane
    scaling on that node. It introduces the notion of pre-installed per TE link 'pop
    labels' that are shared by MPLS RSVP-TE LSPs that traverse these links and thus
    significantly reducing the forwarding plane state required. This couples the feature
    benefits of the RSVP-TE control plane with the simplicity of the Segment Routing
    MPLS forwarding plane. This document also introduces the ability to mix different
    types of label operations along the path of the LSP, thereby allowing the ingress
    or an external controller to influence how to optimally place a LSP.</p>"
