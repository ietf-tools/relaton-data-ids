abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call
    control requirements that support communication with direct transcoding capability.
    Several solutions are addressed for transcoding service. Direct transcoding requires
    two kinds of requirements: the service requirement and call control requirement.
    Service requirement is no constraint of codec adaptation and interoperability
    of models. Call control requirement is exchange of codec information and minimizing
    of call set up delay. The model might be applied to general-purpose services satisfying
    the requirements of multimedia applications without an additional INVITE.</p>"
