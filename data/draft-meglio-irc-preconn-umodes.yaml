abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC2812 introduced the ability to set certain usermodes before connection
    has occurred via a simple extension to the USER command. However, this implementation
    is believed to be excessively limiting. The RFC2812 implementation only allows
    a limited number of modes (+i and +w) to be set. Modern IRC servers provide many
    more modes and a method is necessary to set these modes at the pre-connection
    stage. Therefore, this specification introduces a method to allow users to set
    arbitrary usermodes at the pre-connection stage while maintaining backward compatibility
    with RFC2812.</p>"
