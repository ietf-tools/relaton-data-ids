abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF defines three different kinds of authentication schemes: Null
    authentication, simple password and cryptographic authentication. The cryptographic
    authentication scheme can make use of various cryptographic algorithms in order
    to authenticate the OSPF packets. To ensure interoperability between disparate
    implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
    to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have
    available. This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
    to be used for the cryptographic authentication for OSPF as well as specifying
    the algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory
    at some future time.</p>"
