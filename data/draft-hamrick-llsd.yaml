- content: "<p>This document describes the Linden Lab Structured Data (LLSD) abstract
    type system, interface description and serialization formats. LLSD is a language-neutral
    facility for maintaining and transporting structured data. It provides dynamic
    data features for loosely-coupled collections of software components, even in
    statically-typed languages. LLSD includes an abstract type system, an interface
    description language (LLIDL) and three canonical serialization schemes (XML, JSON
    and Binary).</p>"
