abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of considerations and strategies to use
    in increasing the character repertoire available in a protocol element or suite
    of protocol elements. This document is not meant to provide normative instruction
    to protocol designers, but does hope to provide guidance on common issues arising
    from this task. This initial draft does not contain real-world examples for the
    different strategies outlined below; before final publication, the IAB plans to
    add such examples and solicits feedback from the community on examples appropriate
    to this draft. Feedback on this point or the draft as a whole should be sent to
    the editors or the IAB.</p>"
