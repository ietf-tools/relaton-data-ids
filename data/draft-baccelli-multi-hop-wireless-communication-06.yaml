abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some characteristics of communication between
    nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network. These are not requirements in the
    sense usually understood as applying to formulation of a requirements document.
    Nevertheless, protocol engineers and system analysts involved with designing solutions
    for ad hoc networks must maintain awareness of these characteristics.</p>"
