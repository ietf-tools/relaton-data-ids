abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter protocol provides Authentication, Authorization and Accounting
    for network access technologies, such as NASREQ, ROAMOPS and Mobile IP. This extension
    describes how accounting records can be securely transmitted over the Diameter
    protocol. When combined with the Strong Security extension, accounting records
    MAY traverse intermediate proxies in a secure fashion and is compatible with the
    referral broker model. This extension allows real-time accounting transfers.</p>"
