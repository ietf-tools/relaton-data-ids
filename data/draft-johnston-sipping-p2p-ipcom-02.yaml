abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft discusses issues related to the application of peer to peer
    (P2P) technologies to SIP in particular, and Internet communications in general.
    After an analysis of the P2P and non-P2P capabilities of SIP, this draft proposes
    that a P2P protocol be standardized in the IETF as a protocol used between a Registrar/
    Proxy/Redirect server and a Location Service. This allows the operator of a Registrar
    to decide how much registration state is be This draft discusses issues related

    a P2P protocol be standardized in the IETF as a protocol used between a Registrar/
    Proxy/Redirect server and a Location Service. This allows the operator of a Registrar
    to decide how much registration state is be stored locally and how much can be
    distributed using the P2P network to a distributed Location Server. A number of
    DHT (Distributed Hash Table) P2P protocols that solve some similar functions are
    given as examples and could be used as input to this work. Finally, existing SIP
    and P2P work is surveyed with respect to this proposal.</p>"
