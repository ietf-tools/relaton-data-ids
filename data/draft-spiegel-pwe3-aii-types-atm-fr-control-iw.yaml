abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes work in progress in the MFA Forum on ATM and
    Frame Relay to MPLS Control Plane Interworking. Two specifications are being defined,
    one for client-server interworking (between two client network endpoints that
    communicate across an IP/MPLS network) and one for SPVC interworking (from a client
    network endpoint to an IP/MPLS network endpoint). Both client-server interworking
    and SPVC Interworking use standard PWE3 control for establishment of the pseudowires
    that transport the ATM or Frame Relay data connections across the IP/MPLS network.
    New AII type codepoints from the "Expert Review" range are requested. The need
    for these codepoints and proposed usage is described.</p>
