abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how a Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) performs a planned rollover of its key pair.
    This document also notes the implications of this key rollover procedure for relying
    parties (RPs). In general, RPs are expected to maintain a local cache of the objects
    that have been published in the RPKI repository, and thus the way in which a CA
    performs key rollover impacts RPs. This memo documents an Internet Best Current
    Practice.</p>"
