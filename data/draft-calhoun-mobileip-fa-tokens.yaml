abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAA requirements,
    which currently supports a Key Distribution Center (KDC) model that issues temporary
    session keys for use between the mobility nodes. In order to support real-time
    traffic, the Mobile IP architecture also requires that hand-off be done in a quick
    and efficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents to retrieve
    the session keys from the AAA infrastructure.</p>"
