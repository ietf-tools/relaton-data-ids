abstract:
- content: <p>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), holders of IP address
    space can become a Certification Authority (CA), optionally hosting their repository.
    They can also delegate (part of) their resources to subordinate CAs, who in turn
    may do the same. This CA hierarchy forms a tree structure. Relying Party (RP)
    software walks this tree and determines the current valid objects. An underlying
    assumption is that this tree is a reasonable size, and that the information can
    be processed within reasonable time. This assumption is not guaranteed to hold.
    This document describes two new extensions, "maxDescendants" and "maxVrps", that
    add constraints for use in RP processing that ensure this assumption holds.</p>
