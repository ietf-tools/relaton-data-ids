abstract:
- content: "<p>IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to 232.255.255.255)
    range are designated as source-specific multicast (SSM) destination addresses
    and are reserved for use by source-specific applications and protocols. For IP
    version 6 (IPv6), the address prefix FF3x::/32 is reserved for source-specific
    multicast use. This document defines an extension to the Internet network service
    that applies to datagrams sent to SSM addresses and defines the host and router
    requirements to support this extension. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
