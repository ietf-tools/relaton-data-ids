abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more of today's devices are multi-homing capable, in particular
    3GPP user equipment like smartphones. In the current standardization of the next
    upcoming mobile network generation 5G Rel. 16, this is especially targeted in
    the study group Access Traffic Steering Switching Splitting [3GPP, TR 23.793].
    ATSSS describes the flexible selection or combination of 3GPP untrusted access
    like Wi-Fi and cellular access, overcoming the single-access limitation of today's
    devices and services. Another multi- connectivity scenario is the Hybrid Access
    [draft-lhwxz-hybrid- access-network-architecture, draft-muley-network-based-bonding-
    hybrid-access], providing multiple access for CPEs, which extends the traditional
    way of single access connectivity at home to dual- connectivity over 3GPP and
    fixed access. A missing piece in the ATSSS and Hybrid Access is the access and
    path measurement for efficient and beneficial traffic steering decisions. This
    becomes particularly important in heterogeneous access networks with a multitude
    of volatile access paths. MP-TCP can be employed in such scenarios and concerning
    the ATSSS, it is the agreed protocol for the traffic splitting mode. A decision
    for MP-TCP though leaves the increasing share of UDP in today's traffic mix (https://arxiv.org/
    abs/1801.05168) unconsidered. In this document, a network architecture leveraging
    the MP-DCCP network protocol is proposed, which enables above scenarios and address
    the formulated issues either independent or complementary to MP-TCP.</p>"
