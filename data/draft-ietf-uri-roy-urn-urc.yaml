abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the author would implement Uniform Resource
    Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs), such that the basic
    concepts and technology can be usable by today's World-Wide Web clients and servers.
    It is intended to identify the key ingredients which make the WWW extensible and
    open to the introduction of URNs and URCs, and thereby steer the implementors
    of URI technology toward more consistent solutions.</p>"
