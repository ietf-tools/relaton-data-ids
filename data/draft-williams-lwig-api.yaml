abstract:
- content: <p>This document takes a look at various aspects of Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) used in embedded sensors and controller applications such as
    IP Smart Objects and IP based Wireless Sensor Networks. These devices may be interconnected
    via many different types of media, including 802.15.4 (lowpans), power line control
    (PLC), RS485, but the common characteristic is that the devices have extremely
    limited code space and memory space for both the stack and application. Just as
    there is no one single API for IP networking stacks today (though the "Berkeley
    sockets" might be considered de- facto standard) there is not likely to be a single
    standard in the embedded space, but there can be some common understanding about
    facilities that can and should be provided to the application developer.</p>
