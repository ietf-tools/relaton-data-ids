abstract:
- content: "<p>This document updates RFC 2710, and it specifies Version 2 of the ulticast
    Listener Discovery Protocol (MLDv2). MLD is used by an IPv6 router to discover
    the presence of multicast listeners on directly attached links, and to discover
    which multicast addresses are of interest to those neighboring nodes. MLDv2 is
    designed to be interoperable with MLDv1. MLDv2 adds the ability for a node to
    report interest in listening to packets with a particular multicast address only
    from specific source addresses or from all sources except for specific source
    addresses. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
