abstract:
- content: "<p>Gateway-Initiated Dual-Stack Lite (GI-DS-Lite) is a variant of Dual-
    Stack Lite (DS-Lite) applicable to certain tunnel-based access architectures.
    GI-DS-Lite extends existing access tunnels beyond the access gateway to an IPv4-IPv4
    NAT using softwires with an embedded Context Identifier that uniquely identifies
    the end-system to which the tunneled packets belong. The access gateway determines
    which portion of the traffic requires NAT using local policies and sends/ receives
    this portion to/from this softwire. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
