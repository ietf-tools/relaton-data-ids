abstract:
- content: <p>QUIC uses Retry packets to reduce load on stressed servers, by forcing
    the client to prove ownership of its address before the server commits state.
    QUIC also has an anti-tampering mechanism to prevent the unauthorized injection
    of Retry packets into a connection. However, a server operator may want to offload
    production of Retry packets to an anti-Denial-of-Service agent or hardware accelerator.
    "Retry Offload" is a mechanism for coordination between a server and an external
    generator of Retry packets that can succeed despite the anti-tampering mechanism.</p>
