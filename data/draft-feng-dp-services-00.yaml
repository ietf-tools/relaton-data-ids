abstract:
- content: "<p>Drop preference has been proposed as a possible means for providing
    differentiated services in the Internet. Used as a parameter in a PHB group, drop
    preference can provide weighted bandwidth sharing amongst flows and flow aggregates
    of a PHB group. This memo documents a number of services which can be implemented
    using either a single drop preference PHB setting or multiple drop preference
    settings.</p>"
