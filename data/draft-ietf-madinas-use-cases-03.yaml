abstract:
- content: "<p>To limit the privacy and security issues created by the association
    between a device, its traffic, its location and its user, client vendors have
    started implementing MAC address rotation. When such rotation happens, some in-network
    states may break, which may affect network efficiency and the user experience.
    At the same time, devices may continue sending other stable identifiers, defeating
    the MAC rotation purposes. This document lists various network environments and
    a set of functional network services that may be affected by such rotation. This
    document then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network
    state disruption, and settings where other machine identifiers may help re- identify
    the user or recover the identity of the user, and locate the device and its associated
    user. Last, this document examines solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving
    user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</p>"
