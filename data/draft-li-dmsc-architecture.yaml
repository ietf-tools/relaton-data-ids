abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a novel communication architecture, called Distributed
    Micro Service Communication architecture (DMSC). It includes multiple aspects
    of microservice communication, such as service registration, service discovery,
    service routing, service scheduling, and more, Which to achieve all the essential
    functionalities provided by current centralized service networks. By incorporating
    content-semantic communication, DMSC significantly enhances the performance, scalability,
    and reliability of microservice communication. It provides a robust architecture
    for managing the complex communication requirements of distributed microservices,
    ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore,
    DMSC provides a reference direction for the transition of the service mesh infrastructure
    from a location-based model to a content- and service-centric paradigm.</p>"
