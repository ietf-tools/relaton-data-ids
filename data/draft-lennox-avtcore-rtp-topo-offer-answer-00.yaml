abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses a number of considerations related to the topologies
    of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions initated using the Session Description
    (SDP) unicast Offer/Answer Model, especially as applied to source-multiplexed
    sessions. The primary observation is that certain topologies cannot be created
    by unicast SDP Offer/Answer. Notably, the it is not possible to negotiate the
    topology that RFC 5117 calls Topo-Transport-Translator (or "relay"). As a consequence
    of this limitation, certain topological assumptions can safely be made for RTP
    sessions initiated using unicast SDP Offer/Answer; and therefore, certain optimizations
    to RTP are possible in such sessions. This document also describes the optimizations
    that these assumptions make possible.</p>
