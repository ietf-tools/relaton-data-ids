abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a general authentication
    protocol that supports multiple authentication methods and typically runs directly
    over data link layers without requiring IP. EAP can be used for different types
    of authentication, where multiple providers provide different services. However,
    EAP itself does not have the ability to differentiate between multiple EAP conversations
    between a peer and an authenticator. This document specifies the 3GPP2 Generic
    EAP Encapsulation (GEE) protocol for differentiating between multiple EAP conversations
    between a peer and an authenticator.</p>"
