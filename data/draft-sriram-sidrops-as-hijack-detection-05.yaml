abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a method for detection and mitigation of AS
    hijacking. In this mechanism, an AS operator registers a new object in the RPKI
    called 'ROAs Exist for All Prefixes (REAP)'. REAP is digitally signed using the
    AS holder's certificate. By registering a REAP object, the AS operator is declaring
    that they have Route Origin Authorization (ROA) coverage for all prefixes originated
    by their AS. A receiving AS will mark a route as Invalid if the prefix is not
    covered by any Validated ROA Payload (VRP) and the route origin AS has signed
    a REAP. Here Invalid means that the route is determined to be an AS hijack.</p>"
