abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the service-specific implementation and requirements
    for Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) of TDM circuits using SONET/SDH
    payload formats. This draft extends SONET/SDH SPE emulation proposal [CEP-SPE],
    providing SONET VT1.5/2/3/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2 circuit emulation. This draft also
    provides bandwidth saving modes for SONET STS-1 and SDH VC-3/4 carrying tributaries
    or asynchronous T3/E3 signals. This proposal is optimized for VT level cross connect
    applications, for PDH to SONET/SDH emulation and for carrying PDH circuits across
    a PSN. The applicability statement for TDM circuit emulation (PDH and SONET/SDH)
    is described in [TDM-APP]. This draft discusses the emulation of these circuits
    over packet networks using IP or MPLS.</p>"
