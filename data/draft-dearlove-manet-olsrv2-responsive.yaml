abstract:
- content: <p>This specification indicates circumstances in which the sending of am
    unscheduled TC message by an OLSRv2 router is recommended or required rather than
    optional. It is motivated by the possible responsive use of OLSRv2 in a mostly
    stable network. The cases in which the message sending would be required are limited
    to such cases, and would require administrative configuration to establish such
    a network. This specification updates RFC 7181 "The Optimized Link State Routing
    Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)".</p>
