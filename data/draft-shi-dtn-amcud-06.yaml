abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with the unpredictable
    disruption problem and congestion control problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks
    (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] provides
    retransmission-based reliability for bundles, several times of retransmissions
    can be seen as a failure occurred over links. The proposed mechanism is used to
    direct the following packets to other nodes as soon as the selected path is detected
    as disruption or congestion and probes the availability of the links which has
    disrupted unexpectedly.</p>"
