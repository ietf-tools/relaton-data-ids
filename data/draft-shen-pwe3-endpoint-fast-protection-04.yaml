abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires
    (PWs) against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment circuit failure,
    egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE failure, and multi-segment
    PW switching PE failure. Designed on the basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy,
    upstream label assignment and context specific label switching, the mechanism
    enables local repair to be performed by a router upstream adjacent to a failure.
    In particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds,
    by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel.
    Therefore, the mechanism can reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to
    the failure and the network converges on the topology changes due to the failure.</p>"
