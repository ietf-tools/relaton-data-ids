abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been discussion within the IETF IPv6 community for some time
    regarding whether or not to define Centrally Assigned Unique Local Addresses (ULA-Cs).
    Although many arguments both for and against the definition of ULA-Cs have been
    raised and repeated, our discussions have not resulted in consensus about whether
    or not to define this new address type. This document will summarize the arguments
    for and against the allocation of ULA-Cs, in an attempt to help the IETF IPv6
    community reach a decision on this issue.</p>"
