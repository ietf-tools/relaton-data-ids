abstract:
- content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming
    whereby a mobile node (1) gets assigned prefixes by the local mobility anchor
    which are associated with an interface of a mobile node and are managed by the
    PMIPv6 elements as a single IP mobility session, and (2) can connect to a Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for simultaneous access and get
    assigned a different set of prefix(es) per interface, since being each interface
    managed via an independent mobility session. However, PMIPv6 needs multihoming
    enhancements such that it needs the ability to instantiate additional IP mobility
    sessions associated with an already active interface or a secondary interface
    of the mobile node which has an established IP mobility session at a local mobility
    anchor (LMA), the ability to selectively share home network prefix(es) across
    access technology types, the ability to perform flow mobility tied to a subset
    of prefixes associated with an access technology to another access technology
    and extended support for multiple IP mobility sessions in a scenario where multiple
    interfaces of the mobile node are connected to a single mobile access gateway
    (MAG). This memo highlights such required enhancements to PMIPv6 multihoming with
    respect to improved operations and extended applicability to different deployment
    scenarios.</p>"
