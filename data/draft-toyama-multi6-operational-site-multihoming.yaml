abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an operational solution of IPv6 mulithoming.
    This approach is that a group of providers administrates cooperatively one prefix
    and one autonomous system number (ASN) for only their multihoming customers; each
    multihomed customer is assigned a longer prefix, such as /48, but only address
    block of /32 allocated by RIR is advertised through the providers of the group
    to the global IPv6 Internet. This approach does not need allocation of provider-independent
    address block to each customer who needs multihomed network, and therefore saves
    IPv6 address space.</p>"
