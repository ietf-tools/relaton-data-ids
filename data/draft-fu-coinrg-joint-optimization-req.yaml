abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of edge computing, there is a trend that computing
    is widely deployed in network rather than at other end of network, and provides
    services at nearer location. With the deep integration of network, traditional
    optimization and scheduling within network domain is not enough, the endpoint
    of the path matters a lot. So the relationship between computing and network are
    new and important topics to be studied. This document focus on the requirements
    of computing and network joint optimization and scheduling based on the newly
    arising service requirements.</p>"
