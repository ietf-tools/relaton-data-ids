abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines metrics to evaluate whether a network has maintained
    packet order on a packet-by-packet basis. It provides motivations for the new
    metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including the context information
    required for all metrics. The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then
    uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in
    several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design. Additional
    metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate
    occurrences. We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering
    effects on TCP. Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics
    are included. An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with
    packet fragmentation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
