abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success
    in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive,
    IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions,
    but it also has been extended to better fit the specificities of the different
    use cases. For Internet addressing in particular, as it is defined in RFC 791
    for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist many extensions. Those
    extensions have been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities beyond the
    basic properties of Internet addressing. This discusses the properties the IP
    addressing model, showcasing the continuing need to extend it and the methods
    used for doing so. The most important aspect of the analysis and discussion in
    this document is that it represents a snapshot of the discussion that took place
    in the IETF (on various mailing lists and several meetings) in the early 2020s.
    While the community did not converge on specific actions to be taken, the content
    of this document may nonetheless be of use at some point in the future should
    the community decide so.</p>"
