abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies additional cryptographic attributes for signaling
    additional Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) cryptographic context information
    via the Session Description Protocol (SDP) in alongside those defined by RFC4568.
    The SDP extension defined in this document address situations where the receiver
    needs to quickly and robustly synchronize with a given sender. The mechanism also
    enhances SRTP operation in cases where there is a risk of losing sender-receiver
    synchronization.</p>"
