- content: "<p>This paper describes a design for multicast that is simple to understand
    and low enough overhead for routers that a single scheme can work both within
    and between domains. It also eliminates the need for coordinated multicast address
    allocation across the Internet. It is not very different from the tree-based schemes
    CBT, PIM-SM, and BGMP. Essentially all of the mechanisms to support this have
    already been implemented in the other designs. The contribution of this protocol
    is in what is NOT required to be implemented. The main idea for simplifying multicast
    is to consider the identity of a group to be the 8-byte combination of a</p>"
