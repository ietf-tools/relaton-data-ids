abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an alternative service architecture for user-
    centric control of the sharing of resources, such as personal data, using the
    decentralized peer-to-peer computing paradigm. The term 'control' is used here
    to denote the full capacity of the user to freely select (i) the entities with
    whom to share resources (e.g. data), and (ii) the entities which provide services
    implementing user-controlled resource sharing. The peer-to-peer service architecture
    uses a set of computing nodes called OAuth2.0 Nodes (ON) that are part of a peer-to-peer
    network as the basis for the decentralized service architecture. Each OAuth2.0
    Nodes is assumed to have the capability to provide AS-services, RS-services and
    Client-services.</p>"
