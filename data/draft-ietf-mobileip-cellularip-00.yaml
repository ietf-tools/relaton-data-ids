abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagrams
    to a mobile host. The protocol is intended to provide local mobility and handoff
    support. It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to provide wide area mobility support.
    Four fundamental design principles of the protocol are: (1) location information
    is stored in distributed data bases (2) location information referring to a mobile
    host is created and updated by regular IP datagrams originated by the said mobile
    host (3) location information is stored as soft state (4) location management
    for idle mobile hosts is separated from location management of hosts that are
    actively transmitting or receiving data.</p>"
