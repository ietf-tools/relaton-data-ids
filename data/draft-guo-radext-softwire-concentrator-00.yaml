abstract:
- content: "<p>6rd and DS-Lite are two most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and
    IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co- existing period.
    Both mechanisms need to configure the softwire concentrator information on the
    host. In many networks, the information may be stored in AAA servers while user
    configuration is mainly through DHC protocol. This document defines several RADIUS
    attributes that carries softwire concentrator information.</p>"
