abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies protocol interfaces profiled by the United
    States National Security Agency (NSA) for National Security System (NSS) servers
    that provide public key certificates, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), and
    symmetric keys to NSS clients. Servers that support these interfaces are referred
    to as Secure Object Delivery Protocol (SODP) servers. The intended audience for
    this profile comprises developers of client devices that will obtain key management
    services from NSA-operated SODP servers. Interfaces supported by SODP servers
    include Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) and its extensions as well as Certificate
    Management over CMS (CMC). This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration,
    and operation of all components of US National Security Systems (SP 800-59). It
    is also appropriate for other US Government systems that process high-value information.
    It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and
    any other system deployments.</p>"
