abstract:
- content: "<p>In large-scale deterministic networks (LDN), App-flows need to span
    multiple deterministic network domains, and the latency in multiple domains is
    added together. The jitter will be increased. In order to realize the protection
    service function, App-flows should be transmitted on multiple paths. The delay
    difference in data transmission on different paths is no different from jitter
    in end- to-end services. Jitter generated by various factors needs to be reduced
    to meet business requirements. This document describes the end-to-end jitter reduction
    mechanism in an LDN. This mechanism can effectively control the end-to-end jitter
    to meet specific business needs and make the planning of multiple paths for service
    protection more flexible.</p>"
