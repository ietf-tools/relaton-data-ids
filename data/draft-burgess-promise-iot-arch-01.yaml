abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes architectural recommendations for a unified concept
    of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, based on tried and tested principles
    from infrastructure science. We describe a functional service architecture that
    may be applied in the manner of a platform, from the smallest scale to the largest
    scale, using vendor agnostic principles. The current draft is rooted in the principles
    of Promise Theory[Bergstra1] and voluntary cooperation.</p>"
