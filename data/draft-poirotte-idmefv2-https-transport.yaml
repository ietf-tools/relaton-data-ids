abstract:
- content: "<p>The Incident Detection Message Exchange Format version 2 (IDMEFv2)
    provides a way to describe any incidents detected on cyber and/or physical infrastructures.
    The format is agnostic so it can be used in standalone or combined cyber (SIEM),
    physical (PSIM) and availability (NMS) monitoring systems. IDMEFv2 can also be
    used to describe cyber and physical potential threats (CTI/PTI). IDMEF improves
    situational awareness by facilitating correlation of multiple types of events
    using the same base format thus enabling efficient detection of complex and combined
    cyber and physical attacks on critical infrastructures. If approved this document
    would obsolete RFC4767.</p>"
