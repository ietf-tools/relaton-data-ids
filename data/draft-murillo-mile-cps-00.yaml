abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft document will extend the Incident Object Description Exchange
    Format (IODEF) defined in [RFC5070] to support the reporting of incidents dealing
    with attacks to physical infrastructure through the utilization of IT means as
    a vehicle or as a tool. These systems might also be referred as Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), Operational Technology Systems, Industrial Control Systems, Automatic
    Control Systems, or simply Control Systems. These names are used interchangeably
    in this document. In this context, an incident is generally the result of a cybersecurity
    issue whose main goal is to affect the operation of a CPS. It is considered that
    any unauthorized alteration of the operation is always malign. This extension
    will provide the capability of embedding structured information, such as identifier-
    and XML-based information. In its current state, this document provides important
    considerations for further work in implementing Cyber-Physical System incident
    reports, either by utilizing any already existing industry formats (XML- encoded)
    and/or by utilizing atomic data. In addition, this document should provide appropriate
    material for helping making due considerations in making an appropriate decision
    on how a CPS reporting is done: 1) through a data format extension to the Incident
    Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070], 2) forming part of an already existing
    IODEF-extension for structured cybersecurity information (currently draft draft-ietf-mile-sci-11.txt),
    or others. While the format and contents of the present document fit more the
    earlier option, these can also be incorporated to the later.</p>"
