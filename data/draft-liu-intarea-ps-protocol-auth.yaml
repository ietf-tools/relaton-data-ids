abstract:
- content: "<p>Transport and application layer protocol provides end-to-end connectivity
    for clients and servers, but conveys limited or even no information to a middlebox,
    such as Policy and Charging Control (PCC) system, between the client and server.
    However, PCC needs to authenticate the client-server traffic so that it can perform
    the basic functionality, i.e., charging the client. Due to lack of traffic authentication
    capability in transport and application layer protocol, state-of-the-art PCC adopts
    Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to understand client-server communication and decide
    whether to charge a client. However, in this draft, we show that current transport
    layer protocol(TCP) and application layer(HTTP, TLS) protocol cannot meet the
    need of traffic authentication, i.e., the user can modify the packet and by pass
    the ISP PCC to have free ride. Due to the existence of the aforementioned free-riding
    attacks, we believe that Transport and application layer protocol needs to provide
    traffic authentication capability to a middlebox. In this draft, we describe free-riding
    attacks and present requirements for providing traffic authentication.</p>"
