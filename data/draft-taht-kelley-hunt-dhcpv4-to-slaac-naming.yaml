abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a technique for using the hostname acquired from
    a DHCPv4 client request to publish AAAA records on that domain name for public
    IPv6 addresses acquired by the same dual-stack host using SLAAC. On dual-stack
    networks, there is a need to automatically publish entries in the DNS for the
    public IPv6 addresses of an IPv6 host when it does not use DHCPv6. IPv6 hosts
    can acquire IPv6 addresses using SLAAC, but there is no mechanism allowing them
    to register a name in the DNS database other than a DNS update, which would create
    a very difficult key management problem. By combining the DHCPv4 hostname or client
    FQDN option with information acquired using ICMPv6, a lightweight DHCPv4 server
    on a home gateway or SOHO gateway can automatically publish AAAA records for such
    hosts.</p>"
