abstract:
- content: "<p>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Canonical Name (CNAME) is a persistent
    transport-level identifier for an RTP endpoint. While the Synchronization Source
    (SSRC) identifier of an RTP endpoint may change if a collision is detected, or
    when the RTP application is restarted, the CNAME is meant to stay unchanged, so
    that RTP endpoints can be uniquely identified and associated with their RTP media
    streams. For proper functionality, CNAMEs should be unique within the participants
    of an RTP session. However, the existing guidelines for choosing the RTCP CNAME
    provided in the RTP standard are insufficient to achieve this uniqueness. This
    memo updates these guidelines to allow endpoints to choose unique CNAMEs.</p>"
