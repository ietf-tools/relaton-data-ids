abstract:
- content: "<p>Once a L2TP session is established, the current standard [RFC 2661]
    has no explicit mechanism to update the session characteristics, during the life
    of the session, between the L2TP tunnel endpoints. One such requirement for this
    mechanism is, LNS informing LAC about the PPP-user's service characteristics,
    so that user-specific service actions can be applied at LAC. Eg: DSCP marking.
    There is a need for additional messages that will address similar requirements.
    Two additional messages are defined in this draft for this.</p>"
