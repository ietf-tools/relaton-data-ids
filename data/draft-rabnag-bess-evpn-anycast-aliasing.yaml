abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) all-active multi-
    homing procedures in Network Virtualization Over Layer-3 (NVO3) networks provide
    the required Split Horizon filtering, Designated Forwarder Election and Aliasing
    functions that the network needs in order to handle the traffic to and from the
    multi-homed CE in an efficent way. In particular, the Aliasing function addresses
    the load balacing of unicast packets from remote Network Virtualization Edge (NVE)
    devices to the NVEs that are multi-homed to the same CE, irrespective of the learning
    of the CE's MAC/IP information on the NVEs. This document describes an optional
    optimization of the EVPN multi-homing Aliasing function - EVPN Anycast Aliasing
    - that is specific to the use of EVPN with NVO3 tunnels (i.e., IP tunnels) and,
    in typical Data Center designs, may provide savings in terms of data plane and
    control plane resources in the routers.</p>"
