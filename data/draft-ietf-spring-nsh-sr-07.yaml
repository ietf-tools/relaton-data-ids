abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the integration of Network Service Header (NSH)
    and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to support Service
    Function Chaining (SFC) in an efficient manner while maintaining separation of
    the service and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.
    Combining these technologies allows SR to be used for steering packets between
    Service Function Forwarders (SFF) along a given Service Function Path (SFP) while
    NSH has the responsibility for maintaining the integrity of the service plane,
    the SFC instance context, and any associated metadata. The integration described
    in this document demonstrates that NSH and SR can work jointly and complement
    each other leaving the network operator with the flexibility to use whichever
    transport technology makes sense in specific areas of their network infrastructure,
    and still maintain an end-to-end service plane using NSH.</p>"
