abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the specification of Xcast6 (Explicit Multi-
    unicast (Xcast) for IPv6), a new multicast scheme with complementary scaling properties:
    Xcast supports a very large number of small multicast sessions. Xcast achieves
    this by explicitly encoding the list of destinations in the data packets, instead
    of using a multicast group address. The difference from the experimental specification
    which is described in [5058] is that this version eliminates Hop-by-Hop header
    which sometimes suffers hardware router.</p>"
