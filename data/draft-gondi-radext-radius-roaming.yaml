abstract:
- content: "<p>The functionalities of radius server can be extended to provide new
    types of services for the users in Wireless and cellular network. Traditionally
    Radius servers are limited to authentication, access and accounting, there are
    few researchers proposing new extensions to provide new functionalities for radius
    server in wireless and cellular networks. In this draft we are proposing to extend
    the functionalities of Radius to extend it to roaming and handover support for
    the mobile terminals. Using this mechanism the mobile terminal initially gets
    access to the network and then when there is a possibility of handover and roaming
    with the other access networks, mobile terminal communicates with the home radius
    server and creates the pre authentication information. In this process different
    mechanisms essential for roaming and handover are addressed such as Network Selection,
    Handover Initiation, Security Context Management, and Mobility Management. Using
    this mechanism the latency for handover and roaming can be reduced with higher
    level control mobility of the terminal during handover and roaming.</p>"
