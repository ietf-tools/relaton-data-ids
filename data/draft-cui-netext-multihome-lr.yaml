abstract:
- content: "<p>In basic PMIPv6[RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) should forward
    all traffic for the registered MN. Localized Routing (LR) for PMIPv6 proposed
    in [RFC6705] allows MN to exchange data directly by using localized forwarding
    or tunnel between the MAGs. But in some multi- access scenarios, it is apparently
    suboptimal. The present document proposes two localized routing mechanisms that
    are compatible with RFC 6705 for multi-access MNs which have some interfaces attached
    to the same MAGs.</p>"
