abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies methods to interconnect multiple TRILL (Transparent
    Interconnection of Lots of Links) sites with an intervening MPLS network using
    existing TRILL and VPLS (Virtual Private LAN Service) standards. This document
    addresses two problems: 1) providing connection between more than two TRILL sites
    that are separated by an MPLS provider network and 2) providing a single logical
    virtualized TRILL network for different tenants that are separated by an MPLS
    provider network.</p>"
