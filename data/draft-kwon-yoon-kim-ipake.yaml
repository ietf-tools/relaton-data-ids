abstract:
- content: "<p>Although password authentication is the most widespread user authentication
    method today, cryptographic protocols for mutual authentication and key agreement,
    i.e., password authenticated key exchange (PAKE), in particular authenticated
    key exchange (AKE) based on a password only, are not actively used in the real
    world. This document introduces a quite novel form of PAKE protocols that employ
    a particular concept of ID-based encryption (IBE). The resulting cryptographic
    protocol is the ID-based password authenticated key exchange (I-PAKE) protocol
    which is a secure and efficient PAKE protocol in both soft- and hard-augmented
    models. I-PAKE achieves the security goals of AKE, PAKE, and hard-augmented PAKE.
    I-PAKE also achieves the great efficiency by allowing the whole pre-computation
    of the ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public keys by both server and client.</p>"
