abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a Client Hint that aims to allow developers to
    opt-in to the ability to perform content negotiation based on the set of natural
    languages preferred by the user agent. This new mechanism is intended to improve
    upon the privacy properties of the "Accept- Language" header, and eventually to
    supplant it entirely.</p>
