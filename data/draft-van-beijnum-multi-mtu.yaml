abstract:
- content: "<p>In the early days of the internet, many different link types with many
    different maximum packet sizes were in use. For point-to-point or point-to-multipoint
    links, there are still some other link types (PPP, ATM, Packet over SONET), but
    multipoint subnets are now almost exclusively implemented as Ethernets. Even though
    the relevant standards mandate a 1500 byte maximum packet size for Ethernet, more
    and more Ethernet equipment is capable of handling packets bigger than 1500 bytes.
    However, since this capability isn't standardized, it is seldom used today, despite
    the potential performance benefits of using larger packets. This document specifies
    mechanisms to negotiate per-neighbor maximum packet sizes so that nodes on a multipoint
    subnet may use the maximum mutually supported packet size between them without
    being limited by nodes with smaller maximum sizes on the same subnet.</p>"
