abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a Filtering Policy Information Base, which
    is necessary for a filtering service in routers. The Filtering PIB allows service
    providers or operators to control user access to networks or services for both
    dial-in and always-on customers. The provisioning of the Filtering PIB is done
    by COPS-PR; some enhancements for COPS and COPS-PR are also described in this
    document.</p>"
