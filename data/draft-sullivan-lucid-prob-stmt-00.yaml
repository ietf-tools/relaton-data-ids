abstract:
- content: "<p>Internationalization techniques that the IETF has adopted depended
    on some assumptions about the way characters get added to Unicode. Some of those
    assumptions turn out not to have been true. Discussion is necessary to determine
    how the IETF should respond to the new understanding of how Unicode works.</p>"
