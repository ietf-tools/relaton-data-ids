abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an extension to the MLS protocol [RFC940] that
    improves its efficiency in terms of per-member download size. This comes at essentially
    no cost. In essence, this document defines a new message type called split commit
    which replaces regular MLS commits. Unlike regular commits, a split commit can
    be "split" by the Delivery Service (DS) into much smaller per-member commits,
    one for each receiving member. The size of a per-member commit is always logarithmic
    in the group size, while the size of a regular MLS commit can be linear. This
    extension works in settings with a DS that can do the splitting which can be demanding
    with encrypted MLS handshake messages. This is motivated by academic research
    [KKP22], [HKPPW22], [AHKM22].</p>
