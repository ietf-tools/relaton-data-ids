abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a growing number of people, on the Internet and elsewhere,
    that are interested in knowing when others are available, in order to communicate
    with them. A system that provides this information is known as Presence Service.
    Instant Messaging is the ability to communicate with someone in a rapid, conversational
    fashion. This usually involves short text messages, but it may be extended in
    different ways. This draft is a response to the efforts of the Instant Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (IMPP) group. It describes an architecture and protocols
    for Presence and Instant Messaging that meet the requirements of [RFC 2779]. This
    draft covers the basic functional modules needed to provide Presence and Instant
    Messaging services. It also provides the semantics for the interactions among
    this set of functional modules, along with the data format of the information
    exchanged.</p>"
