abstract:
- content: "<p>A SIP Back-To-Back User Agent (B2BUA) refers to the concatenation of
    a SIP User Agent Client (UAC) and a SIP User Agent Server (UAS). A transparent
    B2BUA is a particular type of B2BUA that forwards SIP messages in a SIP proxy-like
    way, and that also benefits from some features of a User Agent (UA) element. This
    document recommends best current practices for the implementation of such a transparent
    B2BUA. Developing transparent B2BUAs that meet this set of requirements will greatly
    increase the likelihood that SIP applications will function properly.</p>"
