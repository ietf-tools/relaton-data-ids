abstract:
- content: "<p>Emerging new services have new business characteristics, different
    from traditional C/S business model, whose most traffic is downstream traffic,
    more and more new business with gradually increasing upstream traffic have appeared,
    such as short videos, live sales etc,. Due to the new traffic characteristics
    of these services, more requirements have been put forward for the choice of network
    paths. In addition, emerging services also put forward new requirements for computing.
    Only selecting the network path or the service node cannot meet the stringent
    requirements. The perception of network paths and path selection also need to
    consider the characteristics of the service, and further need to coordinate the
    state of the network side and the service node side. The application of path-aware
    networking can assist the terminal to better perceive the network status, and
    also combine the status of the service node to achieve on-demand, more fine-grained
    path selection.</p>"
