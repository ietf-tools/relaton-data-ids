abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 Subnet Anycast is not used operationally, complicates implementations,
    and complicates protocol specifications. The form of anycast actually used in
    the Internet is routing-based, and is essentilly the same as that of IPv4 anycast.
    Therefore, this document deprecates IPv6 Subnet Anycast. This is an early draft
    and will require non-trivial fill-in and details.</p>"
