abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies CEQMM, a Complete and Efficient Quality of Service
    (QoS) Model for MANETs which combines the positive aspects of both IntServ and
    DiffServ. It uses a hybrid per-flow and per-class provisioning scheme. In such
    a scheme, traffic of highest priority is given per-flow provisioning while other
    priority classes are given per-class provisioning. To offer this scheme and to
    ensure that certain packets receive higher priority transmission than other packets,
    priority classifier, active queue management and packet scheduler are integrated.
    CEQMM applies the QOLSR protocol to support multiple-metric routing criteria and
    to respond quickly when changes in topology and/or QoS conditions are detected.
    Once a path is chosen for one QoS flow, CEQMM performs call admission control
    (CAC) at each intermediate node. For only QoS flows of highest priority, a node
    can precede to soft and later hard bandwidth reservation on links during the CAC
    process. CEQMM implements congestion avoidance mechanisms to prevent a network
    from entering the congested state. However, in MANETs, network congestion can
    still occur frequently under mobility. In order to prevent performance degradation
    due to mobility-triggered congestion, CEQMM uses congestion control scheme based
    on: (i) rated control of best-effort traffic, (ii) path selection for best-effort
    traffic, (iii) next hop maintaining for each QoS class (except the high-priority
    class), (iv) active queue management and (v) backoff timer method.</p>"
