abstract:
- content: <p>The non-DF of a Single-Active Ethernet Segment (SA-ES) can filter both
    unicast traffic and BUM traffic. In such case, when a specific Single-Active ES
    performs fast DF recovery, the corresponding revertive FRR switching should be
    performed on the ingress PEs that are not adjacent to this ES. This revertive
    FRR switching needs to be performed immediately after the A-D per EVI route with
    the "P=1" is received from the new DF node. In other words, the revertive FRR
    switching cannot perform the WTR procedures, otherwise unicast traffic will be
    dropped on the new NDF node during the WTR. In this draft, the SCT-EC is extended
    to the A-D per EVI routes, so that the ingress PEs can perform the revertive FRR
    switching based on the time specified by the SCT-EC for the non-adjacent ESes
    that support the fast DF recovery.</p>
