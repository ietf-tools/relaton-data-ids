abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures that enable a router to populate
    its Traffic Engineering Database (TED), with local addresses of other routers,
    that are not advertised in IS-IS TE extensions. The only addresses belonging to
    a router that are advertised in IS-IS TE LSAs are the router's local addresses
    on links enabled for TE and the Router ID. The described procedures enable a router
    to compute traffic engineered MPLS LSPs to a given router's loopback and non-TE
    capable interface addresses.</p>"
