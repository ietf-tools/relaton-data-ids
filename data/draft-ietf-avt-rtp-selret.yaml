abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes new RTP payload formats, i.e. RTX and SEL,
    to enable multiple and optional selective retransmissions in RTP. These are especially
    applicable to environments where enhanced RTCP- based feedback, as per the RTP/AVPF
    profile [4], is available. Using these payload formats it is possible to classify
    the media stream according to prioritisation of packets or according to the transmissions
    status of the packet ( i.e. transmission or retransmission). These payload formats
    can be tailored to fit different scenarios, with different requirements and where
    different solutions are needed. Typical scenarios are unicast transmission and
    small multicast groups. In this document we give examples how these payload formats
    can be used to accommodate different retransmission schemes.</p>"
