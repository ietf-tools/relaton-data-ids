abstract:
- content: '<p>This document is a survey of the filtering of content. The focus is
    on the human rights involved as cited in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights"
    which is one of the foundational documents for HRPC. The recent years have seen
    an increase in content filtering for a variety of reasons including to further
    the aims of governments who wish to maintain their rule and suppress dissent but
    also to enforce cultural norms, human rights and compliance with the law. Filters
    also exist for security (botnets, malware etc.), user-defined policies (parental
    control, corporate blocking of social networks during work time, etc.), spam control,
    upload of copyrighted material and other reasons. This document is based on several
    real world considerations: the existence of national and regional sovereignty,
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) that
    provide connectivity and content hosting services, Over- the-top (OTTs) and Content
    Delivery Platforms (CDPs) that play a disproportionate role in capturing the attention
    and "eyeballs" of many of the users of the Internet.</p>'
