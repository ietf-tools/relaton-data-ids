abstract:
- content: "<p>The Quick Mail Transfer Protocol (QMTP) is a replacement for the Simple
    Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). QMTP eliminates any need for end-of-line scanning
    between hosts with the same end-of-line convention. It features automatic pipelining
    and chunking, 8-bit transmission, prior declaration of the message size, and efficient
    batching. It is designed to be very easy to implement.</p>"
