    function for the Internet Protocol, and is the product of an ad hoc Internet 2
    working group meeting held August 25-27, 1997 hosted by Cisco Systems, Inc. This
    document is offered to the IP community for its consideration and comments. This
    document is organized as follows: Section 1 proposes a simple classification scheme
    to describe QoS models. Subsequent sections discuss requirements for Measurement,
    Administrative Policy, Provisioning Issues, Network Environment and Implementation
    Issues.</p>"
