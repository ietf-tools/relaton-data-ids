abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam
    and attach to different access networks without disrupting the ongoing sessions
    that nodes of the network may have. By extending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile
    Routers, nodes of the network are not required to support any kind of mobility,
    since packets must go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional
    tunnel. Communications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent,
    and therefore better paths may be available. Additionally, this solution adds
    packet overhead, due to the encapsulation. This document describes an approach
    to the Route Optimisation for NEMO, based on the well-known concept of Correspondent
    Router. The solution aims at meeting the currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation
    requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration. Based on
    the ideas that have been proposed in the past, as well as some other extensions,
    this document describes a Correspondent Router based solution, trying to identify
    the most important open issues. The main goal of this first version of the document
    is to describe an initial NEMO RO solution based on the deployment of Correspondent
    Routers and trigger the discussion within the MEXT WG about this kind of solution.
    This document (in an appendix) also analyses how a Correspondent Router based
    solution fits each of the currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements
    for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.</p>"
