abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the DNS security extensions (commonly called
    "DNSSEC") that are specified RFCs 4033, 4034, 4035, and a handful of others. One
    purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in one place so that the reader can understand
    the many aspects of DNSSEC. This document does not update any of those RFCs. Another
    purpose is to move DNSSEC to Best Current Practice status. This document is currently
    maintained at https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-hoffman-dnssec. Issues and
    pull requests are welcomed.</p>
