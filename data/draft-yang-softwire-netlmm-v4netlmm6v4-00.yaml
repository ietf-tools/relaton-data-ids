abstract:
- content: "<p>NETLMM6 may be widely deployed in the 3G network. But currently, most
    of the mobile hosts are IPv4 nodes without any Mobile IPv4/IPv6 stacks. This document
    proposes the solution to enable the IPv4 hosts to obtain the network connection
    and set up IPv4 sessions over NETLMM6 network. Extensions and option are added
    to proxy Mobile IPv6 allowing for single IPv4 stack hosts to access kind of IPv6
    network. The IPv4 Address could be maintained constantly in the domain of NETLMM6.</p>"
