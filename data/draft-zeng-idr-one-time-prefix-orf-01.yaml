abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP,
    termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which would allow a BGP
    speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh request with a set of address-prefix-based
    filters to make the peer re-advertise only the specific routes matching the filters
    to the speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to replay or recover some
    specific "problematic" routes without requiring its peer to re- advertise the
    whole Adj-RIB-Out of a specific address family, which makes the trouble shooting
    operation (such as packets tracking) more efficient and reduces the impact on
    network stability. This filter does not change the outbound route filters on BGP
    peers and should only be used for one-time filtering.</p>
