abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet mail defines the From: field to indicate the author of the
    message's content and the Sender: field to indicate who initially handled the
    message. The Sender: field is optional, if it has the same information as the
    From: field. That is, when the Sender: field is absent, the From: field has conflated
    semantics, as both a handling identifier and a content creator identifier. This
    was not a problem, until development of stringent protections on use of the From:
    field. It has prompted Mediators, such as mailing lists, to modify the From: field,
    to circumvent mail rejection caused by those protections. This affects end-to-end
    behavior of email, between the author and the final recipients, because mail from
    the same author is not treated the same, depending on what path it followed. In
    effect, the From: field has become dominated by its role as a handling identifier.
    The current specification augments the current use of the From: field, by specifying
    the Author: field, which identifies the original author of the message and is
    not subject to modification by Mediators.</p>"
