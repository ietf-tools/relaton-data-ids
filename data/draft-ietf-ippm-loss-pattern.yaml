abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet exhibits certain specific types of behavior (e.g., bursty
    packet loss) that can affect the performance seen by the users as well as the
    operators. The loss pattern or loss distribution is a key parameter that determines
    the performance observed by the users for certain real-time applications such
    as packet voice and video. For the same loss rate, two different loss distributions
    could potentially produce widely different perceptions of performance. Using the
    base loss metric defined in RFC 2680, this document defines two derived metrics
    'loss distance' and 'loss period', and the associated statistics that together
    capture loss patterns experienced by packet streams on the Internet.</p>"
