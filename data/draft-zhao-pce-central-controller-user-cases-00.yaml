abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain deployment networks deployment scenarios, service providers
    would like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS
    network while removing the complexity of existing signaling protocols such as
    LDP and RSVP-TE. In this document, we propose to use the PCE as a central controller
    so that LSP can be calculated/signaled/initiated/downloaded through a centralized
    PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging the existing
    PCE technologies as much as possible. This draft describes the user cases for
    using the PCE as the central controller where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded
    through extending the existing PCE architectures and extending the PCEP.</p>"
