abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication
    describes a mechanism with which a presence user agent is able to publish presence
    information to a presence agent. Using the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF),
    each presence publication contains full state, regardless of how much of that
    information has actually changed since the previous update. As a consequence,
    updating a sizeable presence document with small changes bears a considerable
    overhead and is therefore inefficient. Especially with low bandwidth and high
    latency links, this can constitute a considerable burden to the system. This memo
    defines a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constraints and increases
    transport efficiency by introducing a mechanism that allows for publication of
    partial presence information. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
