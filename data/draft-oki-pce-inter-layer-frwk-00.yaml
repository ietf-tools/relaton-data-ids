abstract:
- content: "<p>A network may comprise of multiple layers. It is important to globally
    optimize network resources utilization, taking into account all layers, rather
    than optimizing resource utilization at each layer independently. This allows
    better network efficiency to be achieved through a process that we call inter-layer
    traffic engineering. The Path Computation Element (PCE) can be a powerful tool
    to achieve inter-layer traffic engineering. This document describes a framework
    for the PCE-based path computation architecture to inter-layer MPLS and GMPLS
    traffic engineering. It provides suggestions for the deployment of PCE in support
    of multi-layer networks. This document also describes network models where PCE
    performs inter-layer traffic engineering, and the relationship between PCE and
    a functional component called the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM).</p>"
