abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes how a Virtual Private LAN (VPL) can be realized
    by setting up point-to-point tunnels from CE (Customer Edge) or CLE (Customer
    Located Equipment) to CE/CLE over a PSN, and bridging Ethernet traffic at the
    CE/CLE. Regardless of the access technology used (e.g. DSL or Ethernet) or the
    geographic distribution of CEs/CLEs, an end customer may use an emulated LAN service
    via an Ethernet interface, as long as the CEs/CLEs of the emulated LAN are reachable
    over the PSN. When used in conjunction with IPSec, the proposal allows secure
    transmission of Ethernet traffic, from one site to another site of a VPL, over
    the PSN.</p>"
