abstract:
- content: <p>This specification describes how to generate an authentication tag using
    the UMAC message authentication algorithm. UMAC is designed to be very fast to
    compute in software on contemporary uniprocessors. Measured speeds are as low
    as one cycle per byte. UMAC relies on addition of 32-bit and 64-bit numbers and
    multiplication of 32-bit numbers, operations well-supported by contemporary machines.
    To generate the authentication tag on a given message, a "universal" hash function
    is applied to the message and key to produce a short, fixed-length hash value,
    and this hash value is then xor'ed with a key-derived pseudorandom pad. UMAC enjoys
    a rigorous security analysis, and its only internal "cryptographic" component
    is a block cipher used to generate the pseudorandom pads and internal key material.
