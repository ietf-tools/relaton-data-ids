abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained devices have a limitation in adapting various general cryptography
    mechanisms since they have limited processing power, storage space and transmission
    capacities. Moreover, in an environment that has a large number of constrained
    devices, the device authentication and authorization procedure causes serious
    burdens. Therefore, this draft proposes a group authentication mechanism to solve
    existing problems.</p>"
