abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism providing database exchange and reliable
    transmission capabilities in a way which is adapted to link state routing on ad
    hoc networks. This mechanism is specified in this document for wireless OSPF interfaces
    as specified in draft- spagnolo-manet-ospf-wireless-interface-00.txt. A signature
    exchange technique is proposed, providing a very compact way for the nodes to
    communicate and compare the state of their respective link-state databases. Upon
    receiving such a signature, a node can quickly detect if a discrepancy is present
    and, furthermore, determine which information must be exchanged in order to alleviate
    this discrepancy.</p>"
