abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a seamless integration solution for BGP-based
    Layer-2 VPN (L2VPN) and EVPN to provide point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Service
    (VPWS). In addition, this document also extends the existing seamless integration
    for multipoint Ethernet VPN service with all-active multihoming support. The specified
    solution allows the coexistence of EVPN and L2VPN services under the same point-to-
    point or multipoint VPN instance. By using this seamless integration solution,
    a service provider can introduce EVPN into their existing L2VPN network or migrate
    from an existing L2VPN based network to EVPN.</p>"
