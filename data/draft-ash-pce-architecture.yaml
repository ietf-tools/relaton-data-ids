abstract:
- content: "<p>Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for
    traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. Path computation in large, multi-domain,
    multi-region or multi-layers networks is highly complex and may require special
    computational components and cooperation between the different network domains.
    This document specifies the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based
    model to address this problem space.</p>"
