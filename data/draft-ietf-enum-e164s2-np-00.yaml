abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a text version of the Number Portability Supplement
    (11/98) to ITU-T Recommendation E.164 (The international public telecommunication
    numbering plan, 05/97) [2]. That Supplement [3] defined terminology for number
    portability within an E.164 numbering scheme; identified formats, call flows,
    architectures, and routing approaches for some methods; and gave examples of some
    processes needed to implement number portability. A January 2000 workshop on IP-Telecomms
    interworking (focused on numbering, naming, addressing, and routing) identified
    issues to be addressed by the IETF and/or the ITU [4]. This Supplement was noted
    as a document related to a joint IETF/ITU issue on E.164 number portability. A
    text version was posted on the ITU's web site in March 2000 and notified to the
    itu+ietf and enum mailing lists. This Internet Draft is being submitted to support
    work of the ENUM (Telephone Number Mapping) Working Group on impacts of local
    number portability on a DNS-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone
    number to a set of attributes (e.g., URLs) [5].</p>"
