abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework and a detailed suite of network
    programming interface (NPI) examples for provisioning of underlay services to
    overlay networks. It provides background by reviewing the growing pains that commonly
    faced today by enterprise for its flexiable WAN sites connection. It assumes that
    WAN connection services are and will continue to be provided by multiple underlay
    networks operated by different administrative entities. Based on the pains and
    the assumptions, this document propose to use SRv6 binding SIDs (BSIDs) on a transport
    network (TN) edge router as NPI for service provisioning to be accessed remotely
    and securely by a customer router that constitutes to a higher overlay network,
    including the requirements of such service, the illustration of how it may work,
    and the possible applicability of the solution.</p>"
