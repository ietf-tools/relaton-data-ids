abstract:
- content: '<p>This document introduces a standardized mechanism for zone owners to
    signal their intent regarding DNS provider responsibilities through DNS itself.
    It defines a new DNS RRtype, HSYNC (Horizontal Synchronization), that enables
    zone owners to designate which providers are authorized to serve and/or sign their
    zones, control whether providers or the zone owner manages the NS RRset, and specify
    zone transfer chain configurations. The HSYNC record allows DNS providers to discover
    each other and establish secure communication channels, either via DNS messages
    secured by SIG(0) signatures or via a RESTful API secured by TLS. This provider-to-provider
    communication via Agents enables automated coordination for tasks such as NS RRset
    management, zone transfers, and DNSSEC-related operations. This specification
    covers the provider discovery and communication establishment aspects. The document
    defines two new roles to facilitate this synchronization: the Agent responsible
    for provider-to-provider communication and the Combiner which merges unsigned
    zone data from the zone owner with managed data from providers. While a distributed
    DNSSEC multi-signer architecture (similar to "model 2" in RFC8901) is an important
    application of this framework, the HSYNC mechanism supports broader provider synchronization
    needs. The specific synchronization algorithms for multi-signer operation are
    described in [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation]. Specification for how to
    express these algorithms over provider-to- provider communication is left for
    a follow-up document. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in
    Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-leon-dnsop-signaling-zone-owner- intent
    (https://github.com/johanix/draft-leon-dnsop-signaling-zone- owner-intent). The
    most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc, should all be available
    there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>'
