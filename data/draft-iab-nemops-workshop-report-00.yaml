abstract:
- content: <p>The "Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)" workshop was
    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on December 3-5, 2024 as a three-day
    online meeting. It builds on a previous 2002 workshop, the outcome of which was
    documented in RFC 3535 identifying 14 operator requirements for consideration
    in future network management protocol design and related data models, along with
    some recommendations for the IETF. Much has changed in the Internetâ€™s operation
    and technological foundations since then. The NEMOPS workshop reviewed the past
    outcomes and identified any operational barriers that prevented these technologies
    from being widely implemented. It sketched new requirements for future network
    management operations collaboratively with the industry, network operators and
    protocol engineers, and developed a suggested action plan and recommendations
    for the IETF. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.
    The views and positions documented in this report were expressed during the workshop
    by participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB's views and positions.</p>
