abstract:
- content: "<p>This document attempts to generate discussion on methods to run end
    2 end 'sensitive' protocols and capabilities, like IPSEC, on networks that use
    Network Address Translators (NAT). The proposal does so by outlining one method
    to bypass NAT, when the required capabilities cannot be supported by NAT. The
    method uses a tunnel between a local host and the NAT box in order to dynamically
    allocate addresses to those hosts that need to communicate with external networks.
    With an allocated external address, the local hosts are able to communicate with
    external hosts without breaking the end 2 end principle. This proposal does not
    introduce any new protocols, it simply reuses existing protocols to provide an
    example solution.</p>"
