abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a security analysis for the differentiated service
    framework. We studied what kinds of attacks can be performed and how badly attacks
    can affect network services under the DiffServ framework. Without a careful investigation
    of potential attacks and impacts, the protection systems can not be effectively
    developed and evaluated. The DiffServ working group, as a whole, needs to decide
    what the important security issues are (or what specific attacks we need to defend
    against). Then, it will be meaningful to discuss the possible solution to those
    realistic DiffServ vulnerabilities. Our objective in this report is to define
    a model for denial of service attacks under the DiffServ framework.</p>"
