abstract:
- content: "<p>The advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC) will
    threaten the public key cryptography that is currently in use in today's secure
    internet protocol infrastructure. To address this, organizations such as the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will standardize new post-quantum
    cryptography (PQC) that is resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum
    computers. After PQC algorithms are standardized, the widespread implementation
    of this cryptography will be contingent upon adapting current protocols to accommodate
    PQC. Hybrid solutions are one way to facilitate the transition between traditional
    and PQ algorithms: they use both a traditional and a PQ algorithm in order to
    perform encryption or authentication, with the guarantee that the given security
    property will still hold in the case that one algorithm fails. Hybrid solutions
    can be constructed in many ways, and the cryptographic community has already begun
    to explore this space. This document introduces non-composite hybrid authentication,
    which requires updates at the protocol level and limits impact to the certificate-issuing
    infrastructure.</p>"
