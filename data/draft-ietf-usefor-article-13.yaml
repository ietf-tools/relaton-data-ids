abstract:
- content: "<p>This Draft is intended as a standards track document, obsoleting RFC
    1036, which itself dates from 1987. This Standard defines the format of Netnews
    articles and specifies the requirements to be met by software which originates,
    distributes, stores and displays them. Since the 1980s, Usenet has grown explosively,
    and many Internet and non-Internet sites now participate. In addition, the Netnews
    technology is now in widespread use for other purposes. Backward compatibility
    has been a major goal of this endeavour, but where this standard and earlier documents
    or practices conflict, this standard should be followed. In most such cases, current
    practice is already compatible with these changes.</p>"
