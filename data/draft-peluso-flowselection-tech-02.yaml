abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow selection is the process in charge of electing a limited number
    of flows from all of those observed at an observation point to be considered into
    the measurement process chain. The flow selection process can be enabled at different
    stages of the monitoring reference model. It can be performed at metering time
    once the packet classification has been executed, i.e. flow state dependent packet
    selection, or at recording/exporting time by limiting the number of flows to be
    stored and/or exported to the collector applications. This document illustrates
    the motivations which might lead flow selection to be performed and presents a
    classification of the related techniques. The document furthermore provides an
    information model for configuring flow selection techniques and discusses what
    information about the flow selection process is beneficial to be exported by adopting
    a suitable information model.</p>"
