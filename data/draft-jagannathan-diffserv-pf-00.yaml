abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a new Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for differentiated services
    in IP networks. In this PHB, each network subscriber (or flow) receives a bandwidth
    allocation proportional to the subscribed information rate. This new PHB is called
    'Proportional Forwarding PHB' or PF PHB. The marking mechanism at the source or
    ingress router and the queuing and discard behavior at core routers are clearly
    described.</p>"
