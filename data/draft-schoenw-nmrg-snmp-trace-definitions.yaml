abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity to
    collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) from operational
    networks. To analyze these traces, it is necessary to split potentially large
    traces into more manageable pieces that make it easier to deal with large data
    sets and simplify the analysis of the data. This document provides some common
    definitions that have been found useful for implementing tools to support trace
    analysis. This document mainly serves as a reference for the definitions underlying
    these tools and it is not meant to explain all the motivation and reasoning behind
    the definitions. Some of this background information can be found in other research
    papers.</p>"
