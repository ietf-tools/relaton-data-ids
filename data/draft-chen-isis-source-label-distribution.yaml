abstract:
- content: "<p>An MPLS Source Label (SL) is defined to identify a node that is (one
    of) the ingress LSRs to a specific LSP. This document defines extensions to ISIS
    protocol for distribution of the mapping of an MPLS Source Label to an specific
    LSR. Therefore, the egress and intermediate LSRs can determine from which LSR
    an MPLS packet is sent. This document also defines ISIS extensions to advertise
    the Source Label Capability (SLC) of each LSR that indicates whether an LSR can
    process the Source Label. With the SLC, an ingress LSR can determine whether it
    is allowed to insert a Source Label into the label stack for a specific LSP.</p>"
