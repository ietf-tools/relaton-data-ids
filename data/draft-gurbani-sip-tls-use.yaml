abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explores the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). We do so by outlining the goals and
    the non-goals for the use of TLS and SIP. In doing so, a number of open questions
    are encountered regarding the contents of certificates and the behavior of SIP
    entities using such certificates. We hope to foster discussion in the SIP working
    group on these issues.</p>"
