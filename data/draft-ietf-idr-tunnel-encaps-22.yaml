abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a BGP path attribute known as the "Tunnel Encapsulation
    attribute", which can be used with BGP UPDATEs of various Subsequent Address Family
    Identifiers (SAFIs) to provide information needed to create tunnels and their
    corresponding encapsulation headers. It provides encodings for a number of tunnel
    types, along with procedures for choosing between alternate tunnels and routing
    packets into tunnels. This document obsoletes RFC 5512, which provided an earlier
    definition of the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute. RFC 5512 was never deployed
    in production. Since RFC 5566 relies on RFC 5512, it is likewise obsoleted. This
    document updates RFC 5640 by indicating that the Load-Balancing Block sub-TLV
    may be included in any Tunnel Encapsulation attribute where load balancing is
    desired.</p>
