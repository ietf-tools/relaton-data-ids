abstract:
- content: "<p>The plethora of networks comprising the Internet have been getting
    bigger and faster in the past at a tremendous rate. In the future, to address
    all of the current and future pervasive services, the Internet will also have
    to get better, i.e. it will need more intelligence created by clever software
    deployed throughout the network. This Internet Draft advances the discussion on
    the issues involved in interconnecting the Internet and Public Switched Telephone
    Networks (PSTNs), focusing on potential interfaces between Internet-based devices
    and Intelligent Network (I.N.) devices. Services based on the interplay of PSTN
    / I.N. and the Internet are discussed and classified, and an outline of a protocol
    architecture for the interface between the Internet and the Intelligent Network
    is given.</p>"
