abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new approach for the Designated Forwarder
    (DF) selection algorithm. This is besides the existing algorithm types discussed
    in RFC7432 and RFC8584. A DF is a PE part of an Ethernet-Segment, forwarding BUM
    traffic to multi-homed hosts. This document discusses methods to achieve efficient
    service carving in Evpn Multi-homed networks by extending the DF selection algorithm
    type in RFC7432 by suggesting a new approach for service carving.</p>"
