abstract:
- content: "<p>The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP), as currently defined, makes
    use of the TCP MD5 Signature option to protect (authentication and integrity)
    the LDP traffic between two adjacent LSRs. This document specifies extensions
    to LDP to enable end-to-end authentication between non-adjacent LSR's (ie not
    directly connected via a TCP connection) that are setting up an LSP. Two mechanisms
    are defined that also provide integrity protection of the information carried
    within LDP messages and protect against the malicious replay of LDP messages.
    Both proposed mechanisms require ordered control LDP and can also be applied to
    CR-LDP.</p>"
