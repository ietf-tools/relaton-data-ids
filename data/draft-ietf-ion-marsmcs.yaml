abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides details on the design and implementation of an MCS,
    building on the core mechanisms defined in RFC 2022. It also provides a mechanism
    for using multiple MCSs per group for providing fault tolerance. This approach
    can be used with RFC 2022 based MARS server and clients, without needing any change
    in their functionality. This memo provides information for the Internet community.
    This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
