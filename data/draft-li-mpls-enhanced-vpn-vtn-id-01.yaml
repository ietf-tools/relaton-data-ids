abstract:
- content: "<p>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which has a
    customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network resources
    allocated from the underlying network infrastructure. Multiple VTNs can be created
    by network operator for using as the underlay for one or a group of VPNs services
    to provide enhanced VPN (VPN+) services. In packet forwarding, some fields in
    the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so
    that the VTN-specific processing can be executed. This document proposes a mechanism
    to carry the VTN-ID in an MPLS packet to identify the VTN the packet belongs to.
    The procedure for processing the VTN ID is also specified.</p>"
