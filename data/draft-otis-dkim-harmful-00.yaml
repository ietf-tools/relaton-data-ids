abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be identified
    by an authenticated domain. Unfortunately many hope to use DKIM as an alternative,
    but it is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable for sending
    the message. This means DKIM is poorly suited for establishing abuse assessments
    for unsolicited messaging of commercial email otherwise known as SPAM, nor was
    this initially DKIM's intent. DKIM lacks message context essential to ensure fair
    assessment and to ensure this assessment is not poisoned. DKIM was instead intended
    to establish increased levels of trust based upon valid DKIM signatures controlling
    acceptance and what a user sees within the FROM header field. But DKIM failed
    to guard against pre-pended header fields where any acceptance based on valid
    DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header field spoofing, especially that of the
    FROM. This weakness allows malefactors to exploit DKIM signature acceptance established
    by high-volume DKIM domains to spoof ANY other domain, even when prohibited within
    the Signer's network.</p>"
