abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). DTLS over
    SCTP provides communications privacy for applications that use SCTP as their transport
    protocol and allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is
    designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery. Applications
    using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport features provided by SCTP and
    its extensions. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
