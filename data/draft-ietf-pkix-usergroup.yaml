abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of systems which understand X.509 client certificates have
    developed various ad hoc mechanisms to map a certificate to a 'userid'/'group(s)'
    value which can then be used for access control. The mechanisms include idiosyncratic
    name forms for the SubjectName field such as encoding the userid as a CommonName
    and the group as an OrganizationalUnit, or mapping the certificate against an
    entry in a directory system. This document describes an otherName extension of
    the GeneralName type which can be used in the SubjectAltName extension or IssuerAltName
    extension to directly encode userid and group information.</p>"
