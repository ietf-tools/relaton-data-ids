abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification offers an approach for augmenting domain name resolution
    times by intercepting HTTP responses at HTTP Proxy servers and triggering DNS
    queries to the servers in lieu of user requests and returning responses without
    an explicit requests from clients. This functionality can be achieved by multiple
    approaches at HTTP and Domain Name System [DNS] Protocols, this document specifies
    approach that shall be employed at HTTP protocol [RFC 2616]. Methods/approaches
    pertaining to DNS shall be documented in [draft- pchowdaiah-dns-without-explicit-query.txt].</p>"
