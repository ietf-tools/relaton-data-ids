abstract:
- content: "<p>TRILL supports multi-access TRILL links that can have multiple RBridges
    attached. This draft specifies RBridge Aggregation that enables concurrent data
    forwarding by multiple RBridges for the end stations in the same VLAN on a TRILL
    link without partition. RBridge Aggregation offers active/active multi-homing
    to multi-access TRILL links, which improves their reliability and increases the
    access bandwidth of RBridge campus.</p>"
