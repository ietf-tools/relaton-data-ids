abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents five extensions to the PPP/LCP Protocol: * Assistance
    from a router to another router (or a host) looking for its Operating System file.
    * Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) looking for its configuration
    file. * Request from an equipment to receive Discard frame when no Data frame
    can be sent. When no Discard or Data frames are received the link will be brought
    down. This method is more efficient than using a timeout and/or a keepalive mecanism.
    * Interface Bandwidth and Delay measurements. These informations can be used by
    OSPF or any other IGP protocol.</p>"
