abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines GORF, a Generic Opportunistic Routing Framework.
    GORF specifies all necessary basic functionality that is common for all utility-based
    routing protocols that are variants of the epidemic routing protocol for intermittently
    connected networks that operates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to
    minimize resource usage while still attempting to achieve the best case routing
    capabilities of epidemic routing. It is intended for use in sparse mesh networks
    where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between source and destination
    exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver
    messages between hosts. These networks are examples of networks where there is
    a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and the capabilities
    of the underlying network (networks often referred to as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant).
    The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</p>"
