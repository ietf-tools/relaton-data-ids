abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the revocation semantics for terminating a mobile
    node's mobility session and associated resources. These semantics are generic
    enough and can be used by mobility entities in the case of Client Mobile IPv6
    and its extensions. This mechanism allows the mobility entity which initiates
    the revocation procedure to request its corresponding one to terminate either
    one, multiple or all specified binding cache entries.</p>"
