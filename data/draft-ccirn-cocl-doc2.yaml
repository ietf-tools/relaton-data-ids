abstract:
- content: "<p>The Short-term approach outlined in ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking:
    Part I: Introduction'' is based on the use of transport-layer relays known as
    transport service bridges, or TS-bridges. Further, the short-term approach also
    assumes that knowledge of the TS-bridges is present in the end-systems. The companion
    memo ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking--Part III: The Intermediate-Term--Provision
    of the CONS over TCP and X.25 Subnetworks'' identifies solutions in which end-system
    knowledge of transport-layer relays is avoided. The purpose of this memo is two-fold:
    first, modifications to the operational characteristics of end-systems are described;
    and, second, the operational characteristics of TS-bridges are described.</p>"
