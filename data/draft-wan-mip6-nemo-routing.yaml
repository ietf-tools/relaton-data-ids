abstract:
- content: "<p>The current Mobile IPv6 and NEMO specification supports only IPv6.
    As an extension, the DSMip6 protocol [v4traversal]defines how the dual-stack mobile
    node roams in the ipv4 network. The dsmip6 protocol assumes that both home agent
    and mobile node supports mipv4 and mipv6 protocol. It also assumes that both the
    home agent and mobile node have a configured ipv4 address. These assumptions do
    work during many scenarios. However, as the ipv4 address is a scarce resource
    in many counrties, some mobile nodes may not be able to get configured ipv4 home
    addresses from their home agents. In this scenario, a temporary ipv4 home address
    is more useful. This document will focuse on this scenario.</p>"
