abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of wireless and mobile technologies, mobile multicast
    becomes a research hotspot. However, the current multicast routing protocols can
    not provide the mobile multicast services. To support the mobile multicast, the
    related multicast specifications need to be extended. In this memo, we focus on
    the group membership management protocol and define the new source address selection
    policy for mobile multicast.</p>"
