abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. This memo suggests that the existing
    RFC 3552 threat model, while important and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient
    to cater for the pressing security and privacy issues seen on the Internet today.
    For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against endpoints that are
    compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests
    of users. While such protection is difficult, there are some measures that can
    be taken and we argue that investigation of these issues is warranted. It is particularly
    important to ensure that as we continue to develop Internet technology, non-communications
    security related threats, and privacy issues, are properly understood.</p>"
