abstract:
- content: "<p>Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is a network protocol that uses a
    hierarchical name to forward requests and to match responses to requests. This
    document specifies the encoding of CCNx messages in a TLV packet format, including
    the TLV types used by each message element and the encoding of each value. The
    semantics of CCNx messages follow the encoding-independent CCNx Semantics specification.
    This document is a product of the Information Centric Networking research group
    (ICNRG). The document received wide review among ICNRG participants and has two
    full implementations currently in active use, which have informed the technical
    maturity of the protocol specification.</p>"
