abstract:
- content: "<p>Various IPv6 extension headers have been defined since the IPv6 standard
    was first published. This document updates RFC 2460 to describe how intermediate
    nodes should deal with such extension headers and with any that are defined in
    future. It also specifies how extension headers should be registered by IANA,
    with a corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.</p>"
