abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe the 'out-of-band' exchange of data in a classical enrollment
    protocol as a Trusted Transitive Introduction (TTI) between two end entities and
    an introducer, thus distinguishing introduction from enrollment. This document
    describes the three system entities in the trusted transitive introduction model
    and the data exchanges between them. Three introduction stages are defined and
    examined in the context of a 'TTI over HTTP' introduction.</p>"
