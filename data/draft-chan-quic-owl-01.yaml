abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for enhancing
    multipath transmission in QUIC. Several representative usages of OWL, such as
    congestion control mechanism, retransmission policy, crucial data scheduling are
    analyzed. Two kinds of OWL measurement approaches are also provided and compared.
    More explorations related with OWL will be researched to improve the performance
    of QUIC.</p>"
