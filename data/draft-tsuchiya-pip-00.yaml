abstract:
- content: "<p>Pip is an IP protocol that scales, encodes policy, and is high speed.
    The purpose of this draft is to explain the basic concepts behind Pip so that
    people can start thinking about potential pitfalls. I am proposing Pip as an alternative
    to the two 'medium term' proposals that emerged from the Road (Routing and Addressing)
    group to deal with the dual IP problems of scaling and address depletion. Because
    this proposal, which represents new ideas, is competing with old (and therefore
    well thought-out) ideas, I wish to circulate it (and get the process started)
    as quickly as possible, albeit in not as complete a form as I would like. I expect
    to have a complete proposal by the beginning of September. There will be a plenary
    presentation and a BOF covering this material at the Boston meeting of IETF.</p>"
