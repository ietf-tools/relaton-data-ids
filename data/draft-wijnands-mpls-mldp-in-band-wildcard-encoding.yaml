abstract:
- content: <p>There are scenarios in which an IP multicast tree traverses an MPLS
    domain. In these scenarios, it can be desirable to convert the IP multicast tree
    "seamlessly" to an MPLS multipoint label switched path (MP-LSP) when it enters
    the MPLS domain, and then to convert it back to an IP multicast tree when it exits
    the MPLS domain. Previous documents specify procedures that allow certain kinds
    of IP multicast trees (either "Source-Specific Multicast" trees or "Bidirectional
    Multicast" trees) to be attached to an MPLS Multipoint Label Switched Path (MP-LSP).
    However, the previous documents do not specify procedures for attaching IP "Any
    Source Multicast" trees to MP-LSPs, nor do they specify procedures for aggregating
    multiple IP multicast trees onto a single MP-LSP. This document specifies the
    procedures to support these functions. It does so by defining "wildcard" encodings
    that make it possible to specify, when setting up an MP- LSP, that a set of IP
    multicast trees, or a shared IP multicast tree, should be attached to that MP-LSP.
    Support for non-bidirectional IP "Any Source Multicast" trees is subject to certain
    applicability restrictions that are discussed in this document.</p>
