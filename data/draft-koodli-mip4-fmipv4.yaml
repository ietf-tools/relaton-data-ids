abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mobile IPv6 fast handover document [2] specifies a protocol to
    improve latency and packet loss resulting from Mobile IPv6 handover operations.
    This document adapts the protocol for IPv4 networks to improve performance over
    Mobile IPv4 operations, including processing of Agent Advertisements, new Care
    of Address acquisition and Registration Request and Reply. However, operation
    without Foreign Agent function at a router is also feasible. In addition, the
    protocol may be used transparently on hosts which do not support Mobile IP, but
    with limited movement across subnets. Using the concepts outlined in [2], this
    document also addresses movement detection, IP address configuration and location
    update latencies during a handover. For reducing the IP address configuration,
    the document currently proposes that the new CoA is always made to be the new
    access router's IP address. Additional mechanisms may be defined in the future
    versions of this document.</p>"
