abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP provides a mobile node, that visits a foreign subnet, the
    ability to continue to use an address from its home subnet (the home address)
    as a source address. This is achieved through the allocation of a Care of Address
    on the foreign subnet that is used as the end-point of a redirection tunnel from
    a home agent on the home subnet. Mobile IP in RFC 3220 states that when the mobile
    node originates multicast traffic intended for the foreign multicast system, it
    can only do so by first obtaining an IP address from the foreign subnet (a Collocated
    Care of Address) and then using this address as the multicast source address.
    This is to ensure that the source address will pass multicast routing reverse
    path forwarding checks. This foreign multicast model is however extremely restrictive,
    and still very problematic to multicast routing and applications when the mobile
    node regularly changes foreign subnets, as is common in wireless systems. This
    is because the source address continues to evolve which must be tracked by source
    specific multicast application and routing signalling. Using the home multicast
    system, again described above, is also non-optimal because the mobile node receiver
    is then serviced by packets that must be tunnelled from its home agent which,
    removes any multicast routing benefits (ie network based tree building). This
    draft therefore describes modifications to the foreign multicast interface between
    mobile IP and multicast routing that enable the mobile node to use its persistent
    home address as a multicast source address.</p>"
