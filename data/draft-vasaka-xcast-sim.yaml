abstract:
- content: "<p>Sender Initiated Multicast (SIM) is a point-to-multipoint multicast
    mechanism. SIM will not replace the existing multicast protocol, but will be a
    subset of entire multicast protocol suite. Its design goals are to gain more simplicity
    than the traditional IP multicast and to gain less header-processing overhead
    than the Xcast protocol. It eliminates the cost of allocating global multicast
    address, by routing packets according to receiver unicast addresses attached to
    packet headers. Access control can be introduced before, members of a receiving
    group are explicitly specified by the sender. A group is identified by the combination
    of sender's unicast address and a multicast group address. The key feature of
    SIM is in its Preset mode, which can lessen the costs of route lookups and provides
    cost- efficient packet forwarding by using a SIM Forwarding Information Base (FIB)
    maintained on routers. Moreover, a SIM tunnel will be automatically created between
    two routers that act as multicast branching points. Therefore, SIM can gain scalability
    by maintaining FIB entries only on the branching routers. In this document, we
    describe SIM including its delivery models, SIM FIB operations, the formats, and
    security considerations.</p>"
