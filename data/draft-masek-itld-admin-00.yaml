abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed policy, procedure, and control structure
    for the allocation of additional top-level domains. It also discusses a new format/
    special class of iTLDs to be implemented to facilitate deployment of innovative
    Internet services. Further it discusses the issues surrounding additional international
    top level domains (iTLDs) and registries, qualification proposals for operating
    such a registry, and justifications for the positions expressed in this paper.
    This document describes policies and procedures to o allow open competition in
    domain name registration in the iTLDs, o and provide the IANA with a legal and
    financial umbrella Note that while cooperation between competing iTLD registries
    is allowed, it is not required. This is specifically not assumed in this proposal,
    and is considered to be an operational aspect of a registry best determined, and
    coordinated, by contractual agreements between private interests. The NEWDOM,
    IETF, and related mailing lists are encouraged to read, and comment, on this material.
    Presuming a consensus can be found within these audiences, the distribution of
    this memorandum should be</p>"
