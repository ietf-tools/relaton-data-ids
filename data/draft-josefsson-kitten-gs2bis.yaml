abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service Application
    Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer (SASL) framework. This is done by defining a new SASL mechanism family,
    called GS2. This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous
    "SASL/ GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication
    phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding. This is an
    update of RFC 5801 that relaxes the requirement for channel binding support and
    mutual authentication in the underlying GSS-API mechanism.</p>'
