abstract:
- content: "<p>The specification for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version
    3 (LDAPv3) nominally comprises eight separte RFCs which were issued in two distinct
    subsets at separate times (RFCs 2251..2256 first, then RFCs 2229 and 2830 following
    later), but this has never been formally stated. Additionally, RFCs 2251..2256
    each are embellished with an 'IESG Note' warning implementors and deployers of
    potential interoperability prob- lems due to the lack of a specification of mandatory-to-implement
    authentication mechanism(s). This document corrects both situations by explicitly
    specifying the set of RFCs comprising LDAPv3 and rescinding the 'IESG Note' due
    to the specification of mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanisms in RFC
    2829.</p>"
