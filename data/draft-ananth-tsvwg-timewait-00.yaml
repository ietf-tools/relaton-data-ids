abstract:
- content: "<p>Source port randomization has been suggested to provide improved security
    and obfuscation which helps in adding robustness towards blind attacks. With TCP
    in practice, simply producing a random port as the source port for a new connection
    can lead to problems when a TCP client establishes connections to a TCP server
    at a high rate. If the same source port value is chosen twice, the client TCP
    connection can fail due to the server having the Transmission Control Block (TCB)
    for this tuple lingering in TIME-WAIT state. This memo discusses the ramifications
    of such source port reuse scenarios and suggests some mitigations to avoid the
    same.</p>"
