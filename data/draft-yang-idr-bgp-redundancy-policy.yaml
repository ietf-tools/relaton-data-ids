abstract:
- content: "<p>Redundancy Protection is a generalized protection mechanism by replicating
    and transmitting copies of flow packets on redundancy node over multiple different
    and disjoint paths, and further eliminating the redundant packets at merging node.
    In order to support the replication behavior of redundancy protection, Redundancy
    Policy is used to instruct the replication of service packets and assign more
    than one redundancy forwarding paths. This document defines the extensions to
    BGP to advertise the redundancy policy.</p>"
