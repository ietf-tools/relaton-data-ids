abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP (MIP) suffers from the so-called triangular routing problem.
    Moreover, MIP Home Agent (HA) tends to undergo severe data traffic load, since
    it should deliver all the data packets toward mobile nodes. This paper proposes
    a simple extension of MIP, called Query- based MIP (QMIP), in which the binding
    query to HA will be used to get the care-of address of a mobile node and to deliver
    the subsequent data packets over the optimized data path. The proposed QMIP scheme
    can be applied to MIPv4 and Proxy MIPv6 as well.</p>"
