abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 2284,
    provides for support of multiple authentication methods. While EAP was originally
    created for use with PPP, it has since been adopted for use with IEEE 802.1X 'Network
    Port Authentication'. Since its deployment, a number of weaknesses in EAP have
    become apparent. These include the lack of protection for, and acknowledgement
    of Success and Failure messages.</p>"
