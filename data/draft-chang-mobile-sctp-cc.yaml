abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a novel error and congestion control algorithm
    for mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP). This algorithm is simple
    but very effective means to minimize the lost packet recovery time as well as
    the handover latency by capitalizing on the transport layer awareness of the mobility.</p>"
