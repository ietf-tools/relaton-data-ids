abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of
    SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the LSP can be calculated/set
    up/initiated and the label forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a
    centralized PCE server to each network device along the path while leveraging
    the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This document specifies the
    procedures and Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions
    when a PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding
    actions on the routers, in addition to computing the paths for packet flows in
    a segment routing (SR) network and telling the edge routers what instructions
    to attach to packets as they enter the network. PCECC as defined in RFC 9050 is
    further enhanced for SR-MPLS SID (Segment Identifier) allocation and distribution.</p>"
