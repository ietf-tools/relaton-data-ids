abstract:
- content: "<p>In MIPv4, when a Mobile Node (MN) registers with the 'D' bit, in the
    MIP Registration to a Home Agent (HA), then the MN wishes to use a Co-located
    Care-of address (CCoA) with a specific Home Address (HoA). Packets sent to the
    MN Home Address (HoA) will then be encapsulated in the CCoA by the HA and forwarded
    directly to the MN. Alternatively, a MN can obtain from the local Foreign Agent(FA)
    a shared FA CoA for inclusion in its MIP Registration to the FA/HA. In this case,
    the HA encapsulates to the FA CoA, and the Foreign Agent then decapsulates and
    delivers the HoA addressed packet unencapsulated to the MN. This draft adds to
    MIPv4 the ability for the MN to acquire a MN specific FA CoA that provides the
    MN with a topologically correct local address and whose tunnel encaps/decaps is
    provided by the FA. This address is called a proxy CCoA (PCCoA) and the associated
    processing in the MN and FA is called Proxy CCoA tunneling. This capability is
    applicable to any access technology but is especially useful for wireless systems
    where the access bandwidth is expensive and when point-to-point link-layer connectivity
    exists between the MN and the FA. This draft also describes reverse tunneling
    and smooth hand-off extensions based on the PCCoA that enables inter-FA forwarding
    even for CCoAs.</p>"
