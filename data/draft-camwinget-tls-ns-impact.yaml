abstract:
- content: "<p>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, the public
    sector, internet-service providers, and cloud-service providers to both complement
    and enhance host-based security solutions. As TLS is a widely deployed protocol
    to secure communication, these network- based security solutions must necessarily
    interact with it. This document describes this interaction for current operational
    security practices and notes the impact of TLS 1.3 on them.</p>"
