abstract:
- content: "<p>PCEP is used to provide a communication between a PCC and a PCE. This
    document defines the extensions to PCEP to support the bounded- latency path computation.
    Specifically, two new objects and three new TLVs are defined for the transmission
    of bounded latency information between PCC and PCE to guarantee the bounded latency
    transmission in control plane.</p>"
