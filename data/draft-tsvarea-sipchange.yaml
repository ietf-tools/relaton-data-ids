abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a process intended to apply architectural discipline
    to the future development of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). There have
    been concerns with regards to new SIP proposals. Specifically, that the addition
    of new SIP features can be damaging towards security and/or greatly increase the
    complexity of the protocol. The Transport Area directors, along with the SIP and
    Session Initiation Proposal Investigation (SIPPING) working group chairs, have
    provided suggestions for SIP modifications and extensions. This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
