abstract:
- content: <p>20 This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet
    21 electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates, and clarifies 22 several
    previous documents, making all or parts of most of them 23 obsolete. It covers
    the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices 24 for the contemporary Internet,
    but does not provide details about 25 particular extensions. Although SMTP was
    designed as a mail 26 transport and delivery protocol, this specification also
    contains 27 information that is important to its use as a "mail submission" 28
    protocol for "split-UA" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile 29 environments.
