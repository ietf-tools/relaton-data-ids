abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses some of the issues posed by firewalls and other
    intermediaries to deployment of some basic IETF technologies. The intent of this
    document is to track such issues, explore possible approaches elegant or not that
    have been proposed so far to address them and initiate discussion on how such
    issues should be appropriately addressed by IETF. This first version 00 is provided
    to initiate discussion. Most of the content should be considered as initial place
    holders.</p>"
