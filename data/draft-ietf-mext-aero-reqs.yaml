- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements and desired properties of
    Network Mobility (NEMO) Route Optimization techniques for use in global-networked
    communications systems for aeronautics and space exploration. Substantial input
    to these requirements was given by aeronautical communications experts outside
    the IETF, including members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
    and other aeronautical communications standards bodies. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
