abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how to connect pseudowires (PWs) between different
    Packet Switched Network (PSN) domains or between two or more distinct PW control
    plane domains, where a control plane domain uses a common control plane protocol
    or instance of that protocol for a given PW. The different PW control plane domains
    may belong to independent autonomous systems, or the PSN technology is heterogeneous,
    or a PW might need to be aggregated at a specific PSN point. The PW packet data
    units are simply switched from one PW to another without changing the PW payload.
