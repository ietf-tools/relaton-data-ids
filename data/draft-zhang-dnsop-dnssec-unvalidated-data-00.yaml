abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the prevalence of DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)
    misconfigurations, many domain administrators troubleshoot the records of DNSSEC-signed
    domains via queries with CD (Checking Disabled) bit set. However, as DNS resolvers
    are not forced to perform DNSSEC validation for CD=1 queries, the unvalidated
    data introduced during troubleshooting could be mixed up with the routine ones
    in the resolver cache. Recent research has revealed that the reuse of the cached
    unvalidated data in subsequent resolutions could lead to the risk of Denial-of-Service
    (DoS). This document clarifies the definition of unvalidated data in the context
    of DNSSEC. Then, it demonstrates the DoS vulnerabilities of current DNS resolver
    implementations due to the reuse of cached unvalidated data. Accordingly, it provides
    several recommendations for DNSSEC- validating resolvers to handle the unvalidated
    data and mitigate the risk of DoS, so as to improve the availability of DNSSEC-signed
    domains.</p>"
