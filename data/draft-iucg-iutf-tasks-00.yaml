abstract:
- content: "<p>The Intelligent Use Task Force (IUTF) has responsibility for organizing
    Dedicated Interest Groups (DIG) to research, document and validate solutions in
    the area of Intelligent Use Interfaces (IUI) between the various components of
    the whole digital ecosystem (WDE), the resulting intelligent global network (IGNet),
    the diversity of on-line facilitation services that their IUI and IGNet may bring
    to people and machines. This document describes the guidelines and procedures
    for the formation, operations, experimentations and publications of IUTF Dedicated
    Interest Groups and their internal and external relations with other SDOs (Standardization
    and Documentation Organizations). Its publication as an IETF Draft is part of
    the IUCG liaison.</p>"
