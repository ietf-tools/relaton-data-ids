abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies TRILL active/active edge which allows multiple
    RBridges concurrently forward data frames of the same VLAN on links bundled by
    a Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group. With this kind of connection, end nodes
    may increase the bandwidth and reliability of the access at the edge of TRILL
    campuses. It's required that no loop or duplication is caused by this new connection
    type. Besides this basic requirement, this document outlines other potential issues
    associated with TRILL active/active edge and investigates how these issues may
    be addressed.</p>"
