abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is related to the Hovey and Bradner [1], and Huizer drafts
    [2], addressing only the matter of formal external relationships. The IETF is
    at a juncture in its evolution. The key factors to consider are: a) the most effective
    standards bodies in the past have all been independent; b) failure to do so invariably
    ends up seriously damaging good standards bodies; c) incorporation as an independent
    entity is needed for the IETF; d) Other effective standards bodies on the Internet,
    in particular the WWW bodies, are also independent; e) one simple and easy alternative
    proposed here is incorporation under Swiss law (which also virtually eliminates
    liability problems and provides the IETF with its own international stature),
    and locate the secretariat wherever desired.</p>"
