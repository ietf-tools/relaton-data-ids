abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the framework and requirements for usage of
    the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to convey user location information from
    one Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) entity to another SIP entity. We consider
    cases where location information is conveyed from end to end, as well as cases
    where message routing by intermediaries is influenced by the location of the session
    initiator. We offer a set of solutions to the requirements, based on the scenario(s)
    being addressed.</p>"
