abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is the product of Group B, which is one of, at least, two
    subgroups in the IRTF-Routing Research Group working on requirements for routing
    solutions for the future. This document sets out a set of requirements that we
    believe are important for the future routing architecture and future routing protocols.
    It should be noted that the IRTF-Routing Research group does not endorse this
    set of requirements or any other set of requirements as the one and only set of
    requirements.</p>"
