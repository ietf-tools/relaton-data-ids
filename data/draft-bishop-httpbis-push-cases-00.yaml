abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP/2 defines the wire mechanics of Server Push. Though the mechanics
    of how a pushed resource is delivered are well-specified, the use cases that describe
    which resources can be pushed, in what states, and for what purpose are not described
    in HTTP/2. As a result, support between implementations varies widely. This document
    attempts to enumerate interesting scenarios, in hopes that a more concrete taxonomy
    can assist the community in arriving at a standard set of supported scenarios.</p>"
