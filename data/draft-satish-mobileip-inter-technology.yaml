abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi mode terminals are becoming pervasive. In a multi mode environment,
    Mobile Terminals (MTs) move from the coverage of one radio access network to another.
    There is a need to maintain ongoing network sessions to support seamless services.
    For example, a MT may roam between a 3G cellular network and a wireless LAN seamlessly
    with session continuity. It is possible for a single service provider to support
    multiple modes but it is expected that different modes will be supported by different
    service providers. For example WLAN support can be enterprise supported where
    as 3G services are supported by a wide area service provider. In this draft we
    discuss handover support between multiple domains (modes) where a MT can use different
    IP addresses or can use a global IP address. Handover between different modes
    will then require greater federation capabilities between the different IP domains.
    In this draft we discuss Home Agent federation capabilities over Mobile IP so
    that inter-technology, inter-domain handovers are better supported.</p>"
