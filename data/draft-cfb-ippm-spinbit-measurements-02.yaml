abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an additional single bit signal to enhance
    the spin bit [I-D.trammell-ippm-spin] performance in presence of network impairments
    and application limited flow. In addition, it defines two new explicit per-flow
    transport-layer signals for hybrid measurement of connection loss rate. The former
    is a spin-bit dependent signal and uses a single bit. The latter is a standalone
    solution based on a two bits loss signal and on alternate marking RFC 8321 [RFC8321].</p>"
