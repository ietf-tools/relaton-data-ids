abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a novel mechanism for Source Address Validation
    (SAV) message propagation based on Segment Routing policies (SR- policy). Traditional
    SAV mechanisms often rely on routing tables (RIB) and Policy-Based Routing (PBR),
    but these methods lack the flexibility and granularity needed for some network
    environments. By leveraging the flexibility and control capabilities of SR-policy,
    the proposed mechanism ensures that SAV messages are propagated along well-defined
    paths, ensuring efficient, secure, and accurate source address validation.</p>"
