abstract:
- content: "<p>This document advocates the usage of small, mostly constant payloads
    in the SYN+ACK frame of the 3-way TCP [RFC0793] handshake. We show how this can
    have immediate benefits for some protocols. Additionally, we describe a new TCP
    option that enables a wider range of protocols to gain from it.</p>"
