abstract:
- content: "<p>Crypto-conditions provide a mechanism to describe a signed message
    such that multiple actors in a distributed system can all verify the same signed
    message and agree on whether it matches the description. This provides a useful
    primitive for event-based systems that are distributed on the Internet since we
    can describe events in a standard deterministic manner (represented by signed
    messages) and therefore define generic authenticated event handlers.</p>"
