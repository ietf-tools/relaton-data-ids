abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes interdependent TCP control blocks, where part of
    the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent or consecutive connections. TCP
    state includes a combination of parameters, such as connection state, current
    round-trip time estimates, congestion control information, and process information.
    Most of this state is maintained on a per-connection basis in the TCP Control
    Block (TCB), but implementations can (and do) share certain TCB information across
    connections to the same host. Such sharing can improve transient transport performance,
    while maintaining backward- compatibility with existing implementations. The sharing
    described herein is limited to only the TCB initialization and so has no effect
    on the long-term behavior of TCP after a connection has been established.</p>"
