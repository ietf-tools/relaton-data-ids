abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides an analysis of the architectural aspects of multi-homing
    support for the IPv6 protocol suite. The purpose of this analysis is to provide
    a taxonomy for classification of various proposed approaches to multi-homing.
    It is also an objective of this exercise to identify common aspects of this domain
    of study, and also to provide a framework that can allow exploration of some of
    the further implications of various architectural extensions that are intended
    to support multi-homing. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
