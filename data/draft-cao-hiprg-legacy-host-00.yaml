abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to support a HIP-enabled host to have
    the ability to communicate with legacy hosts. By leveraging a proxy to bridge
    the communication between HIP host and non-HIP hosts, this document does not need
    the extensions to the HIP protocol.</p>"
