abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a protocol independent message format for requesting
    and reporting state related to keys or buttons. The document also defines a SIP
    Event Package to make use of this extensible framework through the SIP SUBSCRIBE
    &amp; NOTIFY messages. The draft currently defines key event sub-packages to represent
    the state of telephone dial pads, feature buttons found on many commercial telephones,
    standard keyboards as well as support for user or device specific buttons (for
    instance, a 'Double Latte' button). The event package and associated key packages
    can be used to enable new SIP services where an application or SIP entity requires
    notification of user interface activity either associated with a particular SIP
    session or simply in relation to the device itself.</p>"
