abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new, XML-based canonical format for RFCs that
    explicitly allows external art as a normative part of the RFC. If the RFC Editor
    chooses this format, they will also publish non- canonical versions of RFCs in
    order to accomodate the largest target audience of readers. Having a simple, stable
    canonical format and a varying number of non-canonical formats that can change
    over time allows the RFC Editor to add useful formats, particularly in HTML, that
    can keep up with the needs of all RFC readers.</p>"
