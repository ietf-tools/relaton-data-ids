- content: "<p>This document describes the proposed requirements for NDMP version
    5. This document assumes NDMP version 4 as a starting point. The requirements
    focus on improved clarity and interoperability, enabling a richer set of data
    management applications, and broadening the scope of NDMP to become a true Internet
    protocol. This increased scope increases the need for improved security mechanisms.</p>"
