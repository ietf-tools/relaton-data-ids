abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an optional extension to Neighbor Discovery
    Router Advertisement messages for communicating default router preferences and
    more-specific routes from routers to hosts. This improves the ability of hosts
    to pick an appropriate router, especially when the host is multi-homed and the
    routers are on different links. The preference values and specific routes advertised
    to hosts require administrative configuration; they are not automatically derived
    from routing tables.</p>"
