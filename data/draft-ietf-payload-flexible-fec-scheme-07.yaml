abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) packets that are generated by the non-interleaved and interleaved
    parity codes from source media encapsulated in RTP. These parity codes are systematic
    codes, where a number of FEC repair packets are generated from a set of source
    packets from one or more source RTP streams. These FEC repair packets are sent
    in a redundancy RTP stream separate from the source RTP stream(s) that carries
    the source packets. RTP source packets that were lost in transmission can be reconstructed
    using the source and repair packets that were received. The non-interleaved and
    interleaved parity codes which are defined in this specification offer a good
    protection against random and bursty packet losses, respectively, at a cost of
    decent complexity. The RTP payload formats that are defined in this document address
    the scalability issues experienced with the earlier specifications including RFC
    2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several improvements. Due to these
    changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatible with the earlier
    specifications, but endpoints that do not implement this specification can still
    work by simply ignoring the FEC repair packets.</p>"
