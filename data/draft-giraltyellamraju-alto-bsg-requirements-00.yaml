abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization (ALTO) protocol to support bottleneck structures as an efficient
    representation of the state of a network. Bottleneck structures are efficient
    computational graphs that allow network operators and application service providers
    to optimize application performance in a variety of communication problems including
    routing, flow control, flow scheduling, bandwidth prediction, and network slicing,
    among others. This document introduces a new abstraction called Bottleneck Structure
    Graph (BSG) and the necessary requirements to integrate it into the ALTO standard.</p>"
