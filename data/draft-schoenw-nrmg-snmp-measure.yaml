abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to
    monitor, control and configure network elements. Even though the SNMP technology
    is well documented, it remains relatively unclear how SNMP is used in practice
    and what typical SNMP usage patterns are. This document proposes to carry out
    large scale SNMP traffic measurements in order to develop a better understanding
    how SNMP is used in real world production networks. It describes the motivation,
    the measurement approach, and the tools and data formats needed to carry out such
    a study.</p>"
