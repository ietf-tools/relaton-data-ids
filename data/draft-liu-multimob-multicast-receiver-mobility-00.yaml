abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes the architecture and solution options for multicast
    receiver mobility. The discussions are restricted only to the receiver mobility
    with the assumption that the multicast source and network are stationary while
    the receiver is in the moving state. The suggestions are given on how to integrate
    mobile IP and fixed multicast protocols to provide the feasible solutions, which
    involves the aspects of mobile receiver registration, group membership management,
    tunnel or optimal multicast routing, and handover optimization. Conventions used
    in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
    NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</p>
