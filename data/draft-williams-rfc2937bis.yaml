abstract:
- content: "<p>Hosts may use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (RFC2131) [DHCP]
    as a mechanism to retrieve configuration information. The Name Service Search
    Option for DHCP (RFC2937) [NSSO] allows the DHCP server to specify the order in
    which various kinds of name services RFC2937 uses a list of DHCP option code numbers
    to identify the specific name service type, in the order it is to be consulted.
    This specification extends RFC2937 to support name service types which currently
    have no DHCP option number -- either because they do not need additional configuration
    information, or because this configuration is not typically supplied via DHCP.</p>"
