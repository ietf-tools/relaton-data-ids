abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we present the Extended Internet Protocol (EIP) which
    provides a long-term solution to Internet address exhaustion. What we propose
    here is not a new addressing and routing scheme, but a framework in which any
    addressing and routing schemes can be accommodated. The goal of EIP is to provide
    maximum flexibility to accommodate any addressing and routing schemes yet to maintain
    maximum backward compatibility with current IP. It can substantially reduce the
    amount of modifications needed to the current Internet systems and greatly ease
    the difficulties of transition. This is an 'idea' paper and discussion is strongly
    encouraged on Big-Internet@munnari.oz.au.</p>"
