abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC employs a Key Tag field in the RRSIG and DS resource records
    in order to efficiently identify the key that produced a DNSSEC signature and
    the key that should be used as secure entry point into a delegated zone. The Key
    Tag was not intended to be a unique identifier. Key tag collisions can occur in
    practice for keys in the same zone, though they are relatively rare in normal
    operation. Colliding key tags impose additional work on a validating resolver,
    which then has to check signatures for each of the candidate set of keys identified
    by the Key Tag. Furthermore, they open up resolvers to computational denial of
    service attacks by adversaries deploying specially crafted zones with many intentionally
    colliding key tags. This document specifies updates to the DNSSEC protocol and
    the process of key generation to avoid colliding keys and enforce the uniqueness
    of key tags.</p>"
