abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes an optional extension to IS-IS protocol, used
    today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds. IS-IS is an interior gateway
    routing protocol developed originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as IGP.
    IS-IS originally does not provide CSNP and PSNP checksums, relying on the underlying
    layers to verify the integrity of information provided. Experience with the protocol
    shows that this precondition does not always hold and scenarios can be imagined
    that impact protocol functionality. This document introduces a new optional TLV
    providing checksums.</p>"
