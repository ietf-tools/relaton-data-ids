abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework and methodology for performing stress
    testing and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) devices, including clients (i.e.,
    host interfaces) and Access Points. The document defines and discusses a number
    of tests and associated test conditions that may be used to characterize the performance
    of such devices, and also supplies the methods used to calculate the results of
    these tests. This document also describes specific formats for reporting the results
    of the tests. It extends the methodology defined for benchmarking network interconnecting
    devices in RFC 2544 and LAN switches in RFC 2889 to IEEE 802.11 WLAN devices.</p>"
