abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet community is working on a transition from version 4 of
    the Internet Protocol (IPv4) to version 6 of the Internet Protocol (IPv6). This
    memo describes the IPv6 Authentication Header. This optional header provides strong
    integrity and authentication for IPv6 datagrams. Non-repudiation might be provided
    by an authentication algorithm used with the Authentication Header, but it is
    not provided with all authentication algorithms that might be used. Confidentiality,
    and protection from traffic analysis are not provided by the Authentication Header.
    Users desiring confidentiality should consider using the IPv6 Encapsulating Security
    Protocol (ESP) either in lieu of or in conjunction with the Authentication Header.
    [Atk95b] This document assumes the reader has previously read and understood the
    related IPv6 Security Architecture document which defines the overall security
    architecture for IPv6 and provides important background information for this specification.
