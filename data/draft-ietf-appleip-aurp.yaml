abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies compatible enhancements to AppleTalk Phase
    2 routing protocols, intended to provide better routing in large wide-area network
    environments. This document first discusses architectural concepts related to
    these enhancements. The architectural discussion is followed by detailed protocol
    and procedural descriptions of the new protocols involved. This document focuses
    on the general architecture and protocols associated with enhanced AppleTalk routing,
    along with specifics as to how these protocols are to be implemented in a TCP/IP
    environment. It represents both a specification by Apple Computer, Inc. and an
    Internet Draft RFC, for use when connecting two or more AppleTalk internets together
    using an existing TCP/IP internet. This document is intended to ultimately become
    part of Inside AppleTalk, as well as a standard for the Internet Community. Comments
    are welcome.</p>"
