abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP
    XR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media transmission or
    reception quality, as proposed in RFC5968. This memo suggests that a new block
    should contain a single metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single
    parameter of interest or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which
    attempt to provide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific
    application. Applications may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which
    covers their set of concerns. Where possible, a specific block should be designed
    to be re-usable across more than one application, for example, for all of voice,
    streaming audio and video.</p>
