abstract:
- content: "<p>Network services based on Virtual Networks (VN) or Virtual Circuits
    (VC) may be run over MPLS-TE links, and support network configurations such as
    hub-spoke, service routing, or on-demand networks. An MPLS Traffic Engineering(TE)
    network is typically configured and the results of its operation analyzed through
    network management interfaces (CLI, SNMP or NETCONF). These interactions control
    each of the MPLS TE links, and diagnose operations issues concerning link configuration,
    MPLS TE protection, and traffic switching-over. The network management functions
    also monitor MPLS TE links and provide fault detection. The Interface to the Routing
    System (I2RS) (draft-ietf-i2rs- architecture) programmatic interface to the routing
    system provides an alternative way to control the configuration and diagnose the
    operation of MPLS links. I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation,
    polling, or analyzing MPLS TE. This document describes a set of use cases for
    which I2RS can be used for MPLS TE. It is intended to provide a base for a solution
    draft describing I2RS information models and protocol functions that will support
    virtual networks that utilize MPLS TE.</p>"
