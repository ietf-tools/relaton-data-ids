abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of top level domains was recently reserved for testing and documentation
    purposes. Currently, there is work in progress to reserve a top level domain to
    be used only in private networks. It is inevitable that some DNS queries for the
    names under these domains will leak to the Internet. To prevent the load of such
    ineffectual queries on the root servers, special configuration of the public DNS
    servers is recommended in this document</p>"
