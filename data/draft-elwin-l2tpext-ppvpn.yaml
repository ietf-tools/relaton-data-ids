abstract:
- content: "<p>Provider Provisioned VPNs (PPVPNs) need a tunneling mechanism and a
    means to automatically discover VPN membership and signal these tunnels. This
    draft elaborates the use of L2TP as the tunneling mechanism, and defines extensions
    to L2TP to handle VPN membership discovery to leverage PPVPNs. Additional AVPs
    are defined, and their behaviour are explained. The solution presented here is
    applicable for both L3 VPNs and L2 VPNs.</p>"
