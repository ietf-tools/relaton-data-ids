abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered
    replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication packets (RFC8279).
    This is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE). BIER-TE can be used as a path
    steering mechanism in future Traffic Engineering solutions for BIER (BIER-TE).
    BIER-TE leverages RFC8279 and extends it with a new semantic for bits in the bitstring.
    BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little or no changes. In BIER,
    the BitPositions (BP) of the packets bitstring indicate BIER Forwarding Egress
    Routers (BFER), and hop-by-hop forwarding uses a Routing Underlay such as an IGP.
    In BIER-TE, BitPositions indicate adjacencies. The BIFT of each BFR are only populated
    with BPs that are adjacent to the BFR in the BIER- TE topology. The BIER-TE topology
    can consist of layer 2 or remote (routed) adjacencies. The BFR then replicates
    and forwards BIER packets to those adjacencies. This results in the aforementioned
    strict and loose path steering and replications. BIER-TE can co-exist with BIER
    forwarding in the same domain, for example by using separate BIER sub-domains.
    In the absence of routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing
    underlay, and can then be operated without requiring an Interior Gateway Routing
    protocol (IGP). BIER-TE operates without explicit in-network tree-state and carries
    the multicast distribution tree in the packet header. It can therefore be a good
    fit to support multicast path steering in Segment Routing (SR) networks.</p>"
