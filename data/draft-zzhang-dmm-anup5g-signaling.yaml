abstract:
- content: "<p>Draft-zzhang-dmm-mup-evolution describes an architecture in which co-
    located Access Node and User Plane Function node of a 5G mobile network are integrated
    into a single Network Function ANUP in 6G for simplified signaling and optimized
    forwarding. The integration can happen in 5G as well but only with optimized forwarding.
    This document describes how BGP signaling specified in Draft-mpmz-bess- mup-safi
    can be used for ANUP implementation in 5G.</p>"
