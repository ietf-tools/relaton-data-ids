abstract:
- content: "<p>Abstract Syntax Notation X (ASN.X) is a semantically equivalent Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) representation for Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
    specifications. ASN.X completely avoids the numerous ambiguities inherent in the
    ASN.1 language; therefore, specifications written in ASN.X are much easier to
    parse and manage than original ASN.1 specifications. ASN.X, together with the
    Robust XML Encoding Rules (RXER), constitutes a schema language for XML documents
    that offers, through other ASN.1 encoding rules, alternative compact binary encodings
    for XML instance documents. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
