abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes new challenges for IoT services issued by the
    changes of the IoT environment. In order to address those new challenges, the
    integration of Edge computing and IoT has been emerged as a promising solution.
    This document provides the concept of IoT integrated with Edge computing as well
    as its use cases to discuss the benefits and challenges of Edge computing mainly
    focused on IoT data. The direction of Edge computing for IoT should be discussed
    in IETF/IRTF.</p>"
