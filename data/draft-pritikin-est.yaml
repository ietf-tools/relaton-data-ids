abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a protocol for certificate Enrollment over Secure
    Transport (EST). EST is a certificate enrollment protocol that operates over HTTPS,
    and thus should be trivially accessible by modern clients. The Certificate Management
    over CMS (CMC) "Simple PKI Request" and "Simple PKI Response" messages are leveraged.
    EST is designed to be easily implemented by clients and servers running other
    common enrollment mechanisms such as Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP).
    Renewal and rekey mechanisms are described consistent with Certificate Management
    Protocol (CMP).</p>
