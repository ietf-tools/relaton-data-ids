abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the standard algorithm that Transmission Control
    Protocol (TCP) senders are required to use to compute and manage their retransmission
    timer. It expands on the discussion in Section 4.2.3.1 of RFC 1122 and upgrades
    the requirement of supporting the algorithm from a SHOULD to a MUST. This document
    obsoletes RFC 2988. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
