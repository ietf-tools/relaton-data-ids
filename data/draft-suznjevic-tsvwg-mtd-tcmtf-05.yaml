abstract:
- content: <p>This document contains recommendations to be taken into account when
    using methods which optimize bandwidth utilization through Tunneling Compressing
    and Multiplexing (TCM) traffic flows over a network path. Different multiplexing
    policies and implementation issues which are service and link specific are discussed.
    Additionally, this document describes policies which can be used for detecting,
    classifying, and choosing the network flows suitable for optimization by using
    TCM. Finally, recommendations of maximum tolerable delays to be added by optimization
    techniques are reported. Recommendations are presented only for network services
    for which such bandwidth optimization techniques are applicable (i.e., services
    with low payload to header size ratio, which will also be denoted as "small-packet
    flows").</p>
