abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a sketch of a rendezvous protocol that allows
    constrained internet devices such as sensors to securely connect into a system
    that uses them. The solution is based on the idea that each device will be manufactured
    with a one time password that can be used by the customer to tell the device which
    controller to enroll with, and the device will be manufactured to contact a given
    Transfer Server that is used to tell the device which system to connect to. The
    administrator of the device will be able to get this one time password from the
    device using a QR code, and then will be able to use that one time password to
    inform a Transfer Server which system the device should connect to. The device
    will contact the Transfer Agent, get this information, and then connect to the
    appropriate system.</p>"
