abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Restconf subscription and push mechanisms to
    continuously stream information from YANG datastores over HTTP. These mechanisms
    allow client applications or operations support systems to request custom sets
    of updates from a YANG datastore. This document also specifies how to stream updates
    over HTTP without Restconf. In either case, updates are pushed by a datastore
    to a receiver per a subscription policy, without requiring continuous requests.</p>"
