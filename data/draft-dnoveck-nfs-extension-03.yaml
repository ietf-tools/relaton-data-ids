abstract:
- content: "<p>This document surveys the processes by which the NFS protocol has been
    extended in the past, including all of the NFS major and minor versions. It also
    looks forward to methods of protocol extension that might be used by NFS in the
    future. A particular focus is on how the minor versioning model of NFSv4 has worked
    and what is being done to enhance version management within NFSv4. The work already
    done in the new NFSv4 version management document is summarized, and there is
    a discussion of further issues the working group will need to address in moving
    that work forward.</p>"
