abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a lightweight and incremental approach to improving
    early cross-area review in the IETF. This proposal has two specific goals. Firstly,
    the current perception is that the IETF standardization process is bogged down
    and takes far too long. One factor in this slowness appears to be the workload
    placed upon the IESG when documents are brought to them. Given that one role of
    the IESG has been to provide cross-area review, offloading some portion of that
    work may increase the speed of the process. Secondly, cross-area review done early
    in the process may be a good tool for identifying significant problems with a
    Working Group's efforts long before the documents reach the IESG. As such, the
    early cross-area review can improve the quality of the output from the Working
    Group by sifting the wheat from the chaff.</p>"
