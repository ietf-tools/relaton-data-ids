abstract:
- content: "<p>In some environments where a mobile client joins a network via simple
    DHCP process, the serving network may want to know the mobile client's mobile
    subscription information. This is particularly useful when a mobile client switches
    to a private Wi-Fi network such as home network which uses simple SSID/Pre-Shared-Key
    combination. The network can use the mobile subscription information to identify
    the client's serving mobile network and provide service continuity.</p>"
