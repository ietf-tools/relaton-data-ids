abstract:
- content: "<p>While IP was designed around the notion that the network would be invisible
    to the applications that run on them, an increasingly complex service environment
    along with the compartmentalization of 'policy' into administrative domains has
    led to a proliferation of types of middleboxes for policy enforcement, and those
    middleboxes are interfering with applications. Applications now need to influ-
    ence the behavior of middleboxes, but violating network layering principles by
    establishing explicit communication channels from applications to network-layer
    middleboxes introduces a new set of problems related to topology and discovery
    as well as consequent problems that ripple out from those. This paper is an introductory
    examination of whether or not there is a better way.</p>"
