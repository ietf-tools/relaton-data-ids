abstract:
- content: "<p>This document examines the requirements for Distributed Conferencing
    (DCON). Separate documents will map the requirements to existing protocol primitives,
    define new protocol extensions, and introduce new protocols as needed. Together,
    these documents will provide a guideline for building interoperable conferencing
    applications. The current works in SIPPING and XCON working groups marginally
    address the matter, which is nonetheless considered as out-of-scope. The requirements
    listed in this document are in part based on thoughts derived from the cited working
    groups activities.</p>"
