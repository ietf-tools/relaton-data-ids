abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the Protected Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (PEAP) Version 2, which provides an encrypted and authenticated tunnel
    based on transport layer security (TLS) that encapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms.
    PEAPv2 uses TLS to protect against rogue authenticators, protect against various
    attacks on the confidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange
    and provide EAP peer identity privacy. PEAPv2 also provides support for chaining
    multiple EAP mechanisms, cryptographic binding between authentications performed
    by inner EAP mechanisms and the tunnel, exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs),
    and fragmentation and reassembly.</p>"
