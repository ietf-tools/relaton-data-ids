abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the main scenarios related to AI services
    in WAN, as well as the requirements for FANTEL(FAst Notification for Traffic Engineering
    and Load balancing) in these scenarios. Traditional network management mechanisms
    are often constrained by slow feedback and high overhead, limiting their ability
    to react quickly to sudden link failures, congestion, or load imbalances. Therefore,
    these new AI services need FANTEL to provide real-time and proactive notifications
    for traffic engineering and load balancing, meeting the ultra-high throughput
    and lossless data transmission requirements of these AI service scenarios.</p>"
