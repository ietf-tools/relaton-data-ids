abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for authentication of the source
    of a stream of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets. The mechanism provides
    sender-specific authentication, non-repudiation, and replay protection services
    for both unicast and multicast RTP streams. This mechanism is based upon the stream
    signing scheme of Wong and Lam [WL]. These authentication services extend the
    RTP profile for audio and video conferences with minimal control [Schulzrinne96,
    Schulzrinne99]. Authentication covers all RTP payload types, and may be applied
    in conjunction with the RTP confidentiality service. Key management and negotiation
    of the authentication mechanism parameters are not addressed in this document.</p>"
