abstract:
- content: "<p>Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve
    the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share expected application
    needs, and thus to provide differentiated service to a flow and to packets within
    a flow. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet
    prioritization), the server (e.g., adaptive transmission), or both. This document
    describes how clients can communicate with their nearby network elements so they
    can learn network constraints. Optionally, with QUIC server support their incoming
    QUIC packets can be mapped to metadata about their contents so packet importance
    can influence both intentional and reactive management policies. The framework
    handles both directions of a flow.</p>"
