abstract:
- content: "<p>The pre-requisite for IP based seamless mobility protocols is the knowledge
    of the access router (AR) to which a mobile node can be handed over to. Further,
    a handoff can be optimized if the capabilities of the AR being considered for
    handoff are known. The protocol which discovers ARs for potential handoff along
    with their capabilities is called the CAR discovery protocol. In this draft we
    list the requirements which are to be met by any solution for CAR Discovery.</p>"
