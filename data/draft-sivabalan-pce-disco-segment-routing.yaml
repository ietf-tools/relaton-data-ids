abstract:
- content: "<p>When a PCE is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in Interior
    Gateway Protocol (IGP), or a server participating in IGP, its presence and path
    computation capabilities can be advertised using IGP flooding. Such IGP extensions
    exist for OSPF and ISIS to advertise several such capabilities. Segment Routing
    (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling pardigms in which a node steers
    a packet through the network using segments. A segment can be an MPLS label or
    IPv6 header with a new extension. In SR networks, a PCE can be used to compute
    paths using SR PCEP extension. This document specifies additional capability to
    advertise a PCE that supports the new SR PCEP extension.</p>"
