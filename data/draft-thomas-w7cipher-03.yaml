abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the W7 cipher algorithm. The W7 algorithm is
    a byte-wide, synchronous stream cipher optimized for efficient hardware implementation
    at very high data rates. It is a symmetric key algorithm supporting key lengths
    of 128 bits. In addition to the algorithm specification, this document contains
    test vectors and a representative software implementation in the C language.</p>"
