abstract:
- content: "<p>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned to one interface
    of a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) and different mobile nodes
    can not share this home network prefix. Managing per-MN's interface home network
    prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the LMA. Based on the idea
    that Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers can manage
    prefixes, we propose a new technique in which LMA offloads delegation and release
    tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server. LMA requests a prefix for an incoming
    mobile node to the DHCPv6 server. Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create
    a home address for its interface. When the mobile station leaves the network,
    the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. Authentication, Authorization and
    Accounting (AAA) servers can also play a role in prefix delegation.</p>"
