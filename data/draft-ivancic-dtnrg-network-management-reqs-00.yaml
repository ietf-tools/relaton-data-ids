abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains four main sections. The first section provide
    some a short introduction of what Delay (or Disruption or Disconnected) Networking
    is. The second section describes various DTN operational environments. The third
    section provides requirements and desired properties for managing Delay and Disruption
    Tolerant Networks. The fourth section describes characteristics that can be found
    in DTN systems and suggests items that should be considered for monitoring and/or
    configuration.</p>"
