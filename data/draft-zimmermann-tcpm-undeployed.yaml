- content: "<p>This document reclassifies several TCP extensions that have either
    been superceded or never seen widespread use to Historic status. The affected
    RFCs are RFC 675, RFC 721, RFC 879, RFC 1078, and RFC 6013. Additionally, it reclassifies
    RFC 813, RFC 814, RFC 816, RFC 817, RFC 872, RFC 896, and RFC 964 to Informational
    status. Most of those RFCs are today part of RFC 1122.</p>"
