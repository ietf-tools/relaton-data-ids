abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework for passive measurement. In particular,
    the differences between passive and active measurements are analyzed, general
    considerations for both metric definition and measurement methodology are discussed,
    and requirements for various entities performing a given passive measurement task
    are described according to a reference model.</p>"
