abstract:
- content: "<p>The Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem protocol defines a key distribution
    protocol to provision an SSH server with user's public keys. However, that protocol
    is limited to provisioning an SSH server. This document describes extensions to
    this protocol to allow the provisioning of keys and certificates to a server using
    the SSH transport. The defined protocol extensions allow the calling client to
    organize keys and certificates in different namespaces on a server. These namespaces
    can be used by the server to allow a client to configure any application running
    on the server (e.g., SSH, KMIP, SNMP). The defined extensions provide a server-independent
    mechanism for clients to add public keys, remove public keys, add certificates,
    remove certificates, and list the current set of keys and certificates known by
    the server by namespace (e.g., list all public keys in the SSH namespace). Rights
    to manage keys and certificates in a specific namespace are specific and limited
    to the authorized user and are defined as part of the server's implementation.
    The described protocol is backward compatible to version 2 defined by RFC 4819.</p>"
