abstract:
- content: <p>This document reviews common Internet protocols and discusses how each
    protocol establishes, maintains, and tears down trust relationships within the
    protocol. This document includes discussion of "meta" trust issues, including
    extra-protocol trust creation, management, and destruction. In cases where specific
    issues related to establishment of trust have been documented, these are discussed
    as well. By examining both similarities and differences between different protocols,
    this document can help protocol designers and maintainers in IETF working groups
    learn from successful (and un- successful) Internet protocols.</p>
