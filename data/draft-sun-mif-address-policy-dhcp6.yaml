abstract:
- content: "<p>For hosts with multiple interfaces, the problem is how to make it run
    several applications simultaneously on variant interfaces such as GPRS, Wifi etc.
    To achieve this, one way is to select appropriate IP address so that the packets
    can be sent to the corresponding interface for forwarding. RFC 3484 defines a
    ''policy table'' for default IP address selection. This document extends the DHCPv6
    option message so that the policy table can be dynamically updated.</p>"
