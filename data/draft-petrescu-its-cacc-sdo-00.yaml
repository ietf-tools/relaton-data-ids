abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise
    Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development Organizations
    such as ETSI, IEEE 1609, SAE and 3GPP. C-ACC and Platooning involve concepts of
    direct vehicle-to-vehicle, and device-to-device communications, which are developped
    by 3GPP and precursory by the METIS EU project. They are illustrated very clearly
    in emergency settings such as FirstNet. IP messages - instead of link-layer messages
    - are pertinent for C-ACC and Platooning use-cases because applications for road
    safety such as WAZE, iRezQ and Coyote (currently involving infrastructure) are
    IP messages, and proved succesful in deployments. Applications such as Sentinel
    are direct between vehicles but are not IP, currently.</p>"
