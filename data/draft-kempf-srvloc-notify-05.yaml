abstract:
- content: "<p>The Service Location Protocol (SLP) provides mechanisms whereby service
    agent clients can advertise and user agent clients can query for services. The
    design is very much demand-driven, so that user agents only obtain service information
    when they specifically ask for it. There exists another class of user agent applications,
    however, that requires notification when a new service appears or disappears.
    In the RFC 2608 design, these applications are forced to poll the network to catch
    changes. In this document, we describe a protocol for allowing such clients to
    be notified when a change occurs, removing the need for polling. This memo defines
    an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
