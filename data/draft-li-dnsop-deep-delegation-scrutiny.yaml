abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) relies on caching to ensure its scalability
    and performance. However, certain behaviors in the DNS delegation and caching
    mechanisms can be exploited to circumvent domain name revocation. A recently discovered
    attack, named PHOENIX DOMAIN T2, allows a malicious domain that has been revoked
    at its parent zone to remain resolvable for an extended period. This is achieved
    by creating a chain of deeply nested subdomains, effectively keeping the delegation
    information alive in recursive resolver caches. This document describes the PHOENIX
    DOMAIN T2 attack mechanism and proposes a set of operational best practices for
    DNS recursive resolver operators to mitigate this threat. The primary recommendation
    is for resolvers to apply additional scrutiny to domain names with an excessive
    number of labels, which is a key characteristic of this attack.</p>"
