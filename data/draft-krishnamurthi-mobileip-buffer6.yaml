abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time applications like VoIP in mobile networks need smooth handovers
    in order to minimize or eliminate packet loss as a mobile node (MN) transitions
    between network links. This document defines a buffering mechanism for IPv6 by
    which an MN can request that the router on its current subnet buffers packets
    on its behalf while the MN completes registration procedures with the router of
    a new subnet. Once the registration is complete and the MN has a valid care-of
    address in the new network, the buffered packets can be forwarded from the previous
    router, thus reducing the possibility of packet loss during the transition</p>"
