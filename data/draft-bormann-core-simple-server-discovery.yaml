abstract:
- content: "<p>CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking.
    Many applications also need a simple form of discovery for the servers carrying
    these resources. This specification shows a simple way to extend the link-based
    resource discovery into a basic form of server discovery. The current version
    -01 of this document continues an initial draft that is intended to spark discussion.</p>"
