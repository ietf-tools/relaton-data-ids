abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol
    is a solution for least cost transparent frame routing in multi-hop networks with
    arbitrary topologies and link technologies, using IS-IS (Intermediate System to
    Intermediate System) link-state routing and encapsulation with a hop count. IS-IS
    supports multiple topology routing. This document specifies a TRILL data plane
    encoding and procedures to make use of such routing.</p>"
