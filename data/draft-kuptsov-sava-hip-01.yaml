abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for the source address validation
    with help of Host Identity Protocol (HIP), SAVAH. The architecture utilizes the
    properties of cryptographically strong protocol to authenticate an originator
    of a network communication. In addition this architecture offers network access
    control, data protection, host mobilty and multihoming features and is suitable
    for the wireless networks. The proposed, architecture is the first-hop router
    solution, meaning that it should be deployed on the router placed on the edge
    of a local network topology.</p>"
