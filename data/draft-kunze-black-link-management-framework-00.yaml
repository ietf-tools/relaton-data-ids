abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework that describes a solution space
    for the control and management of optical interfaces according to the Black Link
    approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU.G698.2] and beyond (friendly wavelength).
    In particular, it examines topological elements and related network management
    measures. Optical Routing and Wavelength assignment based on WSON is out of scope.
    This document concentrates on the management of optical interfaces. The application
    of a dynamic control plane, e.g. for auto-discovery or for the distribtion of
    interface parameters, is complementary. Anyway, this work is not in conflict with
    WSON but leverages and supports related work already done for management plane
    and control plane. Furthermore, support for Fast Fault Detection, to e.g. trigger
    Protection Switching is provided by the WDM interface capability of the client
    interface (e.g. ITU-T G.709) is out of scope for this work. Additionally the wavelength
    ordering process and the process how to determine the demand for a new wavelength
    from A to Z is out of scope.</p>"
