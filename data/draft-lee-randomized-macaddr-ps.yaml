abstract:
- content: "<p>MAC Addresses are Link Layer addresses used in IEEE Ethernet, WiFi,
    and other link layer protocols. A MAC Address is a fixed locally unique address
    assigned by the Network Interface Card (NIC) manufacturer, though they may be
    modified by an operating system, and they enable a device to connect to a network.
    Due to the static nature of a MAC Address, it raises some privacy concerns that
    have led to randomization of MAC Addresses by operating systems. This draft documents
    the impacts of MAC Address randomization to existing use cases of network and
    application services and proposes few next steps IETF may consider working on.</p>"
