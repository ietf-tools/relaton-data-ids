abstract:
- content: "<p>To-date, no intrinsic mechanisms exist for pseudowires that allow operators
    to measure the performance of a pseudowire. Only the existing Virtual Circuit
    Connectivity Verification protocol allows for the verification of connectivity
    of a pseudowire. This document defines the problems that must be solved in this
    space, and provides discussion points around the issues of pseudowire performance
    measurement, including timing synchronization and packet loss detection.</p>"
