abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a protocol for selectively reliable transmission
    of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) data in a wide-area multicast environment.
    The Selectively Reliable Transmission Protocol (SRTP) operates in three distinct
    modes: best-effort multicast, reliable multicast using negative acknowledgements
    with a NAK suppression mechanism to avoid congestion at the sender, and lightweight
    reliable transaction-oriented unicast. SRTP is designed to run in user space and
    form a sublayer between applications and the kernel-level Internet protocol stack.</p>"
