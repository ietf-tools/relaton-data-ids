abstract:
- content: "<p>The protocol described in this document provides the basis for the
    IP Device Control (IPDC) family of protocols. The IPDC protocols are proposed
    as a protocol suite, components of which can be used individually or together
    to perform connection control, media control, and signaling transport for environments
    where the service control logic is separated from the network access server. Please
    see the references section for other IPDC documents. According to the framework
    provided by Cuervo et al [1], the IPDC protocol suite operates between the Media
    Gateway Controller and the Media Gateway. In terms of previous contributions to
    the experts of Questions 13-14/16, the corresponding entities are the Call Control
    and Media Control portions of the H.323 Gateway. The operation of IPDC in the
    service of H.323 is clarified in a companion contribution entitled 'IPDC Architectural
    Framework' [3].</p>"
