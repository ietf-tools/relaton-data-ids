abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a derived PNAT mechanism that hosts do not
    need IPv4 addresses, neither public, private nor faked IPv4 address. PNAT solution
    was first proposed by Huang &amp; Deng in [PNAT], which provides application-level
    transparency for hosts in IPv4 and IPv6 hybrid environments via host-based IPv4/IPv6
    translation technique. This specification addresses one of the PNAT scenarios
    where a host is provided IPv6 only network connectivity. Two IPv6 addresses will
    be assigned to a PNAT host. One is native IPv6 address, and the other is a PNAT
    IPv6 address. In this case, IPv4- originated communications still need to be translated
    into IPv6. However, the host does not need to be assigned an IPv4 address. Instead,
    a PNAT IPv6 address will take the place of the originally required IPv4 address.Two
    formats of PNAT IPv6 address,4rd (IPv4 Rapid Deployment) address and 4rm (IPv4
    Rapid Migration) address, are defined. The advantage of the derived PNAT mechanism
    is that such IPv6 PNAT host supports both IPv4 and IPv6 applications, with SIMPLICITY,
    SCALABILITY and without worrying about any IPv4 address allocating issue.</p>"
