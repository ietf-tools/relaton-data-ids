abstract:
- content: "<p>The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency
    Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group describes an
    architecture where location information is provided by access networks to end
    points in order to determine the correct dial string and information to route
    the call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). For determining the PSAP Uniform
    Resource Identifier (URI) the usage of the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST)
    Protocol is envisioned. This document explores the architectural impact for the
    IETF emergency services architecture for situations where the Internet Access
    Provider (IAP) and/or the Internet Service Provider (ISP) are only willing to
    disclose limited or no location information. This document provides a problem
    statement and lists requirements.</p>"
