abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the SMI textual coventions required to support
    the definition of IPsec MIBs. It is necessary to separate the definition of the
    textual conventions into a separate document due to their dependence on IANA assigned
    numbers for transforms and Diffie-Hellman groups supported by IPsec protocol.</p>"
