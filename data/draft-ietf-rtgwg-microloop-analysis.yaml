abstract:
- content: "<p>Link-state routing protocols (e.g. OSPF or IS-IS) are known to converge
    to a loop-free state within a finite period of time after a change in the topology.
    It is normal, however, to observe short-term loops during the period of topology
    update propagation, route recalculation, and forwarding table update, due to the
    asynchronous nature of link-state protocol operation. This document provides an
    analysis of formation of such microloops and suggests simple mechanisms to minimize
    them.</p>"
