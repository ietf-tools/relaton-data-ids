abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for the PSAMP (Packet SAMPling)
    protocol. The functions of this protocol are to select packets from a stream according
    to a set of standardized Selectors, to form a stream of reports on the selected
    packets, and to export the reports to a Collector. This framework details the
    components of this architecture, then describes some generic requirements, motivated
    by the dual aims of ubiquitous deployment and utility of the reports for applications.
    Detailed requirements for selection, reporting, and exporting are described, along
    with configuration requirements of the PSAMP functions. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
