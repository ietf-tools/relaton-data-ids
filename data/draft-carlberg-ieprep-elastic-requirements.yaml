abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this draft is to present a set of requirements to
    address requests by users of authorized emergency communications for better than
    best effort service for elastic service. We stress the word 'request' versus guarantee,
    and we do NOT advocate broad sweeping changes to elastic applications. This document
    provides background information on emergency communications and presents suggested
    do's and don'ts in addressing the issue of requirements for elastic services.
    Finally, examples of requirements for specific applications are presented.</p>"
