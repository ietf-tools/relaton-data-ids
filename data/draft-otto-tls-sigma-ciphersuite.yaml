abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a TLS ciphersuite which is based on the SIGMA
    protocol. By its careful adoption in the TLS handshake protocol, the proposed
    ciphersuite is able to inherit features of the SIGMA protocol. The ciphersuite
    provides active identity protection, forward secrecy, deniability and adjustable
    security strength. A similar ciphersuite offering these features has not yet been
    proposed so far.</p>"
