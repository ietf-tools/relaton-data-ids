abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) specification allows
    for the authentication of network management operations by a variety of authentication
    algorithms. This memo specifies alternatives to the trivial authentication algorithm.
    It also describes an abstract Authentication Service Interface (ASI) by which
    SNMP-based management applications or agents may--in a convenient and uniform
    way--benefit from the algorithms described here and a wide range of others. The
    terms of the ASI are used to describe three distinct algorithms, including one
    with support for privacy.</p>"
