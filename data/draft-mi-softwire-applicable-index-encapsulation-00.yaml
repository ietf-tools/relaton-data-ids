abstract:
- content: "<p>The Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation
    and translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions in order to be able to provide
    IPv4 connectivity to customers in an IPv6-Only environment. The purpose of this
    document is to describe the basic issues and key elements of the IPv4/IPv6 encapsulation,
    and presents its applicability index that would help the operators decide on the
    development scheme for their IPv6 transition.It could lead to significant operational
    benefits and potential savings for the operators.</p>"
