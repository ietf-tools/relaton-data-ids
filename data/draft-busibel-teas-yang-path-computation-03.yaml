abstract:
- content: "<p>There are scenarios, typically in a hierarchical SDN context, in which
    an orchestrator may not have detailed information to be able to perform an end-to-end
    path computation and would need to request lower layer/domain controllers to calculate
    some (partial) feasible paths. Multiple protocol solutions can be used for communication
    between different controller hierarchical levels. This document assumes that the
    controllers are communicating using YANG-based protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF).
    This document describes some use cases where a path computation request, via YANG-based
    protocols (e.g., NETCONF or RESTCONF), can be needed. This document also proposes
    a yang model for a stateless RPC which complements the stateful solution defined
    in [TE-TUNNEL].</p>"
