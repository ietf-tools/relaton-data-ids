abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of LIS for IP over ATM causes a topology mismatch between
    the link and the internetworking layer. While it introduces some inefficiency
    with CATENET based operation, it is not so much a problem unless we try to solve
    this minor problem. Short-cutting attempts such as NHRP can't solve the inefficiency
    issue at all even though, or, just because, it utterly destroys the CATENET model,
    which resulted in inelegant modifications of existing protocols, which, in turn,
    causes scalability problems. Moreover, the creation of short-cut VCs itself suffers
    a scalability issue. But, CSRs (Cell Switching Routers), or RSVP-signaled ATM
    switches, make it possible to have end-to-end cell-by-cell relaying over IP routers.
    That is, there is no reason to have LISes and there is no inefficiency The way
    to go for the Internet is Simple Unified Networking with the CATENET model.</p>"
