abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an IPv6 Provider-Independent global unicast address
    format for use in the Internet. The address format defined in this document is
    consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [2].
    It is designed to facilitate scalable Internet routing when sites attach to multiple
    service providers, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference to the site.
    A natural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is that all addresses
    are fixed allowing sites to change providers at will without requiring their network
    to renumber.</p>
