abstract:
- content: '<p>Moving the focus from nodes to information objects raises scalability
    issues because the number of addressable information objects is huge compared
    to the number of nodes, so scalable routing is an important challenge issue of
    ICN. There are two types of naming scheme which have been proposed in the ICN
    literatures: hierarchical and flat. To guarantee clean separation of identifier
    from locator and scalability of routing, we chose flat name and designed domain-based
    routing. A significant requisite to be considered when flat name is used is an
    efficient name-resolution system (NRS). Bloomfilter-based NRS [BF NRS] is our
    proposal to this issue. Once a name is resolved into locator(s), discovery and
    delivery steps are carried out based on the routing scheme of locator. For scalability
    in routing of locator, network is projected into hierarchically-organized domain
    structure. A domain is a group of nodes or other domains. This composition could
    be physical or logical. Each domain has its own identifier, and the concatenation
    of domain IDs from top level domain to a certain domain which a node belongs to
    plays the role of "locator" for that node. Each domain has one or more domain
    gateways. All traffic from/to the domain should pass through any of domain gateways.
    Routing information based on this type of locators is exchanged among domain gateways
    by using modified link-state routing protocol which can suppress LSA explosion
    [LSR]. Thanks to this hierarchical domain structure, locators are highly aggregatable
    (which means scalable routing), and any node in heterogeneous network can communicate
    each other.</p>'
