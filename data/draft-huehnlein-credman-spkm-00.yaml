abstract:
- content: "<p>The GSS-API [GSS-API1,2] offers security services independent of underlying
    mechanisms. A possible GSS-mechanism is the Simple Public Key Mechanism [SPKM].
    This paper complements [SPKM] by providing concrete rules for the Credential Management.
    Our proposal allows beside the standard Credential Management based on X.509v3
    [X509v3] and PKIX [PKIX] the self certification of temporary public keys, which
    may be used to implement a Secure Single Login variant, which works with temporary
    keys instead of the sensitive long term keys. The benefits of this approach are
    discussed in [SSLogin] more detailed. Since DL-based signature- and encryption
    algorithms are very well suited for the efficient generation of the temporary
    keys we propose two new RECOMMENDED algorithms for SPKM.</p>"
