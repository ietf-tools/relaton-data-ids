abstract:
- content: "<p>The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6
    is a subject of much debate. However, the big picture of the transition doesn't
    seem to have been discussed sufficiently. Therefore, different people have different
    assumptions on the process, which makes planning the transition architecture very
    difficult. This memo tries to point out some issues that will need consideration
    in the transition architecture.</p>"
