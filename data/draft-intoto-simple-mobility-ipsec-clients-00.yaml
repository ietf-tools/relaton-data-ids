abstract:
- content: "<p>One very popular use of VPNs is to provide telecommuter access to the
    corporate Intranet. Remote clients that are behind NAT boxes can also access the
    corporate intranet with the help of the standard NAT Traversal feature. But this
    access may be disturbed in scenarios where a mobile user roams across different
    points of attachment and there by getting assigned with different IP Addresses.
    The access also fails in cases where the client roams across environments with
    NAT to environments without NAT and vice versa. In both the cases the tunnel may
    get re-established but it induces jitter in voice sessions.</p>"
