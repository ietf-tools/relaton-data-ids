abstract:
- content: '<p>Recently, there has been a discussion on "Infrastructure-to- Application
    Information Exposure" and the related communications requirements in fully controlled
    (e.g. data centers) or partially controlled environments (e.g. CDN). One possibility
    to expose infrastructure information to applications in the aforementioned environments
    is to use yet-to-be-defined ALTO extensions. This draft discusses requirements
    for such ALTO extensions for a specific use case: Request Routing in CDN Interconnection
    (CDNI).</p>'
