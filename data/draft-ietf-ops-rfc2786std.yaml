abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines a textual convention for doing Diffie- Hellman key agreement key exchanges
    and a set of objects which extend the usmUserTable to permit the use of a DH key
    exchange in addition to the key change method described in [14]. In other words,
    this MIB adds the possibility of forward secrecy to the USM model. It also defines
    a set of objects that can be used to kick start security on an SNMPv3 agent when
    the out of band path is authenticated, but not necessarily private or confidential.
    The author is submitting this draft at the request of the O&amp;M area director.
    This memo revises and updates RFC 2786 [19] with the goal of moving the described
    protocol and MIB from Experimental to Standards Track. The one minor substantive
    change from the Experimental RFC is a restatement of the conditions on the selection
    of the DH public number (see DHKeyChange and usmDHKickstartMyPublic in the body
    of the MIB as well as the MIBs revision history). The spelling of 'Hellman' was
    corrected throughout. Author contact information was updated. Slight structural
    modifications were made to more cleanly seperate boilerplate from substantive
    text.</p>"
