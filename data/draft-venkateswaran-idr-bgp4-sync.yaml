abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP (Border gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol, which shares the
    information of its routing table on incremental basis. BGP needs to interact with
    the IGP peers within the autonomous system when all the routers inside the autonomous
    system do not run BGP. This document provides a detailed implementation of synchronization
    in BGP. This document specifies some implementation specifics of synchronization
    and also throws some of the pros and cons involved in implementing synchronization.
    This also reveals the points to be taken care when transition happens from synchronization
    to No synchronization and vice versa. Some of the precautions that are to be taken
    before implementing synchronization in BGP are also highlighted here.</p>"
