abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format of an electronic signature that can
    remain valid over long periods. This includes evidence as to its validity even
    if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny (i.e., repudiates the
    validity of the signature). The format can be considered as an extension to RFC
    3369 and RFC 2634, where, when appropriate additional signed and unsigned attributes
    have been defined. The contents of this Informational RFC amounts to a transposition
    of the ETSI TS 101 733 V.1.6.3 (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures - CAdES) and
    is technically equivalent to it.</p>"
