abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft document contains the complete text of ISO/IEC International
    Standard 10747, which specifies an inter-domain routing protocol commonly referred
    to as 'IDRP'. It is made available in this form as part of an agreement between
    the Internet Society and ISO/IEC JTC1 (which is responsible for Information Technology
    standards as a joint activity of ISO and IEC). Those figures that could easily
    be rendered in ASCII are included, but it was not possible to create ASCII replicas
    for all figures included in the International Standard. The PostScript version
    of this document that includes all the figures is available (URL = ftp://merit.edu/pub/iso/idrp.ps.Z).</p>"
