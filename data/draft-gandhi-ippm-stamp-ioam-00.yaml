abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC 8762
    and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 can be used for Edge-To-Edge (E2E)
    active measurement. In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
    data fields defined in RFC 9197 and RFC 9326 can be used for recording and collecting
    Hop-By-Hop (HBH) and E2E operational and telemetry information. This document
    extends STAMP to carry IOAM data fields for HBH and E2E two-way active measurement
    and telemetry. The STAMP extensions are generic and allow to carry and reflect
    any type of IPv6 option and MPLS Network Action Sub-Stacks for two-way active
    measurement.</p>"
