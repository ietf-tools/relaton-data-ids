abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies two extensions to HIP to implement multi-hop
    routing. The first extension allows a HIP packet to carry the list of hosts that
    forwarded it. The second extension allows implementing source routing in HIP.
    That is, a host sending a HIP packet can define a set of hosts that the HIP packet
    should traverse.</p>"
