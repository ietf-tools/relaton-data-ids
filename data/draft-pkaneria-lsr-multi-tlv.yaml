abstract:
- content: "<p>New technologies are adding new information into IS-IS while deployment
    scales are simultaneously increasing, causing the contents of many critical TLVs
    to exceed the currently supported limit of 255 octets. Extensions such as [RFC7356]
    require significant IS-IS changes that could help address the problem, but a less
    drastic solution would be beneficial. This document codifies the common mechanism
    of extending the TLV content space through multiple TLVs.</p>"
