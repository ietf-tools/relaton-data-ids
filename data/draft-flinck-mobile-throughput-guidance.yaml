abstract:
- content: <p>The bandwidth available for end user devices in cellular networks can
    vary by an order of magnitude over a few seconds due to changes in the underlying
    radio channel conditions, as device mobility and changes in system load as other
    devices enter and leave the network. Furthermore, packets losses are not always
    signs of congestion. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) can have difficulties
    adapting to these rapidly varying conditions leading to inefficient use of a cellular
    network's resources and degraded application performance. Problem statement, requirements
    and the architecture for a solution is documented in [Req_Arch_MTG_Exposure].
    This document proposes a mechanism and protocol elements that allow the cellular
    network to provide near real-time information on capacity available to the TCP
    server. This "Throughput Guidance" (TG) information would indicate the throughput
    estimated to be available at the radio downlink interface (between the Radio Access
    Network (RAN) and the mobile device (UE)). TCP server can use this TG information
    to ensure high network utilization and high service delivery performance. The
    document describes the applicability of the proposed mechanism for video delivery
    over cellular networks; it also presents test results from live operator's environment.</p>
