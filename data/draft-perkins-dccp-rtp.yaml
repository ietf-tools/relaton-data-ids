abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely used transport for
    real-time media on IP networks. The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
    is a newly defined transport protocol that provides desirable services for real-time
    applications. This memo specifies a mapping of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated
    signalling, such that real-time applications can make use of the services provided
    by DCCP.</p>"
