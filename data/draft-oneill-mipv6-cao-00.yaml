abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 and MIPv6 has constrained the HoA to being used within forward
    and reverse tunnels via the HA. In the unicast case, the MN can then activate
    Route Optimisation to bypass the HA in both directions by securely installing
    a Binding Cache Entry into the CN. The MN then sends from the CCoA source address
    to the CN directly into the foreign multicast system, and includes the Home Address
    Option (HAO) so that the changing CCoA is masked from the transport layer. This
    draft defines the Care of Address Option, which carries the current CCoA of the
    MN. The CAO can be included in a Hop By Hop Header or Destination header and used
    instead of the packet source address for unicast ingress filtering and multicast
    RPF purposes. This enables a MN to potentially use the HoA as a source address
    on the foreign network, and to inform the CNs of the evolving MN location.</p>"
