abstract:
- content: "<p>JavaScript Object Notation, JSON (RFC7159) is a text-based data format
    which is popular for Web based data exchange. Concise Binary Object Representation,
    CBOR (RFC7049) is a binary data format which has been optimized for data exchange
    for the Internet of Things (IoT). For many IoT scenarios, CBOR formats will be
    preferred since it can help decrease transmission payload sizes as well as implementation
    code sizes compared to other data formats. Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way
    to represent links between Web resources as well as the relations expressed by
    them and attributes of such a link. In constrained networks, a collection of Web
    links can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (RFC6690). Outside of constrained
    environments, it may be useful to represent these collections of Web links in
    JSON, and similarly, inside constrained environments, in CBOR. This specification
    defines a common format for this. Group Communication for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (RFC7390) defines a number of JSON formats for controlling communication
    between groups of nodes employing the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).
    In a similar vein, this specification defines CBOR variants of these formats.</p>"
