abstract:
- content: "<p>The Transport Profile of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS- TP)
    is a packet-based transport technology based on the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE)
    and Pseudowire (PW) data plane architectures applicable in various deployment
    environments. This document describes the allocation of an Associated Channel
    Type to support ITU-T defined functions for packet transport network (PTN) applications,
    such as Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM), and applicable to MPLS-TP
    Pseudowires (PWs), Label Switched Paths (LSPs), Sub-path Maintenance Elements
    (SPMEs) and Sections. This document is intended to become a product of a joint
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union
    Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
    Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</p>"
