abstract:
- content: "<p>Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been considered
    in G.709. Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing would be desirable to facilitate
    the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without
    having to upgrade every node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into
    ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and transit across the 2.5G TS region. Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing
    are also used to support the multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel
    design. If there are a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints
    (or even part of an overall path), it may be convenient from a management perspective
    to first multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2 or ODU3 to minimize
    the number of connections that need to be made in intermediate nodes. The ODU2/ODU3
    effectively creates a tunnel through the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and
    ODUflex can use. This document describes the requirement of multi stages multiplexing
    configuration assocaited with some specific scenarios in G.709 Optical Transport
    Network.</p>"
