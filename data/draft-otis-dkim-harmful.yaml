abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, email lacks conventions ensuring SMTP clients can be identified
    by an authenticated domain. Unfortunately many hope to use DKIM as an alternative,
    but it is independent of intended recipients and domains accountable for having
    sent the message. This means DKIM is poorly suited at establishing abuse assessments
    of unsolicited commercial email otherwise known as SPAM, nor was this initially
    DKIM's intent. DKIM lacks message context essential to ensure fair assessment
    and to ensure this assessment is not poisoned (Who initiated the transaction and
    to whom). DKIM was instead intended to establish increased levels of trust based
    upon valid DKIM signatures controlling acceptance and what a user sees within
    the FROM header field. But DKIM failed to guard against pre-pended header fields
    where any acceptance based on valid DKIM signatures is sure to exclude header
    field spoofing, especially that of the FROM. This weakness allows malefactors
    to exploit DKIM signature acceptance established by high-volume DKIM domains to
    spoof ANY other domain, even when prohibited within the Signer's network.</p>"
