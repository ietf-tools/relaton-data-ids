abstract:
- content: "<p>Network path validation refers to a technology that ensures data packets
    to strictly travel along a chosen network path. It aims to enforce data to travel
    only on the assigned network path and provide evidence that the data has indeed
    followed this path. While existing efforts primarily focus on the control plane,
    path validation protects and monitors routing security in the data plane. This
    document provides a technical definition of the Network Path Validation problem,
    briefly overviews past efforts, models its ideal solution and design goals, and
    lists out different use case across various layers of the Internet.</p>"
