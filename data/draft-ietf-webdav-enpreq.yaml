abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements for an Event Notification
    Protocol. The objective is to provide a simple, scalable and highly efficient
    notification protocol while also providing the appropriate flexibility to meet
    the needs of both the Internet and enterprise environments. Intent of this document
    is to collect all notification requirements in one place and leverage the work
    already done in other working groups. This document is one of a set of documents
    which together describe all aspects of a new Event Notification Protocol (ENP).
    ENP is an application level protocol that can be used for distributed event notification.
    The full set of ENP documents include: (1). Requirements for Event Notification
    Protocol (2). Model and Semantics Event Notification Protocol (3). Protocol Specification
    for Event Notification Protocol (4). Rationale for the Structure and Model for
    the Event Notification Protocol</p>"
