abstract:
- content: <p>Reducing technology's carbon footprint is one of the big challenges
    of our age. Networks are an enabler of applications that reduce this footprint,
    but also contribute to this footprint substantially themselves. Many of the biggest
    opportunities to reduce this footprint may not be management or even networking
    specific, for instance general power efficiency gains in hardware or deployment
    of equipment in more energy-efficient buildings. However, methods to make networking
    technology itself "greener" and in particular to manage networks in ways that
    reduces their carbon footprint without impacting their utility also need to be
    explored. This document outlines a corresponding set of opportunities, along with
    associated research challenges, for networking technology in general and management
    technology in particular to become "greener" and reduce network carbon footprint.</p>
