abstract:
- content: "<p>In its current form, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows session
    invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered from one party
    to another. However it doesnot explicitly permit midcall events such as hook/flash
    from the user to be passed on to the network application server. Without such
    ability, it is not clear how SIP can be used to provide certain network controlled
    services. This document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP
    to provide a MidCall-based communications framework.</p>"
