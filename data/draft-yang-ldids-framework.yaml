abstract:
- content: "<p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to detect intrusions
    and protect the relative network or hosts. Now the network scale is becoming larger
    and larger, Large-scale Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems, which are IDSs
    that work in such environments, are the trends of IDSs evolution. This document
    describes a hierarchy framework for Large-scale Distributed Intrusion Detection
    Systems, with which a Large-scale Distributed IDS can be flexibly deployed. Each
    node in this framework can be seen as a simple IDS. This document gives a four-layer
    structure for the simple IDS. This four-layer structure can also be the structure
    of an independent IDS.</p>"
