abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community, that is targeted
    at increasing scalability of network monitoring via SNMP. In particular, the MIB
    module defined in this document describes a set of managed objects that allow
    to define a check procedure on a managed device. The result of the check is accumulated
    into a single managed object that can be read by a manager instead of reading
    all individual managed objects to be checked during the check procedure.</p>"
