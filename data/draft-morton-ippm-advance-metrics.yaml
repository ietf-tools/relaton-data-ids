abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric RFCs
    along the standards track. Observing that the metric definitions themselves should
    be the primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo describes
    results of example lab test procedures to evaluate specific metric RFC requirement
    clauses to determine if the requirement has been implemented as intended. A single
    implementation has been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2679 on One-way
    Delay.</p>"
