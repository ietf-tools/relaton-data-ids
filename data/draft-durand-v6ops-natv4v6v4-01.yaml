abstract:
- content: "<p>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been to say that dual
    stack was the answer to IPv6 transition and that most things would be converted
    to dual stack way before we ran out of IPv4. Well, it has not happened. We are
    going to run out of IPv4 addresses soon, way before any significant IPv6 deployment
    will have occured. However, the quasi totality of the Internet and most of the
    computers in the home are still IPv4-only. Several distributed NAT architectures,
    based on different possible flavors of a carrier-grade NAT, are presented as solutions
    to maintain some form of connectivity between those home environments and the
    legacy Internet.</p>"
