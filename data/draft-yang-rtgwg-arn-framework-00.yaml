abstract:
- content: "<p>With progress of more and more new technologies have been deployed
    in large scale, such as SRv6 and network slicing, it is highly desirable to open
    these new capability to applications. Current practice is using ACLs to classify
    the packet and then map those traffic onto proper network resources. This is the
    way the application is passively perceived by the network, rather than the application
    actively calling the network, and changes in application characteristics require
    triggering network configuration adjustments, making it difficult to deploy at
    scale. The document proposes a new framework called Application Request Network
    (ARN), by encapsulating more network functions into ARN ID, thus it opens up interfaces
    to applications. The vision is to enable applications to access network resources
    like they access an operating system.</p>"
