abstract:
- content: "<p>In a distributed, constraint-based routing environment, the information
    used to compute a path may be out of date. This means that Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) label switched path (LSP) setup requests may be blocked by links
    or nodes without sufficient resources. Crankback is a scheme whereby setup failure
    information is returned from the point of failure to allow new setup attempts
    to be made avoiding the blocked resources. Crankback can also be applied to LSP
    restoration to indicate the location of the failed link or node. This document
    specifies crankback signaling extensions for use in MPLS signaling using RSVP-TE
    as defined in 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels', RFC3209, so that
    the LSP setup request can be retried on an alternate path that detours around
    blocked links or nodes. This offers significant improvements in the successful
    setup and recovery ratios for LSPs, especially in situations where a large number
    of setup requests are triggered at the same time.</p>"
