- content: "<p>This document specifies an autonomic mechanism for resource-based network
    services deployment through the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) in an Autonomic
    Network. This mechanism uses the GRASP in [RFC8990] to exchange the information
    among the autonomic nodes so that the resource among the service path can be coordinated.</p>"
