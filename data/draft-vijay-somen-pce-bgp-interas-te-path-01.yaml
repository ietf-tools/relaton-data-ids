abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability to compute an optimal path for setting up Traffic engineering
    Label Switched Paths spanning multiple autonomous systems managed by different
    operators has been a key requirement in MPLS and GMPLS networks. This document
    specifies a method of computing inter-AS paths consisting of a list of ASes to
    be traversed and a list of TE-Tunnels to be traversed in each AS. The method described
    here uses BGP speakers in the PCEs of each AS to distribute the inter-AS connectivity
    information and the TE-Tunnels in each AS to its neighbors to facilitate the construction
    of an inter-AS topology graph which can be used for computing inter-AS paths.</p>"
