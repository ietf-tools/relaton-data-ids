abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) Scheme for the Reed-Solomon FEC codes over GF(2^^m), where m is in {2..16},
    and its application to the reliable delivery of data objects on the packet erasure
    channel (i.e., a communication path where packets are either received without
    any corruption or discarded during transmission). This document also describes
    a Fully-Specified FEC Scheme for the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8)
    when there is no encoding symbol group. Finally, in the context of the Under-Specified
    Small Block Systematic FEC Scheme (FEC Encoding ID 129), this document assigns
    an FEC Instance ID to the special case of Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^8). Reed-Solomon
    codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, i.e., they
    enable a receiver to recover the k source symbols from any set of k received symbols.
    The schemes described here are compatible with the implementation from Luigi Rizzo.
