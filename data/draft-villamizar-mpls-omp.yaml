abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS ingress routers may establish one or more explicit paths to a
    given egress to the MPLS domain. Load can be balanced across a com- plex topology
    using MPLS and the technique referred to here as MPLS-- OMP (Multiprotocol Label
    Switching -- Optimized Multipath). The tech- nique requires the use of a link
    state interior gateway protocol (IGP) such as OSPF or IS--IS with extensions to
    the link state protocol to flood loading information. It requires the ingress
    router be capa- ble of computing a hash with a sufficiently fine level of granularity
    based on the IP source and destination and selecting a forwarding entry based
    on the outcome of the hash. MPLS Optimized Mulitpath is an extension to MPLS.
    MPLS-OMP requires no additions or modification to the MPLS protocols. MPLS-OMP
    does require that the IGP be capable of flooding loading information as described
    in the OSPF-OMP and ISIS-OMP documents. At the MPLS ingress an algorithm is applied
    to select alternate paths where needed and adjust forwarding. Forwarding is adjusted
    gradually enough to insure stability yet fast enough to track long term changes
    in loading. The load adjustment algorithm itself is fully defined in a related
    docu- ment describing OSPF--OMP. The application of this technique to MPLS is
    described here.</p>"
