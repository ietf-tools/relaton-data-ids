abstract:
- content: "<p>High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) represent a critical
    infrastructure for the modern global research and education community, facilitating
    collaboration across national and international boundaries. These networks, such
    as Janet, ESnet, GÃ‰ANT, Internet2, CANARIE, and others, are designed to support
    the general needs of the research and education users they serve but also the
    the transmission of vast amounts of data generated by scientific research, high-performance
    computing, distributed AI-training and large-scale simulations. This document
    provides an overview of the terminology and techniques used for existing HP-WANS.
    It also explores the technological advancements, operational tools, and future
    directions for HP-WANs, emphasising their role in enabling cutting-edge scientific
    research, big data analysis, AI training and massive industrial data analysis.</p>"
