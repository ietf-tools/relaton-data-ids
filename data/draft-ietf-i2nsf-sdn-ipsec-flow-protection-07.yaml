abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how providing IPsec-based flow protection by
    means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller (aka. Security Controller)
    and establishes the requirements to support this service. It considers two main
    well-known scenarios in IPsec: (i) gateway-to- gateway and (ii) host-to-host.
    The SDN-based service described in this document allows the distribution and monitoring
    of IPsec information from a Security Controller to one or several flow-based Network
    Security Function (NSF). The NSFs implement IPsec to protect data traffic between
    network resources. The document focuses on the NSF Facing Interface by providing
    models for configuration and state data required to allow the Security Controller
    to configure the IPsec databases (SPD, SAD, PAD) and IKEv2 to establish Security
    Associations with a reduced intervention of the network administrator.</p>"
