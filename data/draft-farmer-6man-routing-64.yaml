abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a common misconception that the IPv6 Addressing Architecture
    requires the use of only /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing. This document
    clarifies the characterization of the relationship between IPv6 routing and the
    64 bit boundary, which is that of a recommendation for the use of /64 subnet prefixes
    for subnet routing in most circumstances, not a requirement for such. To further
    clarify this relationship, the document also provides operational guidance for
    the configuration of subnet prefixes and updates RFC 4291 accordingly.</p>"
