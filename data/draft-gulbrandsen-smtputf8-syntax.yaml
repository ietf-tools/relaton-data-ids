abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible
    enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while avoiding confusing
    or risky elements. This is one of a pair of documents: This is simple to implement,
    contains only globally viable rules and is intended to be usable for software
    such an MTA. Its companion defines has more complex rules, takes regional usage
    into account and aims to allow only addresses that are readable and cut-and-pastable
    to some audience.</p>"
