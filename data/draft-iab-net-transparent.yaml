abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a review of previous IAB statements on Internet
    transparency, as well a discussion of new transparency issues. Far from having
    lessened in relevance, technical implications of intentionally or inadvertently
    impeding network transparency play a critical role in the Internet's ability to
    support innovation and global communication. This document provides some specific
    illustrations of those potential impacts. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
