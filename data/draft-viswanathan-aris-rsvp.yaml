abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism for establishing a switched path with
    guaranteed Quality of Service for RSVP [1] flows in an integrated switch-router
    environment. It proposes an extension to the RSVP protocol that allows establishment
    of a sequence of virtual connections along the hop-by-hop routed path by enabling
    adjacent nodes to exchange Layer-2 labels. The labels correspond to information
    that identifies the virtual connections; for example, the VPI/VCI value in the
    case of an ATM-based Layer-2 infrastructure.</p>"
