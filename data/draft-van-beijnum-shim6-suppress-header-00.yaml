abstract:
- content: <p>The shim6 protocol defines a header that contains a "context tag" that
    identifies packets as belonging to a certain shim6 context that exists between
    two hosts. It has been suggested that this shim6 header is inserted between the
    IPv6 header and the upper layer protocol such as TCP in all packets where the
    shim layer has rewritten the source and/or destination address. This document
    considers the suppression of this header in situations where packets can be successfully
    demultiplexed by the receiver without it.</p>
