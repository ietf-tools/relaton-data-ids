abstract:
- content: <p>When publishing mechanically verified mathematics on the Internet, there
    is a need for referencing previously published documents. As an example, referenced
    documents may contain needed definitions, lemmas, and proofs. References from
    one mechanically verified document to another is much like any other Uniform Resource
    Locator, but there is a need to ensure that referenced documents do not change
    after publication. This is so because otherwise a change of e.g. a definition
    in a referenced document could invalidate the correctness of a referencing document.
    The present document describes the protocol used by an experimental system named
    "Logiweb" which allows to publish mechanically verified, immutable mathematical
    documents.</p>
