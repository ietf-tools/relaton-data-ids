abstract:
- content: "<p>Some users need to choose nodes that meet security requirements to
    form secure paths and ensure that traffic can defend against dynamic attacks during
    path forwarding. In this architecture, there are four roles defined: attester,
    authorizer, controller and secfunction, the interaction of these four roles can
    achieve the selection of secure paths and security services. the purpose of this
    architecture is to secure the path, including node static security assessment,
    dynamic security defense, and path and service validation.</p>"
