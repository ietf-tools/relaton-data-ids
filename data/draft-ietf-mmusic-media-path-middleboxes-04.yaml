abstract:
- content: "<p>Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functions
    apart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the data path between
    a source host and destination host. Two such functions are network address translation
    and firewalling. When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact
    with NATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, then problems
    may occur in the transport of media traffic when signaling protocol interaction
    takes place along the media path, as it is the case for recent key exchange proposals
    (such as DTLS-SRTP). This document highlights problems that may arise. Unfortunately,
    it is difficult for the end points to detect or predict problematic behavior and
    to determine whether the media path is reliably available for packet exchange.
    This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects of NAT and firewall
    control, the reasons that they exist, and possible means of improving their behavior
    to allow protocols that rely upon signaling along the media path to operate effectively.</p>"
