abstract:
- content: "<p>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been that the transition
    to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and that most things would be converted
    this way before we ran out of IPv4. It has not happened. The IANA free pool of
    IPv4 addresses will be depleted soon, way before any significant IPv6 deployment
    will have occurred. This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces
    the dual- stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the cost and the benefits
    of deploying IPv6. It will provide the necessary bridge between the two protocols,
    offering an evolution path of the Internet post IANA IPv4 depletion.</p>"
