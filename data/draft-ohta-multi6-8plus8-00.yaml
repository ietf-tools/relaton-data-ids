abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes 8+8 address format, which is an IPv6 address format
    with locator/ID separation useful for end to end multihoming. A 16 byte address
    of an end is separated into two 8 byte fields: locator, which is used to route
    packets to a link to which the end is attached, and ID, which is used to globally
    identify the end. Locators are assigned from (top level) ISPs to sites (and lower
    level ISPs) in hierarchical and aggregatable manner that a multihomed site (and
    ISPs) receive multiple locators from upstream ISPs. A usual host in a multihomed
    site (or a singly homed site under a multihomed ISP) is expected to have an ID
    and multiple locators and transport layer protocols are expected to handle multiple
    locators of the host and its peer.</p>"
