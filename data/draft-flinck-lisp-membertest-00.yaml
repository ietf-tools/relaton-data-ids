abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines how a membership test can be used to convey all
    or some of the EID-to-RLOC mappings from an Egress Tunnel Router to requesting
    Ingress Tunnel Router. This draft proposes that an authoritative ETR MAY return
    a group membership test in the LISP Map- Reply Message that indicates if a given
    EID is served by the ETR. The membership test is implemented as a Bloom filter.
    A Bloom filter is compact data structure to represent a set of elements. The membership
    test "aggregates" EIDs beyond prefix based aggregation. Membership test decreases
    the load of the mapping system and distributes the EID-to-RLOC resolution between
    an ITR and an ETR.</p>
