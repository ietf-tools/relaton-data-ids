abstract:
- content: "<p>The Authentication Received Chain (ARC) provides a means to preserve
    email authentication results and verify the identity of email message handlers,
    each of which participates by inserting certain header fields before passing the
    message on. But the specification does not indicate how intermediaries and receivers
    should interpret or utilize ARC. This document will provide guidance in these
    areas.</p>"
