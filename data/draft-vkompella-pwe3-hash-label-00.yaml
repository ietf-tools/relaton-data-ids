  content: "<p>V. KompellaExpires August 2008 [page 1] Internet-Draft Hashing on Pseudowires
    February 2008 This draft proposes a method to introduce granularity on the hashing
    of traffic running over pseudowires. Most forwarding engines are able to hash
    based on label stacks, so the approach here is to introduce additional labels
    that do not affect the handling of packets, but which identify a conversation,
    and can be hashed with granularity.</p>"
