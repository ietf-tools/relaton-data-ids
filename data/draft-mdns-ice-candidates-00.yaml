abstract:
- content: "<p>WebRTC applications rely on ICE candidates to enable peer-to-peer connections
    between clients in as many network configurations as possible. To maximize the
    probability to create a direct peer-to- peer connection, client private IP addresses
    are often exposed without user consent. This is currently used as a way to track
    users. This document describes a way to share IP addresses with other clients
    while preserving client privacy. This is achieved by obfuscating IP addresses
    using dynamically generated names resolvable through Multicast DNS [RFC6763].</p>"
