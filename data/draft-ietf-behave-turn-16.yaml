abstract:
- content: "<p>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can
    be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers).
    In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate
    node that acts as a communication relay. This specification defines a protocol,
    called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that allows the host to control
    the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay.
    TURN differs from some other relay control protocols in that it allows a client
    to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
