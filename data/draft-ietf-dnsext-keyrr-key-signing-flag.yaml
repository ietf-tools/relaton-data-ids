abstract:
- content: "<p>With the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record (RR), the concept of
    a public key acting as a secure entry point (SEP) has been introduced. During
    exchanges of public keys with the parent there is a need to differentiate SEP
    keys from other public keys in the Domain Name System KEY (DNSKEY) resource record
    set. A flag bit in the DNSKEY RR is defined to indicate that DNSKEY is to be used
    as a SEP. The flag bit is intended to assist in operational procedures to correctly
    generate DS resource records, or to indicate what DNSKEYs are intended for static
    configuration. The flag bit is not to be used in the DNS verification protocol.
    This document updates RFC 2535 and RFC 3755. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
