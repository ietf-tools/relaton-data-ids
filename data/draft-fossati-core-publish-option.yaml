abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP). The Publish Option is used by a CoAP Endpoint to control the
    authority delegation of one of its resources to another Endpoint. All the phases
    of the authority delegation process (setup, renewal, cancellation) are controlled
    by a simple RESTful protocol. This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking
    relation type, to be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly advertise the resources
    that it can serve - either from its cache, or by forwarding the Client's request
    upstream. The Publish Option and the 'proxies' relation provide the building blocks
    for a comprehensive, in-protocol, solution to the sleepy/ intermittent Endpoint
    use case.</p>"
