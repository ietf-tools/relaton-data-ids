abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes certain functionality that is missing in the
    current 'Integration of Resource Management and SIP' [1] (a.k.a. manyfolks draft).
    An extension to add this functionality is outlined. This functionality is needed
    in general to provide richer signalling capabilities and can be employed in several
    scenarios. This draft describes its use in third party call control applications.
    If this extension is accepted it is foreseen that this draft would be merged with
    [1].</p>"
