abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses handover decision criteria for avoiding deterioration
    in communication quality during WLAN handover, in particular at handover initiation.
    We first describe problems for handover decision criteria employed by existing
    mobility management technologies, such as Mobile IP and mSCTP. We then propose
    the number of frame retransmissions as a simple heuristic for handover decisions
    and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we introduce our proposed
    method using the number of frame retransmissions.</p>"
