abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the process that Certificate Authorities (CAs)
    and Relying Parties (RP) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically
    stronger) algorithm set. The process is expected to be completed in a time scale
    of months or years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.</p>"
