abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links, and
    these links often define certain expectations about the interactions (such as
    HTTP methods being used, media types being sent in the request, or URI parameters
    being used in a certain way). While these expectations are essential to define
    the possible framework for interactions, it may be useful to further narrow them
    down by providing link descriptions, which can help clients to gain more runtime
    knowledge about the resource they are about to interact with. This memo defines
    Link Descriptions, a model and associated media type that can be used to describe
    links by supporting descriptive markup for representing interaction information
    with links. Link Descriptions can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference)
    that seek to make Link Descriptions runtime-capable, without having to create
    their own representation.</p>"
