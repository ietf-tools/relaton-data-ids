abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC ([RFC9000]) is well-suited to various NAT traversal techniques.
    As it operates over UDP, and because the QUIC header was designed to be demultipexed
    from other protocols, STUN ([RFC5389]) can be used on the same UDP socket. This
    allows for using ICE ([RFC8445]) with QUIC. Furthermore, QUICâ€™s path validation
    mechanism can be used to test the viability of an address candidate pair, allowing
    the immediate use of a new path.</p>"
