abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is proposed to enable communications between an IPv4-only
    node in today's Internet and an IPv6-only node, initiated by the IPv4-only node.
    The communication depends on allocation of a flow record and address triggered
    by a DNS query received for the target v6-only node. DNS query conventions can
    be agreed upon to provide a natural model for resolving IPv4 queries for IPv6-only
    nodes. The NAT mechanism proposed demultiplexes multiple sessions through the
    same dynamically allocated IP address, using flow records matching the source
    address of incoming packets. This is in contrast to the use of ports in NAT-PT
    boxes, which inhibits the support of incoming traffic towards a node behind the
    NAT-PT.</p>"
