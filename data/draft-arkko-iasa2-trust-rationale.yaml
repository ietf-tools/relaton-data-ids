abstract:
- content: "<p>The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well,
    because members of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC have
    also served as trustees of the IETF Trust. A proposal for a minimal change regarding
    this has been provided separately in [I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-update]. This companion
    memo provides some background on the details of the current IETF Trust arrangements,
    explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during a transition
    to a new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update. This memo is provided
    only for discussion.</p>"
