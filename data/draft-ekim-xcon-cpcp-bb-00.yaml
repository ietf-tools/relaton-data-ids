abstract:
- content: "<p>In a tightly coupled conference, conference participants can communicate
    with the conference policy server using a conference policy control protocol (CPCP).
    This document generally describes how to use CPCP to efficiently provide and augment
    interaction between clients and conference policy server. This document describes
    what information is needed for conference policy control, and what operation is
    needed to manipulate and interact with the policy information. It is noted that
    the purpose of this draft is not to suggest a new mechanism of CPCP, but to suggest
    building block approach to CPCP work.</p>"
