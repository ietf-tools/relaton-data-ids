abstract:
- content: "<p>Encryption between recursive and authoritative DNS servers is currently
    being defined in two modes: unauthenticated and fully- authenticated. These two
    modes have some features in common, and this document defines those common features
    so that the documents defining the modes do not need to point to each other.</p>"
