abstract:
- content: "<p>The number and types of devices that are Internet connected continues
    to grow. Sensors, appliances, utility meters, medical devices etc. are Internet
    connected for various reasons. Many of these newer devices are constrained in
    terms of processing power, memory, communication capability and, available power.
    Devices such as sensors and similar very small devices often lack a proper user
    interface and hence configuring even the most basic parameters for enabling Internet
    connectivity on these is extremely difficult. Some of the existing configuration
    protocols can help in autoconfiguring various parameters of the IP stack needed
    for Internet connectivity. However this is not sufficient if the devices are using
    a web service application. There is a need for additional information such as
    service provider name and username/password etc. for authentication etc. A configuration
    protocol solution for resource constrained devices is needed in order to enable
    the potential enabled by Internet connectivity. This document outlines the use
    cases and requirements for user friendly configuration of such information on
    a constrained device, and specifies a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    based mechanism to meet the requirements.</p>"
