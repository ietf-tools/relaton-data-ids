abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a protocol and IP option to allow two communicating
    Internet hosts to authenticate datagrams that travel from one to the other. This
    authentication is limited to source, destination IP address pair. It is up to
    host-based mechanisms to provide authentication between separate processes running
    on the same IP host. The protocol will provide for ``authentication'' of the datagram,
    not concealment from third party observers. By authentication, I mean that an
    IP host receiving a datagram claiming to be from some other IP host will be able
    (if both hosts are set up to authenticate datagrams between each other) to determine
    if in fact the datagram is from the host claimed, and that it has not been altered
    in transit.</p>"
