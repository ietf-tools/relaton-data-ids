abstract:
- content: "<p>This document builds on the 6TiSCH architecture that defines, among
    others, mechanisms to establish and maintain deterministic routing and scheduling
    in a centralized fashion. The document details dependencies on DetNet and PCE
    controller to express topologies and capabilities, as well as abstract state that
    the controller must be able to program into the network devices to enable deterministic
    forwarding operations.</p>"
