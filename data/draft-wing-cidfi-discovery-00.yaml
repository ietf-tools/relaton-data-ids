abstract:
- content: "<p>Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve
    the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share expected application
    needs, and thus to provide differentiated service to a flow and to packets within
    a flow. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet
    prioritization), the server (e.g., adaptive transmission), or both. Such an approach
    is called CIDFI, for Collaborative and Interoperable Dissemination of Flow Indicators.
    A key component in a CIDFI system is to discover whether a network is CIDFI-capable,
    and if so discover a set of CIDFI-aware Network Elements (CNEs) that will be involved
    in the Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling. This document
    discusses a set of discovery methods.</p>"
