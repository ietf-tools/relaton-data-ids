abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO (Application Layer-Traffic Optimization) Protocol ([RFC7285])
    defines several services that return various metrics describing the costs between
    network endpoints. For example, when downloading a file that is mirrored on several
    sites, a user application may use these ALTO cost metrics to determine the most
    efficient mirror site. An ALTO Server may offer a variety of cost metrics, based
    on latency, bandwidth, hop count, jitter, or whatever else the ALTO Server deems
    useful. When selecting a mirror site, a client may consider more than one metric,
    perhaps trading bandwidth for latency. While the base ALTO Protocol allows a client
    to use more than one cost metric, to do so, the client must request each metric
    separately. This document defines a new service that allows a client to retrieve
    several cost metrics with one request, which is considerably more efficient. In
    addition, this document extends the ALTO constraint tests to allow a user to specify
    an arbitrary logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.</p>"
