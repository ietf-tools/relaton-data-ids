abstract:
- content: "<p>When the path characteristics between two hosts change abruptly, TCP
    can experience significant delays before resuming transmission in an efficient
    manner or TCP can behave unfairly to competing traffic. This document describes
    TCP extensions that improve transmission behavior in response to advisory, lower-layer
    connectivity-change indications. The proposed TCP extensions modify the local
    behavior of TCP and introduce a new TCP option to signal locally received connectivity-change
    indications to remote peers. Performance gains result from a more efficient transmission
    behavior and there is no difference in aggressiveness in comparison to a newly-started
    connection.</p>"
