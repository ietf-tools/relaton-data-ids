abstract:
- content: "<p>Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination
    address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection of the source
    address and malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses.
    In an effort to enhance the Internet with IP source address validation, a prototype
    implementation of the IP Source Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) was created
    and an evaluation was conducted on an IPv6 network. This document reports on the
    prototype implementation and the test results, as well as the lessons and insights
    gained from experimentation. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>"
