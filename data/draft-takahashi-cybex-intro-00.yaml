abstract:
- content: "<p>The cybersecurity information exchange framework, known as CYBEX, is
    currently undergoing its first iteration of standardization efforts within ITU-T.
    The framework describes how cybersecurity information is exchanged between cybersecurity
    entities on a global scale and how the exchange is assured. This framework is
    intended to facilitate cybersecurity entities to work together beyond national
    and/or organizational boundaries. Currently, ITU-T Draft Recommendation X.1500
    defines the framework. The editors designated for the progress of the Draft Recommendation
    are (in alphabetical order): Inette Furey (DHS), Youki Kadobayashi (NICT), Bob
    Martin (MITRE), Angela Mckay (Microsoft), Stephen Adegbite (FIRST), Damir Rajnovic
    (FIRST), Gavin Reid (Cisco), Tony Rutkowski (Yaana), Gregg Schudel (Cisco). On
    behalf of ITU-T Q.4/17, this draft introduces the overview of CYBEX in the IETF.</p>"
