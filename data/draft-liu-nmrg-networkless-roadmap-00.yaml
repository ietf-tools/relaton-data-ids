abstract:
- content: <p>This draft aims to illustrate possible approaches to make network management
    and operations more autonomic in several aspects. The ultimate goal is that the
    network could run all by itself, so that users/administrators just feel like there
    isn't a network to take care of at all (a.k.a. "Networkless"). The approaches
    are described in a form of different levels (inspired by the Self-Driven Car levels).
    The higher the level is, the more autonomic management capabilities the network
    could have. Please note that although some specific technologies are categorized
    into different levels, it is not the draft's intent to rank them; rather, this
    draft is more about discussing what's the possible next stage and what's the ultimate
    vision. Hopefully, this draft could collect people's consensus in the industry
    and provide guidance for future technology developments.</p>
