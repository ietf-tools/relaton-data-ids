abstract:
- content: "<p>The memo 'MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)'
    (draft-ietf-mhtml-rev-05.txt) specifies how to send packaged aggregate HTML objects
    in MIME format. This memo is an accompanying informational document, intended
    to be an aid to developers. This document is not an Internet standard. Issues
    discussed are implementation methods, caching strategies, problems with rewriting
    of URIs, making messages suitable both for mailers which can and which cannot
    handle Multipart/related and handling recipients which do not have full Internet
    connectivity. The latest version of this document is available in HTML format
    at: http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/mhtml-info.html Differences from the previous
    versions 9 and 10 of this draft (1) A paragraph about one disadvantage with MAILTO
    action elements has been added to section 10. (2) A new section 13: Default font
    size has been added (3) A new temporary section 'Issue list' immediately below
    has been added</p>"
