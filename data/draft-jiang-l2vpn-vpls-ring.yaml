abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes ring based VPLS architecture. This architecture
    is an alternative to existing VPLS architecture. It can simplify full mesh connections
    and provide a standard based protection mechanism, especially when underlying
    infrastructure is ring based. It can also reduce unnecessary customer multicast
    traffic compared with existing full mesh based VPLS.</p>"
