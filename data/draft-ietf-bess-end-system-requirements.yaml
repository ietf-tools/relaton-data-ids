abstract:
- content: "<p>The proven scalability and extensibility of the BGP/MPLS IP VPNs (IP
    VPN) technology has made it an attractive candidate for data center/cloud virtualization.
    Virtualized end-system environment imposes additional requirements to MPLS/BGP
    VPN technology. This document provides the requirements for extending IP VPN technology
    (in original or modified versions) into the end-systems/hosts, such as a server
    in a data center.</p>"
