abstract:
- content: "<p>Current Internet protocols tend to be based on either X.509 based PKI,
    or Kerberos. Both have limitations and age-related issues. In this draft, we outline
    a possible approach to providing similar, and additional, functionality based
    on an abstract device that always signs whatever its given, and that may additionally
    annotate or modify its input in order to fulfill the security needs of other protocols.
    This draft describes a SWIG service and how it can be used to conduct research
    into a number of important problems in Internet trust and identity management
    today.</p>"
