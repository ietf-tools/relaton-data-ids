abstract:
- content: "<p>A multihomed host receives node configuration information from each
    of its access networks. Some configuration objects are global to the node, some
    are local to the interface. Various issues arise when multiple conflicting node-scoped
    configuration objects are received on multiple interfaces. Similar situations
    also happen with single interface host connected to multiple networks. This document
    describes these issues.</p>"
