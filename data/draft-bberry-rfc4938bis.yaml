abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)
    with an optional credit-based flow control mechanism and an optional Link Quality
    Metric report. These optional extensions improve the performance of PPPoE over
    media with variable bandwidth and limited buffering, such as mobile point-to-point
    radio links. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it
    is published for informational purposes.</p>"
