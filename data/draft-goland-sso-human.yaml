abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how to enable a federated single sign on (SSO)
    environment across HTTP using existing HTTP/1.0 compliant clients that support
    303 redirects. The goal of the system is to enable a user to authenticate to multiple
    websites using a single identity. Further, the mechanism must work without requiring
    the user to upgrade their existing web client.</p>"
