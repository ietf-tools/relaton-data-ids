abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Payload format for Generic Forward
    Error Correction (FEC), specified in RFC 5109, forbids transmitting FEC repair
    flows as separate sources in the same RTP session as the flows being repaired.
    This document updates RFC 5109 to lift that restriction, as long as the association
    between original and repair flows is properly signaled and negotiated.</p>"
