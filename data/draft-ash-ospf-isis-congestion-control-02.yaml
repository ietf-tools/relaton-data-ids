abstract:
- content: "<p>Earlier papers and contributions identified issues of congestion control
    and failure recovery for link-state protocol networks, such as OSPF, ISIS, and
    PNNI networks [maunder, choudhury, pappalardo1, pappalardo2, atm01-0101]. The
    problem addressed is to enable link-state protocols to a) gracefully recover from
    massive loss of topology database information, and b) respond gracefully to network
    overloads and failures. This contribution proposes specific additional considerations
    for network congestion control/failure recovery. Candidate mechanisms are proposed
    for control of network congestion and failure recovery, in particular we initially
    propose to investigate the following mechanisms: a) throttle new connection setups,
    topology-state updates, and Hello updates based on automatic congestion control
    mechanisms, b) special marking of critical control messages (e.g., Hello and topology-state-update
    Ack) so that they may receive prioritized processing, c) database backup, in which
    a topology database could be automatically recovered from loss based on local
    backup mechanisms, and d) hitless restart, which allows routes to continue to
    be used if there is an uninterrupted data path, even if the control path is interrupted
    due to a failure. We propose that the OSPF and ISIS working groups include the
    candidate mechanisms in an evaluation of congestion control/failure recovery for
    OSPF and ISIS networks.</p>"
