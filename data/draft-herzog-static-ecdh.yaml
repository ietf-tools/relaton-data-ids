- content: "<p>This document describes how to use the 'static-static Elliptic Curve
    Diffie-Hellman key-agreement scheme (i.e., Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman where
    both participants use static Diffie-Hellman values) with the Cryptographic Message
    Syntax. In this form of key agreement, the Diffie-Hellman values of both the sender
    and receiver are long-term values contained in certificates. This document is
    not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
