abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an extension to the OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS
    Routing Protocol. The extension consists of feeding certain topology information
    out of the Level 2 subdomain into the areas to allow Level 1 routers to select
    the best Level 2 router for reaching a particular area in their routing domain.
    Early simulation studies at PTT Research, The Netherlands show that use of Extended
    IS-IS with metric feeding results in smaller end-to-end delays and higher throughput
    at the cost of a slight increase in complexity and convergence time after topology
    changes. Comments should be sent to 'A.A.L.Reijnierse@research.ptt.nl'.</p>"
