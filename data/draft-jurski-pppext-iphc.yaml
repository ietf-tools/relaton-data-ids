abstract:
- content: "<p>The negotiation options specified in RFC 2509 defined an all-or-nothing
    strategy for applying header compression: peers were assumed to support compression
    for any combination of headers. [RFC3544] refined that strategy to make it possible
    to negotiate header compression for only TCP or only non-TCP packets (and also
    added Enhanced RTP-Compression negotiation option). The current document further
    refines the strategy by also making it possible to negotiate header compression
    for only particular combinations of headers or header types.</p>"
