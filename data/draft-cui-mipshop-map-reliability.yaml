abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces an extension to allow an adapted multiple
    binding in hierarchical mobile network. Mobile node registers its RCoA and LCoA
    in the home agent at same time to get two separate connections between the mobile
    node and the home agent, or between the mobile node and the correspondent node
    in Route Optimization scenario. These connections provide robust communication
    between the mobile node and correspondent nodes and mobile node can overcome the
    failure on MAP.</p>"
