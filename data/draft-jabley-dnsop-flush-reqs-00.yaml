abstract:
- content: "<p>Operational calamaties in the DNS happen from time to time, and in
    many cases problems persist due to DNS caching of bad data. Lacking any robust
    mechanism to signal that bad data has been flushed, the operators of DNS authority
    servers often resort to unauthenticated requests for help being sent to mailing
    lists, the results of which are frequently unsatisfying to all concerned. This
    document aims to present requirements for a more robust mechanism by which authoritative
    server operators can signal to recursive server operators that bad data has been
    published, and that targetted cache flushes may be beneficial.</p>"
