abstract:
- content: "<p>Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with
    the request URLs and content negotiation that produced them, to transmit or store
    together. They can include multiple top-level resources with one identified as
    the default by a primaryUrl metadata, provide random access to their component
    exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.</p>"
