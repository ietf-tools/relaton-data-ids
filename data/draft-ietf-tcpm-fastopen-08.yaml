abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experimental TCP mechanism TCP Fast Open
    (TFO). TFO allows data to be carried in the SYN and SYN-ACK packets and consumed
    by the receiving end during the initial connection handshake, thus saving up to
    one full round trip time (RTT) compared to the standard TCP, which requires a
    three-way handshake (3WHS) to complete before data can be exchanged. However TFO
    deviates from the standard TCP semantics since the data in the SYN could be replayed
    to an application in some rare circumstances. Applications should not use TFO
    unless they can tolerate this issue detailed in the Applicability section.</p>"
