abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband
    access. IEEE has specified the service specific convergence sublayers (CS) in
    the IEEE 802.16 MAC to be used by upper layer protocols. Asynchronous Transfer
    Mode Convergence Sublayer (ATM CS) and Packet Convergence Sublayer (Packet CS)
    represent the two main service specific convergence sublayers for the IEEE 802.16.
    The packet CS is used for transport for all packet-based protocols such as Internet
    Protocol (IP), IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN). The IP specific part
    of the Packet CS enables transport of IPv4 packets directly over the IEEE 802.16
    MAC. This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
    and address assignment procedures for transmitting IPv4 packets over IP Convergence
    Sublayer (IPCS) of the IEEE 802.16. This document also provides the details of
    why the ARP cannot be sent over the IEEE 802.16 links using IPCS and a recommendation
    for this.</p>"
