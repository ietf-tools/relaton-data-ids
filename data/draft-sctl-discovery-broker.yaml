abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS-Based Service Discovery allows clients to discover available services
    using unicast DNS queries. In simple configurations these unicast DNS queries
    go directly to the appropriate authoritative server(s). In large networks that
    have complicated topology, or many client devices, or both, it can be advantageous
    to have an intermediary between the clients and authoritative servers. This intermediary,
    called a Discovery Broker, serves several purposes. A Discovery Broker can reduce
    load on both the servers and the clients, and gives the option of presenting clients
    with service discovery organized around logical, rather than physical, topology.</p>"
