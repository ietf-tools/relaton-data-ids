abstract:
- content: "<p>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) is a connection-oriented protocol
    that has a shared state between active endpoints. Some of this shared state is
    vital for operation, but may be volatile in nature, such as packet sequence numbers
    used on the L2TP Control Connection. When failure of one side of a control connection
    occurs, a new control connection is created and associated with the old connection
    by exchanging information about the old connection. Such a mechanism is not intended
    as a replacement for an active fail over with some mirrored connection states,
    but as an aid for those parameters that are particularly difficult to have immediately
    available. Protocol extensions to L2TP defined in this document are intended to
    facilitate state recovery, providing additional resiliency in an L2TP network,
    and improving a remote system's layer 2 connectivity. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
