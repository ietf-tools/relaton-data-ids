abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the interaction between users
    and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based applications. By interacting with
    applications, users can guide the way in which they operate. The focus of this
    framework is stimulus signaling, which allows a user agent (UA) to interact with
    an application without knowledge of the semantics of that application. Stimulus
    signaling can occur to a user interface running locally with the client, or to
    a remote user interface, through media streams. Stimulus signaling encompasses
    a wide range of mechanisms, ranging from clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons,
    to traditional Dual-Tone Multi- Frequency (DTMF) input. In all cases, stimulus
    signaling is supported through the use of markup languages, which play a key role
    in this framework. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
