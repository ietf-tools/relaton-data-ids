abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the ChaMeLeon Version 2 (CMLv2) routing protocol
    designed for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs). CMLv2 is a multi-path, hybrid routing
    protocol operating within a defined area denoted as the Critical Area (CA). The
    main concept behind CMLv2 is the adaptability of its routing mechanisms towards
    changes in the physical and logical state of a MANET. For autonomous communications,
    there is a likelihood that the network size will vary whenever more devices join
    or leave the network. In addition, battery depletion of lightweight mobile communication
    devices will stipulate another reason for changes in the network size. Hence,
    CMLv2 adapts its routing behavior according to changes in the network size within
    a pre-defined CA. For small networks, CMLv2 routes data proactively using the
    Optimized Link State Routing version v2 (OLSRv2) protocol whereas for larger networks
    it utilizes the reactive Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Version 2 (AODVv2) Routing
    protocol. These transitions occur via the oscillation phase, which is maintained
    from CMLv1. O-phase will be totally removed in the next release of CMLv2.CMLv2
    creates multi-path routes for nodes with disjoint paths thereby increasing the
    reliability of the network.</p>"
