abstract:
- content: "<p>Digital Credentials allow users to access Homes, Cars or Hotels using
    their mobile devices. Once a user has a Credential on a device, sharing it to
    others is a natural use case. This document describes a sharing flow that allows
    convenient and seamless user experience, similar to sharing other digital assets
    like photos or documents. The sharing process should be secure and private. This
    document also defines a new transport to meet unique requirements of sharing a
    Credential.</p>"
