abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses a vulnerability in publicly accessible SIP
    servers (servers includes both UASes and proxies) that enables them to be used
    as an amplifier in an untracable reflected denial of service attack. The amplification
    ratio is between 1:10 to over 1:350 in both packets and bytes. As a proposed solution,
    a mechanism for stateless cookie exchange between a SIP server and client to ensure
    that a public SIP server that wishes to accept SIP requests from hosts over datagram
    can not be used as an amplifier for a denial of service attack. This brings SIP
    over datagram transports (such as UDP) in line with TCP in terms of routability
    to the source IP address.</p>"
