abstract:
- content: "<p>IS-IS protocol specifies a procedure that if a Link State Protocol
    Data Unit (LSP) with an incorrect LSP Checksum is received, the corruptedLSPReceived
    circuit event will be generated and the corrupted LSP will be discarded. This
    document aims to emphasize that although this procedure can maintain the network
    stability, it can not diagnose and isolate the source of the network problem.
    In some cases this procedure will create bad effect on the services carried by
    the network. This document suggests that IS-IS protocol introduce the mechanism
    for link degradation detection and isolation, which should be triggered when corrupted
    LSP is received.</p>"
