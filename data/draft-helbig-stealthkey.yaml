abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a key management, designated as StealthKey
    Management. StealthKey Management establishes short-term keys which are derived
    from a common long-term key in two entities, referred to as sender and receiver,
    for symmetric encryption algorithms and cryptographic authentication protocols
    based on a common secret. Stealthkey Management covers two main parts: - Independent
    generation of the short-term keys by the sender and receiver from either the common
    long-term key and the time, or from the common long-term key and a sequence number.
    - Synchronization of the short-term keys between both entities. The important
    advantages of using StealthKey Management for message encryption and authentication
    are the ability to change the short- term keys frequently, without exchanges between
    sender and receiver and the independence of other applications for the key change
    process (in band). A commonly used term for key change is rekeying. The required
    long-term key can be established remotely through the use of known symmetric or
    asymmetric key protocols, or locally via manual setup. StealthKey Management improves
    the performance of any of today's key management protocols, by extending the protocol
    with the frequent changing of keys.</p>"
