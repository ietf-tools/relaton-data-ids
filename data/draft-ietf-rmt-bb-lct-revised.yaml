abstract:
- content: "<p>The Layered Coding Transport (LCT) Building Block provides transport
    level support for reliable content delivery and stream delivery protocols. LCT
    is specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast, but it also
    provides support to protocols that use unicast. LCT is compatible with congestion
    control that provides multiple rate delivery to receivers and is also compatible
    with coding techniques that provide reliable delivery of content. This document
    obsoletes RFC 3451. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
