abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced characteristics,
    such as guaranteed resources, latency, jitter, etc., so as to support customers
    requirements for connectivity services with these enhanced characteristics. Enhanced
    VPN requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics
    provided by the underlay network. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset
    of the network resources and associated policies on each of a connected set of
    links in the underlay network. An NRP could be used as the underlay to support
    one or a group of enhanced VPN services. In some network scenarios, each NRP can
    be associated with a unique Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo), which can provide
    constraint-path computation based on the customized topological constraints. This
    document specifies a mechanism to build Segment Routing (SR) based NRPs by combining
    SR Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundles with minor extensions.</p>"
