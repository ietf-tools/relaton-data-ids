abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Name-based sockets. name-based sockets allow application
    developers to refer to remote hosts (and it self) by name only, passing on all
    IP (locator) management to the operating system. Applications are thus relieved
    of re-implementing features such as multi-homing, mobility, NAT traversal, IPv6/IPv4
    interoperability and address management in general. The operating system can in
    turn re- use the same solutions for a whole set of guest applications. name- based
    sockets aims to provide a whole set of features without adding new indirection
    layers, new delays or other dependences while maintaining transparent backwards
    compatibility.</p>"
