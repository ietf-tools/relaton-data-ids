abstract:
- content: "<p>The Provisioning of VPN based on Layer 2 circuits across MPLS-base
    network has been described in draft-kompella-mpls-l2vpn-02.txt. The draft describes
    how provider's edge routers distribute configured VPN information amongst themselves.
    This information is then processed to map layer 2 circuits of customer's edge
    devices to remote customer devices of the same VPN through MPLS cloud via adjoining
    provider's edge devices. The proposal requires a priori guestimating of customer's
    growth needs for the VPN and accordingly over provisioning of a contiguous set
    of (preferably per platform) MPLS labels.</p>"
