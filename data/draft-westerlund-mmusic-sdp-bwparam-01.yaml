abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Session Description Protocol (SDP) bandwidth modifiers
    and their values include the bandwidth needed also for the transport and IP layers.
    When using SDP in protocols like SAP, SIP and RTSP and the involved hosts reside
    in networks running different IP versions, the interpretation of what type of
    lower layers that is included is not clear. This documents defines a bandwidth
    modifier that does not include transport overhead, instead additional packet rate
    attributes are defined. The transport independent bitrate value together with
    the packet rate can then be used to calculate the real bitrate over the actually
    used transport.</p>"
