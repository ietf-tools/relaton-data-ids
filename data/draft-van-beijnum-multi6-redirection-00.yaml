abstract:
- content: <p>The new multi6 design team as of august 2004 is chartered to explore
    multihoming by means of a "layer 3.5 wedge" that allows unmodified applications
    and transport protocols to become address agile. In order to do this, the two
    hosts involved must communicate certain parameters. The exact nature of this communication
    isn't specified at this time. However, this document discusses certain security
    issues pertaining to such communication.</p>
