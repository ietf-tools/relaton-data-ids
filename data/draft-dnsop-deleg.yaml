abstract:
- content: "<p>A delegation in the Domain Name System (DNS) is a mechanism that enables
    efficient and distributed management of the DNS namespace. It involves delegating
    authority over subdomains to specific DNS servers via NS records, allowing for
    a hierarchical structure and distributing the responsibility for maintaining DNS
    records. An NS record contains the hostname of the nameserver for the delegated
    namespace. Any facilities of that nameserver must be discovered through other
    mechanisms. This document proposes a new extensible DNS record type, DELEG, which
    contains additional information about the delegated namespace and the capabilities
    of authoritative nameservers for the delegated namespace.</p>"
