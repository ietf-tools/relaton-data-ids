abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this memo is to highlight the new QoS requirements of
    the multiparty communication services in terms of measurement parameters. It tries
    to derive a set of parameter metrics from the existing one-way metrics in IP Performance
    metrics IPPM [2] [3] [4] for the multiparty communications to present these new
    requirements. These parameter metrics are supposed to provide methods and rules
    for engineers to measure and judge the QoS of the multiparty communications.</p>"
