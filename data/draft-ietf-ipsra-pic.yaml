abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a Pre-IKE Credential (PIC) provisioning protocol.
    PIC is a method to bootstrap IPsec authentication via an 'Authentication Server'
    (AS) and user authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS. PIC happens before IKE
    (the Internet Key Exchange protocol). The client machine communicates with the
    AS using a key exchange protocol where only the server is authenticated, and the
    derived keys are used to protect the user authentication. Once the user is authenticated,
    the client machine obtains credentials from the AS that can be later used to authenticate
    the client in a standard IKE exchange, with no user intervention. The proposed
    key exchange is based on ISAKMP (the Internet Security Association and Key Management
    Protocol), similar to a simplified IKE exchange. Arbitrary user authentication
    is supported via the use of EAP (the PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol).</p>"
