abstract:
- content: <p>Firewall and Service Tickets is a generic and extensible protocol mechanism
    for hosts to send explicit signals to on-path elements to request network services
    on a per packet basis. This is a type of "host to networks signaling", and the
    data of the signal is a "ticket" that accompanies a packet. A ticket indicates
    the requested services or a grant of admission into a network; tickets are processed
    by network nodes to instantiate the requested services. Tickets are scoped to
    be relevant to their "origin domain" which is the network or limited domain in
    which they are issued. Outside of their origin domain tickets are not processed
    and are forwarded as opaque data. To prevent forgery and to obscure the services
    being requested, tickets are authenticated, encrypted, or otherwise obfuscated
    such that they can only be read by network nodes in their origin domain. Tickets
    are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</p>
