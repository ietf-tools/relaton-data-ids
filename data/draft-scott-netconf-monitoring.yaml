abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Netconf content via XML Schema to be used to
    monitor the Netconf protocol. It provides information about Netconf sessions and
    subscriptions. The proposed schema is intended to provide sufficient information
    to facilitate Netconf session and subscription management. It does not intend
    to provide detailed statistical session information. Though primarily intended
    to monitor Netconf protocol the schema also provides information for non-Netconf
    sessions. In particular for session management purposes.</p>"
