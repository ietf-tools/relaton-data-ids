abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] defines stateful extensions for Path Computation
    Element Communication Protocol (PCEP). A Path Computation Client (PCC) can synchronize
    an LSP state information to a Path Computation Element (PCE). [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
    allows for PCE redundancy where a PCC can have redundant PCEP sessions towards
    multiple PCEs. In such a case, a PCC gives control on a LSP to only a single PCE,
    and only one PCE is responsible for path computation for this delegated LSP. There
    are some use cases where path computation for a particular LSP is linked to another:
    the most common use case is path disjointness. The set of LSPs that are dependant
    to each other may start from different head-ends. In such a case, we cannot guarantee
    that at any time all the head-ends (acting as PCCs) will delegate their LSP to
    the same PCE. This scenario where a group of dependant LSPs are delegated to multiple
    PCEs is called a split-brain scenario. This split-brain scenario may lead to computation
    loops between PCEs. This document proposes a solution to enhance redundant stateful
    PCE architecture to overcome those issues.</p>"
