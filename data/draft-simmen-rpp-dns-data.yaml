abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a unified, extensible JSON representation for
    DNS resource records for use in the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP). The aim
    is to create a single, consistent structure for provisioning all DNS-related data
    - including delegation, DNSSEC, and other record types - that directly mirrors
    the DNS data model and being mappable to existing EPP model of requests and responses
    same time. This approach simplifies the adoption of both current and future DNS
    features by aligning the provisioning format with the target system, thereby streamlining
    the management of domain names and related objects within RPP.</p>"
