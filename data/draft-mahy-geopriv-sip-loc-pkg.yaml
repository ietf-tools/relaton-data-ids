abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package
    to dereference raw location data about named SIP resources (as opposed to presence
    data with embedded filtered location) as a GEOPRIV Using Protocol. The resulting
    location information is conveyed in existing location formats wrapped in GEOPRIV
    privacy extensions to the Presence Information Document Format (PIDF-LO). In the
    envisioned usage, location disclosure is limited to voluntary disclosure to the
    target of its own location or to a trusted service (such as a presence server)
    which enforces the target's privacy rules on the target's behalf.</p>"
