abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a measurement scheme of IP performance metrics
    for mobile networks with multiple interfaces in heterogeneous wireless networks.
    In the proposed scheme, mobile nodes (MNs) can get IP performance metrics irrespective
    of the presence or absence of measurement functionality. Since the multihomed
    mobile router (MMR) with heterogeneous wireless multiple interfaces measures IP
    performance metrics on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network, the proposed
    scheme does not require MNs to be involved in measuring IP performance metrics.
    MNs can get measured IP performance metrics from the MMR using L3 messages. Therefore,
    the proposed scheme can reduce burden and power consumption of MNs with limited
    resource and battery power since MNs don't measure directly IP performance metrics.
    In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead over
    wireless links on multiple measurement paths since signaling messages and injected
    testing traffic are reduced.</p>"
