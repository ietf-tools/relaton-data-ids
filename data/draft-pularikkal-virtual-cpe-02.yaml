abstract:
- content: "<p>Broadband Service Provider Industry has been gearing towards the adoption
    of Virtual CPE (vCPE) solutions. The concept of vCPE is build around the idea
    that the physical CPE device at the customer premises can be simplified by moving
    some of the key feature functionalities from the physical CPE device to the Service
    Provider Network. This document starts discussing the drivers behind vCPE adoption
    followed by Solution level requirements. Two key Architecture models for vCPE,
    which can address the service provider and subscriber requirements, are covered
    in this reference document. Document also touches up on some of the key deployment
    considerations, which can influence the adoption of the vCPE architecture models.</p>"
