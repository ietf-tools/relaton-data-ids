- content: <p>This document specifies the payload format for packetization of audio
    data encoded with the Standard apt-X or Enhanced apt-X audio coding algorithms
    into the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP).The payload format supports transmission
    of multiple related audio channels per payload. This document also describes the
    use of the Standard apt-X and Enhanced apt-X coding algorithms in conjunction
    with the Session Description Protocol (SDP). Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft
