abstract:
- content: "<p>In virtualized networks, machines with processing and storage are virtualized
    resources on which network functional entities can be allocated and relocated
    dynamically. Such dynamic allocation and relocation of network entities imposes
    the challenge of service mobility, i.e., how to maintain not only coupling relations
    between those network entities but also sessions established between those entities
    in a virtualized environment. This document provides a reference model for managing
    service mobility in the virtual environment and defines the control protocol between
    the virtualized platform and the managing controller to realize service mobility.
    Such capability is especially longed for realizing more scalable and reliable
    telecom networks.</p>"
