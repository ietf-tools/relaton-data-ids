abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active Queue
    Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with different responses
    to congestion. This provides a way for the Internet to transition from the scaling
    problems of standard TCP Reno-friendly ('Classic') congestion controls to the
    family of 'Scalable' congestion controls. These are designed for consistently
    very Low queuing Latency, very Low congestion Loss and Scaling of per-flow throughput
    (L4S) by using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in a modified way. Until
    the Coupled DualQ, these L4S senders could only be deployed where a clean-slate
    environment could be arranged, such as in private data centres. The coupling acts
    like a semi-permeable membrane: isolating the sub-millisecond average queuing
    delay and zero congestion loss of L4S from Classic latency and loss; but pooling
    the capacity between any combination of Scalable and Classic flows with roughly
    equivalent throughput per flow. The DualQ achieves this indirectly, without having
    to inspect transport layer flow identifiers and without compromising the performance
    of the Classic traffic, relative to a single queue. The DualQ design has low complexity
    and requires no configuration for the public Internet.</p>"
