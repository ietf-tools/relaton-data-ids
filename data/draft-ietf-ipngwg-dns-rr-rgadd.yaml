abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a proposal to redefine the existing DNS AAAA resource
    record into two resource records: an RG record to define the routing topology
    of an IPv6 address and an aAA record to define the End System Identifier of an
    IPv6 address. The document will define the synthesis of the RG and aAA record
    at the DNS primary server, which will return an AAAA record to DNS resolvers.
    The objective of this work is to split the AAAA record in the DNS into location
    and identifier to provide future capabilities for dynamic renumbering of addresses.
    This work was spawned by the GSE - Alternate Addressing Architecture Proposal
    for IPv6.</p>"
