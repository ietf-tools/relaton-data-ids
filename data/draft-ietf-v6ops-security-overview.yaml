abstract:
- content: "<p>The transition from a pure IPv4 network to a network where IPv4 and
    IPv6 coexist brings a number of extra security considerations that need to be
    taken into account when deploying IPv6 and operating the dual-protocol network
    and the associated transition mechanisms. This document attempts to give an overview
    of the various issues grouped into three categories: o issues due to the IPv6
    protocol itself, o issues due to transition mechanisms, and o issues due to IPv6
    deployment. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
