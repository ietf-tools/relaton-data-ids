abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 5586 defines a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism for
    MPLS paths that enables multiplexing of auxiliary traffic over such paths along
    with the user traffic they carry. Such auxiliary traffic is commonly used for
    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance protocols that enable monitoring and
    management of the path. This document describes the applicability of the G-ACh
    mechanism to Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels.</p>"
