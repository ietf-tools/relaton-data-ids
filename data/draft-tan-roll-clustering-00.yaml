abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is
    one of the emerging routing standards for multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).
    RPL is based on the construction of a Destination- Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph
    (DODAG), which offers a loop-free topology to route data packets. But due to the
    tree topology, the upper nodes in tree topology are easy to run out of energy.
    Moreover, the hop count and ETX are the only route metrics for which standards
    related to their usage in RPL are published. Due to the seriously resource-constrained
    character, we take nodes' residual energy into account. Here we present an RPL-based
    clustering scheme and detailed description of Objective Function.</p>"
