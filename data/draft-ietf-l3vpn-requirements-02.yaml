abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides requirements for Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks
    (L3VPNs). It identifies requirements applicable to a number of individual approaches
    that a Service Provider may use to provision a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.
    This document expresses a service provider perspective, based upon past experience
    with IP-based service offerings and the ever-evolving needs of the customers of
    such services. Toward this end, it first defines terminology and states general
    requirements. Detailed requirements are expressed from a customer perspective
    as well as that of a service provider. This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
