abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication algorithm in addition
    to the already-documented authentication schemes described in the base specification.
    This document adds the basic infrastructure thats required for supporting algorithm
    and key agility for BFD.</p>"
