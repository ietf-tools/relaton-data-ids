abstract:
- content: "<p>Collective signatures are compact cryptographic proofs showing that
    several distinct secret key holders, called cosigners, have cooperated to sign
    a given message. This document describes a collective signature extension to the
    EdDSA signing schemes for the Ed25519 and Ed448 elliptic curves. A collective
    EdDSA signature consists of a point R, a scalar s, and a bitmask Z indicating
    the specific subset of a known group of cosigners that produced this signature.
    A collective signature produced by n cosigners is of size 64+ceil(n/8) bytes for
    Ed25519 and 114+ceil(n/8) bytes for Ed448, respectively, instead of 64n and 114n
    bytes for n individual signatures. Further, collective signature verification
    requires only one double scalar multiplication rather than n. The verifier learns
    exactly which subset of the cosigners participated, enabling the verifier to implement
    flexible acceptance-threshold policies, and preserving transparency and accountability
    in the event a bad message is collectively signed.</p>"
