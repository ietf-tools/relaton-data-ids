abstract:
- content: "<p>''Packet marking'' is proposed as an architectural generalization of
    the type of service (TOS) and precedence facilities of IPv4 [RFC795, RFC1349],
    as well as the traffic class facilities of IPv6 [IPv6]. It is intended to encompass
    all mechanisms by which a host or a router may mark a packet to invoke some differentiated
    packet handling behavior by another node along the transit path of the packet.
    This memo examines several proposed applications of a packet marking facility
    and attempts to categorize each application in terms of the behavioral requirements
    it imposes on hosts and routers. In addition, issues related to the deployment
    of packet marking, including provisioning, authorization, and security, are examined.
    This memo is proposed as a framework to focus discussion on implementation issues
    and mechanisms as new differentiated services enabled by a packet marking facility
    are introduced into the Internet.</p>"
