abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experiment in which VPN service information
    for both layer 2 and layer 3 VPNs is encoded in a new IPv6 Destination Option.
    The new IPv6 Destination Option is called the VPN Service Option. One purpose
    of this experiment is to demonstrate that the VPN Service Option can be implemented
    and deployed in a production network. Another purpose is to demonstrate that the
    security considerations, described in this document, have been sufficiently addressed.
    Finally, this document encourages replication of the experiment.</p>"
