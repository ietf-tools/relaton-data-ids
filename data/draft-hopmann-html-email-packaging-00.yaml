abstract:
- content: "<p>Although HTML was designed within the context of MIME, more than the
    specification of HTML as defined in RFC 1866 is needed for two electronic mail
    user agents to be able to interoperate using HTML as a document format. These
    issues include the naming of objects that are normally referred to by URIs, and
    the means of aggregating objects that go together. This draft describes a set
    of guidelines that will allow conforming mail user agents to be able to send,
    deliver and display these HTML objects. In addition it is hoped that these techniques
    will also apply to the wider category of URI-enabled objects.</p>"
