abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to use Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) in HIP to incorporate user authentication in the IPsec tunnel creation.
    This document describes two new parameters for transporting EAP messages inside
    HIP control packets. The main focus of this document is to describe how to use
    these parameters to combine needed EAP negotiation in order to authenticate the
    user. This document also describes how on-path middleboxes can take part in the
    negotiation as authenticators.</p>"
