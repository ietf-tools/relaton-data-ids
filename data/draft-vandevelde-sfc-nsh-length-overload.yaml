abstract:
- content: <p>The specification of the NSH MD Type 1 header [draft-ietf-sfc-nsh] mandates
    four Context Headers, 4-byte each, and they MUST be added immediately following
    the Service Path Header. As direct consequence, an NSH MD Type 1 header is always
    Length 0x6 (six 4-byte words). As a result, the Length field of the NSH MD Type
    1 header provides an information which is known by simply looking at the "MD Type"
    field. However, while [draft-ietf-sfc-nsh] does not specify the encoding of these
    Context Headers, other specifications have started to do so. A need to distinguish
    types of Context Headers therefore arises. This draft proposes to overload the
    Length field of an NSH MD Type 1 as Meta-Data context allocation identifier and
    to create a IANA repository for NSH MD Type 1 allocation schemes. The NSH MD Type
    1 Length field overload intends to allow universal understanding at any network
    location and by any network device of the context allocation structure.</p>
