abstract:
- content: <p>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is an authorization infrastructure
    that allows the holder of Internet Number Resources (INRs) to make verifiable
    statements about those resources. The certification authorities (CAs) in the RPKI
    issue certificates to match their allocation of INRs. These entities are trusted
    to issue certificates that accurately reflect the allocation state of resources
    as per their databases. However, there is some risk that a CA will make inappropriate
    changes to the RPKI, either accidentally or deliberately (e.g., as a result of
    some form of "government mandate"). The mechanisms described below, and referred
    to as "Suspenders" are intended to address this risk. Suspenders enables an INR
    holder to publish information about changes to objects it signs and publishes
    in the RPKI repository system. This information is made available via a file that
    is external to the RPKI repository, so that Relying Parties (RPs) can detect erroneous
    or malicious changes related to these objects. RPs can then decide, individually,
    whether to accept changes that are not corroborated by independent assertions
    by INR holders, or to revert to previously verified RPKI data.</p>
