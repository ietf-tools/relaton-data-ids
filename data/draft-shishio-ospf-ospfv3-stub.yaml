abstract:
- content: <p>OSPFv3 accommodates for the possibility to indicate through the R-bit
    if a router is an active router and should be taken into consideration as a transit
    device. Another method available is the v6-bit indicating if a router or link
    should be excluded from IPv6 routing calculations. A direct result is that OSPFv3
    has "no transit capability" potentially based upon the setting of R-bit and V6-bit,
    unlike the stub OSPFv2 router functionality. This feature proposal has as purpose
    to re-introduce existing OSPFv2 stub router behavior into OSPFv3 to keep the operational
    service provider experience used to deploy, troubleshoot and be familiar with
    OSPFv2 stub routing. OSPFv3 has similar metric field information field of all
    of LSAs, with exception of the Link-LSA, so RFC3137 method can be re-utilized
    in OSPFv3. To drive consistency between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, there should be next
    to supporting both R-bit and v6-bit be support for"max-metric".</p>
