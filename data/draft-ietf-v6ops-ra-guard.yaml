abstract:
- content: "<p>Routed protocols are often susceptible to spoof attacks. The canonical
    solution for IPv6 is Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND), a solution that is non-trivial
    to deploy. This document proposes a light-weight alternative and complement to
    SEND based on filtering in the layer-2 network fabric, using a variety of filtering
    criteria, including, for example, SEND status. This document is not an Internet
    Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
