abstract:
- content: "<p>Hyperlink maintenance allows robots and servers to cooperate in propagating
    the effects of daily changes in the millions of resource locations in the wwweb.
    Here, we propose developing the definitions of the LINK and UNLINK methods defined
    for HTTP since RFC 1945 and which remain largely unimplemented and unused. We
    believe that the only reason these methods have not been employed is that they
    remain too loosely defined and implicitly too inefficient. A new syntax and semantics
    simplify implementation and improve utility.</p>"
