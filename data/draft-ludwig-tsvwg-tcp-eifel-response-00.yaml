abstract:
- content: "<p>The Eifel response algorithm uses the Eifel detection algorithm to
    detect a posteriori whether the TCP sender has entered loss recovery unnecessarily.
    In response to a spurious timeout it avoids the go-back-N retransmits that would
    otherwise be sent, and reinitializes the RTT estimators to avoid further spurious
    timeouts. Likewise, it adapts the duplicate acknowledgement threshold in response
    to a spurious fast retransmit. In both cases, the Eifel response algorithm restores
    the congestion control state in way that avoids packet bursts.</p>"
