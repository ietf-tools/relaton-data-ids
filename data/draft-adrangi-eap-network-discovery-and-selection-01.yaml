abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a solution for Service Network discovery and
    selection that could be implemented within the existing EAP specification framework.
    The purpose of Service Network discovery and selection here is to help a WLAN
    client using EAP for authentication to decide whether or not to connect to a WLAN
    Access Network, and help it select the most appropriate Mediating Network as a
    next hop for routing AAA packets in roaming situations where the WLAN Access Network
    has agreements with more than one Mediating Network affiliated with the clientâ€™s
    Home Service Network. The proposed solution has 3 components: a delivery mechanism
    for conveying Access Network and Service Network Information to a WLAN client,
    a data model/syntax for structuring the information in a generic manner, and a
    method by which the WLAN client can indicate its selection to the WLAN Access
    Network.</p>"
