abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a list of DSCP value of hundreds service type
    in order to make a precise priority, which can be applied by differentiated traffic
    conditioning policies. A Routing optimization based on traffic identification
    is then proposed, which is to execute route selection with the information of
    both destination address and traffic value. This method can promote the network
    quality of transmission and finally achieve differentiated services.</p>"
