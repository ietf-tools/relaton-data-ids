abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and access
    control for IP multicasting. The scope of the requirements is limited to cases
    where Authentication, Accounting and Authorization (AAA) functions are coordinated
    between Content Provider(s) and Network Service Provider(s). In order to describe
    the new requirements of a multi-entity Content Deliver System(CDS) using multicast,
    the memo presents three basic business models: 1) the Content Provider and the
    Network Provider are the same entity, 2) the Content Provider(s) and the Network
    Provider(s) are separate entities and users are not directly billed, and 3) the
    Content Provider(s) and the Network Provider(s) are separate entities and users
    are billed based on content consumption or subscriptions. The requirements of
    these three models are listed and evaluated as to which aspects are already supported
    by existing technologies and which aspects are not. General requirements for accounting
    and admission control capabilities including quality-of-service (QoS) related
    issues are listed and the constituent logical functional components are presented.
    This memo assumes that the capabilities can be realized by integrating AAA functionalities
    with a multicast CDS system, with IGMP/MLD at the edge of the network.</p>"
