abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo should help starting the discussion on extensions of the
    Policy Framework Core Information Model (PCIM). It does not replace nor change
    concepts used in PCIM, but tries to add concepts, which could help different application
    areas to define policies more easily by reusing some of the concepts proposed
    in this draft. The draft basically tries to generalize concepts introduced by
    other drafts such as the Policy Framework QoS Information Model [PQIM]. The focus
    lies in means for specifying general conditions and actions. Additionally, group
    ordering, events, and variables are introduced.</p>"
