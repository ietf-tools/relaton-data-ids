abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a transport independent, request-response protocol
    for the management of trust anchors and community identifiers stored in a device.
    The protocol makes use of the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital
    signature is used to provide integrity protection and data origin authentication.
    Each trust anchor is associated with a list of functions within devices that make
    use of digital signature mechanisms. Digital signatures can be validated directly
    with the public key associated with the trust anchor, or they can be validated
    with a certified public key whose X.509 certification path terminates with the
    trust anchor public key.</p>"
