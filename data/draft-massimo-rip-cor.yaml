abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft is intended to point out a difference of behaviour between
    the RIP protocol as described in the RFC 2453 (also STD 56) and the RIP protocol
    as implemented by many vendors. If all the vendors apply the same rule, no problem
    arises. But, on the contrary, serious problems of interoperability can occur.</p>"
