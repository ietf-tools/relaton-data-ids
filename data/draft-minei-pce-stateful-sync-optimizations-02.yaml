abstract:
- content: "<p>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) has access to not only the
    information disseminated by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), but
    also the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its computation.
    The additional Label Switched Path (LSP) state information allows the PCE to compute
    constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their interactions. This
    requires a reliable state synchronization mechanism between the PCE and the network,
    PCE and path computation clients (PCCs), and between cooperating PCEs. The basic
    mechanism for state synchronization is part of the stateful PCE specification.
    This draft presents motivations for optimizations to the base state synchronization
    procedure and specifies the required Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP) extensions.</p>"
