abstract:
- content: <p>The document describes a mechanism allowing the use of Duplicate Address
    Detection (DAD) by IPv6 nodes in a point-to-multipoint architecture with "split-horizon"
    forwarding scheme. Based on the DAD signalling, the first hop router stores in
    a Binding Table all known IPv6 addresses used on a point-to-multipoint domain
    (e.g. VLAN). When a node performs DAD for an address already used by another node,
    the first hop router replies instead of this last one.</p>
