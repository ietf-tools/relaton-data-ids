abstract:
- content: <p>An HTTP "Nice" header field is defined. "Nice" marks a request as low
    priority. Gateways can choose to discard or delay the request, or provide a response
    from cache rather than forwarding it to an origin server. This enables constrained
    origin servers, such as those that rely on battery power, to avoid expending limited
    resources on serving requests.</p>
