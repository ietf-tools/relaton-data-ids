abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low-
    power and lossy networks. The nodes generate a Cryptographically Generated Address,
    register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a default router and periodically
    refresh the registration. Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol
    are described for secure neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks.
    Cryptographically generated address and digital signatures are calculated using
    elliptic curve cryptography, so that the cryptographic operations are suitable
    for low power devices.</p>"
