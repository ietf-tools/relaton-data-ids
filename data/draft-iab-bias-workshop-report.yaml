    convened by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) from January 15-17, 2024 as
    a three-day online meeting. Based on the submitted position papers, the workshop
    covered three areas of interest: the role of community networks in Internet Access
    of Services; reports and comments on the observed digital divide; and measurements
    of censorship and censorship circumvention. This report summarizes the workshop's
    discussion and serves as a reference for reports on the current barriers to Internet
    Access. Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.
    The views and positions documented in this report were expressed during the workshop
