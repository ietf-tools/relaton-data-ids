abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in a
    Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain through enabling differentiated services. When a packet
    is encapsulated in a mobile access gateway (or a local mobility anchor), the differentiated
    services codepoint (DSCP) field in the outer header is mapped to the priority
    of a mobile node, or the precedence of an application of the mobile node. Intermediary
    routers between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor, which
    forward the packet based on the outer header of the packet, prioritize the packet
    according to the DSCP value of the outer header.</p>"
