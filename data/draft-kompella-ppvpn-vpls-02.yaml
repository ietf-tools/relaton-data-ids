abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent LAN Service,
    and Virtual Private Switched Network service, is a useful Service Provider offering.
    The service offered is a Layer 2 VPN; however, in the case of VPLS, the customers
    in the VPN are connected by a multipoint network, in contrast to the usual Layer
    2 VPNs, which are point-to-point in nature. This document describes the functions
    required to offer VPLS, and proposes a mechanism for signaling a VPLS, as well
    as for forwarding VPLS frames across a packet switched network.</p>"
