abstract:
- content: "<p>End-to-end provisioning of quality of service guarantees is nowadays
    one of the most basic and crucial issues. Towards this end, the inter-domain resource
    control architecture for DiffServ networks described in [1], tries to address
    this issue by applying a scalable and efficient signaling approach. Based on this
    architecture, this paper tries to provide an analysis and a performance study
    of the introduced quiet grafting mechanisms.</p>"
