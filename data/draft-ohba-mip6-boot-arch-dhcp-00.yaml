abstract:
- content: "<p>A mobile node needs home address, home agent address and security association
    with home agent to register with the home agent. The process of obtaining this
    information is called bootstrapping. This document describes a bootstrapping architecture
    in which there is some dependency between AAA for network access and AAA for mobility
    service and DHCP in the visited network is used for carrying Mobile IPv6 bootstrap
    information to the mobile node. The architecture is based on an assumption that
    the mobile node uses network access credentials as the seed information without
    a need to pre-configure any Mobile IPv6 service parameters.</p>"
