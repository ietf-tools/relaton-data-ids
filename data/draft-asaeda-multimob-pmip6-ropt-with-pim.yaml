abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes IP multicast routing optimization with PIM-SM
    in Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) environment. The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and
    the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) are the mobility entities defined in the PMIPv6
    protocol and act as PIM-SM routers. The proposed protocol optimization addresses
    the tunnel convergence problem and cooperates with seamless handover mechanisms.</p>"
