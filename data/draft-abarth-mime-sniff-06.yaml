abstract:
- content: "<p>Many web servers supply incorrect Content-Type header fields with their
    HTTP responses. In order to be compatible with these servers, user agents consider
    the content of HTTP responses as well as the Content-Type header fields when determining
    the effective media type of the response. This document describes an algorithm
    for determining the effective media type of HTTP responses that balances security
    and compatibility considerations. Please send feedback on this draft to apps-discuss@ietf.org.</p>"
