abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been many opportunities to examine the functioning of the
    IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) since its creation in 2005 and the
    subsequent addition of the IETF Trust to its scope. Suggestions to do so have
    generally not progressed, in part because of constraints imposed by the IETF Trust.
    Those constraints have now expired. The IASA has often fallen short of the expectations
    about openness and transparency called for in BCP 101, with members of the IAOC
    and IETF Trust claiming excessive workload as a major cause of that problem. This
    document proposes to change the workload requirements.</p>"
