- content: "<p>This document is a revision of RFC 1928, the SOCKS version 5 protocol.
    SOCKS is a generic proxying protocol for traversing firewalls and other trust
    boundaries; version 5 of the protocol adds new features such as authentication
    and UDP support. Changes from the RFC in this draft include formatting cleanups,
    authentication clarification, and fixing UDP-related problems found during implementation.</p>"
