abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP is designed to provide IP services to roaming nodes, allowing
    them access to services, and enabling other nodes to reach them, as if they were
    on their home domain. By definition this functionality must be deployed on multiple
    subnets, and in many cases across domains, and while services which enable Mobile
    IP MUST be present on a subnet in order for a mobile node to have this reachability,
    deploying Mobile IP can introduce some security issues which may need to be addressed,
    by any network administrator overseeing Mobile IP subnets.</p>"
