abstract:
- content: "<p>When BGP is used to distribute a route, it can also be used to distribute
    a Link Layer PATH_NEXT_HOP binding which is mapped to that route such that packets
    to that network route can be switched directly across an Ethernet switched network.
    This document specifies the way in which this is done.</p>"
