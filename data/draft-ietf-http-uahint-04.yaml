abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a HTTP response header called UA-Hint, which
    can be used by applications (servers) to describe handling hints which will allow
    user agents to more accurately reflect the intent of the web application designer
    for the handling and presentation of the response entity. The UA-Hint header is
    intended to be an extensible general mechanism by which the application can suggest
    user agent behaviors which alter or extend the behaviors specified in HTTP/1.1
    (RFC 2068) with the express purpose of improving the usability of the resulting
    application. Intended considerations include enablement of a safe POST and refined
    handling of the traditional history buffer.</p>"
