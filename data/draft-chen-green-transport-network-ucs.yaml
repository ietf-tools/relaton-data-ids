abstract:
- content: "<p>With the continuous growth of business volume, the transmission rate
    and number of network elements have increased sharply, and energy consumption
    of transport network has increased accordingly. Rising power costs due to significant
    energy consumption in transport networks necessitate energy-saving measures. To
    address this, adjusting energy consumption strategies according to different service
    requirements to optimize efficiency, ensuring quality while eliminating waste.
    Furthermore, regular network optimization and energy efficiency assessments enhance
    equipment performance and extend lifespan, thereby controlling long-term operational
    costs. Integrating energy-saving concepts into transport network operations proactively
    supports sustainable development. This document presents two transport network
    level GREEN use cases, aiming to facilitate discussions within the GREEN Working
    Group on the potential benefits, challenges, and requirements. The use cases follow
    a structured template that is proposed for all GREEN use cases, ensuring consistency
    and comparability across different scenarios.</p>"
