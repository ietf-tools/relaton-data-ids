abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949 == STD 94)
    is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
    code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version
    negotiation. CBOR does not provide any forms of data compression. CBOR data items,
    in particular when generated from legacy data models, often allow considerable
    gains in compactness when applying data compression. While traditional data compression
    techniques such as DEFLATE (RFC 1951) can work well for CBOR encoded data items,
    their disadvantage is that the receiver needs to decompress the compressed form
    to make use of the data. This specification describes Packed CBOR, a simple transformation
    of a CBOR data item into another CBOR data item that is almost as easy to consume
    as the original CBOR data item. A separate decompression step is therefore often
    not required at the receiver. // The present version (-08) is a refresh update
    to -07, which added // the concept of Tag Equivalence as initially discussed at
    the CBOR // Interim meeting 12 in 2022 and at IETF 114.</p>"
