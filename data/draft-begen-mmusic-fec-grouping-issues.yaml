abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) currently supports grouping
    media lines. SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source
    and Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows. However, the existing specifications
    have strict requirements that severely limit the use of the new features that
    are currently under development in the FECFRAME WG. These new features will allow
    applications to use FEC in a more flexible way but they require changes in the
    current specifications. This document provides a list of the required changes
    and discusses potential approaches to make these changes.</p>"
