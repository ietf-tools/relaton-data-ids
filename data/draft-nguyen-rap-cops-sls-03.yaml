abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Common Open Policy Service (COPS)
    protocol for supporting Service Level Specification (SLS) negotiation (COPS-SLS).
    The COPS protocol [COPS] has been defined by the IETF Resource Allocation Protocol
    (RAP) WG [RAP] and will be used in this memo to communicate SLS information between
    customer and provider. COPS-SLS can be used at different interfaces such as vertically
    between a service provider and a network provider or horizontally between network
    providers in order to decide if the network guarantees a service level for a traffic
    stream. This version presents COPS-SLS as a candidate protocol for the interface
    between the Resource Control Domain (RCD) and the Service Control Domain (SCD),
    according to [SESSION-AUTH] vocabulary. It enables an SCD to vertically reserve
    RCD resource for its customers. Once resource has been reserved in the RCD, the
    media session establishment, together with the horizontal resource reservation,
    follows the steps described in the [AUTHSESSION] framework. Moreover, the respective
    PDPs have to verify that all the media streams being accepted lie within the bounds
    of the resource reserved in the RCD by the SCD.</p>"
