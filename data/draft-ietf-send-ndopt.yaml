abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) to discover other
    nodes on the link, to determine their link-layer addresses to find routers, and
    to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors. If not
    secured, NDP is vulnerable to various attacks. This document specifies security
    mechanisms for NDP. Unlike those in the original NDP specifications, these mechanisms
    do not use IPsec. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
