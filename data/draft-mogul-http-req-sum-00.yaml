abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC1122 [1] introduced a ``Requirements Summary'' format, to help implementors
    understand what aspects of a lengthy specification were mandatory, recommended,
    or optional. The HTTP/1.1 specification is similarly lengthy and complicated;
    many implementors have asked for guidance in understanding what they need to do.
    The latest draft revision of the HTTP/1.1 specification [2] has a placeholder
    section for a ``Requirements Summary'', but there has been relatively little discussion
    of the format and content of this summary in the HTTP working group. This document
    proposes a specific format for the summary, and gives an example summary for one
    section of the document.</p>"
