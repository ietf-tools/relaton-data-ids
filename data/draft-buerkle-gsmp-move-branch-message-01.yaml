abstract:
- content: "<p>Some multicast applications, such as Video distribution, need an efficient
    support for moving between multicast groups. This draft shows that the support
    of such application results in a extended move branch concept of GSMP to be able
    to move the Output branch of a connection not only to another port but also between
    connections with the same QoS.</p>"
