abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines basic terminology for describing different types
    of behavior for NATs and firewalls. It also defines a set of requirements for
    NATs and firewalls that would allow many applications, such as multimedia communications
    or online gaming, to work consistently. Developing NATs and firewalls that meet
    this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications
    will function properly.</p>"
