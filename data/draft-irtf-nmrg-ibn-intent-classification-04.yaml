abstract:
- content: "<p>Intent is an abstract, high-level policy used to operate the network.
    Intent management system includes an interface for users to input requests and
    an engine to translate the intents into the network configuration and manage their
    life-cycle. This document discusses mostly the concept of network intents, but
    other types of intents are also being considered. Specifically, it highlights
    stakeholder perspectives of intent, methods to classify and encode intent, the
    associated intent taxonomy, and defines relevant intent terms where necessary.
    This document provides a foundation for intent related research and facilitates
    solution development. This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management
    Research Group (NMRG). The document represents the consensus of the RG. During
    the document's lifecycle it received many positive expressions of support and
    detailed reviews beyond the authors. Only in the last call period it received
    more than 12 positive expressions of support and more than 5 detailed reviews.
    It is published for informational purposes.</p>"
