abstract:
- content: "<p>Several different call models are in common use today in conventional
    Telephony. IP Telephony is gaining wider acceptance. There is, as yet, no well-defined,
    widely accepted call model for this domain. In this draft, we study some of the
    issues associated with call models for IP Telephony, and suggest how a single
    call model representation may be selected to effectively represent call processing
    in this domain.</p>"
