abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests a file format to be used to inform multiple mail
    reading user agent programs about the locally-installed facilities for handling
    mail in various formats. The mechanism is explicitly designed to work with mail
    systems based Internet mail as defined by RFC's 821, 822, 934, 1049, 1113, and
    the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, known as MIME. However, with some extensions
    it could probably be made to work for X.400-based mail systems as well. The format
    and mechanism are proposed in a manner that is generally operating-system independent.
    However, certain implementation details will inevitably reflect operating system
    differences, some of which will have to be handled in a uniform manner for each
    operating system. This memo makes such situations explicit, and, in an appendix,
    suggests a standard behavior under the UNIX operating system. This is a minor
    update to RFC 1524. Differences are detailed in Appendix E.</p>"
