abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
    for IPv4 and IPv6. It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it is based on
    VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in "Virtual Router Redundancy
    Protocol for IPv6". VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns
    responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP
    router controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual router
    is called the VRRP Active Router, and it forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or
    IPv6 addresses. VRRP Active Routers are configured with virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses,
    and VRRP Backup Routers infer the address family of the virtual addresses being
    carried based on the transport protocol. Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers
    in each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto themselves and
    do not overlap. The election process provides dynamic failover in the forwarding
    responsibility should the Active Router become unavailable. For IPv4, the advantage
    gained from using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without requiring
    configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.
    For IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switchover
    to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.
    The VRRP terminology has been updated conform to inclusive language guidelines
    for IETF technologies. This document obsoletes VRRP Version 3 [RFC5798].</p>
