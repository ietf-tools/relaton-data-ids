abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks require certain packet flows to be transported with preferential
    treatment over others of the same type (e.g., voice or video). This document defines
    a new PHB (Per Hop Behavior), the Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding (MLEF) PHB,
    which is a minor extension to EF defined in RFC 3246. RFC 3246 defines the Expedited
    Forwarding PHB for applications requiring low latency, but with a single DSCP
    and treatment per queue. Although EF suggests that packet discard should be used
    to achieve this behavior, it does not define an algorithm for packet discard.
    This document extends that concept and defines a PHB with multiple discard treatments
    for packet flows for applications requiring low latency and multiple priority
    levels.</p>"
