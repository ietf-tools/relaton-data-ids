abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an experimental protocol, IP over Avian Carriers
    using Drones (IPoAC-Drone), as an extension to the classic IPoAC (RFC 1149) for
    modern low-altitude economy applications. It describes how UAVs (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles) can be utilized as network carriers to provide a store-and-forward data
    transmission model. The document covers protocol design, operational considerations,
    and potential applications, including emergency communication, rural networking,
    and disaster recovery.</p>"
