abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS Segment Routing (SR-MPLS in short) is an MPLS data plane-based
    source routing paradigm in which the sender of a packet is allowed to partially
    or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network by imposing
    stacked MPLS labels on the packet. SR-MPLS could be leveraged to realize a source
    routing mechanism across MPLS, IPv4, and IPv6 data planes by using an MPLS label
    stack as a source routing instruction set while preserving backward compatibility
    with SR-MPLS. This document describes how SR-MPLS capable routers and IP-only
    routers can seamlessly co-exist and interoperate through the use of SR-MPLS label
    stacks and IP encapsulation/tunneling such as MPLS-in- UDP as defined in RFC 7510.</p>"
