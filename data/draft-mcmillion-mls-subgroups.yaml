- content: "<p>This document describes how the user of an MLS-based messaging service
    can synchronize the operation of its devices, such that they behave as a single
    virtual MLS client. This prevents other users of the messaging service from being
    able to tell when a user changes its set of authorized devices, or which device
    the user sent a message from.</p>"
