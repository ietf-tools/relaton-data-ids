abstract:
- content: "<p>Security policies are often implemented by network intermediaries such
    as routers and proxies. These intermediaries are unable to distinguish between
    requests from requests initiated by a user and requests initiated by untrusted
    mobile code running on the user's machine. This document describes the X-RequestOrigin
    hop-by-hop HTTP header, which an HTTP client uses to allow intermediate proxies
    to make this distinction.</p>"
