abstract:
- content: "<p>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object
    identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for the purpose of registering the Edwards
    Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature algorithms. This donated set of OIDs
    allowed for shorter values than would be possible using the existing S/MIME or
    PKIX arcs. This document describes the donated range and the identifiers that
    were assigned from that range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes
    IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.</p>"
