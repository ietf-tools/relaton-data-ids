abstract:
- content: "<p>The increased intertwinement of Internet and society increases the
    impact of the Internet on the lives of individuals. Because of this, the design
    and development of the architecture of the Internet also has an increasing impact
    on society. This has led to an increasing recognition that human rights [UDHR]
    [ICCPR] [ICESCR] have a role in the development and management of the Internet
    [HRC2012] [UNGA2013] [NETmundial]. It has also been argued that the Internet should
    be strenghtened as a human rights enabeling environment [Brown]. This document
    provides a proposal for a glossary to discuss the relation between human rights
    and Internet protocols, an overview of the discussion, a proposal for the mapping
    of the relation between human rights and technical concepts, and a proposal for
    guidelines for human rights considerations, similar to the work done on the guidelines
    for privacy considerations [RFC6973]. Discussion of this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org
