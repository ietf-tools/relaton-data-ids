abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's RAP Working Group has almost completed its task of defining
    COPS as a standards-track protocol for RSVP Admission Policy. The WG's charter
    is now being extended to cover standardizing a policy provisioning protocol, and
    the proposal put forward for consideration by the WG is based on defining a new
    Client-type for COPS. This new Client-type is intended to work in conjunction
    with the QoS Policy objects and schema definitions being defined in two other
    IETF Working Groups: Differentiated Services, and Policy. Before proceeding any
    further, it has been requested that a comparison be undertaken as to why COPS
    is better suited to this than a (modified if necessary) version of SNMP. This
    memo attempts to document such a comparison.</p>"
