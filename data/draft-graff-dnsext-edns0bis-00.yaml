abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System's wire protocol includes a number of fixed fields
    whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not allow clients to advertise
    their capabilities to servers. This document describes backward compatible mechanisms
    for allowing the protocol to grow. This document is a starting point to update
    the EDNS0 RFC after 10 years of operational experience.</p>"
