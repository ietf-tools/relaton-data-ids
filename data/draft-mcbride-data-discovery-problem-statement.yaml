- content: "<p>If data is the new oil of the 21st century, then we need a standardized
    way of locating, capturing, classifying and transforming this raw data to generate
    insights and recommendations. Data, like oil, needs to be discovered and captured
    in order to be refined and valuable. While the topic of data discovery can be
    far reaching, this document focuses on the problem of actually locating data,
    throughout a network of data servers, in a standardized way.</p>"
