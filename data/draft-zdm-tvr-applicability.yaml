abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) is a routing system that can support the
    predicted topology changes caused by internal or external reasons. Typical use
    cases include resource preservation networks, operating efficiency networks and
    dynamic reachability networks. This document provides examples of how to implement
    the TVR scheduling capabilities for key use cases. It describes which part of
    the TVR data model is used and why, and it outlines operational and security considerations
    when deploying TVR-based technologies.</p>"
