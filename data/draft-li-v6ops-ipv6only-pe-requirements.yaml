abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the basic requirements for multi-domain IPv6-only
    Provider Edge (PE) routers. The requirements cover several key aspects: support
    for fundamental IPv6 protocols, such as, MP-BGP and ICMPv6, implementation of
    4map6 based MP-BGP extensions, stateless encapsulation and translation functions
    using IPv6 mapping prefixes as well as support for SRv6 and NAT64 functionalities.
    By defining these requirements, this document aims to facilitate the development,
    deployment and interoperability of such PE routers, thereby promoting the smooth
    establishment and operation of multi- domain IPv6-only Networks.</p>"
