abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specify a mechanism to allow IPv6 stack implementation
    to parse upcoming IPv6 extension header by reserving a small range of protocol
    numbers for well defined IPv6 extension headers. IPv6 stack implementors can code
    these range into their network stack a priori. These reserved range provide an
    guarantee that a given next header is a well formed extension header and not a
    next layer protocol. Operators, companies, vendors et cetera are in the ability
    to deploy and test not standardized extension headers without modifying every
    middle box parsing the complete extension header chain in between.</p>"
