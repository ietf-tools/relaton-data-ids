abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines host extensions to Protocol Independent Multicast
    - PIM protocol. These host extensions allows endnodes to join/leave any multicast
    (S/*,G) groups. This helps in easing SSM-style multicast deployment that does
    not have to depend on IGMP (v1/v2/v3), in either endnodes or the routers.</p>"
