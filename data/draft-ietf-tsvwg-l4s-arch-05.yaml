abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet
    applications to achieve Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput (L4S),
    while coexisting on shared network bottlenecks with existing Internet applications
    that are not built to take advantage of this new technology. In traditional bottleneck
    links that utilize a single, shared egress queue, a variety of application traffic
    flows can share the bottleneck queue simultaneously. As a result, each sender's
    behavior and its response to the congestion signals (delay, packet drop, ECN marking)
    provided by the queue can impact the performance of all other applications that
    share the link. Furthermore, it is considered important that new protocols coexist
    in a reasonably fair manner with existing protocols (most notably TCP and QUIC).
    As a result, senders tend to normalize on behaviors that are not significantly
    different than those in use by the majority of the existing senders. For many
    years, the majority of traffic on the Internet has used either the Reno AIMD congestion
    controller or the Cubic algorithm, and as a result any newly proposed congestion
    controller needs to demonstrate that it provides reasonable fairness when sharing
    a bottleneck with flows that use Reno or Cubic. This has led to an ossification
    in congestion control, where improved congestion controllers cannot easily be
    deployed on the Internet. It is well known that the common existing congestion
    controllers (e.g. Reno and Cubic) increase their congestion window (the amount
    of data in flight) until they induce congestion, and they respond to the congestion
    signals of packet loss (or equivalently ECN marks) by significantly reducing their
    congestion window. This leads to a large sawtooth of the congestion window that
    manifests itself as a combination of queue delay and/or link underutilization.
    Meanwhile, in closed network environments, such as data centres, new congestion
    controllers (e.g. DCTCP [RFC8257]) have been deployed that significantly outperform
    Reno and Cubic in terms of queue delay and link utilization across a much wider
    range of network conditions. The L4S architecture provides an approach that allows
    for the deployment of next generation congestion controllers while preserving
    reasonably fair coexistence with Reno and Cubic. The L4S architecture consists
    of three components: network support to isolate L4S traffic from other traffic
    and to provide appropriate congestion signaling to both types; protocol features
    that allow network elements to identify L4S traffic and allow for communication
    of congestion signaling; and host support for immediate congestion signaling and
    an appropriate congestion response that enables scalable performance.</p>"
