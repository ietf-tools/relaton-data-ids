abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines new method of calculating the authentication
    HASH of the IKE [RFC-2409] protocol. It fixes known problems with the IKE. The
    way the HASH is currently defined in the [RFC-2409] does not authen- ticate the
    ISAKMP [RFC-2408] packet header, nor does it authenticate any extra ISAKMP payloads
    inside phase 1 ISAKMP packets. This causes a secu- rity problem when using extra
    ISAKMP payloads as already defined in the IKE and DOI [RFC-2407] (vendor ID payload,
    INITIAL-CONTACT notification etc). There is also suggestion how to fix the Phase
    2 authentication hashes so that they will also authenticate the ISAKMP packet
    header.</p>"
