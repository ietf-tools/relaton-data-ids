abstract:
- content: "<p>Cellular IP specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagrams to
    a mobile host. The protocol is intended to provide local mobility and handoff
    support. It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to provide wide area mobility support.
    This I-D provides performance results based on the implementation and analysis
    of Cellular IP as defined by draft draft-valko-cellularip-01.txt [2]. The evaluation
    is focused on handoff performance, optimum active-state-timeout choice and scalability
    issues. The Cellular IP source code used for the experimental results presented
    in this Internet-Draft is freely available from comet.columbia.edu/cellularip.</p>"
