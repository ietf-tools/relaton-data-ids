abstract:
- content: "<p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) supports two commands that list files:
    NLST and LIST. The NLST response is easy to parse but provides very little information.
    The LIST response provides more information, but in a format that varies from
    system to system. The most common LIST formats are undocumented and impossible
    to parse reliably. This document defines Easily Parsed LIST Format (EPLF), a format
    for the LIST response that is usable by humans yet easy for programs to handle.
    This format is supported by anonftpd, a secure FTP server. One visible advantage
    of EPLF is that a browser can easily display dates in the viewer's time zone and
    native language. EPLF also makes it straightforward for an indexing program to
    automatically traverse an FTP area and for a mirroring program to avoid downloading
    the same file twice.</p>"
