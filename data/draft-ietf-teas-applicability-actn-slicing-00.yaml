abstract:
- content: "<p>Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network
    domain. It utilizes a set of policies to select network resources and obtain a
    view of potential connectivity across the network. Network slicing is an approach
    to network operations that builds on the concept of network abstraction to provide
    programmability, flexibility, and modularity. It may use techniques such as Software
    Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to create multiple
    logical or virtual networks, each tailored for a set of services that share the
    same set of requirements. Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
    (ACTN) is described in RFC 8453. It defines an SDN-based architecture that relies
    on the concept of network and service abstraction to detach network and service
    control from the underlying data plane. This document outlines the applicability
    of ACTN to network slicing in a Traffic Engineering (TE) network that utilizes
    IETF technology. It also identifies the features of network slicing not currently
    within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where ACTN might be extended.</p>"
