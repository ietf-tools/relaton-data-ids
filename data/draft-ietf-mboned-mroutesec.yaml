abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes security threats for the larger (intra-domain or
    inter-domain) multicast routing infrastructures. Only Protocol Independent Multicast
    - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is analyzed, in its three main operational modes: the traditional
    Any-Source Multicast (ASM) model, the source-specific multicast (SSM) model, and
    the ASM model enhanced by the Embedded Rendezvous Point (Embedded-RP) group-to-RP
    mapping mechanism. This memo also describes enhancements to the protocol operations
    that mitigate the identified threats. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
