abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently there are no policy classes defined for the PEP to convey
    provisioned policy usage feedback to the PDP. The purpose of this document is
    to define the accounting framework PIB that specifies the policy classes common
    for COPS accounting type reports. The basic operation and objects for reporting
    usage information are defined in [COPS]. A specific clientSI accounting type object
    named REPORT is defined in [COPS-PR]. This document further describes operational
    behavior that is implied in [COPS] and [COPS-PR.]</p>"
