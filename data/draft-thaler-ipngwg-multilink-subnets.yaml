abstract:
- content: "<p>Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several operational
    advantages. A single subnet prefix is sufficient to support multiple physical
    links. There is no need to allocate subnet numbers to the different networks,
    simplifying management. This document introduces the concept of a 'multilink subnet',
    defined as a collection of independent links, connected by routers, but sharing
    a common subnet prefix. It then specifies the behavior of multilink subnet routers
    so that no changes to host behavior are needed.</p>"
