abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture aimed for reducing the latency
    of network access authentication based on the Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP). The architecture is based on the design of a new EAP method for which a
    standalone authenticator is used, and does not require any change to the EAP specification
    or the specifications of existing EAP lower-layers.</p>"
