abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework to integrate a Network Address
    Translation layer into an operator's network to function as a Carrier Grade NAT
    (also known as CGN or Large Scale NAT). The CGN infrastructure will often form
    a NAT444 environment as the subscriber home network will likely also maintain
    a subscriber side NAT function. Exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool is a major
    driver compelling some operators to implement CGN. Although operators may wish
    to deploy IPv6 to strategically overcome IPv4 exhaustion, near term needs may
    not be satisfied with an IPv6 deployment alone. This document provides a practical
    integration model which allows the CGN platform to be integrated into the network
    meeting the connectivity needs of the subscriber while being mindful of not disrupting
    existing services and meeting the technical challenges that CGN brings. The model
    included in this document utilizes BGP/MPLS IP VPNs which allow for virtual routing
    separation helping ease the CGNs impact on the network. This document does not
    intend to defend the merits of CGN.</p>"
