abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a loop-detection algorithm with a cumulative
    O(n) complexity (O(1) average complexity for each proxy) and average O(log n)
    state-space, where n is the number of proxies that the message passes through.
    Also, the backwards-compatibility and security of this algorithm are discussed.
    Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working group list
    at 'sipping@ietf.org'.</p>"
