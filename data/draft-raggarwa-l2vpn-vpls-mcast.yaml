abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a solution for overcoming the limitations of
    existing VPLS multicast solutions. It describes procedures for VPLS multicast
    that utilize multicast trees in the sevice provider (SP) network. One such multicast
    tree can be shared between multiple VPLS instances. Procedures by which a single
    multicast tree in the backbone can be used to carry traffic belonging only to
    a specified set of one or more multicast groups from one or more VPLSs are also
    described.</p>"
