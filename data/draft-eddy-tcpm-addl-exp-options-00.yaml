abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been multiple issues with the allocation of TCP option kind
    numbers recently. Two of these issues, which this document attempts to address,
    are that there were only a small number of options reserved by RFC 4727 for experiment
    and test use in the RFC 3692 style to begin with, and both of these have been
    used in shipping products. This impacts the ability of other research and experimental
    efforts to develop and test running code since registration of other option numbers
    requires either IESG Approval or Standards Action. This document proposes designation
    of additional experimental options in the IANA registry for TCP Option Kind Numbers,
    intended to resolve the possible barriers to using the existing RFC 3962 experimental-use
    options.</p>"
