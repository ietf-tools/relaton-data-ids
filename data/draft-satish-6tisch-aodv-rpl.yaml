abstract:
- content: "<p>Asymmetrical link based time-sensitive traffic flows with highly reliable
    shortest end-to-end route discovery is pre-requisite in IPv6 over the TSCH mode
    of IEEE 802.15.4e (6tisch) Networks. To achieve, this document specifies a resource
    reservation based reactive P2P route discovery mechanism for hop-by-hop routing
    (storing mode) based on Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) RPL protocol
    for 6tisch Networks. Two separate instances are used to achieve directional paths
    based on asymmetric links in between source and destination.</p>"
