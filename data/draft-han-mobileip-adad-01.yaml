abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes to automatically allocate a care-of IPv6 addresses
    (CoA) for the use of mobile nodes that want to be fast handovered. Each access
    router maintains 'Passive Proxy Cache' of which each address is in advance generated
    and tested for its uniqueness by the access router. Also, the access router acts
    as 'Passive Proxy' for an address reserved in 'Passive Proxy Cache' in order not
    to affect the destination cache and neighbor cache of its neighbor nodes and not
    to disturb the normal CoA configuration procedure of the nodes which do not obey
    this draft. During L3 handover, a mobile node, which obeys this draft, requests
    one of the duplication-free addresses reserved by its target access router. After
    successfully acquiring the address, the mobile node assigns it on its interface
    which attaches to the new link, without the RFC 2461 DAD. Consequently, the proposed
    scheme can completely take off the DAD procedure and hence the time involved in
    the exsting L3 handover schemes</p>"
