abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints,
    commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication
    and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.
    This document defines actors in the security architecture for authentication and
    authorization, analyzes the relationships between them, and describes their respective
    tasks and characteristics. This knowledge will then be used to derive requirements
    for the communication between the actors.</p>"
