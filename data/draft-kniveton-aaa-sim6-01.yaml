abstract:
- content: "<p>Providing an existing scalable authorization infrastructure for mobile
    nodes is needed for IPv6-based mobility. SIM Authentication provides a protocol
    for authenticating and authorizing services. It uses an authorizing home domain
    defined by the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). The protocol is an Internet Control
    Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) extension. It can leverage the existing SIM
    authorization infrastructure for automatic bootstrapping of security association
    between the mobile node and a service, where the service can be e.g. authorized
    last-hop VPN setup for network access or Mobile IPv6 mobile-home security association
    setup.</p>"
