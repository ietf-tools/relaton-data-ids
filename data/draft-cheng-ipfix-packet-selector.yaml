abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a composite IP packet selector in Metering
    Process of the IP Flow Information Export protocol (IPFIX). The composite selector
    is realized by combining a sampling selector using systematic or random sampling
    technique followed by a hash- based filtering selector computing the hash function
    on 5-tuples information (source/ destination IP address, source/destination port
    number, port). Taking flow sampling into account in packet selection, the designed
    composite selector could better solve the short-flow lost problem meeting in simple
    systematic or random sampling selector.</p>"
