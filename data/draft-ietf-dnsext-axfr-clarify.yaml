abstract:
- content: "<p>The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for maintaining
    coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers consists of three mechanisms.
    Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) is one of the mechanisms and is defined in RFC 1034
    and RFC 1035. The definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby
    forcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions, impeding
    interoperability. Yet today we have a satisfactory set of implementations that
    do interoperate. This document is a new definition of AXFR -- new in the sense
    that it records an accurate definition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
