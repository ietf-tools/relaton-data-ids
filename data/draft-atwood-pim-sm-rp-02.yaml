abstract:
- content: "<p>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol uses
    a core-based tree to forward multicast datagrams to members of a multicast group.
    Currently there is no method for relocating the core or Rendezvous Point (RP)
    for a group. Administratively chosen RP's lead to low performance as the sources
    and receivers in the multicast group join and leave the group. This draft presents
    a mechanism for dynamically relocating the RP to a position that minimizes the
    tree cost and improves performance.</p>"
