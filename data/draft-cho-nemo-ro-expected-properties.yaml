abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo categorizes the route optimization problem of NEMO and clarifies
    the expected properties of the route optimization protocols. The route optimization
    can be classified into NEMO optimization and nested NEMO optimization. Since NEMO
    basic support protocol is based on bi-directional tunneling, the packets from
    the CN to the MNN are suffer from inefficient routing all the cases. This routing
    inefficiency is getting worse when a number of MRs are nested. This memo is especially
    interested in nested NEMO optimization. To solve the routing inefficiency problem,
    there were several proposals. However, those proposals could not be compared or
    evaluated properly since there was no consensus on the expected properties of
    nested mobile networks. This memo is willing to suggest the expected properties
    of nested mobile networks, so as to help coming route optimization proposals find
    their strength and weakness according to the commonly accepted desirable properties.</p>"
