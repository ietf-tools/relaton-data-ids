abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo makes the case for interdependent TCP control blocks, where
    part of the TCP state is shared among similar concurrent connections, or across
    similar connection instances. TCP state includes a combination of parameters,
    such as connection state, current round-trip time estimates, congestion control
    information, and process information. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</p>"
