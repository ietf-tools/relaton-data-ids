abstract:
- content: "<p>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing
    protocol designed for ad-hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is a mesh-based,
    rather than a conventional tree-based, multicast scheme and uses a Forwarding
    Group concept (only a subset of nodes forwards the multicast packets via scoped
    flooding). It applies on-demand procedures to dynamically set up routes and maintain
    multicast group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad-hoc wireless networks
    with mobile hosts where bandwidth is limited, topology changes frequently and
    rapidly, and power is constrained.</p>"
