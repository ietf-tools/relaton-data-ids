abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establish
    backup LSP tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels. Two methods are presented
    here. One is to setup one-to-one detour LSPs according to the requirements defined
    by the head-end users. The other is to setup many-to-one bypass LSP using a single
    bypass tunnel to backup a set of protected LSPs (making use of label stacking)
    to reroute both data and control traffic. Both methods can protect both link and
    node during network failure, and make use of local protection techniques.</p>"
