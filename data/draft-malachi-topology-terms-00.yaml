abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a common nomenclature for use by the Physical Topology
    MIB Working Group. This glossary is based on the terms used in the various Internet
    Drafts submitted to this working group as well as on some RFCs. As we move forward
    with the definition of a common topology MIB this glossary will evolve to reflect
    the new constructs in the MIB and this draft will probably become a section in
    the Physical Topology MIB Internet Draft. Although a topology MIB will include
    many terms we include here only terms which are not well-defined elsewhere or
    might be confusing here.</p>"
