abstract:
- content: "<p>The invention of a large-scale quantum computer would pose a serious
    challenge for the cryptographic algorithms that are widely deployed today. The
    Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) supports key transport and key agreement algorithms
    that could be broken by the invention of such a quantum computer. By storing communications
    that are protected with the CMS today, someone could decrypt them in the future
    when a large-scale quantum computer becomes available. Once quantum-secure key
    management algorithms are available, the CMS will be extended to support the new
    algorithms, if the existing syntax does not accommodate them. In the near-term,
    this document describes a mechanism to protect today's communication from the
    future invention of a large-scale quantum computer by mixing the output of key
    transport and key agreement algorithms with a pre-shared key.</p>"
