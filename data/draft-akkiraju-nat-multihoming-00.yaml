abstract:
- content: "<p>Multihoming to upstream ISPs is a requirement today for most networks
    in the Internet. The most common motivation to multihome is for reliable, non-stop
    access to the Internet. However, Multihoming creates scaling problems for the
    global routing infrastructure by making route aggregation more difficult for multihomed
    networks. Multihoming also complicates the addressing scheme used by the network.
    Another requirement for multihomed networks is the ability to load balance traffic
    between the multiple links to upstream ISPs. This requirement is difficult to
    fulfill for traffic flow in both directions as the multihomed network has no control
    over the return path of the packet.</p>"
