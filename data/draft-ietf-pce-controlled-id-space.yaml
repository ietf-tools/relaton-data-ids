abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
    a mechanism for the Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations
    in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions
    allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering
    (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCE can be used for
    computing paths in the SR networks. Stateful PCE provides active control of MPLS-TE
    LSPs via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally
    configured LSPs to the PCE. Further, stateful PCE could also create and remove
    PCE-initiated LSPs by itself. A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by integrating with elements of
    Software-Defined Networking (SDN). In some use cases, such as PCECC provisioning
    or Binding Segment Identifier (SID) for Segment Routing (SR) allocation, there
    are requirements for a stateful PCE to make allocation of labels, SIDs, etc. These
    use cases require PCE to be aware of various identifier spaces from where to make
    allocations on behalf of a PCC. This document defines a generic mechanism by which
    a PCC can inform the PCE of the identifier space set aside for the PCE control
    via PCEP. The identifier could be an MPLS label, a SID, or any other identifier
    that can be allocated and managed by the PCE.</p>"
