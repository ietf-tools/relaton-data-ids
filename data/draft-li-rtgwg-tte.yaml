abstract:
- content: "<p>Conventional traffic engineering approaches for resource management
    used by RSVP-TE and SR-TE often leverage estimates of the ingress traffic demands,
    during path placement. Unforeseen and/or dynamic events, can skew these estimates
    by significant enough margins to result in unexpected network congestion. Recomputed
    paths that address the new demands may take a considerable amount of time, leaving
    the network in a sub-optimal state for far too long. This document proposes one
    mechanism that can avert congestion on a real-time basis.</p>"
