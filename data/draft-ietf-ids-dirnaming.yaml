abstract:
- content: "<p>Application of the conventional X.500 approach to naming has heretofore,
    in the experience of the authors, proven to be an obstacle to the wide deployment
    of directory-enabled applications on the Internet. We propose a new directory
    naming plan that leverages the strengths of the most popular and successful Internet
    naming schemes for naming objects in a hierarchical directory. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard
    of any kind.</p>"
