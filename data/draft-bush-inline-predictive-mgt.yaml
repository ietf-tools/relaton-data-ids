abstract:
- content: "<p>In-line network management prediction exploits fine-grained models
    of network components, injected into the communication network, to enhance network
    performance. Accurate and fast prediction of local network state enables more
    intelligent network control resulting in greater performance and fault tolerance.
    Accurate and fast prediction requires algorithmic capability. Active and Programmable
    Networking have enabled algorithmic information to be dynamically injected into
    the network allowing enhanced capability and flexibility. One of the new capabilities
    is enhanced network management via in-line management code, that is, management
    algorithms embedded within intermediate network devices. In-line network management
    prediction utilizes low-level algorithmic transport capability to implement low-overhead
    predictive management. A secondary purpose of this document is to provide general
    interoperability information for the injection of general purpose algorithmic
    information into network devices. This document may help in some manner to serve
    as a temporary bridge between Internet Protocol and Active and Programmable Network
    applications. This may stimulate some thought as to the content and format of
    'standards' information potentially required for Active Networking. Management
    of the Internet Protocol and Active and Programmable Networking is vital. In particular,
    coexistence and interoperability of active networking and Internet Protocol management
    is specified in order to implement the injection of algorithmic information into
    a network.</p>"
