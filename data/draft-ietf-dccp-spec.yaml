abstract:
- content: "<p>The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport protocol
    that provides bidirectional unicast connections of congestion-controlled unreliable
    datagrams. DCCP is suitable for applications that transfer fairly large amounts
    of data and that can benefit from control over the tradeoff between timeliness
    and reliability. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
