abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an application programming interface and a
    corresponding protocol (MGCP) for controlling Voice over IP (VoIP) Gate- ways
    from external call control elements. MGCP assumes a call control architecture
    where the call control 'intelligence' is outside the gateways and handled by external
    call control elements. The document is structured in 6 main sections: * The introduction
    presents the basic assumptions and the relation to other protocols such as H.323,
    RTSP, SAP or SIP. * The interface section presents a conceptual overview of the
    MGCP, presenting the naming conventions, the usage of the session description
    protocol SDP, and the procedures that compose MGCP: Notifications Request, Notification,
    Create Connection, Modify Con- nection, Delete Connection, AuditEndpoint, AuditConnection
    and Res- tartInProgress. * The protocol description section presents the MGCP
    encodings, which are based on simple text formats, and the transmission procedure
    over UDP. * The security section presents the security requirement of MGCP, and
    its usage of IP security services (IPSEC). * The event packages section provides
    an initial definition of pack- ages and event names. * The description of the
    changes made in combining SGCP 1.1 and IPDC to create MGCP 0.1.</p>"
