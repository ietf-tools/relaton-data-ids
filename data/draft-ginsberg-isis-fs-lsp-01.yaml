abstract:
- content: "<p>Intermediate System To Intermediate System (IS-IS) provides efficient
    and reliable flooding of information to its peers. However the current flooding
    scopes are limited to either area wide scope or domain wide scope. There are existing
    use cases where support of other flooding scopes are desirable. This document
    defines new Protocol Data Units (PDUs) which provide support for new flooding
    scopes as well as additional space for advertising information targeted for the
    currently supported flooding scopes. The protocol extensions defined in this document
    are not backwards compatible with existing implementations and so must be deployed
    with care.</p>"
