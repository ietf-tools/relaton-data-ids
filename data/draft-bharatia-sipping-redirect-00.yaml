abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP is selected as a session control protocol for many VOIP applications.
    Hence it should provide capabilities for supporting such redirection-based services
    as automatic call distribution for call centers, third-party voicemail, follow-me
    service etc. The concept of Call Redirection is implicit in the capabilities already
    defined for SIP Proxies and Clients.</p>"
