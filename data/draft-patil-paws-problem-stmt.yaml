abstract:
- content: <p>Governments around the world continue to search for new bands of radio
    spectrum which can be used by the expanding wireless communications industry to
    provide more services in the usable spectrum. The concept of allowing secondary
    transmissions (licensed or unlicensed) in frequencies occupied by a primary user
    is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use. An obvious requirement
    is that these secondary transmissions do not interfere with the primary use of
    the spectrum. One interesting observation is that often, in a given physical location,
    the primary user(s) may not be using the entire band allocated to them. The available
    spectrum for a secondary use would then depend on the location of the secondary
    user. The fundamental issue is how to determine for a specific location and specific
    time, if any of the primary spectrum is available for secondary use. Academia
    and Industry have studied multiple cognitive radio mechanisms for use in such
    a scenario. One simple mechanism is to use a geospatial database that records
    the primary users occupation, and require the secondary users to check the database
    prior to selecting what part of the spectrum they use. Such databases could be
    available on the Internet for query by secondary users. This document discusses
    the problems that need to be addressed for enabling the use of white space spectrum
    by obtaining information from such a database.</p>
