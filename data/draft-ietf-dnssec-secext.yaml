- content: "<p>The Domain Name System (DNS) has become a critical operational part
    of the Internet infrastructure yet it has no strong security mechanisms to assure
    data integrity or authentication. Extensions to the DNS are described that provide
    these services to security aware resolvers or applications through the use of
    cryptographic digital signatures. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
