abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote configuration of network devices which implement IPsec- related
    services is desirable as a matter of convenience and of scale. In some cases,
    these devices are installed on a network with no prior configuration. In such
    cases, secure mechanisms for bootstrap configuration are required. In this document
    the associated issues are examined, and a multi-tiered approach is proposed from
    which a specific method may be selected based upon the security requirements of
    the environment in which the security device exists. While the primary devices
    considered here are security gateways and bump-in-the-wire encryptors, many of
    the resulting conclusions may extend to other devices, including host IPsec implementations.</p>"
