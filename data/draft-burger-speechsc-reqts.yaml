abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol to
    control distributed speech processing of audio streams. By speech processing,
    this document specifically means automatic speech recognition, speaker verification
    and text-to-speech. Other IETF protocols, such as SIP and RTSP, address rendezvous
    and control for generalized media streams. However, speech processing presents
    additional requirements that none of the extant IETF protocols address. Discussion
    of this and related documents is on the MRCP list. To subscribe, send the message
    'subscribe mrcp' to majordomo@snowshore.com. The public archive is at http://flyingfox.snowshore.com/mrcp_archive/maillist.html.
    NOTE: This mailing list will be superseded by an official working group mailing
    list, cats@ietf.org, once the WG is formally chartered.</p>"
