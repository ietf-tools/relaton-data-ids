abstract:
- content: <p>XML signature standard as described in [RFC3275] and defined by IETF/
    W3C references or identifies signed elements by their unique identities in the
    given XML document. Hence, signed XML elements can be shifted from one location
    to another location in a XML document,and still, it does not have any effect on
    its ability to verify its signature. This flexibility paves the way for an attacker
    to tweak original XML message without getting noticed by the receiver. This document
    proposes to use absolute XPath as an "Positional Token" and modifies existing
    XML Digital Signature algorithm to overcome the XML Signature wrapping/rewriting
    attacks on XML ignatures.</p>
