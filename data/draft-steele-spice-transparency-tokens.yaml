abstract:
- content: "<p>When professionals travel for business, they carry identity documents,
    such as passports, employer related payment capabilites, such as corporate credit
    cards, and security keys that might be used for both personal or professional
    reasons, such as hotel or car keys. These credentials might be stored in a purse,
    briefcase or wallet. Digital storage systems struggle to support the various credential
    formats, physical proximity and remote presentation protocols, and assurance capabilities
    needed to enable international business. Device capabilities, cost and power consumption
    can preclude access and adoption of digital credentials, or exclude communities
    that require higher than normal privacy, sustainability, or availability guarantees.
    This specification describes a scalable solution to digital credentials, that
    is market friendly, transport agnostic, privacy oriented, and accountable to users
    of digital credentials above all other stakeholders.</p>"
