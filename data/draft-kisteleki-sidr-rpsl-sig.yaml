abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to allow parties to electronically
    sign RPSL-like objects and validate such electronic signatures. This allows relying
    parties to detect accidental or malicious modifications on such objects. It also
    allows parties who run Internet Routing Registries or similar databases, but do
    not yet have RPSS-like authentication of the maintainers of certain objects, to
    verify that the additions or modifications of such database objects are done by
    the legitimate holder(s) of the Internet resources mentioned in those objects.</p>"
