abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a set of mechanisms to establish and maintain MPLS
    Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path that span multiple Autonomous Systems,
    considering the set of requirements for inter-AS Traffic Engineering listed in
    [INTERnter-AS-TE-REQS]. Each mechanism is described along with its applicability
    to the set of requirements.</p>"
