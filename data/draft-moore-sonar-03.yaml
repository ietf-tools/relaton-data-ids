abstract:
- content: "<p>SONAR is a service which, when presented with a list of Internet Protocol
    addresses, attempts to order that list according to the proximity from the SONAR
    server to each address. Given multiple locations for a network accessible resource,
    SONAR is designed to help networked applications make a reasonable choice between
    those alternatives. This memo describes the SONAR protocol as well as an experimental
    implementation of the SONAR service. While the name 'SONAR' is intended as a pun
    on the 'ping' utility that uses ICMP echo requests to verify network connectivity,
    the SONAR service does not specify use of any particular means of estimating network
    proximity. To the contrary, the design of SONAR assumes that the best means of
    estimating network proximity will change over time and perhaps from one network
    location to another. The SONAR protocol is intended to provide a stable interface
    for applications that need to measure network proximity, thus allowing proximity
    measurement algorithms to evolve separately from those applications.</p>"
