abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the general problem of network stratum query
    for application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability to query the
    network from an application controller such as those used in Data Centers so that
    application controller decisions such as server assignment or virtual machine
    instantiation/migration could be performed with better knowledge of the underlying
    network conditions. As application servers are distributed geographically across
    Data Centers, many application-related decisions such as which server to assign
    a new client or where to instantiate/migrate virtual machines will suffer from
    sub-optimality unless the underlying network conditions are factored in the decision
    process. The lack of network awareness may result in not meeting the end-user
    service objective for some key applications like video gaming/conferencing that
    require stringent latency and bandwidth requirement.</p>"
