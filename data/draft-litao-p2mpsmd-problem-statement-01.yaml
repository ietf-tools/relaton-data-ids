abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, more and more Internet streaming services are getting increasingly
    popular among users. Recent large-scale deployed delay- and loss-sensitive services,
    such as IPTV, impose stringent requirements to the streaming media delivery. Streaming
    media service providers and operators have been struggling to make the QoE of
    the subscribers at a satisfactory level. However, most of the existing P2MP streaming
    media delivery technologies, such as IP multicast, are far from ideal in the aspects
    of scalability, reliability and stability. This document presents the problem
    statements in point to multipoint streaming media delivery, explains why network
    awareness and policy-based routing control should be urgently addressed for the
    point to multipoint streaming media delivery mechanism and introduces what should
    be further considered in the future.</p>"
