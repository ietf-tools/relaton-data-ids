abstract:
- content: "<p>The text/plain media type is defined to represent plain text where
    the CRLF sequence represents a line break [MIME-IMT]. Many modern computer systems
    have a different concept of ``plain text'' from the systems where the text/plain
    media type originated. These modern systems usually use a proportional-spaced
    font and use CRLF to represent paragraph breaks. Numerous software products have
    erroneously labelled this media type as text/plain. In order to correct this interoperability
    problem, the text/paragraph media type is defined. [NOTE: This proposal may be
    discussed publicly on the ietf- 822@imc.org mailing list. The subscription address
    is ietf-822- request@imc.org.]</p>"
