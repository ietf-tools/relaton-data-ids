abstract:
- content: "<p>PIM Sparse-Mode uses a Rendezvous Point (RP) and shared trees to forward
    multicast packets to Last Hop Routers (LHR). After the first packet is received
    by the LHR, the source of the multicast stream is learned and the Shortest Path
    Tree (SPT) can be joined. This draft proposes a solution to support PIM Sparse
    Mode (SM) without the need for PIM registers, RPs or shared trees. Multicast source
    information is flooded throughout the multicast domain using a new generic PIM
    flooding mechanism. This mechanism is defined in this document, and is modeled
    after the PIM Bootstrap Router protocol. By removing the need for RPs and shared
    trees, the PIM-SM procedures are simplified, improving router operations, management
    and making the protocol more robust.</p>"
