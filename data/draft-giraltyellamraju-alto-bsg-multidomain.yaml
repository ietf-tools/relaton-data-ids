abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic
    Optimization(ALTO) protocol to support the computation of bottleneck structure
    graphs [I-D.draft-giraltyellamraju-alto-bsg-requirements] under partial information.
    A primary application corresponds to the case of multi- domain networks, whereby
    each network domain is administered separately and lacks information about the
    other domains. A proposed border protocol is introduced that ensures each domain's
    independent convergence to the correct bottleneck substructure graph without the
    need to know private flow and topology information from other domains. Initial
    discussions are presented on the necessary requirements to integrate the proposed
    capability into the ALTO standard.</p>"
