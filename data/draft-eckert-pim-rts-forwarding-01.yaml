abstract:
- content: '<p>BIER provides stateless multicast in BIER domains using bitstrings
    to indicate receivers. BIER-TE extends BIER with tree engineering capabilities.
    Both suffer from scalability problems in large networks as bitstrings are of limited
    size so the BIER domains need to be subdivided using set identifiers so that possibly
    many packets need to be sent to reach all receivers of a multicast group within
    a subdomain. This problem can be mitigated by encoding explicit multicast trees
    in packet headers with bitstrings that have only node-local significance. A drawback
    of this method is that any hop on the path needs to be encoded so that long paths
    consume lots of header space. This document presents the idea of Segment Routed
    Recursive Tree Structures (RTS), a unifying approach in which a packet header
    representing a multicast distribution tree is constructed from a tree structure
    of vertices ("so called Recursive Units") that support replication to their next-hop
    neighbors either via local bitstrings or via sequence of next-hop neighbor identifiers
    called SIDs. RTS, like RBS is intended to expand the applicability of deployment
    for stateless multicast replication beyond what BIER and BIER-TE support and expect:
    larger networks, less operational complexity, and utilization of more modern forwarding
    planes as those expected to be possible when BIER was designed (ca. 2010). This
    document only specifies the forwarding plane but discusses possible architectural
    options, which are primarily determined through the future definition/mapping
    to encapsulation headers and controller-plane functions.</p>'
