abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet is becoming an increasingly commercial arena in which
    information is being bought and sold and payments are rendered for services and
    data delivered within the Internet and for goods and services to be delivered
    outside of the Internet. Thus far, the protocols and format used for such payments
    have been ad hoc and proprietary. This draft proposes a uniform application level
    syntax to support commerce in applications level data and services Proposed specifications
    are given for how this syntax fits into and enables commerce in the data and services
    rendered by the World Wide Web, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, and DNS protocols.</p>"
