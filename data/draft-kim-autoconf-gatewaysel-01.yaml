abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a rapidly configurable multi-hop
    wireless network without an infrastructure and originally proposed for the military
    use. In order to make the MANET a more commonly used network in our daily lives,
    it may be necessary to connect the MANET to the global Internet. A MANET node
    can communicate with an Internet node via the Internet gateway. To support fault
    tolerance and increase the bandwidth, multiple Internet gateways can be deployed
    within a MANET and, in this case, the network performance can be improved by balancing
    the load among Internet gateways. In this draft, we propose load-balancing Internet
    gateway selection mechanisms for the MANET with multiple stationary Internet gateways.
    In addition to this, we propose a scheme that reduces the routing control message
    overhead in the MANET when a MANET node sets up the route to Internet gateway
    using global address.</p>"
