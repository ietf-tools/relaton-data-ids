abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines the Prague congestion control scheme, which
    is derived from DCTCP and adapted for Internet traffic by implementing the Prague
    L4S requirements. Over paths with L4S support at the bottleneck, it adapts the
    DCTCP mechanisms to achieve consistently low latency and full throughput. It is
    defined independently of any particular transport protocol or operating system,
    but notes are added that highlight issues specific to certain transports and OSs.
    It is mainly based on experience with the reference Linux implementation of TCP
    Prague and the Apple implementation over QUIC, but it includes experience from
    other implementations where available. The implementation does not satisfy all
    the Prague requirements (yet) and the IETF might decide that certain requirements
    need to be relaxed as an outcome of the process of trying to satisfy them all.
    Future plans that have typically only been implemented as proof-of- concept code
    are outlined in a separate section.</p>"
