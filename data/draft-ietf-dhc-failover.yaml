abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP [RFC 2131] allows for multiple servers to be operating on a single
    network. Some sites are interested in running multiple servers in such a way so
    as to provide redundancy in case of server failure. In order for this to work
    reliably, the cooperating primary and secondary servers must maintain a consistent
    database of the lease information. This implies that servers will need to coordinate
    any and all lease activity so that this information is synchronized in case of
    failover. This document defines a protocol to provide such synchronization between
    two servers. One server is designated the 'primary' server, the other is the 'secondary'
    server. This document also describes a way to integrate the failover protocol
    with the DHCP load balancing approach.</p>"
