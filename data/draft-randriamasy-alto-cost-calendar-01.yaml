abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning network related information
    in order to allow applications to make informed decisions. The present draft proposes
    to extend the cost information provided by the ALTO protocol. The purpose is to
    broaden the decision possibilities of applications to not only decide 'where'
    to connect to, but also 'when'. This is useful to applications that have a degree
    of freedom on when to schedule data transfers, such as non- instantaneous data
    replication between data centers or service provisioning to end systems with irregular
    connectivity. ALTO guidance to schedule application traffic can also efficiently
    help for load balancing and resources efficiency. The draft specifies a new Cost
    Mode, "Calendar" Mode, that is applicable to time-sensitive ALTO metrics and allows
    Applications to carefully schedule their connections or data transfers. In the
    Calendar Mode, an ALTO Server exposes ALTO Cost Values in JSON arrays where each
    value corresponds to a given time interval. The time intervals as well as other
    Calendar attributes are specified in the IRD. Besides the functional time-shift
    enhancement the ALTO Cost Calendar also allows to schedule the ALTO requests themselves
    and thus save a number of ALTO transactions.</p>
