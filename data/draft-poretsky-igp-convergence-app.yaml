- content: "<p>This draft describes the applicability of IGP Route Convergence benchmarking
    methodology [1] and IGP Route Convergence bechmarking terminology [2]. The methodology
    and terminology is to be used for benchmarking route convergence and can be applied
    to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4]. The data plane is measured
    to obtain the convergence benchmarking metrics described in [1].</p>"
