abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related to
    migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual
    Network Elements (VNEs). VM migration scheme across IP subnets is needed to implement
    virtual computing resources sharing across multiple network administrative domains.
    For the seamless online migration in various scenarios, many problems are needed
    to be resolved on the control plane. The VM migration process should be adapted
    to these aspects. We also describe the limitations of various types of virtual
    local area networking (VLAN) and virtual private networking (VPN) techniques that
    are traditionally expected to support such migration, mobility, and interconnections.</p>"
