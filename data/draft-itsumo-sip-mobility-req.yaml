abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception in communication
    services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as the signaling protocol for
    multimedia applications on the Internet. Thus, it is essential to develop a mobility
    management scheme that utilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well
    as other protocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently. Without
    providing any specific solution, this document presents preliminary requirements
    and identifies the issues that need to be resolved in order to develop a mobility
    management scheme for supporting multimedia applications in a SIP signaling and
    control environment.</p>"
