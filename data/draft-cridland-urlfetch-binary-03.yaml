abstract:
- content: "<p>The URLFETCH command defined as part of URLAUTH provides a mechanism
    for third parties to gain access to data held within messages in a user's private
    store; however, this data is sent verbatim, which is not suitable for a number
    of applications. This memo specifies a method for obtaining data in forms suitable
    for non-mail applications. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
