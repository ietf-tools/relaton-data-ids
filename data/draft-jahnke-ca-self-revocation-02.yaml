abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a cryptographically secure mechanism for Root
    Certificate Authorities to perform emergency self-termination upon compromise
    detection. Current PKI architecture creates a mathematical impossibility: Root
    CAs cannot be cryptographically revoked because revocation requires validation
    from a higher authority, but Root CAs are self-signed with no higher authority.
    This specification addresses this architectural limitation through game-theoretic
    analysis where attacker key usage patterns result in compromise detection and
    bounded attack duration. The mechanism enables Root CA operators to terminate
    CA validity within hours instead of months while maintaining strict dual-person
    control. Analysis of historical incidents shows average response times of 180-540
    days. This protocol reduces maximum exposure time to 8-72 hours through cryptographic
    self-termination, providing 74-85% reduction in attack exposure duration based
    on empirical analysis.</p>"
