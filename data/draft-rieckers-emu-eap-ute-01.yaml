abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple
    authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-UTE authentication method
    for a User-assisted Trust Establishment between the peer and the server. The EAP
    method is intended for bootstrapping Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices without
    preconfigured authentication credentials. The trust establishment is achieved
    by transmitting a one-directional out-of-band (OOB) message between the peer and
    the server to authenticate the in-band exchange. The peer must have a secondary
    input or output interface, such as a display, camera, microphone, speaker, blinking
    light, or light sensor, so that dynamically generated messages with tens of bytes
    in length can be transmitted or received.</p>"
