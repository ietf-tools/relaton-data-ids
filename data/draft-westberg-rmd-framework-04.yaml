abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents the work on the framework for the Resource Management
    in Diffserv (RMD) designed for edge-to-edge resource reservation in a Differentiated
    Services (Diffserv) domain. The RMD extends the Diffserv architecture with new
    resource reservation concepts and features. Moreover, this framework enhances
    the Load Control protocol described in [WeTu00]. The RMD framework defines two
    architectural concepts: - the Per Hop Reservation (PHR) - the Per Domain Reservation
    (PDR) The PHR protocol is used within a Diffserv domain on a per-hop basis to
    augment the Diffserv Per Hop Behavior (PHB) with resource reservation. It is implemented
    in all nodes in a Diffserv domain. On the other hand, the PDR protocol manages
    the resource reservation per Diffserv domain, relying on the PHR resource reservation
    status in all nodes. The PDR is only implemented at the boundary of the domain
    (at the edge nodes). The RMD framework presented in this draft describes the new
    reservation concepts and features. Furthermore it describes the: - relationship
    between the PHR and PHB - interaction between the PDR and PHR - interoperability
    between the PDR and external resource reservation schemes This framework is an
    open framework in the sense that it provides the basis for interoperability with
    other resource reservation schemes and can be applied in different types of networks
    as long as they are Diffserv domains. It aims at extreme simplicity and low cost
    of implementation along with good scaling properties.</p>"
