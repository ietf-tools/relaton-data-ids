abstract:
- content: "<p>[6PE] specifies a mechanism to interconnect IPv6 islands over an MPLS-enabled
    IPv4 cloud using the IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE) approach. The present document
    reports the results of an implementation survey for this mechanism. After a brief
    summary of the results, each survey response is listed. The document contains
    responses from the five implementers that completed the survey (Cisco Systems,
    Juniper Networks, Ixia, Agilent, Spirent). The document also reports some basic
    interoperability testing of 6PE implementations carried out by ISOCORE. No ambiguities
    or errors in the [6PE] specification which could compromise interoperability have
    been reported.</p>"
