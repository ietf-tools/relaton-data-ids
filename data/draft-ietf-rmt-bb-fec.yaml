abstract:
- content: <p>This document generally describes how to use Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for data transport.
    The primary focus of this document is the application of FEC codes to one-to-many
    reliable data transport using IP multicast. This document describes what information
    is needed to identify a specific FEC code, what information needs to be communicated
    out-of-band to use the FEC code, and what information is needed in data packets
    to identify the encoding symbols they carry. The procedures for specifying FEC
    codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
    are also described. This document should be read in conjunction with and uses
    the terminology of the companion document titled, "The Use of Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) in Reliable Multicast". This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the
    Internet community.</p>
