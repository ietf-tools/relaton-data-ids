abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a set of best practices for facilitating interactions
    between automated software agents (AI agents) using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP). As agentic systems proliferate, they frequently utilize HTTP in ad-hoc
    ways, leading to interoperability challenges and the rise of proprietary, "walled
    garden" ecosystems. This document proposes a minimalist, standardized framework
    based on existing HTTP semantics to promote a more cohesive, efficient, and open
    ecosystem. The primary recommendations codify the principles of the Agentic Hypercall
    Protocol (AHP), including tool invocation via GET requests, a stateless authentication
    scheme, and the formalization of the 402 (Payment Required) status code to enable
    a native economic layer for the machine economy.</p>
