abstract:
- content: "<p>A virtual presence client needs information to display people who meet.
    It needs a name, an image, maybe an animated avatar, and more. This document describes
    the storage and exchange of public user identity data. The virtual presence identity
    data format is optimized for VP applications, where many people need the public
    data of their peers, some only once, some repeatedly, where changes happen frequently
    and must be propagated quickly with minimum bandwidth.</p>"
