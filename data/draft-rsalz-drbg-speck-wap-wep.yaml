abstract:
- content: <p>Cryptography is becoming more important to the IETF and its protocols,
    and more IETF protocols are using, or looking at, cryptography to increase privacy
    on the Internet [RFC7258]. This document specifies a proposed best practice for
    any mechanism (or data format) that uses cryptography; namely, that RFCs cannot
    specify an algorithm as mandatory-to-implement (MTI) unless that algorithm has
    had reasonable public review. This document also "sketches out" a rough definition
    around what such a review would look like.</p>
