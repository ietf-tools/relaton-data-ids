abstract:
- content: "<p>CELT is an open-source voice codec suitable for use in very low delay
    audio communication applications, including Voice over IP (VoIP). This document
    describes the payload format for CELT generated bit streams within an RTP packet.
    Also included here are the necessary details for the use of CELT with the Session
    Description Protocol (SDP). At the time of this writing, the CELT bit-stream has
    NOT been finalized yet, and compatibility is usually broken with every new release
    of the codec.</p>"
