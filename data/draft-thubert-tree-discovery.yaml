abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a simple distance vector protocol that exposes
    only a default route towards the infrastructure in a nested NEMO configuration.
    The draft extends the Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC4861] in order to carry
    information and metrics which will help a Mobile Router select its Attachment
    Router(s) in an autonomous fashion and provides generic rules which guarantee
    that the interaction of different selection processes will not create loops.</p>"
