abstract:
- content: "<p>Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many challenges,
    one of which is the scalability challenge; in particular, content routers may
    not have sufficiently large FIB to store a large portion of name prefixes, even
    if the latter are aggressively aggregated. In many ICN designs routers have to
    rely on inefficient mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in content-centric networks)
    in order to route requests. In this draft, we describe a hybrid, reactive routing
    approach, where we augment the information-centric network design with an Infrastructure
    Information Base (IIB) to reap the benefits of both name-based and infrastructure-based
    routing. Simulation-based evaluations demonstrate that this scheme can significantly
    improve the network scalability by cutting down the number of broadcast packets
    while maintaining the same level of the user-perceived latency.</p>"
