abstract:
- content: "<p>The Diameter protocol has specified and relies on the use of per-user
    sessions, which are established between a Diameter client and server during a
    user's authentication and authorization procedure. This document proposes an extension
    to the Diameter session concept to establish a general purpose Diameter session
    for signaling the context of multiple users, such as for group handling or application
    state restoration.</p>"
