abstract:
- content: "<p>The structure that LSP was handled as 1-hop became necessary. It came
    from the requirement of LSP topology management in the MPLS network. As for VPN
    services using LSP, VPN customers may be confused by receiving ICMP packet, e.g.,
    traceroute includes the routers in the MPLS backbone un-belonging to the user's
    VPN topology view, from non VPN topology.</p>"
