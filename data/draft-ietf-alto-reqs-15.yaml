abstract:
- content: "<p>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as pieces
    of information or server processes that are available in several equivalent replicas
    on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing
    applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to
    provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from
    a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource. This guidance shall
    be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission
    between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate goal is to improve
    performance or Quality of Experience in the application while reducing the utilization
    of the underlying network infrastructure. This document enumerates requirements
    for specifying, assessing, or comparing protocols and implementations.</p>"
