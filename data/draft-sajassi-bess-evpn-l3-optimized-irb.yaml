abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet VPN Integrated Routing and Bridging (EVPN-IRB) provides dynamic
    and efficient intra and inter-subnet connectivity among Tenant Systems and end
    devices while maintaining very flexible multihoming capabilities. This document
    describes how EVPN-IRB can be optimized for IP hosts and devices such that PE
    devices only maintain MAC addresses for locally-connected IP hosts,thus improving
    MAC scalability of customer bridges and PE devices significantly. This document
    describes how such optimization is acheived while still supporting host moblity
    which is one of the fundamental features in EVPN and EVPN-IRB. With such optimization
    PE devices perform routing for both intra and inter-subnet traffic which results
    in some some caveats that operators and service providers need to be fully aware
    of.</p>"
