abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the Endpoint ID (EID) concept into an EID Pattern,
    which is used to categorize any EID as matching a specific pattern or not. EID
    Patterns are suitable for expressing agent configuration, for being used on-the-wire
    by DTN protocols, and for being easily understandable by a layperson. EID Patterns
    include scheme-specific optimizations for expressing set membership and each scheme
    pattern includes text and CBOR encoding forms; the pattern for the "ipn" EID scheme
    being designed to be highly compressible in its CBOR form. This document also
    defines a Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Other Name form to contain
    an EID Pattern and a handling rule to use a pattern to match an EID.</p>
