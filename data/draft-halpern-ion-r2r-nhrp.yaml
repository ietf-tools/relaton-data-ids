abstract:
- content: "<p>The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [1] specifies a mechanism
    that allows a source station (e.g., a host or a router) on an NBMA subnetwork
    to find the NBMA subnetwork address address of a destination station when the
    destination station is connected to the NBMA subnetwork. For the case where the
    destination station is off the NBMA subnetwork the mechanism described in [1]
    allows to determine the NBMA subnetwork address of an egress router from the NBMA
    subnetwork that is ``nearest'' to the destination station. If used to locate an
    egress router wherein the destination station is directly behind the egress router,
    the currently document NHRP behaviors are sufficient. However, as documented elsewhere
    [2], there are cases where if used between routers for generalized transit, NHRP
    can produce loops. This document describes extensions to the NBMA Next Hop Resolution
    Protocol (NHRP) [1] that allow to acquire and maintain the information about the
    egress router without constraining the destination(s) to be directly connected
    to the egress router.</p>"
