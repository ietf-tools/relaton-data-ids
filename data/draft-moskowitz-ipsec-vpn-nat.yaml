abstract:
- content: "<p>This document looks at a number of issues surrounding the need for
    network address translation (NAT) when IPsec is used to create virtual private
    networks (NAT). This document only looks at simple VPNs. That is VPNs consisting
    of a single IPsec tunnel as compared to VPNs consisting of chained and/or nested
    IPsec tunnels and/or transports.</p>"
