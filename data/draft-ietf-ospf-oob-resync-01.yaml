abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks.
    LSDB synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods-- initial LSDB synchronization
    when an OSPF router has just been connected to the network and asynchronous flooding
    that ensures continuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changes
    after the initial procedure was completed. It may sometime be necessary for OSPF
    routers to resynchronize their LSDBs. OSPF standard, however, does not allow routers
    to do so without actually changing the topology view of the network. This memo
    describes a mechanism to perform such form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization.</p>"
