abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts
    to record the status of known implementations by including an Implementation Status
    section. This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration
    to documents that have the benefit of running code, by considering the running
    code as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that has made the implemented
    protocols more mature. The process in this document is offered as an experiment.
    Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for their
    documents, and working groups are invited to think about applying the process
    to all of their protocol specifications. The authors of this document intend to
    collate experiences with this experiment and to report them to the community.</p>"
