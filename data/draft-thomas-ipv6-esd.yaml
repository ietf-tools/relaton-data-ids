abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a proposal to split unicast IPv6 addresses into two 8 byte
    quantities. The first 8 bytes will contain routing information which is used to
    reach a subnetwork. The last 8 bytes will contain a identifier of a node on that
    subnet. This identifier is globally unique and is called an End System Designator
    (ESD). The ESD (not the entire 16 byte address) will be used to accept packets
    and identify connections, among other things.</p>"
