    the Internet around the world. Internationalized domain name system has been introduced
    to meet the demand. However, due to many technical and policy issues, IDN may
    provide malicious rogues the opportunities to mislead users to unintended third
    party website, thus cause security issues and threat the stabilization of the
    Internet. CDNC recognize the complexity of the issue and make advises to avoid
    the threat. To simplify the issue, CDNC suggest internationalize the ccTLD before
    any moves on gTLD. Also, the approval on internationalize a ccTLD should based
    on the readiness of the respective registry and the support from the respective
    government. The following document fully demonstrated the principles and procedure
    to internationalize ccTLD that recommended by CDNC.</p>"
