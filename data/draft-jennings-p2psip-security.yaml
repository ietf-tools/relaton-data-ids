abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an overview of some security mechanisms for
    P2P SIP. Specifically it discusses mechanisms that can be used to secure the stored
    data and the routing in the distributed storage. This draft is an very early draft
    to outline the possible solution space and far more details would be needed. This
    work is being discussed on the p2psip@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
