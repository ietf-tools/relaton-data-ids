abstract:
- content: <p>Adoption of cloud and fog technology allows operators to deploy a single
    "Service Function" (SF) to multiple "execution locations". The decision to steer
    traffic to a specific location may change frequently based on load, proximity,
    etc. Under the current Service Function Chaining (SFC) framework, steering traffic
    dynamically to the different execution endpoints requires a specific "rechaining",
    i.e., a change in the service function path reflecting the different IP endpoints
    to be used for the new execution points. This procedure may be complex and take
    time. In order to simplify rechaining and reduce the time to complete the procedure,
    we discuss separating the logical Service Function Path (SFP) from the specific
    execution endpoints. This can be done by identifying the SFs using a name rather
    than a routable IP endpoint (or Layer 2 address). This document describes the
    necessary extensions, additional functions, and protocol details in the Service
    Function Forwarder (SFF) to handle name-based relationships. This document presents
    InterDigital's approach to name-based SFC. It does not represent IETF consensus
    and is presented here so that the SFC community may benefit from considering this
    mechanism and the possibility of its use in the edge data centers.</p>
