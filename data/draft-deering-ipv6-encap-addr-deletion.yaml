abstract:
- content: "<p>In some potentially common uses of IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation ('tunneling'),
    a node that is performing an encapsulation or decapsulation will also be the source
    or destination of the packet being encapsulated. That can result in the same IPv6
    address appearing in both the outer (encapsulating) and inner (encapsulated) IPv6
    headers. This document specifies a method for deleting such redundant addresses
    from an inner header when performing an encapsulation, and restoring those addresses
    when decapsulating, resulting in a 16-octet (128-bit) reduction in header overhead,
    per address deleted.</p>"
