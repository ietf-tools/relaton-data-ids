abstract:
- content: "<p>We define an `explicit route' as a route which is explicitly specified
    as a sequence of hops rather than being determined solely by conventional routing
    algorithms on a hop by hop basis. Using the explicit route object proposed for
    use in RSVP [1] and the ability to bind MPLS labels to RSVP flows [2] we describe
    how explicit routes may be set up in an MPLS environment. The resulting label
    switched paths may have associated resource reservations, or may be purely best
    effort.</p>"
