abstract:
- content: <p>The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scheme "CRID:" has been devised to
    allow references to current or future scheduled publications of broadcast media
    content over television distribution platforms and the Internet. The initial intended
    application is as an embedded link within scheduled programme description metadata
    that can be used by the home user or agent to associate a programme selection
    with the corresponding programme location information for subsequent automatic
    acquisition. This document reproduces the \%TV-Anytime CRID definition found in
    the \%TV-Anytime content referencing specification, and is published as an RFC
    for ease of access and registration with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
    (IANA). This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
