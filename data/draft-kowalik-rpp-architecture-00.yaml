abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), standardized in 2009, has
    served the domain name industry well for domain name management. However, advancements
    in development, integration, and operational paradigms have led to a desire for
    a provisioning protocol leveraging the REST architectural style and JSON data-interchange
    format. This document defines the architecture for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol
    (RPP), aiming to standardize a REST-based protocol for provisioning services,
    initially focused on domain name, host, and contact management, while allowing
    for future extensibility. RPP is intended to co-exist with EPP, offering a modern
    alternative benefiting from the REST architectural style and widely adopted technologies.
    RPP aims for data model compatibility with EPP core objects.</p>"
