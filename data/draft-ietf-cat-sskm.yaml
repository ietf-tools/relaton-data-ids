abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a method for using [SPKM] with exclusively shared
    secret key technologies. The messages and tokens of [SPKM] are unchanged; the
    only modifications required are to replace the default public-key cipher suite
    with ciphers and algorithms suitable for use with shared secret keys. All messages
    and tokens defined in [SPKM] are preserved; no changes are required to the various
    authentication modes of [SPKM]. Integrity algorithms and key establishment algorithms
    suitable for use with secret keys are added to those specified in [SPKM], which
    are well known and specified for use in other existing IETF standards. We in effect
    implement the implicit authenticated key exchange protocol proposed in [BR94]
    using the messages and tokens defined in [SPKM]. An overview and brief discussion
    of the protocol appears in section 1. The specific algorithms and object identifiers
    are listed in section 2. Discussion of how [SPKM] messages are used with shared
    secret keys appears in section 3. Security concerns are addressed in section 4.
    Patent issues are covered in section 5.</p>"
