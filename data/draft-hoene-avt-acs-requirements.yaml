abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements of an audio communication
    system (ACS) for acoustic content, especially speech and music. The ACS consists
    of all components above the IP layer and below a digital PCM audio interface.
    These include codec, jitter buffer, and transport. The goal of the ACS is to provide
    a bidirectional acoustic communication between any two Internet hosts at a good
    quality, constrained only by the available resources at the hosts and the characteristics
    of the transmission path between both hosts. The intention of the document is
    to provide the requirements for a codec that is solely intended for the Internet,
    to provide the requirements for the codec's payload specification, and to define
    the requirements on the transport protocol.</p>"
