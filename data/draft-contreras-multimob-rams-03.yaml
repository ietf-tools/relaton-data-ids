abstract:
- content: "<p>A new proposal is presented for speeding up the acquisition by the
    MAG of the MN's active multicast subscription information, in order to accelerate
    the multicast delivery to the MN after a handover. To do that, an extension to
    the current PMIPv6 protocol is proposed. The solution described in this memo is
    not only applicable to the base solution for multicast support in PMIPv6, but
    also it can be applied to other solutions envisioned as possible architectural
    evolutions of it. Furthermore, it is also independent of the role played by the
    MAG within the multicast network (either acting as MLD proxy or multicast router).</p>"
