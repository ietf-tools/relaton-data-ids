abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to allow the subordinate MANET to be connected to the external
    network, the MANET border router (MBR) has been defined. For providing scalability
    and reliability to the subordinate MANET, multiple MBRs may be deployed. One of
    the issues on the subordinate MANET with multiple MBRs is which network prefixes
    are to be advertised by MBRs. In the case when MBRs advertise different network
    prefixes, if a MANET node changes its default MBR to a new one, the node may have
    to transmit packets via non-optimal paths to keep using the existing connection
    to the previous MBR, or change its address by using the network prefix information
    from the new MBR. In the former case, the MANET node may not communicate with
    the MBR due to MANET partitioning. In the latter case, on-going sessions can be
    terminated because of the address change. In this draft, we define a PMIPv6 based
    address autoconfiguration mechanism that enables MANET nodes to operate properly
    when all MBRs advertise the same network prefix in the subordinate MANET.</p>"
