abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a more efficient variant of a Key Encapsulation
    Mechanism (KEM)-based authentication method for the Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over
    COSE (EDHOC) lightweight protocol, designed for the specific scenario in which
    the Initiator has prior knowledge of the Responderâ€™s credentials, a case commonly
    found in constrained environments. Improving upon the approach described in KEM-based
    Authentication for EDHOC, this method uses only a mandatory three-message handshake
    to enable signature-free post-quantum authentication when PQC KEMs, such as the
    NIST-standardized ML-KEM, are employed, while still providing mutual authentication,
    forward secrecy, and a degree of identity protection.</p>"
