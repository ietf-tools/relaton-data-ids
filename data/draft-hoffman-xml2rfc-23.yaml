abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines the "XML2RFC" version 3 vocabulary; an XML- based
    language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts. It is heavily derived from
    the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion. This document obsoletes
    the v2 grammar described in RFC 2629 and its expected followup, draft-iab-xml2rfc.
