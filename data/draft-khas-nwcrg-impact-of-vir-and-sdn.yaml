abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Coding is a technique used to code packets and be able to recover
    coded packets from loses. It requires at least two participating nodes in the
    path of the packet, one to encode and another to decode. This document discusses
    the impact of virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) on the emerging
    network coding. This document also discusses the integration of network coding
    in various layers of the network stack and the APIs required from the network
    coding entity to program it from a controller.</p>"
