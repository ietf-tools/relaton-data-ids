abstract:
- content: "<p>The document suggests various optimizations for presence that uses
    the SIP/SIMPLE protocol. The suggestions are based on a separate document that
    contains scaling analysis and requirements. The current document reviews only
    suggestions that are not yet part of the work of the various SIP working groups
    while approved and in-work optimizations are reviewed in the scaling document.
    The intention here is to keep these suggestions at this document as a place holder
    until a set of requirements will be discussed and accepted and the work on optimizations
    will commence.</p>"
