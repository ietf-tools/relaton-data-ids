abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an XML format for a buddy list, which represents
    a list of other users a particular user would like to subscribe to. When a presence
    client starts up, it needs to initiate subscriptions to the users on the buddy
    list. By keeping this list in a standard XML format, the list can be stored locally,
    or retrieved remotely using HTTP or any other transfer protocol. The great advantage
    of storing it remotely is that a user can move from machine to machine, fetch
    their buddy list from a home server, and then subscribe to those users. This provides
    personal mobility for presence services.</p>"
