abstract:
- content: "<p>For network scenarios such as Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs),
    BGP is extended for Link-State (LS) distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF)
    algorithm based calculation. BGP-LS SPF leverages the mechanisms of both BGP protocol
    and BGP-LS protocol extensions. Segment Routing (SR) provides a source routing
    mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path,
    while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain.
    In some networks, it may be useful to enable SR based source routing mechanism
    together with BGP-LS SPF. This document proposes to introduce the BGP Link-State
    (BGP-LS) extensions for segment routing to the BGP-LS SPF SAFI.</p>"
