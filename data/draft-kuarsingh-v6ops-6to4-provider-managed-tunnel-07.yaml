abstract:
- content: "<p>6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework that can
    help manage 6to4 tunnels operating in an anycast configuration. The 6to4-PMT framework
    is intended to serve as an option for operators to help improve the experience
    of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal performance
    or break normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT supplies a stable provider prefix and
    forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 relays with an added function
    of IPv6 Prefix Translation. This operation may be particularly important in NAT444
    infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non-RFC1918 address,
    thus breaking the return path for anycast-based 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT has been
    successfully used in a production network, implemented as open source code, and
    implemented by a major routing vendor. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
