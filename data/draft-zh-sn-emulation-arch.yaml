abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an emulation architecture which provides a
    realistic, flexible, and extensible experimental environment for the space network
    (SN). The architecture includes four components, namely logical plane, control
    plane, data plane and measurement plane. Software-defined networking (SDN), virtualization
    technology, and traffic control mechanism are adopted to realize the real space
    environment and arbitrary topology. Furthermore, an extensible structure is described
    to emulate large-scale scenarios and access external emulation resources.</p>"
