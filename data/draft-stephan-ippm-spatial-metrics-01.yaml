abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized
    metrics for measuring end-to-end performance. This memo defines spatial metrics
    both for measuring end-to-end network performance using aggregation of sequence
    of network measures and for measuring the performance of segments of an IP path
    trajectory. It distinguishes clearly the decomposition of one end-to-end measure
    result in a sequence of per hop results from the aggregation of a sequence of
    per hop measure results in an end-to-end result.</p>"
