abstract:
- content: <p>As the IETF continues to produce and standardize different Operations,
    Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) protocols and technologies, various qualifiers
    and modifiers are prepended to the OAM acronym. While, at first glance, the most
    used appear to be well understood, the same qualifier may be interpreted differently
    in different contexts. A case in point is the qualifiers "in-band" and "out-of-band"
    which have their origins in the radio lexicon and which have been extrapolated
    into other communication networks. This document considers some common qualifiers
    and modifiers that are prepended, within the context of packet networks, to the
    OAM acronym, and lays out guidelines for their use in future IETF work. This document
    updates RFC 6291 by adding to the guidelines for the use of the term "OAM".</p>
