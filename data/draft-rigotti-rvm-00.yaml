abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents extensions to IP that enable the use of source-based
    distribution trees (such as those established by DVMRP[1] or PIM-DM[2]) to deliver
    multicast packets generated by members of a multicast group in the opposite direction
    to packets originated by the source (S). Packets generated by a member M of a
    group G are forwarded (unicast) from an in-tree router to another, towards the
    source S. In addition to send the packet to its upstream, each in-tree router
    injects it into the multicast tree (S,G). This enables packets to reach the rest
    of the receivers, as S would originate them. The 'reversed' use of the distribution
    tree is intended for sending of low volume feedback information produced by receivers
    in applications such as RTP/RTCP[3] and reliable multicast. This feature diminish
    the overhead in routers in case of applications with a source and many receivers
    sending feedback, because only one distribution tree, rooted at the sender S must
    be maintained, in place of one per member. In addition, multicast packets originated
    by receivers,travel through the inverse path of information ones in the distribution
    tree. This can be exploited by multicast transport protocols to localize processes
    to subtrees or to reduce exposure.</p>"
