abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes a method for making one or more Domain Name
    System (DNS) labels behave in the DNS "as if" they were actually an entirely different
    label. E.g., the delegee for the example.org zone could define bar.example.org
    to be a CLONE of foo.example.org. This method is designed to meet the needs of
    those managing Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) zones that have been determined
    to be semantically similar, and therefore should be treated "as if" they were
    identical. This method can also be used more generally to handle situations where
    either CNAME or DNAME Resource Records are currently being used. A key design
    goal for the CLONE method is that all of the semantic benefits are available by
    updating only the authoritative servers for the zone. Domain managers who want
    to support DNSSEC for the CLONEd labels/zones may do so with dynamic signing of
    the CLONEs, or rely on users being behind a CLONE-Aware resolving name server.
    Foreword [RFC Editor, please remove this Section at publication time. Thanks.]
    This is my first draft, please be gentle.:) I''m definitely open to the possibility
    that there are better ways to accomplish the concepts presented herein. I''m sure
    that there are a non-zero number of errors in the formatting, references, etc.
    Also Sections 2 and 3 may be under-specified, unclear, or unworkable. So please
    don''t be afraid to offer (constructive) criticism. TODO: Update/add/improve references?
    Add/improve examples? Revision History:</p>'
