abstract:
- content: "<p>Spurious retransmission timeouts (RTOs) cause suboptimal TCP performance,
    because they often result in unnecessary retransmission of the last window of
    data. This document describes the 'Forward RTO Recovery' (F-RTO) algorithm for
    detecting spurious TCP RTOs. F-RTO is a TCP sender only algorithm that does not
    require any TCP options to operate. After retransmitting the first unacknowledged
    segment triggered by an RTO, the F-RTO algorithm at a TCP sender monitors the
    incoming acknowledgements to determine whether the timeout was spurious and to
    decide whether to send new segments or retransmit unacknowledged segments. The
    algorithm effectively helps to avoid additional unnecessary retransmissions and
    thereby improves TCP performance in case of a spurious timeout.</p>"
