abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an EAP method that is used for extending EAP
    functionality. The extended functionality includes HOKEY re- authentication and
    MSK channel binding. The proposed EAP method (EAP-EXT) also allows sequencing
    of multiple EAP methods within itself. EAP-EXT can generate MSK (Master Session
    Key) and EMSK (Extended Master Session Key) in cases where inner method(s) implementations
    generate MSK but do not generate EMSK.</p>"
