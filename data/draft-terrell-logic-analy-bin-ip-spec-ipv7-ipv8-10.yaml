abstract:
- content: "<p>The Information Age Revolution established by the Internet, as viewed
    through its World Wide Popularity, ushered not only a need for additional IP Addresses,
    which serve the ever growing needs and demands of every individual in the World
    today. Will also be viewed, through the resolution of the IP addressing problem,
    as the impetus fueling the Revolution in the whole of the Mathematical and Engineering
    Sciences as well.</p>"
