abstract:
- content: "<p>In the networks where multihomed hosts can have ULA and GUA addresses
    from different ISPs, multiple SIP signaling and media connectivity issues might
    arise due to inappropriate address selections. Some of the problems are described
    in [RFC5220]. Since SIP and SDP allow IP addresses to be embedded into their headers
    and lines, even if proper addresses are selected initially, SIP is not equipped
    with the mechanisms to respond to network events, and transition transport to
    reachable addresses. As a result, SIP messages and media might be filtered by
    routers, or discarded as unreachable destinations. SIP protocol (RFC 3261) defines
    signaling messages and their headers. This document describes how a multihomed
    host should select addresses for SIP headers, like Contact and Via, to be reachable
    destinations. Host SHOULD change a default router for uplink failures, remove
    prefixes and addresses for unreachable ISP, and update contact address list. SDP
    protocol (RFC 3264) defines how participants in a session select their parameters.
    This document describes how an offerer and answerer on multihomed hosts should
    select their addresses. If one of the selected addresses becomes unreachable,
    the document describes the mechanism how a new one should be selected and renegotiated.</p>"
