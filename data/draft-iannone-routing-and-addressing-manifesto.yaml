abstract:
- content: "<p>Despite the stability of the Internet technology, tremendous advances
    and important innovation are always happening. In particular, routing and addressing
    have profoundly changed during the years, with interesting research still ongoing
    and engineers willing to be hear about recent advance that may solve their operational
    problems. However, researchers and engineers lack a dedicated forum where they
    can meet and interact to discuss about routing and addressing. This document advocates
    the creation of such forum, to bring together these communities (researchers and
    engineers) and offer a dedicated venue.</p>"
