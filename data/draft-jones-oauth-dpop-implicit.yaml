abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes a mechanism for sender-constraining OAuth
    2.0 tokens via a proof-of-possession mechanism on the application level. This
    mechanism allows for the detection of replay attacks with access tokens. This
    specification compliments and builds upon the mechanisms defined in draft-fett-oauth-dpop,
    in which access tokens are returned from the token endpoint. In particular, this
    specification extends the Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession at the Application
    Layer (DPoP) mechanisms to also be usable with the OAuth 2.0 implicit flow, in
    which access tokens are returned from the authorization endpoint.</p>"
