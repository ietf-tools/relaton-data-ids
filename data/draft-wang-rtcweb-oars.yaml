abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture
    called OARS which could simplify the data communication process between two hosts
    that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices.
    The key mechanism in OARS is the newly defined "Couple" message which allows the
    Relay servers to be easily incorporated into existing CGN/CDN nodes which are
    already deployed within the network in a distributed manner. Table of Contents</p>
