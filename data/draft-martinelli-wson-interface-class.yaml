abstract:
- content: "<p>Current work on wavelength switched optical network includes several
    considerations regarding the interface signal compatibility. In particular ingress
    and egress optical interfaces will require a check on several optical parameters
    to assess if the signal generated by the ingress interface can be compatible with
    the receiving interface. Current solution available encode all parameters in WSON
    protocol extensions while in this draft will propose an alternative method to
    keep into account the signal compatibility issue at protocol level.</p>"
