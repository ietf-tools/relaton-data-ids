abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an architectural framework for the application
    of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to the construction of packet-switched
    transport networks. It describes a common set of protocol functions -- the MPLS
    Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) -- that supports the operational models and capabilities
    typical of such networks, including signaled or explicitly provisioned bidirectional
    connection-oriented paths, protection and restoration mechanisms, comprehensive
    Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions, and network operation
    in the absence of a dynamic control plane or IP forwarding support. Some of these
    functions are defined in existing MPLS specifications, while others require extensions
    to existing specifications to meet the requirements of the MPLS-TP. This document
    defines the subset of the MPLS-TP applicable in general and to point-to-point
    transport paths. The remaining subset, applicable specifically to point-to-multipoint
    transport paths, is outside the scope of this document. This document is a product
    of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport
    network as defined by the ITU-T. This document is not an Internet Standards Track
    specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
