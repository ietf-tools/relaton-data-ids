abstract:
- content: "<p>Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale and
    complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage and configure
    the network. Deploying policy or configuration based on an abstract view of the
    underlying network is much better than manipulating each individual network element,
    however, in this case, the policy and configuration cannot be recognized by the
    network elements. This document describes guidelines for mapping said abstract
    configuration and policy into device-level configuration and the way in which
    such models will be processed by software to produce configuration details for
    actual devices. The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) framework overview
    and primary procedures of mapping are described. Moreover, an exemplary mapping
    scenario is provided to illustrate the defined mechanism.</p>"
