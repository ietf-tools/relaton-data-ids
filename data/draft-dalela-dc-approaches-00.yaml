abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many approaches to addressing virtualized datacenter scaling
    problems. Examples of these approaches include, L2 vs. L3 forwarding, host-based
    vs. network-based solutions, fat-access and lean-core vs. fat-core and lean-access,
    flat addressing vs. encapsulation, protocol learning vs. directories for location
    discovery, APIs vs. protocols for orchestration, etc. Different solutions being
    proposed today take one or more of these approaches in combination, although sometimes
    the question of approach itself may not be settled. Given the multiple facets
    of the datacenter problem, and many approaches to solve each problem, it becomes
    hard to discuss a solution when some approaches may be acceptable while others
    are not. This document discusses the pros and cons of various approaches. The
    goal is not to describe a specific solution, but to evaluate the various approaches.
    This document concludes with a set of recommendations on which approaches are
    most optimal for a holistic solution to the entire problem set.</p>"
