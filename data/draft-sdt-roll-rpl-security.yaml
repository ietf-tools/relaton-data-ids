abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a security design for RPL: IPv6 Routing Protocol
    for Low Power and Lossy networks. The effort builds upon previous work on routing
    security and adapts the security assessments to the issues specific to RPL. With
    the threat model, the security objectives and required services are identified.
    These assessments then provide the basis of the security recommendations for incorporation
    into RPL.</p>"
