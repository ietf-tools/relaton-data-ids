abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Lightweight authentication extension for
    the Host Identifier Protocol (LHIP). The goal of LHIP is to reduce the computational
    requirements of the Host Identifier Protocol (HIP), thus, making its benefits,
    such as end-host mobility and multihoming, accessible to CPU-restricted devices.
    LHIP reduces the computational cost of establishing, updating, and closing a HIP
    association by providing an alternative way of signing and verifying HIP control
    packets which is based on computationally inexpensive hash function computations
    and hash chains. However, LHIP does not provide nor does it aim at providing the
    same level of security as HIP does. Especially, host authentication and payload
    encryption are not possible. The LHIP extensions in this draft specify also mechanisms
    for dynamic transitioning between lightweight and full HIP associations on the
    fly.</p>"
