abstract:
- content: "<p>In QUIC working group discussions about proposals to use multiple paths,
    an obvious question came up - given multiple paths, how does QUIC select paths
    to send packets over? The answer to that question may inform decisions in the
    QUIC working group about the scope of any multipath extensions considered for
    experimentation and adoption. This document is intended to summarize aspects of
    path selection from those contributions and conversations. It is recognized that
    path selection is not the only important open question about QUIC Multipath, but
    other open questions are out of scope for this document.</p>"
