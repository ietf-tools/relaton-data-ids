abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides general information (such as parameter sizes,
    security assumptions, and targeted security models) on a range of widely studied
    post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including Key Encapsulation Mechanisms
    (KEMs) and digital signature schemes. The cryptographic schemes described in this
    document are among those recommended by major security agencies and/or standardization
    bodies, and are believed to be secure against Cryptographically Relevant Quantum
    Computer (CRQC). The goal of this document is to offer a high-level overview of
    these schemes and their distinguishing features, to help implementers, protocol
    designers, standards developers, and policymakers in understanding and selecting
    appropriate post-quantum cryptographic primitives for use in protocols and systems.
    By aggregating and presenting this information in a unified format, this document
    aims to facilitate informed decision-making and interoperability during the migration
    to post-quantum cryptography, and to encourage consistent practices when evaluating
    and deploying PQC schemes in cryptographic protocols.</p>"
