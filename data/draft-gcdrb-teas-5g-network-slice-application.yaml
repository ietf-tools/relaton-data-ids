abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Slicing is one of the core features in 5G, which provides different
    network service as independent logical networks. To provide 5G network slices
    service, an end-to-end network slice needs to consists of 3 major types of network
    segments: Radio Access Network (RAN), Mobile Core Network (CN) and Transport Network
    (TN). This document describes the application of IETF network slice in providing
    5G end-to-end network slices, including the network slice identification mapping,
    network slice parameter mapping and 5G IETF Network Slice NBI.</p>"
