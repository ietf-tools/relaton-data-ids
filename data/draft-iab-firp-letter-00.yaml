abstract:
- content: "<p>The Draft Report of the U.S. Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel
    (FIRP) has been posted and comments requested. Individual responses from ISOC/IETF
    members are encouraged. However, it is desirable to have a coordinated response
    from the Internet Society, IAB, and IESG. Note that responses are due by February
    18. This Internet Draft is a draft letter from Vint Cerf, Christian Huitema, and
    Phill Gross and is meant to be that coordinated response.</p>"
