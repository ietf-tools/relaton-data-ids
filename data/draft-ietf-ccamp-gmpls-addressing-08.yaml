abstract:
- content: "<p>This document clarifies the use of addresses in Generalized Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. The aim is to facilitate interworking of GMPLS-capable
    Label Switching Routers (LSRs). The document is based on experience gained in
    implementation, interoperability testing, and deployment. The document describes
    how to interpret address and identifier fields within GMPLS protocols, and how
    to choose which addresses to set in those fields for specific control plane usage
    models. It also discusses how to handle IPv6 sources and destinations in the MPLS
    and GMPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) Management Information Base (MIB) modules.
    This document does not define new procedures or processes. Whenever this document
    makes requirements statements or recommendations, these are taken from normative
    text in the referenced RFCs. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
