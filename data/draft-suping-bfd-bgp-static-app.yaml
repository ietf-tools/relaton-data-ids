abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    protocol with BGP and the static route over IPv4 or IPv6. The main purpose of
    this draft is to solve the BFD bootstrap problem with BGP and static routes. As
    to the encapsulation and demultiplexing issues there have been descriptions in
    BFD single hop draft [BFD-1HOP] and multi-hop draft [BFD-MULI]. With the BFD interaction
    with BGP graceful restart, the rules described in BFD single hop [BFD-1HOP] with
    IS-IS and OSPF graceful restart are also applicable to the BFD with BGP graceful
    restart, and will not iteratein in this draft. Comments on this draft should be
    directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org or to author directly.</p>"
