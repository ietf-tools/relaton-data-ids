abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain
    computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips
    required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations,
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which
    adds several more round trips and consequently latency. To re-establish security
    associations (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming especially
    when an IPsec peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a large number
    of SAs with various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause
    additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment. In order to
    avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would be useful
    to provide an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes
    an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway
    in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA. A client
    can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected. The proposed approach
    encodes partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can be stored on the client
    or in a centralized store, and is later made available to the IKEv2 responder
    for re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer to the opaque data that
    is created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does not specify the format of
    the ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
