abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing with link state protocols in dense network topologies can result
    in sub-optimal convergence times due to the overhead associated with flooding.
    This can be addressed by decreasing the flooding topology so that it is less dense.
    This document discusses extensions to the IS-IS routing protocol to support a
    solution to flooding in dense subgraphs.</p>"
