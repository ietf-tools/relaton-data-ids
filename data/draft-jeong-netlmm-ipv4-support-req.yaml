abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF NetLMM WG is developing standards of network-based mobility
    management in a localized domain. PMIPv6 architecture enables mobile nodes to
    roam without host-side mobility management protocol stack. Current PMIPv6 protocols
    mainly consider IPv6 and dual stack mobile nodes. It also states deployment scenario
    of PMIPv6 in IPv6 infrastructure. However, localized mobility management in IPv4
    network is also problematic. Also, there still exist a lot of IPv4 MNs and these
    IPv4 MNs may visit PMIPv6 domain. This document discusses a few scenarios of IPv4
    support in PMIPv6 domain and describes goals and requirements for IPv4 support
    in PMIPv6.</p>"
