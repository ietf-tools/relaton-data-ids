abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE)
    and Internet Information Services (IIS) incorporated in Microsoft Windows 2000
    use Kerberos for security enhancements of web transactions. The HTTP auth-scheme
    of 'negotiate' is defined here; when the negotiation results in the selection
    of Kerberos, the security services of authentication and optionally impersonation
    are performed. This document explains how HTTP authentication utilizes the SPNEGO
    [7] GSSAPI mechanism. Details of SPNEGO implementation are not provided in this
    document.</p>"
