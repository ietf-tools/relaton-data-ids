abstract:
- content: "<p>AI fabric is sensitive to bandwidth. Congestion management, including
    congestion control and load balancing, is a main method to fully utilize network
    resource. However, current congestion management mechanisms are not coordinated,
    which lead to throughput decreasing. This document provides a scheme to coordinate
    different congestion management mechanisms. It describes the design principle,
    behaviors of network switches and hosts in the scheme, and gives an example to
    show end-to-end procedure.</p>"
