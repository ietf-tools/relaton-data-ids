abstract:
- content: "<p>To ease the maintenance of BGP-4 sessions and limit the amount of traffic
    that is lost during planned maintenance on routers, a specific mechanism is proposed
    in order to gracefully shutdown a router or a session. It's proposed that a router
    first withdraw its route to its peer to initiate their convergence. After a timer
    the router can proceed with the closing of the BGP sessions and consequently remove
    its peers'routes from it's RIB (Routing Information Base).</p>"
