abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational memo contains a description of some measurements
    from early DiffServ (DS) experiments that used a preliminary version of IBM's
    DiffServ implementation on an IBM router over an egress T1/E1 PPP interface. The
    service level specification (SLS) may be configured on the router or optionally
    controlled by an LDAP-accessible policy repository. The measurements were intended
    to examine the behavior of a mixture of Expedited Forwarding (EF) traffic, Assured
    Forwarding (AF) traffic and Best Effort (BE) traffic on a congested E1 link. The
    router code includes an LDAP client that communicates with a policy server to
    obtain the policies that control the amount of resources configured for the DiffServ
    classes. The diagrams referred to in this memo are available in the postscript
    version of this memo. Changes from -00 version Added the details of the buffering
    setup, a discussion of an anomaly in the AF delay results, added an additional
    measurement point related to this anomaly, updated author list, added acknowledgements,
    and miscellaneous editorial comments.</p>"
