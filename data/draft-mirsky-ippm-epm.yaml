abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of the error performance metric to
    characterize a packet-switched network's conformance to the pre- defined set of
    performance objectives. In this document, metrics that characterize error performance
    in a packet-switched network (PSN) are defined, as well as methods to measure
    and calculate them. Also, the requirements for an active Operation, Administration,
    and Maintenance protocol to support the error performance measurement in PSN are
    discussed, and potential candidate protocols are analyzed. All metrics and measurement
    methods are equally applicable to underlay and overlay networks.</p>"
