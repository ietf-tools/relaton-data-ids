abstract:
- content: "<p>An IGP Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algorithm) allows IGPs to compute constraint-based
    paths. IGP Flex-Algorithm can be used with Segment Routing (SR) or IP data plane.
    When used with SR data plane, Flex- Algorithm requires to allocate algorithm specific
    Prefix Segment Identifiers (SIDs) or algorithm specific SRv6 Locators. When used
    with IP data plane, Flex-Algorithm requires to allocate algorithm specfic IPv4
    or IPv6 prefixes. This increases the complexity and overhead of managing, advertising
    and maintaining additional SR SIDs, SRv6 Locators and IPv4 or IPv6 prefixes, which
    may not be affordable to some networks and network devices. This document extends
    IGP Flex-Algorithm to allow the use of common SR SIDs, SRv6 Locators and IP prefixes
    among multiple Flex- Algorithms.</p>"
