abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extension to the CBT protocol to maintain a
    multicast tree with user-specified QoS properties. Specifically, it describes
    enhancements in the member join/leave and state update/refresh procedures to facilitate
    the deployment of additive (e.g., end-to-end delay bound), multiplicative (e.g.,
    packet loss ratio along a path) and concave (e.g., minimum bandwidth available)
    QoS. Eligibility tests are devised to verify whether or not a new member can join
    a multicast tree at adequate QoS, while not violating the QoS received by on-tree
    members. Management of router state is based on a simple state update and refresh
    procedure that can be readily integrated with the tree maintenance mechanism that
    exists in CBT (i.e., echo-requests and echo-replies).</p>"
