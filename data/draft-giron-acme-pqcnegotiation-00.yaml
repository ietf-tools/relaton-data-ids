abstract:
- content: "<p>ACME is a critical protocol for accelerating HTTPS adoption on the
    Internet, automating digital certificate issuing for web servers. Because RFC
    8555 assumes that both sides (client and server) support the primary cryptographic
    algorithms necessary for the certificate, ACME does not include algorithm negotiation
    procedures. However, in light of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), many signature
    algorithm alternatives can be used, allowing for different trade-offs (e.g., signature
    vs. public key size). In addition, alternative PQC migration strategies exist,
    such as KEMTLS, which employs KEM public keys for authentication. This document
    describes an algorithm negotiation mechanism for ACME. The negotiation allows
    different strategies and provides KEMTLS certificate issuing capabilities.</p>"
