    solicitation and neighbour advertisement messages to help DAD proxy to perform
    the function.Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
    "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
    in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
