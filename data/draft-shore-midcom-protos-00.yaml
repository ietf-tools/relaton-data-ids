abstract:
- content: "<p>It is increasingly common for applications to want to influence the
    behavior of equipment in the network, in violation of various tenets underpinning
    the the design of IP. A number of different mechanisms and architectures have
    been proposed, and this very drafty draft is a hoped to be a start at discussing
    some of the issues related to protocols used for middlebox communication.</p>"
