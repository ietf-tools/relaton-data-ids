abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the eap.arpa domain as a way for EAP peers to
    signal to EAP servers that they wish to obtain limited, and unauthenticated, network
    access. EAP peers signal which kind of access is required via certain pre-defined
    identifiers which use the Network Access Identifier (NAI) format of RFC7542. A
    table of identifiers and meanings is defined. About This Document This note is
