abstract:
- content: "<p>Existing traffic-engineering-related link attribute advertisements
    have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments. Since the original RSVP-TE
    use case was defined, additional applications (e.g., Segment Routing Policy and
    Loop-Free Alternates) that also make use of the link attribute advertisements
    have been defined. In cases where multiple applications wish to make use of these
    link attributes, the current advertisements do not support application- specific
    values for a given attribute, nor do they support indication of which applications
    are using the advertised value for a given link. This document introduces new
    link attribute advertisements that address both of these shortcomings. This document
    obsoletes RFC 8919.</p>"
