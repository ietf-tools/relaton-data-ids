abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Autokey security model for authenticating
    servers to clients using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) and public key cryptography.
    its design is based on the premiss that IPSEC schemes cannot be adopted intact,
    since that would preclude stateless servers and severely compromise timekeeping
    accuracy. In addition, PKI schemes presume authenticated time values are always
    available to enforce certificate lifetimes; however, cryptographically verified
    timestamps require interaction between the timekeeping function and authentication
    function in ways not yet considered by the IETF. This Document includes the Autokey
    requirements analysis, design principles and protocol specification. A detailed
    description of the protocol states, events and transition functions is included.
    A prototype of the Autokey design based on this document has been implemented,
    tested and documented in the NTP Version 4 (NTPv4) software distribution for Unix,
    Windows and VMS at http://www.ntp.org.</p>"
