abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a simple protocol framework for reliable multicast
    dissemination of data files. The general framework was originally developed and
    used by the Image Multicaster (IMM) application within the Internet MBone for
    dissemination of satellite imagery. This document describes the more general use
    of the protocol framework as a reliable bulk file transfer technique. We discuss
    the present operational modes, some performance issues, and the basic application
    data units (ADUs) used. This is not intended to be a detailed protocol specification
    document, but rather a broad description of the basic protocol features and a
    discussion of issues. Further detailed description of the protocol implementation
    may be provided in future documents.</p>"
