abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method for adding cryptographic protection
    to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The SCTP CRYPTO chunk defined
    in this document is intended to enable communications privacy for applications
    that use SCTP as their transport protocol and allows applications to communicate
    in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message
    forgery. The CRYPTO chunk defined here in is one half of a complete solution.
    Where a companion specification is required to define how the content of the CRYPTO
    chunk is protected, authenticated, and protected against replay, as well as how
    key management is accomplished. Applications using SCTP CRYPTO chunk can use all
    transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions but with some limitations.</p>"
