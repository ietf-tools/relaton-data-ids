abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been a number of proposals for alternate semantics for the
    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the IP header RFC 3168. This document
    discusses some of the issues in defining alternate semantics for the ECN field,
    and specifies requirements for a safe coexistence in an Internet that could include
    routers that do not understand the defined alternate semantics. This document
    evolved as a result of discussions with the authors of one recent proposal for
    such alternate semantics. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices
    for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
