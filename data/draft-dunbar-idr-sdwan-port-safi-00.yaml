abstract:
- content: "<p>The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising properties
    of a SD-WAN edge node WAN ports that face untrusted networks, such as the public
    internet. Those WAN ports may get assigned IP addresses from the Internet Service
    Providers (ISPs), may get assigned dynamic IP addresses via DHCP, or may have
    private addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs). Packets sent over those
    SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending on the user policies) or
    need to go through NAT. SD-WAN edge need to propagate those WAN ports properties
    to its SDWAN controller, which propagates to the authorized peers and manage the
    IPsec SAs among those peers for encrypting traffic via the untrusted networks.
    BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed as points of combination for this information
    in order to allow scaling of the SDWAN.</p>"
