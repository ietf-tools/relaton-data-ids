abstract:
- content: "<p>Route aggregation is critical to the long-term viability of the Internet.
    This document presents practical information that network managers can use to
    both understand the concepts of aggregation as well as put those concepts into
    use in order to do their part to make the Internet stable and allow its continued
    growth. The intended audience for this document is anyone responsible for configuring
    a network which has its own Autonomous System Number (ASN) and exchanges routing
    information with its Internet Service Provider(s) (ISP(s)) using the Border Gateway
    Protocol (BGP). This document does not cover multi-homing, though multi-homed
    sites can still benefit from understanding this material.</p>"
