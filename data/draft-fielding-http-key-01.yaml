abstract:
- content: "<p>The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin server to
    describe the cache key for a negotiated response: a short algorithm that can be
    used upon later requests to determine if the same response is reusable. Key has
    the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip for validation whenever a new
    request differs slightly, but not significantly, from prior requests. Key also
    informs user agents of the request characteristics that might result in different
    content, which can be useful if the user agent is not sending Accept* fields in
    order to reduce the risk of fingerprinting.</p>"
