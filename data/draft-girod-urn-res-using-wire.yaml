abstract:
- content: "<p>The identifier resolution extensions proposed in WIRE [11] add new
    mechanisms for redirection and resolver delegation to HTTP. While these mechanisms
    are generalized to support resolution of all URIs, they were designed in part
    to meet the specific needs of URN resolution systems. This document describes
    how the WIRE model maintains consistency with existing models of URN resolution,
    how WIRE can be used as a URN resolution protocol, and how WIRE fits into the
    existing URN resolution infrastructure, including NAPTR [8] and THTTP [9].</p>"
