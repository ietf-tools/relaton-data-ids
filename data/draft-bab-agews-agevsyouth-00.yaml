abstract:
- content: "<p>Solely technical measures advertised to allow for the age verification
    of minors online face fundamental challenges on a conceptual and implementation
    level. Organizational measures, on the other hand, have been established as best
    practices by peer groups who are both high risk and digitally savvy, which exists
    to protect minors. These approaches can be strengthened via technical measures,
    and two such candidates are the Qualified Website Authentication Certificates
    (QWACS), introduced by the EU as part of eIDAS 2.0 [QWACS] and potentially the
    work of IETF's digital emblems working group [DIEM]. Based on early analysis of
    the use and abuse cases as well as privacy and security considerations, we provide
    arguments why non-scaling organizational measures are a necessity and strengthening
    these with technical measures is a way to enable the security for minors online.</p>"
