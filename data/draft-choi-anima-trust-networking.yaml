abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes trust networking as an application of autonomic
    networking. The objective of trustworthy autonomic networking is providing trust
    networking environment where all autonomic nodes can communicate without any security
    concern. It defines a trust networking domain and describes how to configure and
    maintain the trust networking domain. While communication within the trust networking
    domain is done with trust, the communication with external nodes should be done
    via a specific autonomic service agent (ASA) called "trust gateway". The trust
    gateway ASA performs trust evaluation of the external nodes and enforces domain
    specific policies to keep the domain trustworthy.</p>
