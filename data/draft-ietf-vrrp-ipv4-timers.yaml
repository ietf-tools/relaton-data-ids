abstract:
- content: "<p>The router survivability capability provided by the Virtual Router
    Redundancy Protocol for IPv4 (VRRPv4) satisfies the requirements for many LAN
    environments. There are, however, LAN environments that have sub-second failover
    requirements and thus a need for finer granularity of the VRRP timers. This draft
    proposes extensions to VRRPv4 [RFC 3768] for specifying sub-second Advertisement
    Intervals. A new message type is introduced which permits the timer granularity
    for the Advertisement Interval to be specified. In addition, a new field is introduced
    permitting the specification of the number of missed ADVERTISEMENTs before a Virtual
    Router Master is declared down.</p>"
