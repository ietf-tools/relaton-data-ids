    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring aspects of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
    (NHDP) process on a router. The NHDP MIB also reports state information, performance
    information and notifications. This additional state and performance information
    is useful to management stations troubleshooting neighbor discovery problems.</p>"
