abstract:
- content: <p>In 2000, XCAST (Explicit Multi-Unicast) was first proposed as a protocol
    intended for small group multicasting. It combined three similar datagram simulcasting
    protocols that were submitted as earlier Internet Drafts by a number of different
    research groups. After that, researchers in those groups worked together to further
    develop, experiment and conduct standardization in IETF as well as in the open
    source community. This resulted in several implementations of protocol stacks,
    systems of multi-party video conference and group management, and mechanisms for
    harmonizing XCAST with ASM and SSM. In addition, an XCAST backbone for various
    experiments has been launched to operate inter-continentally. One of the main
    purposes of this document is to summarize the efforts undertaken by XCAST community
    as "best current practices" that would then be formally introduced to the IETF/IRTF
    community. In addition, we raise an issue concerning IANA resource allocation,
    which prevents us from widely expanding our experimental networks as well as distributing
    our software. Finally, we request IESG and other experts to check the validity
    of our proposed protocol and make any suggestions about how IANA can assign appropriate
    resources accordingly.</p>
