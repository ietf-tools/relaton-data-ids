abstract:
- content: "<p>The primary state variables used by all TCP congestion control algorithms,
    cwnd and ssthresh, are heavily overloaded, carrying different semantics in different
    states. This leads to excess implementation complexity and poorly defined behaviors
    under some combinations of events, such as application stalls during loss recovery.
    We propose a new framework for TCP congestion control, and to recast current standard
    algorithms to use new state variables. This new framework will not generally change
    the behavior of any of the primary congestion control algorithms when they are
    invoked in isolation. It will permit new algorithms with better behaviors in many
    corner cases, such as when two distinct primary algorithms are invoked concurrently.
    It will also foster the creation of new algorithms to address some events that
    are poorly treated by today's standards. For the vast majority of traditional
    algorithms the transformation to the new state variables is completely straightforward.
    However, the resulting implementation is likely to technically be in violation
    of existing TCP standards, even if it is fully compliant with their principles
    and intent.</p>"
