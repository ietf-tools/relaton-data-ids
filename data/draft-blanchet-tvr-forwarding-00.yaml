abstract:
- content: "<p>Some networks, such as in space, have links that are up and down based
    on a known schedule. In this context, IP Packets or Bundle Protocol Bundles should
    then be saved locally until the destination becomes reachable again. This document
    describes forwarding node policies regarding how to manage the local store as
    well as forwarding decisions. This specification applies to both IP packets or
    Bundle Protocol bundles.</p>"
