abstract:
- content: "<p>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
    the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved
    resources within the network, and pending path computation requests. This information
    may then be considered when computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated
    and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs). The Hierarchical
    Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture, provides an architecture to allow
    the optimum sequence of inter-connected domains to be selected, and network policy
    to be applied if applicable, via the use of a hierarchical relationship between
    PCEs. Combining the capabilities of Stateful PCE and the Hierarchical PCE would
    be advantageous. This document describes general considerations and use cases
    for the deployment of Stateful PCE(s) using the Hierarchical PCE architecture.</p>"
