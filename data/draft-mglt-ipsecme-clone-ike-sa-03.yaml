abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers a VPN End User setting a VPN with a security
    gateway where at least one of the peers has multiple interfaces. With the current
    IKEv2 protocol, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are determined by those used
    by IKEv2 SA. As a result using multiple interfaces requires to set up an IKEv2
    SA on each interface, or on each paths if both the VPN Client and the security
    gateway have multiple interfaces. Setting each IKEv2 SA involves authentications
    which might require multiple round trips as well as activity from the VPN User
    and thus would delay the VPN establishment. In addition multiple authentications
    unnecessarily increase the load on the VPN client and the authentication infrastructure.
    This document presents the Clone IKE SA extension, where an additional IKEv2 SA
    is derived from an existing IKEv2 SA. The newly created IKEv2 SA is set without
    the IKEv2 authentication exchange. The newly created IKEv2 SA can later be assigned
    to another interface using MOBIKE protocol.</p>"
