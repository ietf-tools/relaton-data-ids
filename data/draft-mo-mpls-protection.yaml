abstract:
- content: "<p>Protection issues for MPLS LSP have been discussed in recent IETF meetings.
    Various drafts have different proposals on establishing the working and protection
    LSP ([1]-[5]). But how to reserve bandwidth for the protection LSP has not be
    discussed. If the bandwidth for the protection LSP is reserved in a similar fashion
    as that of the working LSP, the bandwidth utilization in the network would be
    very poor. In this draft, an algorithm for reserve bandwidth for protection LSP
    is presented which enables very efficient bandwidth reservation for single fault
    protection.</p>"
