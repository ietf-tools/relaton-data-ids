abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an XML network management interface between
    a network managing system and a network managed system. The XML network management
    interface is intended for use in diverse network environments where transport,
    data and operating model requirements vary greatly. It is unlikely that a single
    transport, data and operating model specification will meet the needs of all anticipated
    service operators. Therefore, the XML network management interface is partitioned
    into layered components.</p>"
