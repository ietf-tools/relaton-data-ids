abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishing
    multimedia sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a protocol
    for use in streaming media systems. RTSP has a dual role: it establishes a media
    session for the delivery of streaming media as well as controls the streaming
    session once it has been set up. Since RTSP is also used for session establishment,
    there exists an overlap between the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP. In
    this document, we analyze a model in which SIP and the SDP offer/ answer model
    are used to set up a streaming session with an RTSP control channel and one or
    more media delivery streams. Such a model is beneficial since it allows the reuse
    of current architecture and functionality (e.g., authentication, charging, and
    QoS) established around SIP also for RTSP-based streaming.</p>"
