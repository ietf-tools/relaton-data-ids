abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delay Tolerant Networking 'ipn' Endpoint Identifier scheme was
    first defined as Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] for use with
    the Bundle Protocol version 6 (BPv6) [RFC5050]. [RFC7116] updated [RFC6260] and
    requested IANA registries associated with the ipn scheme when used with BPv6.
    The Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) specification [RFC9171] also defines an ipn
    scheme (for use with BPv7) by reusing the format from [RFC6260]. The evolution
    and specification of the ipn scheme has led to confusion over its use and format
    between BPv6 and BPv7. This document defines the ipn scheme as it is to be used
    with BPv7 and also updates [RFC7116] to make it clear that IANA CBHE registries
    are only to be used for BPv6. This document also updates the format of the BPv7
    ipn scheme to include Numbering Authorities and requests the formation of BPv7
    ipn scheme IANA registries.</p>"
