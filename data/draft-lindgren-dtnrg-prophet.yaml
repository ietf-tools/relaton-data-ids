abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using
    History of Encounters and Transitivity. PRoPHET is a routing protocol for intermittently
    connected networks, where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between
    source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols
    unable to deliver messages between hosts. These networks are examples of networks
    where the Delay-Tolerant Network architecture[1] is applicable. The document presents
    an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</p>"
