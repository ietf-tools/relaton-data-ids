abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of the usage of Path Computation
    Element (PCE) to dynamically structure service function chains. Service Function
    Chaining (SFC) is a technique that is meant to facilitate the dynamic enforcement
    of differentiated traffic forwarding policies within a domain. Service function
    chains are composed of an ordered set of elementary Service Functions (such as
    firewalls, load balancers) that need to be invoked according to the design of
    a given service. Corresponding traffic is thus forwarded along a Service Function
    Path (SFP) that can be computed by means of PCE. This document specifies extensions
    to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute
    and instantiate Service Function Paths.</p>"
