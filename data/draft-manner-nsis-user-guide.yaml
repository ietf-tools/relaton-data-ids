abstract:
- content: "<p>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Working group was officially formed
    in November 2001 to standardize a new IP signaling protocol suite. Six years have
    now passed and the first actual protocol specifications have been finalized. The
    purpose of this draft is to give an overview of what has been achieved, how the
    industry can make use of the new protocols, and how the research community can
    further extend the designs.</p>"
