abstract:
- content: "<p>SPIRITS services are those originating in the PSTN and involving interactions
    between the PSTN and the Internet. This document describes how SPIRITS supports
    those aspects of location services whereby the PSTN wireless network provides
    location related events to internet applications requesting them. An example of
    such an event is a mobile station entering a pre-specified geographic zone.</p>"
