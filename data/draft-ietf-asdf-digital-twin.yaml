abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies SDF modeling for a digital twin, i.e. a digital
    twin system, and its Things. An SDF is a format that is used to create and maintain
    data and interaction, and to represent the various kinds of data that is exchanged
    for these interactions. The SDF format can be used to model the characteristics,
    behavior and interactions of Things, i.e. physical objects, in a digital twin
    that contain Things as components.</p>"
