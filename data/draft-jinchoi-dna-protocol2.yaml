abstract:
- content: "<p>DNA solution consists of 1)link identity detection with a single RA
    and 2)quick RA acquisition. This draft presents the first component based on Link
    Identifier. It describes a way for link identity detection with prefix based Link
    Identifier, 'linkid prefix'. While this document doesn't include the second component,
    any quick RA acquisition scheme will work with the proposal. The draft is the
    result of DNA DT discussion.</p>"
