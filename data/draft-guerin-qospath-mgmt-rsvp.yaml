abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposal aimed at allowing management through
    the RSVP [RZB+96] protocol of paths selected by a QoS routing algorithm such as
    those of [GOW96, ZSSC96]. The goals of the proposal are to allow efficient management
    of such QoS paths with the minimum possible impact to the RSVP protocol and the
    existing routing infrastructure. Basic features of the approach include leveraging
    of RSVP soft state mechanisms, and simple extensions to enable soft pinning (sticking)
    of paths selected by the QoS routing algorithm. In addition, the proposal addresses
    the issue of preventing the formation of data path loops, and of avoiding potential
    race conditions.</p>"
