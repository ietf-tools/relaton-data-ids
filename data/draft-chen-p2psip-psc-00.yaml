abstract:
- content: "<p>REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling
    protocol for use on the Internet. This document proposes a security extension
    for RELOAD. A new data transmission security model was introduced in this draft.
    This model was based on a central Key Management Server (KMS). Security communications
    among multi peers can be achieved with PSC(Public Security Channel). PSC can also
    get performance improvement compared with TLS/DTLS method in RELAOD draft.</p>"
