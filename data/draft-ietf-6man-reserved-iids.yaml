abstract:
- content: "<p>Interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify
    interfaces on a link. They are required to be unique within a subnet. Several
    RFCs have specified interface identifiers or identifier ranges that have a special
    meaning attached to them. An IPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier
    in these ranges will encounter unexpected consequences. Since there is no centralized
    repository for such reserved identifiers, this document aims to create one. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
