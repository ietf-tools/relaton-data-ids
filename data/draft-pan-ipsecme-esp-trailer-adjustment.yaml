abstract:
- content: "<p>Implementing IPsec in hardware is a way to improve the forwarding performance
    of IPsec. However, the current IPsec ESP packet design, i.e., the position of
    ESP trailer, imposes a new overhead challenge for implementing IPsec in hardware.
    This document explains how this overhead challenge occurs and proposes the possible
    solutions.</p>"
