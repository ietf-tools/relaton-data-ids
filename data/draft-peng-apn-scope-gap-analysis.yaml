abstract:
- content: "<p>The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and set of
    mechanisms to derive, convey and use an attribute allowing the implementation
    of fine-grain user group-level and application group- level requirements in the
    network layer. APN aims to apply various policies in different nodes along a network
    path onto a traffic flow altogether, for example, at the headend to steer into
    corresponding path, at the midpoint to collect corresponding performance measurement
    data, and at the service function to execute particular policies. Currently there
    is still no way to efficiently realize this composite network service provisioning
    along the path. This document further clarifies the scope of the APN work and
    describes the solution gap analysis.</p>"
