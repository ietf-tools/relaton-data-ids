abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an Extensible Markup Language (XML) Schema for
    the Call Processing Language (CPL). The original CPL specification only provides
    a Document Type Declaration (DTD) to describe the structure of the language. Compared
    with XML DTDs, XML schemas have many advantages such as performing stricter type
    checking, providing pre-defined data types and being able to derive new data types
    from existing ones. We further split the CPL schema into two parts, one contains
    elements common to all the telecommunication entities, such as user agents or
    presence agents. The other contains elements, such as 'proxy', specifically for
    network servers.</p>"
