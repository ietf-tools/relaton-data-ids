abstract:
- content: "<p>The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based
    access networks. It carries EAP over UDP which permits ISPs to use multiple authentication
    methods. However, in roaming environments IP clients might change of gateways
    and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur. This can considerably degrade
    performance. To solve this problem, the PANA WG is currently working on a solution
    based on context transfer between PANA Authentication Agents. The aim of this
    document is to analyze how this proposal works in a WLAN environment considering
    various deployment scenarios.</p>"
