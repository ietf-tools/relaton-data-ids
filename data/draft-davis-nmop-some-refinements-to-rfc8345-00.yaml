abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides a brief analysis of the current unidirectional
    point-to-point approach to modeling of the link in RFC8345, highlights why this
    is not sufficient and makes a proposal to enhance RFC8345 YANG to support multipoint
    uni/bi links. The two alternative enhancement approaches proposed are backward
    compatible. The enhancement is such that it provides a uniform solution to modeling
    all links that could, over time, replace the current unidirectional point-to-point
    approach. The rationale for the change is based on many years of practical experience,
    including challenges using RFC8345 in actual solution development, and insight
    gained through other standardisation efforts and deployments.</p>"
