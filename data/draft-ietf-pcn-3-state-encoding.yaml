abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect
    the Quality of Service of inelastic flows within a controlled domain. It does
    this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded
    a threshold below the physical link rate. This experimental encoding scheme specifies
    how three encoding states can be carried in the IP header using a combination
    of two DSCPs and the ECN bits. The Basic scheme only allows for three encoding
    states. The Full scheme provides 6 states, enough for limited end- to-end support
    for ECN as well.</p>"
