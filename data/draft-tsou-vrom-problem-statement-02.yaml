abstract:
- content: "<p>TThe dynamic allocation of computing resources on a massive scale through
    the use of virtual machines to serve a large number of customers and applications
    simultaneously brings a number of benefits but also a number of challenges to
    data center operations. Such challenges range from acquiring the information needed
    to provision the physical servers, storage and networking elements, through accounting
    for resource and application usage at the user level. In particular, this document
    describes the problem of operational and management challenges that virtualization
    brings in the (carrier) data center as an enabler of new technologies such as
    self- provisioning and elastic capacity and related benefits of consolidation,
    reduced total cost of ownership, and energy management. This document does not
    cover the problem of address resolution in massive data centers. It does not cover
    technologies related to VDI either.</p>"
