abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) combines source routing and tunneling to steer
    traffic through the transit network. The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)
    separates IP addresses into Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs)
    and also leverages tunneling mechanisms. Mapping between EIDs and RLOCs is facilitated
    by the LISP mapping system. Combining LISP and SR enables the LISP mapping system
    to provide SR information to encapsulating routers so that traffic can be steered
    in the transit network or the list of segments a particular packet traverses is
    recorded in the packet header. This document describes extensions required to
    the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) to enable a LISP mapping system to communicate
    list of segment identifiers or the request to record the list of segments a particular
    packet traverses to the encapsulating router.</p>"
