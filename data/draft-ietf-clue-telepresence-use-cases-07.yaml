abstract:
- content: "<p>Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create an environment that
    gives non co-located users or user groups a feeling of co-located presence through
    multimedia communication including at least audio and video signals of high fidelity.
    A number of techniques for handling audio and video streams are used to create
    this experience. When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between
    different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible. Conveying information
    about the relationships between multiple streams of media would allow senders
    and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork. This
    memo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams
    in a telepresence conference.</p>"
