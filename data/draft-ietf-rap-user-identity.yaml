abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the representation of user identity information
    in POLICY_DATA object [POL-EXT] for supporting policy based admission control
    in RSVP. The goal of identity representation is to allow a process on a system
    to securely identify the owner of the communicating process (e.g. user id) and
    convey this information in RSVP requests (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner. We
    describe the encoding of user identity as RSVP policy element. Subsequently, we
    describe representations of user identities for Kerberos and Public Key based
    user authentication mechanisms. In summary we describe the use of this identity
    information in an operational setting.</p>"
