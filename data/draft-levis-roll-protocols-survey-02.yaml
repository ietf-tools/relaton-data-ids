abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing issues.
    Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and smart objects, have
    difficult constraints: very limited memory, little processing power, and long
    sleep periods. As most of these devices are battery-powered, energy efficiency
    is critically important. Wireless link qualities can vary significantly over time,
    requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology change energy
    costs. Routing over such low power and lossy networks has requirements that existing
    mesh protocols only partially address. This document provides a brief survey of
    the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols with respect to this class
    of networks. It provides guidance on how lessons from existing and prior efforts
    can be leveraged in future protocol design.</p>"
