abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the architecture of end to end multihoming. End
    to end multihoming does not burden routing system for multihoming. That is, even
    extensive use of end to end multihoming does not increase the number of entries
    in a global routing table. Traditionally with IPv4, multihoming capability is
    offered by an intelligent routing system, which, as is always the case with violating
    the end to end principle, lacks scalability on a global routing table size and
    robustness against link failures. On the other hand, with end to end multihoming,
    multihoming is supported by transport (TCP) or application layer (UDP etc.) of
    end systems and does not introduce any problem in the network and works as long
    as there is some connectivity between the end systems. Because end to end multihoming
    is performed in end systems, the architecture needs no routing protocol changes
    Instead, APIs and applications must be modified to some extent.</p>"
