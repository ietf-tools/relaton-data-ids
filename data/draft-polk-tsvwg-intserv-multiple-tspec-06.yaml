- content: <p>This document defines extensions to Integrated Services (IntServ) allowing
    multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow specifications to be conveyed
    in the same Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange.

    in a single round trip. Legal This documents and the information contained therein
