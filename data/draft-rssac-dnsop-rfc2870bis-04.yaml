abstract:
- content: "<p>As the Internet has become critical to the world's social and economic
    infrastructure, attention has focused on the correct, safe, reliable, and secure
    operation of the Internet infrastructure itself. The DNS is considered a crucial
    part of that technical infrastructure. The root domain and its authoritative name
    servers are a part of that technical infrastructure. The primary focus of this
    document is to provide guidelines for secure, stable, and resilient authoritative
    name service for the root zone. Additionally it will look into some specifics
    for the operation of the name servers. Other operators of authoritative name servers
    such as those for generic top-level domains (gTLDs), country code top-level domains
    (ccTLDs) and other zones may also find this document useful.</p>"
