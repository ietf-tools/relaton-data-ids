abstract:
- content: "<p>To build digital twin networks based on the digital twin network architecture
    in [DTNConcept], modeling of digital twins and virtual- physical mapping are critical.
    There are many ways to construct network twins, and they have different ways to
    realize virtual- physical mapping and information exchange between twins. Constructing
    a twin of network element that has communication requirement and function like
    a physical entity is a kind of network modeling. In this scenario, when implementing
    virtual-physical mapping and information exchange between twins based on network
    layer communication, It faces problems such as large addressing space consumption
    and low addressing efficiency. This document describes an idea to using flexible
    addressing and protocol techniques in digital twin network architecture that can
    help reduce the complexity of digital twin network implementations and improve
    digital twin network efficiency and security.</p>"
