abstract:
- content: <p>RFC 2026 places restrictions on how Internet-Drafts can be referred
    to in RFCs. Over time, the way that the IETF community uses Internet-Drafts has
    changed. The restrictions from RFC 2026 sometimes make RFCs inaccurate (because
    many drafts that are referred to are not actually "works in progress", and also
    make references to Internet-Drafts nearly useless to RFC readers. This document
    updates the one part of RFC 2026, and the one part of RFC 7322, that covers referencing
    Internet-Drafts.</p>
