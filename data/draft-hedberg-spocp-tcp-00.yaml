abstract:
- content: "<p>The SPOCP protocol has been described in [SPOCP]. The description is
    done in general terms and is not done in such a way that implementers can directly
    implement the protocol. To make that possible there has to be a mapping defined
    between the more abstract description and a bits on the wire description. This
    document represents one possible mapping.</p>"
