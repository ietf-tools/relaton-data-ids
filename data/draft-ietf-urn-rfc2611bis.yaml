abstract:
- content: <p>This document lays out general definitions of and mechanisms for establishing
    Uniform Resource Names (URN) "namespaces". The URN WG has defined a syntax for
    URNs in RFC 2141, as well as some proposed mechanisms for their resolution and
    use in Internet applications in RFC 3401 and RFC 3405. The whole rests on the
    concept of individual "namespaces" within the URN structure. Apart from proof-of-concept
    namespaces, the use of existing identifiers in URNs has been discussed in RFC
    2288. This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet
    Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>
