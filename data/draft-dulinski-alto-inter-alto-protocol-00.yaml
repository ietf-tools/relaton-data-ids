abstract:
- content: "<p>The ALTO service provides the information, which can make communication
    between applications more efficient, especially in case of overlay applications.
    Such applications can use the information to perform better-than-random peer selection.
    The ALTO protocol conveys network information to applications. The protocol definition
    of this document extends the functionality of this ALTO service by introducing
    a standardized manner of communications between ALTO servers. A new inter-ALTO
    protocol is proposed, which enables the exchange of information between ALTO servers.
    The servers can coordinate actions and can introduce policies, which provide communication
    between applications localized in cooperating Autonomous Systems with a higher
    performance and a better cost efficiency.</p>"
