abstract:
- content: "<p>To limit the association between a device traffic and its user, client
    vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation. When such rotation happens,
    sessions may break, which may affect network efficiency and the user experience.
    This document lists network services that may be affected by such rotation, and
    examines solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience
    and network operation efficiency.</p>"
