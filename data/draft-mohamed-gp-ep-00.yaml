abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Global Postion/Encryption Protocol (GP/EP), a proposal
    for a universal wireless computer network. Global position is defined as region
    in space-time. The network routes data to a global position using routing information
    provided as part of the protocol data and proposes use of encryption algorithms
    to prevent unauthorised access. This protocol is proposed as an alternative for
    IP, the Internet Protocol. The memo also describes how a network can work with
    no real network address other than its global position in the universe.</p>"
