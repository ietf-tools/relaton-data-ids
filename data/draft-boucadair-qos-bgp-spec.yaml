abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a proposal for exchanging QoS-enabled reachability
    information between service providers. It defines new BGP attributes to be used
    in order to convey QoS performance characteristics between service providers and
    it describes how to use these QoS values in order to select the best path. An
    example of route selection process that takes into account the QoS performance
    values enclosed in BGP messages is also detailed.</p>"
