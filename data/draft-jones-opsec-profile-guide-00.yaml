abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidelines for creating security capability
    profiles. A profile is a list of features that are required to operate a device
    in a a secure manner in a specific environment. It is anticipated that what is
    required in a profile will vary over time and, across different classes of devices
    (e.g. a network edge device may need to filter customer traffic whereas core network
    devices may not), and in different organizations. This document does not define
    a profile or specify requirements, but rather gives guidance for their creation.</p>"
