abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an approach to provide extended LAN and VLAN
    services across IP routed networks. This is done by adding a virtual bridge identifier
    to packets destined to the remote location and then encapsulating this new packet
    in IP. This packet is then source routed across the IP network to a Virtual Bridge
    Tunnel terminating router where the header is stripped off and the virtual bridge
    identifier is used to forward the original packet out the corresponding tunnel
    interface. Within the IP network the packets are treated like any other IP packets
    and as such identical mechanisms such as security and quality of service can be
    applied.</p>"
