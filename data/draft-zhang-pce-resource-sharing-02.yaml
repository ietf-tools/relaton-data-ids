abstract:
- content: "<p>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths
    (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can help save network
    resource and useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or when two LSPs do not
    need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is a centralized
    entity, responsible for path computation. Given this feature and its access to
    the network resource information and possibly active LSPs information, it can
    be used to support resource-sharing-based path computation with better efficiency.
    This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to
    support resource sharing-based path computation.</p>"
