abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the NEWZONE_NOTIFY opcode for DNS, by which a primary
    master server advises a set of slave servers that there is a zone has been created
    and that a query should be initiated to discover the new zone data. This draft
    also specifies a mechanism for the slave servers to achieve authenticated synchronization
    of zone data as well as zone synchronization information with the primary when
    a zone is created on the primary.</p>"
