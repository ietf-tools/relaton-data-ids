abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS payload size limitation constrains operational and policy choice
    for many years. It is become increasingly notable in IPv6 transition and DNSSEC
    development, specifically during Priming Exchange process. Given that the load
    of priming exchange on the root system is relatively low, this memo proposes using
    TCP by default in Priming Exchange between resolver and root server. This approach
    is aiming to treat Priming Exchange as a special process which brings a little
    change to the current root system and provide solution to the long- term problems.</p>"
