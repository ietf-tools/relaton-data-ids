abstract:
- content: "<p>IPsec technology is frequently used for remote access scenarios. A
    tunnel is established from a mobile node (such as a laptop) and an IPsec gateway
    located at the Enterprise. The mobile node's tunnel outer address is potentially
    any IP address on the Internet. The mobile node's tunnel inner address should
    be an address from within the enterprise. The assignment of this address should
    ideally be done dynamically. This document specifies a configuration mode called
    'DHCP over IKE'. The document specifies that the payload of a DHCP exchange should
    be carried over an IKE phase 1 exchange.</p>"
