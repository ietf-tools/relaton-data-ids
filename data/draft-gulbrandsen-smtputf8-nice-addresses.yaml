abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible
    enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while avoiding confusing
    or risky elements. This is one of a pair of documents: this contains recommendations
    for what addresses humans should use, such address provisioning sytems can restrain
    themselves to addresses that email valdidators accept. (This set can also be described
    in other ways, including "simple to cut-and-paste".) Its companion defines simpler
    rules, accepts more addresses, and is intended for software like MTAs. NOTE: The
    term ''nice'' is not ideal here, and must be reconsidered or replaced before this
    is issued as an RFC. "Well-formed" is a candidate. "Nice" will do for now: better
    to argue about substance than wording.</p>'
