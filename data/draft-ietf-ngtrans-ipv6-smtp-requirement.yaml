abstract:
- content: "<p>This document lists operational requirements for IPv6 SMTP and IPv6-capable
    MX DNS records. As IPv6 SMTP servers are deployed, it has become apparent that
    certain configurations are necessary in IPv6-capable MX DNS records for stable
    dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) SMTP operation. This document clarifies the problems
    that exist in the transition period between IPv4 SMTP and IPv6 SMTP. It also defines
    operational requirements for stable IPv4/v6 SMTP operation.</p>"
