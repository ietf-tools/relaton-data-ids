abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile Ad-hoc Networks could be attached to a fixed infrastructure
    network, like the Internet. This document specifies a mechanism for Border Router
    discovery and utilization. It provides facilities for choosing the best Border
    Router, configuring IP addresses needed for using the selected Border Router and
    providing a path to the selected Border Router. Seamless transition to alternate
    Border Routers is provided. When mobile nodes in the MANET make use of Mobile
    IP or NEMO (NEtwork MObility), session continuity is provided. NEMO for MANET
    is based on NEMO, which utilizes IPv6 mobility support. The NEMO basic support
    protocol can easily be enhanced to support IPv4, which provides IPv4 support by
    NEMO for MANET.</p>"
