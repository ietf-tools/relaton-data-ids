abstract:
- content: <p>[RFC6513] and [RFC6514] specify procedures for originating, propagating,
    and processing "C-multicast routes". However, there are a number of MVPN use cases
    that are not properly or optimally handled by those procedures. This document
    describes those use cases, and specifies the additional procedures needed to handle
    them. Some of the additional procedures are also applicable to EVPN SMET routes
    [I- D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy].</p>
