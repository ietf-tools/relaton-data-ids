abstract:
- content: "<p>The Advanced Groupware Access Protocol, (AGAP) allows a client to access
    and store electronic mail messages, contacts, events, files, and configurations
    on a server. The electronic mail messages can be grouped in folders. AGAP also
    provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.
    AGAP does not specify a means of posting electronic mail messages; this function
    is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as SMTP [RFC2821]. It also does not
    specify a means for exchanging messages with contacts that are reported as being
    online; this function is handled by an instant messaging protocol such as XMPP
    [RFC3921]. AGAP includes the following operations for electronic mail messages:
    creating, deleting, renaming, moving and coping mail folders; checking for new
    messages; permanently removing messages; moving and coping messages between folders;
    fetching information about a message; setting and clearing tags for messages;
    searching in messages; retrieving only a part of a message; marking messages as
    SPAM; deleting attachments from a message. AGAP includes the following operations
    to manipulate the contacts: creating, deleting, moving, coping, tagging, and searching
    contacts; checking if a contact is online; fetching information about a contact.
    AGAP includes the following operations related to the use of the events: creating,
    deleting, moving, coping and tagging events in calendar; fetching events details;
    searching for events. All items are read and written in format XML encoded UTF-8
    [RFC3629] and each item is identified by a unique alphanumeric identifier. AGAP
    is designed to support access only to a single server per connection. It is also
    designed to balance the volume of text exchanged between the server and clients
    and its readability by humans for debugging.</p>"
