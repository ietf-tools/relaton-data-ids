abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for
    SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD sub-TLV and
    has been designed to be consistent with the work on Technology Agnostic OSPF Traffic
    Engineering Extensions for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV]. These formats are
    based on previous experience prototyping and testing control plane for ASON networks
    and are proposed for adoption as a Standards Track RFC for support of ASON routing.</p>"
