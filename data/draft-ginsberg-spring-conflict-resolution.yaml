abstract:
- content: "<p>In support of Segment Routing (SR) routing protocols advertise a variety
    of identifiers used to define the segments which direct forwarding of packets.
    In cases where the information advertised by a given protocol instance is either
    internally inconsistent or conflicts with advertisements from another protocol
    instance a means of achieving consistent forwarding behavior in the network is
    required. This document defines the policies used to resolve these occurrences.</p>"
