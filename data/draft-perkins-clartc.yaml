abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is informational. It specifies a clarification of version
    2 of the SNMP SMI, a standard for the Internet community, which is defined by
    RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2], and 1904[3]. The clarification is to fix a perceived inconsistency
    in the definition of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION construct. This problem is resolved
    by replacement text for section 3.5 of RFC 1903.</p>"
