abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Neighbor Discovery optimized for 6LoWPAN. The
    6LoWPAN format allows IPv6 to be used over very low-power, low- bandwidth wireless
    networks often making use of extended multihop topologies. However, the use of
    standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery over 6LoWPAN networks has several problems. Standard
    Neighbor Discovery was not designed for wireless links, the standard IPv6 link
    concept and heavy use of multicast makes it inefficient. This document spefies
    a new mechanism allowing efficient Duplicate Address Detection over entire 6LoWPAN
    networks. In addition it specifies prefix and context dissemination for use with
    router advertisements, allows for stateless address assignment, and the use of
    Neighbor Discovery Proxy.</p>"
