abstract:
- content: "<p>Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
    (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store information
    about users and other network entities. One such use is to store information on
    groups. There are LDAP standards established for this purpose, e.g. the groupOfUniqueNames
    [3]. However, currently there are no standards for a very important use of Groups,
    as SMTP Mailing Lists or Aliases. This document discusses how we at Netscape have
    made this extension, with the intent of providing useful information towards perhaps
    creating standards for this important use of LDAP.</p>"
