abstract:
- content: "<p>SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for P2MP
    service delivery. A P2MP Policy consists of candidate paths that connects the
    Root of the Tree to a set of Leaves. The P2MP policy is composed of replication
    segments. A replication segment is a forwarding instruction for a candidate path
    which is downloaded to the Root, transit nodes and the leaves. This document describes
    a simple and efficient mechanism that can be used to detect data plane failures
    in P2MP Policy Candidate Paths (CPs) and Path Instances (PIs).</p>"
