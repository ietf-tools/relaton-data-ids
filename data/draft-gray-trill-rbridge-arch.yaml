abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols as
    a control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the link layer with network
    layer routing benefits. RBridges use existing link state routing to provide higher
    RBridge to RBridge cross-section bandwidth, fast convergence on reconfiguration,
    and more robustness under link interruption than an equivalent set of conventional
    bridges using existing spanning tree forwarding. They are intended to apply to
    similar L2 network sizes as conventional bridges and are intended to be backward
    compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress and transit. They also attempt
    to retain as much 'plug and play' as is already available in existing bridges.
    This document proposes an RBridge system as a solution to the TRILL problem. It
    also defines the RBridge architecture, defines its terminology, and describes
    basic components and desired behavior. One or more separate documents specify
    the protocols and mechanisms that satisfy the architecture presented herein.</p>"
