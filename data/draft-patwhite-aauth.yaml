abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the *Agent Authorization Grant*, an OAuth 2.1
    extension for *confidential agent clients*—software or AI agents with long-lived
    identities—to request end-user consent and obtain access tokens via HTTP polling,
    Server-Sent Events (SSE), or WebSocket. It is heavily inspired by the core dance
    of the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) but is tailored for agents
    either long lived identities, and introduces scoped, natural-language descriptions
    and a reason parameter provided by the agent.</p>"
