abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the syntax and semantics for the Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) content constraints extension. This extension is used to
    determine whether a public key is appropriate to use in the processing of a protected
    content. In particular, the CMS content constraints extension is one part of the
    authorization decision; it is used when validating a digital signature on a CMS
    SignedData content or validating a message authentication code (MAC) on a CMS
    AuthenticatedData content or CMS AuthEnvelopedData content. The signed or authenticated
    content type is identified by an ASN.1 object identifier, and this extension indicates
    the content types that the public key is authorized to validate. If the authorization
    check is successful, the CMS content constraints extension also provides default
    values for absent attributes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
