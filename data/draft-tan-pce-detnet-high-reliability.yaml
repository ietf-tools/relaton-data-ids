abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time network performance information, like latency, delay variation,
    packet loss and in order delivery, is becoming critical in the path computation
    in some networks. This document propose metric extensions to PCEP messages, to
    better describe the path computation constraints and QoS requirements of Deterministic
    Networking (DetNet) flows, especially the high reliability requirements on packet
    loss and in order delivery. PCEP Extensions defined in this document could be
    used not only for DetNet, but also for other PCEP scenarios.</p>"
