abstract:
- content: "<p>IP carrier network needs to provide real-time traffic visibility to
    help network operators quickly and accurately locate network congestion and packet
    loss, and make timely path adjustment for deterministic services in order to avoid
    congestion. It is essential to explore the adaptive traffic data collection mechanism
    so as to capture real-time network state at minimum resource consumption. This
    document summarizes the problems currently faced by network operators when attempting
    to provide timely traffic data collection to satisfy various scenarios that require
    real-time network state and traffic visibility, and aggregates the requirements
    for adaptive traffic collecting mechanism from a variety of deployment scenarios.</p>"
