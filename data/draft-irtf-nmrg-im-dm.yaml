abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been ongoing confusion about the differences between Information
    Models and Data Models for defining managed objects in network management. This
    document explains the differences between these terms by analyzing how existing
    network management model specifications (from the IETF and other bodies such as
    the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the Distributed Management
    Task Force (DMTF)) fit into the universe of Information Models and Data Models.
    This memo documents the main results of the 8th workshop of the Network Management
    Research Group (NMRG) of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) hosted by the
    University of Texas at Austin. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
