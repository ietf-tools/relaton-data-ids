abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on a single
    root, known as the Root Server System. Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production
    root server testbed that provides an environment where technical and operational
    experiments can safely be performed without risk to production root server infrastructure.This
    testbed has been used by a broad community of participants to perform experiments
    that aim to inform operations and future development of the production DNS. Yeti
    DNS is an independently-coordinated project and is not affiliated with ICANN,
    IANA or any Root Server Operator. The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes
    various novel and experimental components including IPv6-only transport, independent,
    autonomous Zone Signing Key management, large cryptographic keys and a large number
    of Yeti-Root Servers names. These differences from the Root Server System have
    operational consequences such as large responses to priming queries and the coordination
    of a large pool of independent operators; by deploying such a system globally
    but outside the production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides an opportunity
    to gain insight into those consequences without threatening the stability of the
    DNS. This document neither addresses the relevant policies under which the Root
    Server System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing any aspect of its
    implementation or operation. This document aims solely to document the technical
    and operational experience of deploying a system which is similar to but different
    from the Root Server System.</p>"
