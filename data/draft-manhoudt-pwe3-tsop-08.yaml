abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Transparent SDH/SONET over Packet (TSoP)
    mechanism to encapsulate Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) or Synchronous Optical
    NETwork (SONET) bit-streams in a packet format, suitable for Pseudowire (PW) transport
    over a packet switched network (PSN). The key property of the TSoP method is that
    it transports the SDH/SONET client signal in its entirety through the PW, i.e.,
    no use is made of any specific characteristic of the SONET/SDH signal format,
    other than its bit rate. The TSoP transparency includes transporting the timing
    properties of the SDH/SONET client signal. This ensures a maximum of transparency
    and a minimum of complexity, both in implementation and during operation.</p>"
