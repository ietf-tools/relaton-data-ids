abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is intended to fix a large number of
    problems with IPv4 that have been identified through many years of global use,
    not least of which is the shortage of available IPv4 addresses. One of the challenges
    with IPv4 that has not, apparently, been adequately considered is the crime attribution
    characteristics of IPv6 technologies. The challenge of crime attribution on the
    Internet is an important one and a careful balance needs to be struck between
    the needs of law enforcement, the rights of crime victims and the right to privacy
    of the vast majority of Internet users who have no involvement in any sort of
    criminality. The purpose of this document is to consider the crime attribution
    characteristics of various IPv6 address assignment techniques.</p>"
