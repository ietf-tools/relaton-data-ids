abstract:
- content: "<p>A number of IETF protocols make use of Abstract Syntax Notation One
    (ASN.1), which is a very complex language for describing abstract types and values,
    in addition to several sets of encoding rules for those types and values. Some
    of these uses of ASN.1, particularly the Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] pose implementation
    problems. This document analyzes some of the likely problems associated with the
    use of ASN.1 in IETF protocols, and some possible reasons for these problems.</p>"
