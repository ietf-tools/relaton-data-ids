abstract:
- content: "<p>JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the representation
    of structured information, supporting Boolean values, numbers, strings, arrays,
    and tables. Recently, a number of applications have started to look for binary
    representation formats that solve a similar problem. In particular, constrained
    node networks can benefit from such a binary representation format. A very successful
    binary representation that is otherwise comparable to JSON is MessagePack. Recently,
    a slight modification of MessagePack has been defined that allows for distinguishing
    UTF-8 strings from binary data. This draft, as an independent effort, documents
    the resulting BinaryPack format. The current version -00 of this document is an
    early draft that is intended to spark further discussion.</p>"
