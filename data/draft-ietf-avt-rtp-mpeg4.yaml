abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a payload format for transporting MPEG-4 encoded
    data using RTP. MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural
    and synthetic audio-visual data. Several services provided by RTP are beneficial
    for MPEG-4 encoded data transport over the Internet. Additionally, the use of
    RTP makes it possible to synchronize MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types.
    This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working group within
    the Internet Engineering Task Force and ISO/IEC MPEG-4 ad hoc group on MPEG-4
    over Internet. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
    mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the authors.</p>"
