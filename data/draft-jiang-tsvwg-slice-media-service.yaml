abstract:
- content: "<p>Extended Reality &amp; multi-modality communication, or XRM, is a type
    of advanced service that has been studied and standardized in the 3GPP SA2 working
    group. It targets at achieving high data rate, ultra-low latency, and high reliability.
    The streams of an XRM service might be comprised of data from multiple modalities,
    namely, video, audio, ambient-sensor and haptic detection, etc. XRM service faces
    challenges on various aspects, e.g. accurate multi-modality data synchronization,
    QoS differentiation, large volume of packets, and etc. While a new 3GPP network
    slice type, HDLLC, has been recently introduced to handle the QoS requirements
    of XRM streams, the ubiquitously-existential encryption of packet header and/or
    payload post additional challenges to the transport of encoded video packets via
    5GS. We have then discussed two potential IETF schemes, e.g., IP-DSCP based or
    UDP-option extension, that could be applied to 'expose' XRM QoS 'metadata' to
    5GS.</p>"
