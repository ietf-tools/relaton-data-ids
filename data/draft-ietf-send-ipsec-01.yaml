abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover other
    nodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to find routers
    and to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors.
    If not secured, ND protocol is vulnerable to various attacks. This document specifies
    an extension to IPsec for securing ND. Contrary to the original ND specifications
    that also called for use of IPsec, this extension does not require the creation
    of a large number of manually configured security associations.</p>"
