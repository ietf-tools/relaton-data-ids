abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains a plan for how providers of email services can
    manage one aspect of the problem of email abuse over IPv6. Spammers can send mail
    from a very large range of IPv6 addresses, and this will make current antispam
    blocklisting technology less effective. This is because email receivers will have
    to maintain excessively large lists of IP blocklists which either consume too
    many resources, or will become stale and therefore ineffective as spammers quickly
    discard one IP address and move onto the next one. This document recommends that
    during the transition of email from IPv4 to IPv6, email receivers implement a
    whitelisting option where they only allow email from permitted senders over IPv6
    and reject email from everyone else sending email over IPv6.</p>"
