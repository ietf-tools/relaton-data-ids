abstract:
- content: "<p>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [2] provides a standard method for
    transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP datagrams
    are often encapsulated in HDLC frames [1] when used over standard analog modems.
    This document describes the extensions to PPP encapsulation and HDLC framing to
    support Quality of Service (QoS) over low bandwidth links. This document is a
    submission to the IETF ISSLL working group. Comments are solicited and should
    be addressed to the working group's mailing list at issll@mercury.lcs.mit.edu
    and/or the author. This document is an update of the previous version which was
    named 'draft-andrades-framing-ext-00.txt' and was revised as a result of discussions
    with Carsten Bormann, as well as the discussions at the September 30th meeting
    of the ISSLL working group.</p>"
