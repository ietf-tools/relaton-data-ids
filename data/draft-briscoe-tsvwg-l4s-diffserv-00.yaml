abstract:
- content: "<p>L4S and Diffserv offer somewhat overlapping services (low latency and
    low loss), but bandwidth allocation is out of scope for L4S. Therefore there is
    scope for the two approaches to complement each other, but also to conflict. This
    informational document explains how the two approaches interact, how they can
    be arranged to complement each other and in which cases one can stand alone without
    needing the other.</p>"
