abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to provide
    hints in its HTTP responses to a user-agent that indicate the user could be better
    off connecting to a different IP than what they are currently connected to. This
    is highly relevant in a multi-homed server world where DNS may not have all of
    the relevant state necessary to make a proper routing decision. Additionally it
    is done in a manner that does not require application level changes as could be
    the case for an application level redirect such as a 3xx response</p>"
