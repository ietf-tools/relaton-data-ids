abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, a number of popular extensions to the NNTP protocol
    defined in RFC977 are documented and discussed. While this document is not intended
    to serve as a standard of any kind, it will hopefully serve as a reference document
    for future implementers of the NNTP protocol. In the role, this document would
    hopefully create the possibility for some level of interoperability among implementations
    that make use of extensions.</p>"
