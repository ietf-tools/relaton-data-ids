abstract:
- content: "<p>The required and suggested algorithms in the original Internet Key
    Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) specification do not reflect the current reality of
    the IPsec market requirements. The original specification allows weak security
    and suggests algorithms that are thinly implemented. This document updates RFC
    2409, the original specification, and is intended for all IKEv1 implementations
    deployed today. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
