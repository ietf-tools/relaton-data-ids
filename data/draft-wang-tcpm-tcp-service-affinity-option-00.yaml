abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a service affinity solution between client and
    server based on the newly defined TCP Option. This solution can avoid the waste
    of resources caused by saving a large amount of customer status data in the network
    equipment, and realize the optimized scheduling of resources based on network
    conditions and computing power resources in the distributed computing power network
    scenario, so as to realize the reasonable operation of cloud network resources.</p>"
