abstract:
- content: <p>IETF members is per tradition a focused group, working with all aspects
    of network interconnectivity and processing. But, as requested by the IETF Security
    Chair at IETF-75, there is an emerging need of a more formal review of Information
    Security issues, in relation to the IETF Standard work. During IETF-75, the author
    noted in several sessions participants voicing a somewhat different view on security
    issues, compared to what I have experienced as norm and practice within several
    End-Users organizations. Some key practices, often dependent on rulesets as SOX
    "Best Practice" framework, seemed to not be to well-known in those discussions
    I attended. This document intends to, with some simple examples, review and highlight
    some effects of these gaps and questions they arises.</p>
