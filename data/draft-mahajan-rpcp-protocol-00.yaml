abstract:
- content: "<p>RPCP is a generic interface protocol between two entities, where one
    entity acting as Resource Pool (RP) and other being the Resource Pool Controller
    (RPC). The RP entity in turn may be acting as RPC for other RPs in a hierarchical
    manner. The resource being defined can be any hardware/software, physical/virtual
    resource. In today's telecommunication world, the intelligence is being moved
    away from the hardware (the embedded platform) or the switching fabric to a more
    generic computing resource (high-end servers). These computing resources controls
    the call logic, service logic and the network signalling part. This implies that
    there is a need for an open interface protocol by which call agents or signalling
    agents can control this rather dumb hardware as resource pools. This helps in
    easy and smooth integration of these entities even if they come from different
    vendors. The Interworking and Gateway market is a very big market today. The network
    architecture proposed for these solutions carries the intelligence away from the
    resource pools (also called media gateways) to call agents or pool controllers
    (also called media gateway controllers). With such network architectures the need
    for such a protocol is more prominent. There are many other needs and use of such
    a protocol which will be discussed in detail in this white paper. This paper does
    not try to define the complete protocol, however the basic definition and the
    protocol architecture will be defined. The document first describes the application
    of Resource Pool Control protocol, followed by requirements from this Protocol
    and then defines the Protocol Architecture with basic protocol definition. The
    annexure of the document gives few examples on RPCP usage.</p>"
