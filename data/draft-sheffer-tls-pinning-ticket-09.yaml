abstract:
- content: "<p>Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from appropriately
    authenticating the TLS server. Several alternatives have been proposed to detect
    this situation and prevent a client from establishing a TLS session with a TLS
    end point authenticated with an illegitimate public-key certificate. These mechanisms
    are either not widely deployed or limited to public web browsing. This document
    proposes to extend TLS with opaque pinning tickets as a way to pin the server's
    identity. During an initial TLS session, the server provides an original encrypted
    pinning ticket. In subsequent TLS session establishment, upon receipt of the pinning
    ticket, the server proves its ability to decrypt the pinning ticket and thus the
    ownership of the pinning protection key. The client can now safely conclude that
    the TLS session is established with the same TLS server as the original TLS session.
    One of the important properties of this proposal is that no manual management
    actions are required.</p>"
