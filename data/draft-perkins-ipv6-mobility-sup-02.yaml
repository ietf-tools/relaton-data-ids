abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents some suggestions for mobility support in IPv6,
    drawing on the experiences of the authors in our work with IPv4 mobility within
    the Mobile IP Working Group of the IETF. The development of IPv6 presents a rare
    opportunity to consider in what ways mobility could explicitly be taken into account
    in the design of IPv6, and in what ways the current work on mobility within IPv4
    can or should be changed to take advantage of IPv6. We believe that the most important
    function needed to support mobility is the reliable and timely notification of
    a mobile node's current location to other nodes that need it: the home agent,
    the correspondent nodes, and its nearest router.</p>"
