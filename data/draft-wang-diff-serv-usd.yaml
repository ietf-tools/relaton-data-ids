abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, we present a new differentiated service scheme called
    ''User-Share Differentiation (USD)''. The USD scheme is based on the principle
    of link sharing. The scheme allows ISPs to differentiate traffic flows on a per-user
    basis, providing minimum bandwidth guar- antee and share-based bandwidth sharing.
    We first look at the objec- tives of differentiated services, and the problems
    with the current proposals, then present the details of the USD scheme. Finally
    we examine the implementation and standardization issues</p>"
