abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme, corresponding
    to FEC Encoding ID XXX, for the RaptorG forward error correction code and its
    application to reliable delivery of data objects. RaptorG codes are a new family
    of codes to provide superior flexibility, larger source block sizes and better
    coding efficiency than Raptor codes in RFC5053. RaptorG is also a fountain code,
    i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly
    from the source symbols of a source block of data. The decoder is able to recover
    the source block from any set of encoding symbols for most cases equal to the
    number of source symbols and in rare cases with slightly more than the number
    of source symbols. The RaptorG code described here is a systematic code, meaning
    that all the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be generated.
