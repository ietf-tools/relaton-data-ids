abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines PPSP tracker usages for REsource LOcation And
    Discovery (RELOAD). Although PPSP assumes a centralized tracker from peer's point
    of view, the logical centralized tracker could be realized by a cluster of geographically
    distributed trackers. In this draft, we design distributed trackers system, which
    are organized by RELOAD. It provides lookup service for file/channel indexes and
    Peer Status among the distributed trackers.</p>"
