abstract:
- content: "<p>This Memo defines the SKiCal format. SKiCal is a machine-readable format
    for the interchange of enhanced yellow-page directory listings. SkiCal expands
    the traditional property-set of name, address, telephone number and business category,
    adding structured information about people, places, things, activities and the
    conditions and terms for interaction with resources.SkiCal provides a structure
    for information about dates and times, directions, rules and recommendations for
    participation, pricing and reservation schemes, access information for those with
    special needs, ownership and responsibilities and promotional material. The referents
    of these listings, which are both events and persistent resources are referred
    to in this draft as SkiSources. SkiCal is based on and extends the iCalendar format
    as defined by RFC-2445, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
    [3] (iCalendar). SkiCal objects are comprised of either VEVENT components with
    the addition of new properties and property parameters, or the SkiCal specific
    VOPTIME calendar component described in this memo.</p>"
