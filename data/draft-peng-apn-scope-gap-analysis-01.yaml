abstract:
- content: "<p>The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and set of
    mechanisms to derive, convey and use an identifier to allow for the implementation
    of fine-grain user (group)-, application (group)-, and service-level requirements
    at the network layer. APN aims to apply various policies in different nodes along
    a network path onto a traffic flow altogether, that is, at the headend to steer
    into corresponding path, at the midpoint to collect corresponding performance
    measurement data, and at the service function to execute particular policies.
    Currently there is still no way to realise this composite network service provisioning
    along the path very efficiently. This document further clarifies the scope of
    the APN work and describesthe solution gap analysis.</p>"
