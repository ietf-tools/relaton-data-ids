abstract:
- content: <p>In "Multicast Virtual Private Networks" (MVPNs), customer multicast
    flows are carried in "tunnels" through a service provider's network. The base
    specifications for MVPN define BGP multicast VPN "auto-discovery" routes", and
    specify how to use an auto-discovery route to advertise the fact that an individual
    customer multicast flow is being carried in a particular tunnel. However, those
    specifications do not provide a way to specify, in a single such route, that multiple
    customer flows are being carried in a single tunnel. Those specifications also
    do not provide a way to advertise that a particular tunnel is to be used by default
    to carry all customer flows, except in the case where that tunnel is joined by
    all the provider edge routers of the MVPN. This document eliminates these restrictions
    by specifying the use of "wildcard" elements in the customer flow identifiers.
    With wildcard elements, a single auto-discovery route can refer to multiple customer
    flows, or even to all customer flows.</p>
