abstract:
- content: "<p>The Working Group Secretary's role was succinctly defined in RFC 2418.
    However, this role has greatly evolved and increased both in value and scope since
    the writing of RFC 2418. This document updates RFC 2418 by providing a new definition
    of the Working Group Secretary's role. This document also provides a compilation
    of good practices and some general guidelines regarding the fulfilment of the
    role. This document is intended for established Working Group Secretaries, individuals
    desirous of taking up that role, or anyone else simply interested in understanding
    better the Working Group Secretary's role. This document may also be useful for
    Working Group Chairs to better appreciate and help develop the value of Working
    Group Secretaries.</p>"
