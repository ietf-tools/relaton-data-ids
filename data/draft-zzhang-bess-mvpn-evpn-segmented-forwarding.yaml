abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC6513] and [RFC6514] specify MVPN Inter-AS Segmentation procedures.
    [RFC7524] specifies MVPN Inter-Area Segmentation procedures. [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-bum-procedure-updates]
    specifies EVPN BUM Inter-Region Segmentation Procedures. Several other documents
    also touch upon the segmentation topic. The forwarding at the segmentation points
    has been assumed to be label switching, subject to certain limitations. The purpose
    of this document is to provide a review of segmentation points' available forwarding
    options and limitations, and to clarify and expand some procedures.</p>"
