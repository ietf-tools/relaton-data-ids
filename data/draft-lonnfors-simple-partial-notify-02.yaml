abstract:
- content: "<p>A Presence service can have constraints for delivering presence information
    to devices with low data processing capabilities, small display, and limited battery
    power. Other limitations can be caused by the interface between the terminal and
    the network, i.e. over radio links with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo
    presents a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constrains and to
    increase efficiency, by introducing a mechanism called partial notification.</p>"
