abstract:
- content: "<p>Intelligence is required to track BGP paths throughout the various
    RIBs and VRFs of a routing platform, due to potential attribute modifications
    and the use of BGP multipath. This document introduces the option to identify
    a path within a router in order to ease correlation in monitoring. A BMPv4 TLV
    is defined in order to communicate this locally significant identifier in monitoring
    messages.</p>"
