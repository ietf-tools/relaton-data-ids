abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider with an
    IPv6 backbone may provide VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) and MVPNs (Multicast
    Virtual Private Networks) for its IPv4 customers. The IPv6 core network need only
    deploy native multicast services using Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) .
    All additional functionality described is Customer Edge (CE) based and there are
    no additional Provider (P) or Provider Edge (PE) protocols.</p>"
