abstract:
- content: "<p>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters
    that identifies an abstract or physical resource. This specification defines the
    generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in
    relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of
    URIs on the Internet. The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all
    valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI
    reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.
    This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is
    performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
