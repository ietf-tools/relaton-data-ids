abstract:
- content: "<p>Development of, and advancements in, automation of network operations
    brought new requirements for measurement methodology. Among them is the ability
    to collect instant network state as the packet being processed by the networking
    elements along its path through the domain. This document introduces a new hybrid
    measurement method, referred to as hybrid two-step, as it separates the act of
    measuring and/or calculating the performance metric from the act of collecting
    and transporting network state.</p>"
