abstract:
- content: "<p>AAA-HK [1] provides a method for a MN and an AR to establish a shared
    key using a AAA server. To ensure that the round trip to the AAA server does not
    delay handoff, the handover key must be derived independent of and well ahead
    of the actual handoff, preferably immediately after moving to a new access router.
    This document describes one such method of optimizing the handover key derivation
    by using an AR as an authenticating server, once the MN and AR have established
    a security association.</p>"
