abstract:
- content: "<p>The importance of software update as a mitigation for vulnerabilities
    discovered after deployment is widely recognised for both desktop and data centre
    applications and infrastructure. However, in the case of smaller devices, whether
    running on challenged networks or platforms or not, the situation is much worse,
    perhaps a decade or more behind that in better developed contexts. This memo proposes
    requirements for software update in situations where none is currently deployed,
    argues that that is the right target. In doing this, and perhaps somewhat in contrast
    to a vendor-driven approach, the interests of the individual device owner are
    emphasised.</p>"
