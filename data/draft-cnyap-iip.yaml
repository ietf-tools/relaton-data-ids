abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a protocol that allows any IP node to communicate
    with other IP nodes in the mobile environment without any fundamental changes
    to TCP/IP. Any mobile aware nodes are able to communicate with one another with
    standard IP routing. Mobile awareness is achieved by means of address updates
    through a query mechanism. Backward compatibility capability is supported via
    the means of one or more anchoring points that are put in place.</p>"
