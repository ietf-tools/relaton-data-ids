abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an alternative to the support for IP mobility
    compared to the solution outlined and specified in [MobIP]. As the title of the
    solution implies, it addresses the problems with the overall complexity of the
    current Mobile IP solution including some of the proposed extensions as outlined
    in [RouteOpt], [3G-IMT]. This more simplistic approach relies on two basic prerequisites:
    Development made in recent years, and also development foreseen in a near-term
    future, regarding certain key protocols and techniques for name-to-address resolution,
    directory services, address assignment, and roaming support; and also the fact
    that the solution is suited for usage within one organizational scope.</p>"
