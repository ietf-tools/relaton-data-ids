abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes requirements for internationalization (I18N)
    of filesystems specifically in the context of Internet protocols, the architecture
    for filesystems in most currently popular general purpose operating systems, and
    their implications for filesystem I18N. From the I18N requirements for filesystems
    and the architecture of running code we derive requirements and recommendations
    for implementors of operating systems and/or filesystems, as well as for Internet
    remote filesystem protocols.</p>"
