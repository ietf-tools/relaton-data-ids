abstract:
- content: <p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to bridge
    the gap between network and applications by provisioning network related information.
    This allows applications to make informed decisions, for example when selecting
    a target host from a set of candidates. The ALTO problem statement [RFC5693] considers
    typical applications as file sharing, real-time communication and live streaming
    peer-to-peer networks. Recently other use cases focused on Content Distribution
    Networks and Data Centers have emerged [draft-jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases-01].
    The present draft proposes to extend the cost information provided by the ALTO
    protocol. The purpose is to broaden the decision possibilities of applications
    to not only decide 'where' to connect to, but also 'when' to connect. This is
    useful to applications that have a degree of freedom on when to schedule data
    transfers, such as non-instantaneous data replication between data centers. The
    draft therefore specifies a new cost mode, called the "schedule" mode. In this
    mode the ALTO server offers cost maps that contain link ratings that are valid
    for a given timeframe (e.g. hourly) for a period of time (e.g. a day). Besides
    the functional time-shift enhancement providing multi-timeframe cost values the
    extansion also allows the saving of a number of ALTO transactions and thus resources
    on the ALTO server and clients.</p>
