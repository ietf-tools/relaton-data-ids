abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to support applications that require a large number of addresses
    or address space, a host may be assigned an aggregate IPv6 prefix rather than
    one or more discrete IPv6 addresses. This document briefly describes cases where
    this may occur, and specifies an extension to TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] to allow
    a client to use a single TCP Fast Open cookie for an IPv6 prefix.</p>"
