abstract:
- content: "<p>When an e-mail program generates an encrypted message to multiple recipients,
    it is possible that it has no encryption capability for at least one of the recipients.
    In this circumstance, an e-mail program may choose to send the message in cleartext
    to the recipient it cannot encrypt to. This draft currently offers several possible
    approaches when such a choice is made by the sender, so that the recipient can
    reason about and act on the cryptographic status of the message responsibly.</p>"
