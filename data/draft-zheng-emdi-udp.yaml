abstract:
- content: "<p>A Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can be used as a diagnostic
    tool or a quality indicator for monitoring flows that are sensitive to arrival
    time and packet loss is defined in [RFC4445]. This document extends the Media
    Delivery Index with a new component: Effective Loss Factor (ELF), which takes
    loss distribution into account when measuring packet loss. ELF is also applicable
    when certain Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes are used.</p>"
