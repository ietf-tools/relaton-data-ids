abstract:
- content: "<p>Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in traditional
    networks. There exist well defined recommendations for the use of appropriate
    differentiated service classes for different types of traffic (eg. audio, video)
    in these networks. Per-Hop Behaviors are typically defined based on this recommendations.
    With emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), traffic originated in a LLN,
    such as metering, command and control, may transit over a converged campus IP
    network, or even a Wide Area Network, and will share resources with traditional
    classes of traffic such as voice, video and data. It is important to have defined
    differentiated services recommendations for LLN traffic to co-exist with traditional
    class of traffic.</p>"
