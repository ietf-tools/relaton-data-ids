abstract:
- content: "<p>When a mobile device (referred to as Station (STA)) tries to connect
    to a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), it needs to first perform mutual authentication
    with the EAP server of the network. As a result of successful authentication,
    a Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated, and distributed to the STA and
    the Authenticator of the network by the EAP server respectively. The PMK is used
    for securing the subsequent communications between the STA and the Wireless Termination
    Point (WTP) it attaches to. In practice, the authenticator may not be deployed
    on the WTP. In this case, an approach is required to help the WTP to obtain the
    PMK. This work tries to discuss the issues related with this topic and proposes
    a RADIUS extension to address the problem.</p>"
