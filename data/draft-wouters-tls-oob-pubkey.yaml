abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new TLS certificate type for exchanging raw
    public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) for use with out-of-band authentication. Currently, TLS authentication
    can only occur via PKIX or OpenPGP certificates. By specifying a minimum resource
    for raw public key exchange, implementations can use alternative authentication
    methods. One such method is using DANE Resource Records secured by DNSSEC, Another
    use case is to provide authentication functionality when used with devices in
    a constrained environment that use whitelists and blacklists, as is the case with
    sensors and other embedded devices that are constrained by memory, computational,
    and communication limitations where the usage of PKIX is not feasible. The new
    certificate type specified can also be used to reduce the latency of a TLS client
    that is already in possession of a validated public key of the TLS server before
    it starts a (non-resumed) TLS handshake.</p>"
