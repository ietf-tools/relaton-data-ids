abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents current recommended practice for managing SSH
    user keys for automated access. It provides guidelines for discovering, remediating,
    and continuously managing SSH user keys and other authentication credentials.
    Various threats from poorly managed SSH keys are identified, including virus spread,
    unaudited backdoors, illegitimate access using leaked keys, lack of proper termination
    of access, use of legitimate access for unintended purposes, and accidental human
    errors. Hundreds of thousands, even over a million SSH keys authorizing access
    have been found from the IT environments of many large organizations. This is
    many times more than they have interactive users. These access-granting credentials
    have largely been ignored in identity and access management, and present a real
    risk to information security. A process is presented for discovering who has access
    to what, bringing an existing IT environment under control with respect to automated
    access and SSH keys. The process includes moving authorized keys to protected
    locations, removing unused keys, associating authorized keys with a business process
    or application and removing keys for which no valid purpose can be found, rotating
    existing keys, restricting what can be done with each authorized key, and establishing
    an approval process for new authorized keys. A process is also presented for continuous
    monitoring and controlled authorized key setup. Finally, recommendations are made
    for security policy makers for ensuring that automated access and SSH keys are
    properly addressed in an organization's security policy. Specific requirements
    are presented that address the security issues while keeping costs reasonable.
    Guidance is also provided on how to reduce operational cost while addressing the
    threats and how to use tools to automate the management process.</p>"
