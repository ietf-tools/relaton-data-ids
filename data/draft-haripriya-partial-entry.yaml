abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism to augment the LDAPv3 [RFC2251]search
    operation through an LDAP search control for sending a partial search entry to
    an LDAP client as result of a search operation in the SearchResultEntry LDAP PDU.
    This mechanism lets the LDAP client specify size and time limits to be applied
    to the server-side processing of a single SearchResultEntry. This document defines
    two LDAP controls required to support the above requirement.</p>"
