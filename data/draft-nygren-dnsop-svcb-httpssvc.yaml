abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies the "SVCB" and "HTTPSSVC" DNS resource record
    types to facilitate the lookup of information needed to make connections for origin
    resources, such as for HTTPS URLs. SVCB records allow an origin to be served from
    multiple network locations, each with associated parameters (such as transport
    protocol configuration and keying material for encrypting TLS SNI). They also
    enable aliasing of apex domains, which is not possible with CNAME. The HTTPSSVC
    DNS RR is a variation of SVCB for HTTPS and HTTP origins. By providing more information
    to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer
    potential benefits to both performance and privacy. TO BE REMOVED: This proposal
    is inspired by and based on recent DNS usage proposals such as ALTSVC, ANAME,
    and ESNIKEYS (as well as long standing desires to have SRV or a functional equivalent
    implemented for HTTP). These proposals each provide an important function but
    are potentially incompatible with each other, such as when an origin is load-balanced
    across multiple hosting providers (multi-CDN). Furthermore, these each add potential
    cases for adding additional record lookups in-addition to AAAA/A lookups. This
    design attempts to provide a unified framework that encompasses the key functionality
    of these proposals, as well as providing some extensibility for addressing similar
    future challenges. TO BE REMOVED: The specific name for this RR type is an open
    topic for discussion. "SVCB" and "HTTPSSVC" are meant as placeholders as they
    are easy to replace. Other names might include "B", "SRV2", "SVCHTTPS", "HTTPS",
    and "ALTSVC".</p>'
