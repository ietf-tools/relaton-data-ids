abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the L4S architecture, which enables Internet
    applications to achieve Low queuing Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable throughput
    (L4S). The insight on which L4S is based is that the root cause of queuing delay
    is in the congestion controllers of senders, not in the queue itself. With the
    L4S architecture _all_ Internet applications could (but do not have to) transition
    away from congestion control algorithms that cause substantial queuing delay,
    to a new class of congestion controls that induce very little queuing, aided by
    explicit congestion signaling from the network. This new class of congestion controls
    can provide low latency for capacity-seeking flows, so applications can achieve
    both high bandwidth and low latency. The architecture primarily concerns incremental
    deployment. It defines mechanisms that allow the new class of L4S congestion controls
    to coexist with 'Classic' congestion controls in a shared network. These mechanisms
    aim to ensure that the latency and throughput performance using an L4S-compliant
    congestion controller is usually much better (and never worse) than performance
    would have been using a 'Classic' congestion controller, and that competing flows
    continuing to use 'Classic' controllers are typically not impacted by the presence
    of L4S. These characteristics are important to encourage adoption of L4S congestion
    control algorithms and L4S compliant network elements. The L4S architecture consists
    of three components: network support to isolate L4S traffic from classic traffic;
    protocol features that allow network elements to identify L4S traffic; and host
    support for L4S congestion controls.</p>"
