abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a method of detecting a dead IKE peer. The method,
    called Dead Peer Detection (DPD) uses IPSec traffic patterns to limit the number
    of IKE messages sent. DPD, like other keepalive mechanisms, is often necessary
    to perform IKE peer failover, or to reclaim lost resources.</p>"
