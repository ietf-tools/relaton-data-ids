abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the
    link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain
    reachability information. This document updates [RFC4861] to allow routers to
    proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned
    to a host. It also updates [RFC4862] and recommends hosts to send unsolicited
    Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address. The proposed change
    will minimize the delay and packet loss when a host initiate connections to off-link
    destination from a new IPv6 address.</p>"
