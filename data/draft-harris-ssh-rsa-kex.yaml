abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a key-exchange method for the Secure Shell (SSH)
    protocol based on Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) public-key encryption. It uses much
    less client CPU time than the Diffie-Hellman algorithm specified as part of the
    core protocol, and hence is particularly suitable for slow client systems. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
