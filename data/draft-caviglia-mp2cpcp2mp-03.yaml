abstract:
- content: <p>During migration scenarios it may be desirable to transfer the ownership
    of a Label Switched Path (LSP) from the Management Plane (MP) to the Control Plane
    (CP), or vice versa. If the LSP is carrying traffic this change needs to be made
    "in service," that is, without affecting traffic. This memo provides minor extensions
    to the Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling protocol,
    GRSVP_TE (Generalized Resource Reservation Protocol with Traffic Engineering Extensions),
    to enable such transfer of ownership and describes the proposed procedures.</p>
