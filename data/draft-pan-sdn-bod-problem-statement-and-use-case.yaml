abstract:
- content: "<p>Bandwidth on Demand services are offered by network operators in industry
    and research sectors to support the needs of selected customers needing high bandwidth
    point-to-point connections. Without a standard interface for controlling the use
    of network resources, user applications and services are subject to limits of
    layering, security and interoperability across multiple vendors of network equipment.
    In this document, we argue the necessity in providing network information to the
    applications, thereby enabling the applications to directly provision network
    elements associated with the relevant applications.</p>"
