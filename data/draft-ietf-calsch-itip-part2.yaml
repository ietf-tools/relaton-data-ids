abstract:
- content: "<p>This set of documents, collectively called the iCalendar Transport-independent
    Interoperability Protocol, or iTIP, defines a transport-independent message protocol
    to allow for searching for busy time and the scheduling of events, journals, or
    journal entries on different calendaring and scheduling systems. These documents
    are based on earlier work documented in the iCalendar format. Because iCalendar
    delt mainly with the format of calendaring information and said so little about
    the method for conveying scheduling semantics, these documents add scheduling
    semantics to the base calendaring functionality defined in iCalendar.</p>"
