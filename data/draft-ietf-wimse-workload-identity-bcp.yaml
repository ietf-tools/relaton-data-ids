abstract:
- content: <p>The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration systems
    poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and client_secret, can
    be complex and error-prone. "Service account token volume projection", a term
    introduced by Kubernetes, provides a way of injecting JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to
    workloads. This document describes the current best practices to avoid client_secret
    provisioning and leverage platform attestation to receive access tokens from an
    OAuth 2.0 authorization server via RFC 7523.</p>
