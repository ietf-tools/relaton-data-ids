abstract:
- content: "<p>NAT-PT (Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation) mechanism
    that has been deprecated in [RFC4966] comes into spotlight again. The use-cases
    that NAT-PT addresses still need to be discussed and the requirements persist
    in IPv6 transition work. This document discusses the applicability issues when
    applying IPsec protocol to NAT-PT mechanism.</p>"
