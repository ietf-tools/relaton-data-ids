abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies methods for Real-Time Text (RTT) media handling
    in multi-party calls. The main solution is to carry Real-Time text by the RTP
    protocol in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103. The main solution for centralized
    multi-party handling of real-time text is achieved through a media control unit
    coordinating multiple RTP text streams into one RTP session. Identification for
    the streams are provided through the RTCP messages. This mechanism enables the
    receiving application to present the received real-time text medium in different
    ways according to user preferences. Some presentation related features are also
    described explaining suitable variations of transmission and presentation of text.
    Call control features are described for the SIP environment. A number of alternative
    methods for providing the multi-party negotiation, transmission and presentation
    are discussed and a recommendation for the main one is provided. Two alternative
    methods using a single RTP stream and source identification inline in the text
    stream are also described, one of them being provided as a lower functionality
    fallback method for endpoints with no multi-party awareness for RTT. Brief information
    is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC environment. EDITOR NOTE: A
    number of alternatives are specified for discussion. A decision is needed which
    alternatives are preferred and then how the preferred alternatives shall be emphasized.</p>"
