abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centralized Conferencing framework defines a model whereby client
    initiated interactions are required for creation, deletion, manipulation and querying
    the state of a of conference. This document defines a Media Control Channel Package
    for XCON client initiated Conference Control. The Package is based on the Media
    Control Channel Framework, which is also used for media server control, thus optimizing
    the implementation for some entities participating in an XCON system.</p>"
