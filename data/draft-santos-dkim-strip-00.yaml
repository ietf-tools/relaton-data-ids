abstract:
- content: <p>The DKIM base protocol has offers two digital signature canonicalization
    (cl4n) methods called "relaxed" and "simple" with low reliability and survivability
    during in-transient operations. This proposal describes a new STRIP canonicalization
    algorithm and method to increase the reliability and survivability of the digital
    signature. In additional, the proposal describe new original body hashing requirements
    to help secure STRIP c14n security concerns found in a similar but deprecated
    NOFWS c14n method.</p>
