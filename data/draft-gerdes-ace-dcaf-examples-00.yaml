abstract:
- content: <p>Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of processing
    power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints,
    commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication
    and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.
    The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF) specifies how resource-constrained
    nodes can delegate defined authentication- and authorization-related tasks to
    less-constrained devices called Authorization Managers, thus limiting the hardware
    requirements of the security solution for the constrained devices. To realize
    the vision of "one Internet for all", constrained devices need to securely establish
    trust relationships with less constrained devices. This document lists examples
    for using DCAF with less constrained devices.</p>
