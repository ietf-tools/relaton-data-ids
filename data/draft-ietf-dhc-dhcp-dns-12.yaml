abstract:
- content: "<p>DHCP provides a powerful mechanism for IP host configuration. However,
    the configuration capability provided by DHCP does not include updating DNS, and
    specifically updating the name to address and address to name mappings maintained
    in the DNS. This document specifies how DHCP clients and servers should use the
    Dynamic DNS Updates mechanism in [RFC2136] to update the DNS name to address and
    address to name mappings so that the mappings for DHCP clients will be consistent
    with the IP addresses that the clients acquire via DHCP.</p>"
