abstract:
- content: <p>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared simulations,
    are becoming increasingly used for serious work in addition to the traditional
    uses of research and entertainment. Whereas previous distributed simulation protocols
    have been designed with narrow, time-definite scope, the LESS (Live Entity State
    Stream) protocol is designed to allow open-ended join and leave for a multitude
    of simulation peers. The LESS protocol specifies how peers of a simulation collaborate
    and share state to achieve a mutually agreed "collective hallucination," leading
    to a user-perceivable shared state of a simulated worlds.</p>
