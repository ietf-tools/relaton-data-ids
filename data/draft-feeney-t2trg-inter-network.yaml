abstract:
- content: "<p>The breadth of IoT applications implies that there will be many diverse,
    administratively independent networks operating in the same physical location.
    In many cases, these networks will use unlicensed spectrum, due to its low cost
    and ease of deployment. However, this spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded.
    IoT networks will therefore be subject to wireless interference, both from similar
    networks and from networks that use the wireless channel in very different ways.
    High-density, heterogeneous wireless environments present formidable challenges
    for network coexistence. The PHY and MAC layers are primarily responsible for
    managing how radios use the channel. But higher layer protocols are also a key
    factor in inter-network interaction. To date, there have been few performance
    studies of coexistence in future IoT operating environments, particularly with
    respect to protocol behavior and network-scale interactions. This document describes
    key challenges for coexistence and highlights some recent research results that
    demonstrate the impact of protocol level interactions on network performance.
    It identifies both concrete and speculative opportunities for the IRTF T2TRG community.
    The former include developing and documenting best practices for performance evaluation
    and contributing IoT-related protocols being developed within IETF. The latter
    include speculative research into the design of high-layer protocols that allow
    networks to actively coordinate their access to the shared channel.</p>"
