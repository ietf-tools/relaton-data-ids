abstract:
- content: "<p>The DAD procedure for NCoA validation is a burden for achieving the
    fast MIPv6 handover. The existing stateless and DHCPv6-based stateful NCoA configuration
    schemes are all concerned with the DAD process at NAR. This document describes
    an NCoA address pool based stateful NCoA configuration for MIPv6 fast handover
    (FMIPv6). To reduce the DAD handling time during the handover, the NCoA pools
    are established at NAR (in the reactive stateful scheme) or PAR (in the proactive
    stateful scheme). An NCoA pool maintains a list of NCoAs already confirmed by
    the corresponding NAR. In response to a handover request, the NAR or PAR will
    allocate a confirmed NCoA to the MN. By the address pool based stateful NCoA configuration,
    the handover latency can be significantly reduced, and a tunneling for handover
    can be extended to an NCoA address, instead of NAR.</p>"
