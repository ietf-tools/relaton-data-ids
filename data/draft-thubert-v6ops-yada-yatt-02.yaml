abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a mechanism named YADA to extend the current
    IPv4 Internet by interconnecting IPv4 realms via a common footprint called the
    shaft. YADA extends [INT-ARCHI] with the support of an IP-in-IP format used to
    tunnel packets across the shaft. This document also provides a bump-in-the-stack
    method to enable YADA on a legacy stack, e.g., to enable virtual machines without
    changing them. This document also provides a stateless address and IP header translation
    between YADA and IPv6 [IPv6] called YATT and extends [IPv6-ADDRESSING] for the
    YATT format. YADA and YATT can take place as a bump in the stack at either end,
    or within the network and enables an IPv6-only stack to dialog with an IPv4-only
    stack across a network that can be IPv6, IPv4, or mixed. YATT requires that the
    IPv6 stack owns a prefix that derives from a YADA address and the IPv4 stack is
    capable of YADA, so it does not replace a generic 4 to 6 translation mechanism
    for any v6 to any v4.</p>"
