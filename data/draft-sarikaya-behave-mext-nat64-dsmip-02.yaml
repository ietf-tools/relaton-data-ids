abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies modifications required to the home agent to integrate
    NAT64 with Mobile IP so that IPv6 only mobile nodes (MN) receiving host-based
    mobility management using Dual Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6) can communicate with
    IPv4 only servers. The protocol is based on home agents maintaining a table similar
    to NAT64 and linking it to the binding cache. The changes include better keepalive
    management in order to preserve battery on the mobile node as well as multicast
    support for NAT64 integrated into the current multicast support scheme in Dual
    Stack Mobile IPv6 so that IPv6 only mobile nodes can receive multicast data from
    IPv4 only content providers.</p>"
