abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2461 [ND] describes host data forwarding and address resolution.
    However, nine years after the ND protocol became an RFC, IPv6 hosts still do not
    fully comply with RFC 2461 [ND]. In particular, hosts incorrectly implement on-
    vs. off-link data forwarding. This document clarifies host behavior and associated
    router behavior to define explicitly address resolution and data forwarding models.
    The set of new requirements beyond what has been specified in RFC 2461 [ND] and
    RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF] is restricted to clarifications deemed necessary to facilitate
    correct implementation. The intention of this document is to incorporate normative
    changes into draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2461bis-11 [NDbis] and draft-ietf-ipv6-rfc2462bis-08
    [ADDRCONFbis]. After this has been accomplished, this document will be on track
    to become an Informational RFC. Following the same model as RFC 2525 [TCPProb],
    a section of this document collects known IPv6 ND implementation problems.</p>"
