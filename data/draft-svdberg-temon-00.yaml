abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes some requirements that need to be taken into account
    when developing a measurement architecture for use in IP-traffic engineering.
    It looks at the methods for collecting measurement information and possible problems
    that might be encountered while doing so. It links the measurement requirements
    to the efforts made in other IETF-working groups and tries to state some guidelines
    for defining a formal framework to describe how measurements can be organised
    for traffic engineering purposes.</p>"
