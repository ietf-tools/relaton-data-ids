abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional model for DNS is that authoritative servers would read
    DNS data from static zone files and use that to answer DNS queries. Modern DNS
    servers do not act in this way, and their answers are created dynamically - either
    periodically or at query time. This document presents a taxonomy breaking down
    the most common and useful methods used to customize responses on the authortiative
    side, as well as a survey of implementations by current large authoritative operators.</p>"
