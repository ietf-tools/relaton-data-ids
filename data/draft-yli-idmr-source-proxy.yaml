abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces a multicast source proxy option to the IP header
    of multicast data in anticipation to improve the scalability of dense-mode multicast
    protocols. In case of many-to-many multicast applications, this option will enable
    downstream routers to aggregate (S,G) states consistently. This option will also
    allow to dynamically re-root subset of multicast distribution tree as required.
    This option will enable an MOSPF domain to function as a transit domain. For each
    aggregation source network S/mask, this option allows internal MOSPF routers to
    create a default state (S/mask, *), whose forwarding decision maps to (ASBR, *).
    All multicast data for group without internal membership will be forwarded in
    accordance with the default state.</p>"
