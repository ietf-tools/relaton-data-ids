abstract:
- content: <p>The proposed [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] defines DNS records that advertise
    the extent to which a domain employs [RFC4871] to sign [RFC2822] messages, and
    defines how other hosts can access these advertisements. Its laudable goal is
    to allow domains control over the use of the From header field. When a message
    is not adequately signed, advertised assertions, referenced by a domain in the
    From header field, assist in resolving the message's intended disposition. Rather
    than dealing with keys that impose a restriction on the "on- behalf-of" identity
    as a separate security consideration to be handled independently from an assertion
    that a domain signs their messages, [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] instead employs a flawed
    two-stage signature validation process that works in conjunction with advertised
    practices. The two-stage approach will most likely occur after message acceptance,
    and impairs the range of authentication assertions permitted by a single signature.
    The limitations on authentication assertions inhibits tactics needed to deal with
    replay abuse. As currently structured, advertised practices not only assert whether
    a signature should be expected, they also constrain the "on-behalf-of" identity
    applied by signing agents that are not otherwise so restricted by [RFC4871]. By
    constraining the "on- behalf-of" identity for all signing agents, the draft neglects
    the predominate role of the domain as a point of trust, and incorrectly assumes
    the signature is limited to supporting assertions regarding the identity of the
    author. By limiting the DKIM signature's "on- behalf-of" value to being representative
    of only the message's author, the draft goes well beyond the working group's charter
    and appears to infringe on S/MIME's and OpenPGP's role. [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] impairs
    security in other ways as well, such as the only directly actionable practice
    is defined using a term likely to negatively impact the integrity of delivery
    status. Fortunately minor changes to the definition of a compliant signature can
    remedy the impairment created, where the critical security issues are best handled
    independent of any [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] assertion.</p>
