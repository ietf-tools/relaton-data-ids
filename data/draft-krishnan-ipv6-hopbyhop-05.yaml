abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hop-by-Hop option header is a type of IPv6 extension header that
    has been defined in the IPv6 protocol specification. The contents of this header
    need to be processed by every node along the path of an IPv6 datagram.This draft
    highlights the characteristics of this extension header which make it prone to
    Denial of Service attacks and proposes solutions to minimize such attacks.</p>"
