abstract:
- content: "<p>Link Aggregation can be used as Attachment Circuit (AC) of the PWE3
    service. Link Aggregation is treated as a single interface. But changes in the
    the member interface may affect use of the aggregated link. This draft suggests
    a method to signal the status of the member interface of Link Aggregation AC to
    remote Provider Edge (PE) device. With this status information, the remote PE
    can decide to discard traffic over bandwidth, avoid congestion at local PE and
    avoid wasted bandwidth of the Packet Switched Network (PSN). This mechanism is
    required in PWE3 applications because pseudo-wires provide layer 1/layer 2 services,
    carrying traffic that may not respond to loss events by executing congestion avoidance</p>"
