abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a reference architecture for a VPLS system. It
    describes possible VPLS architectures based on this reference architecture and
    the merits of each. Each VPLS architecture is described in terms of its logical
    components and their relationship to each other, as well as the mapping of these
    logical components to physical network elements. By understanding these logical
    components, which are fundamental building blocks for any VPLS system, one can
    easily compare different VPLS architectures and understand the pros and cons of
    each. A VPLS system may support one or more of these architectures simultaneously.</p>"
