abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines OAM and traffic accounting capabilities for Preferred
    Path Routing (PPR) for IS-IS and OSPF protocols. Specifically, this document specifies
    OAM capabilities that allow to assert proper PPR connectivity and to trace PPR
    path information. In addition, a set of statistics and operational data to facilitate
    PPR traffic accounting on a per-PPR path basis are defined. This includes a number
    of Information Elements that extend IPFIX to export path information, as well
    as a YANG Data Model to be used in conjunction with management and control protocols.
    Collectively the capabilities defined in this document provide network operators
    with the necessary means to ensure proper working of their PPR deployments.</p>"
