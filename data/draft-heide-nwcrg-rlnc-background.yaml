abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)
    schemes for reliable data transport. Both block and sliding window RLNC code implementations
    are described. By providing erasure correction using randomly generated repair
    symbols, such RLNC-based schemes offer advantages in accommodating varying frame
    sizes and dynamically changing connections, reducing the need for feedback, and
    lowering the amount of state information needed at the sender and receiver. The
    practical considerations' section identifies RLNC- encoded symbol representation
    as a valuable target for standardization.</p>"
