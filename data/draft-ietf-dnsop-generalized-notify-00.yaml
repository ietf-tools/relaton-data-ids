abstract:
- content: '<p>Changes in CDS/CDNSKEY, CSYNC, and other records related to delegation
    maintenance are usually detected through scheduled scans run by the consuming
    party (e.g. top-level domain registry), incurring an uncomfortable trade-off between
    scanning cost and update latency. A similar problem exists when scheduling zone
    transfers, and has been solved using the well-known DNS NOTIFY mechanism ([RFC1996]).
    This mechanism enables a primary nameserver to proactively inform secondaries
    about zone changes, allowing the secondary to initiate an ad-hoc transfer independently
    of when the next SOA check would be due. This document extends the use of DNS
    NOTIFY beyond conventional zone transfer hints, bringing the benefits of ad-hoc
    notifications to DNS delegation maintenance in general. Use cases include DNSSEC
    key rollovers hints via NOTIFY(CDS) and NOTIFY(DNSKEY) messages, and quicker changes
    to a delegation''s NS record set via NOTIFY(CSYNC) messages. Furthermore, this
    document proposes a new DNS record type, tentatively referred to as "NOTIFY record",
    which is used to publish details about where generalized notifications should
    be sent. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify
    (https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized- notify). The
    most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available
    there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>'
