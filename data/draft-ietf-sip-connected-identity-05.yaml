abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a means for a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    User Agent (UA) that receives a dialog-forming request to supply its identity
    to the peer UA by means of a request in the reverse direction, and for that identity
    to be signed by an Authentication Service. Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming
    request (changing the value of the Request-URI), the UA that receives it (the
    User Agent Server, UAS) can have a different identity from that in the To header
    field. The same mechanism can be used to indicate a change of identity during
    a dialog, e.g., because of some action in the Public Switched Telephone Network
    (PSTN) behind a gateway. This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
