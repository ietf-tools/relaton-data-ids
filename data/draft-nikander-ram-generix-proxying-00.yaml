abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a generic way of using Forwarding Proxies, designed
    to be used as a transition mechanism in implementing various flavors of the so
    called Identifier / Locator separation, including both "above IP" and "below IP"
    approaches. This version of this draft is an very incomple version, intented to
    induce discussion.</p>
