abstract:
- content: "<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol is a critical component
    in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains. Due to
    this central nature, it is an accepted best practice to ensure basic security
    properties for BGP and BGP speaking routers. While these general principles are
    outlined in BCP194, it does not provide a list of technical and implementation
    options for securing BGP. This document lists available options for securing BGP,
    serving as a contemporary, non-exhaustive, repository of options and methods.
    The document explicitly does not make value statements on the efficacy of individual
    techniques, not does it mandate or prescribe the use of specific technique or
    implementations. Operators are advised to carefully consider whether the listed
    methods are applicable for their use-case to ensure best current practices are
    followed in terms of which security properties need to be ensured when operating
    BGP speakers. Furthermore, the listed options in this document may change over
    time, and should not be used as a timeless ground-truth of applicable or sufficient
    methods.</p>"
