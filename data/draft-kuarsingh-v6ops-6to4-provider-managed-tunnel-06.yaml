abstract:
- content: "<p>6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework which
    can help manage 6to4 [RFC3056] tunnels operating in an anycast [RFC3068] configuration.
    The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve as an option to operators to help
    improve the experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide
    sub-optimal performance or break normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT provides a stable
    provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 relays with
    an added function of IPv6 Prefix Translation. This operation may be particularly
    important in NAT444 infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned
    a non- RFC1918 address thus breaking the return path for anycast [RFC3068] based
    6to4 operation. The 6to4-PMT model has successfully been used in a production
    network and has been implemented as open source code and by a major routing vendor.</p>"
