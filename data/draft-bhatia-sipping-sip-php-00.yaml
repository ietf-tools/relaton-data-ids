abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the similarity of SIP and HTTP, many mechanisms that have been
    instrumental in the success of the World Wide Web have been replicated in SIP.
    PHP is a robust, cross-platform scripting language, which has been tailored to
    simplify and accelerate service development on the World Wide Web while empowering
    the developer with easy and yet reliable connectivity with all modern databases.
    This draft discusses the creation of SIP services using PHP.</p>"
