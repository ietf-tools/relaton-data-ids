abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the experiences creating independent implementations
    of the Babel routing protocol [RFC6126], based on the two independent implementations
    currently available. The Babel routing protocol is easy to implement, and it is
    quite feasible for someone with no prior experience with routing protocols to
    create a working implementation. The few issues that needed clarification during
    the independent implementation work are documented, with the hope of aiding others
    seeking to implement Babel.</p>"
