abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two textual conventions similar to the RowPointer
    textual convention defined in RFC2579. These two textual conventions indicate
    how the conceptual row to which an object points is to be handled when the object
    is cloned to create an instance- specific configuration. This cloning may involve
    the scripting-based techniques defined under the SMNP Configuration umbrella,
    but it need not: cloning can also be realized with ordinary SNMP Get and Set operations.</p>"
