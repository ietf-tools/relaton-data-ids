abstract:
- content: "<p>Consider a service provider network that offers Optical Virtual Private
    Network (OVPN) service. An important goal in the OVPN service is the ability to
    support what is known as _single end provisioning_, where addition of a new port
    to a given OVPN would involve configuration/provisioning changes only on the devices
    connected to that port. Another important goal in the OVPN service is the ability
    to establish/terminate an optical connection between a pair of (existing) ports
    within an OVPN without involving configuration/provisioning changes in any of
    the provider devices. In this document we describe a set of mechanisms that accomplishes
    these goals.</p>"
