abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a new network quality framework named Quality
    of Outcome (QoO). The QoO framework is unique among network quality frameworks
    in satisfying all the requirements layed out in "Requirements for a Network Quality
    Framework Useful for Applications, Users and Operators". The framework proposes
    a way of sampling network quality, setting network quality requirements and a
    formula for calculating the probability for the sampled network to satisfy network
    requirements.</p>
