abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings of
    a stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packet markings that
    correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based on a higher-rate. It may be
    applied in the PCN context to convert marked admissible-rate-overload into marked
    supportable-rate- overload. This allows to perform marked flow termination when
    packets are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.</p>"
