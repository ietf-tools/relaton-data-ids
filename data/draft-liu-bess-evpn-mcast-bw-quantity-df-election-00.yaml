abstract:
- content: "<p>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN, RFC7432) is becoming prevalent
    in Data Centers, Data Center Interconnect (DCI) and Service Provider VPN applications.
    When multi-homing from a CE to multiple PEs, including links in an EVPN instance
    on a given Ethernet Segment, in an all-active redundancy mode, [RFC7432] describes
    a basic mechanism to elect a Designated Forwarder (DF), and [I-D.ietf-bess- evpn-df-election-framework]
    improves basic DF election by a HRW algorithm. [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-per-mcast-flow-df-election]
    enhances the HRW algorithm for the multicast flows to perform DF election at the
    granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow). This document specifies a new algorithm,
    based on multicast bandwidth utilization and multicast state quantity, in order
    for the multicast flows to elect a DF.</p>"
