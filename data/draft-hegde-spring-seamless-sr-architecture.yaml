abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to operate networks with large numbers of devices, network
    operators organize networks into multiple smaller network domains. Each network
    domain typically runs an IGP which has complete visibility within its own domain,
    but limited visibility outside of its domain. Seamless Segment Routing (Seamless
    SR) provides flexible, scalable and reliable end-to-end connectivity for services
    across independent network domains. Seamless SR accommodates domains using SR,
    LDP, and RSVP for MPLS label distribution as well as domains running IP without
    MPLS (IP-Fabric).It also provides seamless connectivity across domains having
    different IPv6 technologies such as SRv6 and SRm6.</p>"
