abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an architectural framework for network telemetry
    to address the current and future network operation challenges and requirements.
    As evidenced by the defining characteristics and industry practice, network telemetry
    covers technologies and protocols beyond the conventional network Operations,
    Administration, and Management (OAM). Network telemetry promises better flexibility,
    scalability, accuracy, coverage, and performance and allows automated control
    loops to suit both today's and tomorrow's network operation requirements. This
    document clarifies the terminologies and classifies the modules and components
    of a network telemetry system. The framework and taxonomy help to set a common
    ground for the collection of related work and provide guidance for future technique
    and standard developments.</p>"
