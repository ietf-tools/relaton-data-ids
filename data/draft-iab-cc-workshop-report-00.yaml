abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a summary of the IAB/IRTF Workshop on 'Congestion
    Control for Interactive Real-Time Communication', which took place in Vancouver,
    Canada, on July 28, 2012. The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion
    on congestion control mechanisms for interactive real-time communication. This
    report summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) community. The views and positions in this report are those
    of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions
    of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) or the Internet Research
    Task Force (IRTF).</p>"
