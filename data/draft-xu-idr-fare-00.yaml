abstract:
- content: "<p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have become increasingly
    popular in recent years due to their impressive performance in various natural
    language processing tasks. These models are built by training deep neural networks
    on massive amounts of text data, often consisting of billions or even trillions
    of parameters. However, the training process for these models can be extremely
    resource- intensive, requiring the deployment of thousands or even tens of thousands
    of GPUs in a single AI training cluster. Therefore, three- stage or even five-stage
    CLOS networks are commonly adopted for AI networks. The non-blocking nature of
    the network become increasingly critical for large-scale AI models. Therefore,
    adaptive routing is necessary to dynamically load balance traffic to the same
    destination over multiple ECMP paths, based on network capacity and even congestion
    information along those paths.</p>"
