abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing remote network monitoring (RMON) devices for use
    on high speed networks. This document contains a MIB Module that defines these
    new objects and also contains definitions of some updated objects from the RMON-MIB
    in RFC 2819 and the RMON2-MIB in RFC 2021. [PROPOSED STANDARD]</p>"
