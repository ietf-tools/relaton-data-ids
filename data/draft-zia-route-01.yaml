abstract:
- content: "<p>The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport
    protocol (ROUTE protocol) is specified for robust delivery of Application Objects,
    including Application Objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers
    over a unidirectional transport. Application Objects consist of data that has
    meaning to applications that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers,
    for example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment, a WAV audio clip, etc.
    The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency streaming applications. The ROUTE
    protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast transport. Therefore,
    it can be run over IP/UDP including multicast IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage
    the features of the underlying protocol layer, e.g. to provide security it can
    leverage IP security protocols such as IPSec. This document specifies the ROUTE
    protocol such that it could be used by a variety of applications for delivery
    of Application Objects by specifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g.
    by adding or constraining some features).</p>"
