abstract:
- content: "<p>Both Nagle mode and delayed ACKs attempt to conserve network and host
    machine resources by delaying transmissions in the expectation that the current
    material can be piggybacked onto a future transmission. Unfortunately when both
    mechanisms are active at the same time on either end of a connection a deadlock
    can exist, which is broken by arrival of new data for transmission or firing of
    the delayed ACK timer. This produces classical timer based ACKing, which for the
    common 200ms ACK delay yields five exchanges per second.</p>"
