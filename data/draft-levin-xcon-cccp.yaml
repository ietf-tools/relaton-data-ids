abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Centralized Conferencing Control Protocol (CCCP)
    as a part of the XCON Working Group protocols suite. CCCP uses a client-server
    model for creation, querying, and manipulation of XCON entities, conference objects
    and sub-objects. An XCON entity, which implements a CCCP server, provides a means
    for authorized CCCP clients (e.g. conference participants) to affect the behavior
    of a conference in the XCON system.</p>"
