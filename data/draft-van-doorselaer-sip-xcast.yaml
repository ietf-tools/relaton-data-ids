abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Multicast (xcast) is a multicast scheme that uses an explicit
    list of destinations instead of one logical multicast address. Explicit Multicast
    complements the existing multicast schemes in that it can efficiently support
    very large numbers of distinct (small) multicast groups and thus can play an important
    role in making multicast practical for applications such as multiparty IP telephony,
    various conferencing &amp; collaborative applications, multiparty networked games,
    etc... This document explains how multiparty IP telephony conferences making use
    of xcast can be established by SIP carrying SDP. Some open issues will be identified
    and discussed. Possible extensions to SIP and SDP to streamline the use of xcast
    will be suggested as well.</p>"
