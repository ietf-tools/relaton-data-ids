abstract:
- content: "<p>Many services that SIP is anticipated to support require the ability
    to determine why and how the call arrived at a specific application. Examples
    of such services include (but are not limited to) sessions initiated to call centers
    via 'click to talk' SIP URLs on a web page, 'call history/logging' style services
    within intelligent 'call management' software for SIP UAs and calls to voicemail
    servers and call centers. While SIP implicitly provides the redirect/retarget
    capabilities that enable calls to be routed to chosen applications, there is currently
    no standard mechanism within SIP for communicating the history of such a request.
    This 'request history' information allows the receiving application to determine
    hints about how and why the call arrived at the application/user. This draft discusses
    the motivations in support of a mechanism for recording the 'request history',
    and proposes detailed requirements for such a generic 'request history' capability.</p>"
