abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an alternative to XCAP (XML Configuration Access
    Protocol) for manipulating SIMPLE resource and authorization lists using WebDAV.
    XCAP and WebDAV are similar in that they are both usages of HTTP. Since servers
    could support both simultaneously, WebDAV support is a logical progression from
    XCAP for clients that require locking, version control, document moves or other
    features of WebDAV.</p>"
