abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol for use between media devices and
    their controllers. The scope of such media devices includes voice, video and data
    applications. This work started with the decomposition of gateways into functional
    elements, viz. media gateway controller, media gateway and signaling gateway.
    A protocol is needed to allow media gateway controllers and media gateways to
    communicate. Since then the scope has been broadened to the control of media devices
    that do not have a gateway function, such as IVR systems, multipoint processors,
    etc. A model is introduced to describe the functionality of media devices and
    the various operations on that model are described.</p>"
