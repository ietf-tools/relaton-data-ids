abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two algorithms, for source address selection
    and for destination address selection. The algorithms specify default behavior
    for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations. They do not override
    choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the
    development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection. The two algorithms
    share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators
    to provide policy that can override the default behavior. In dual stack implementations,
    the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    - depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6
    addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice-versa. All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts
    and routers, must implement default address selection as defined in this specification.
