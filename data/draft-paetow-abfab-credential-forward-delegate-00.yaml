abstract:
- content: "<p>A core use case of ABFAB-based authentication is access to remote systems.
    In this and other use cases it is preferable that the same identity initially
    used to gain access to the remote system is used for further authentication sessions
    from the initial system onwards. The current architecture and UI considerations
    require the use of secure storage local to the system for any identities from
    that system onwards. This document aims to explore alternate proposals for the
    reuse of an identity configured on the initial ABFAB-enabled client device by
    the use of credential forwarding or delegation in a similar fashion to those used
    by other GSS-API mechanisms.</p>"
