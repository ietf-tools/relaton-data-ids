abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft documents preliminary results of measuring the power consumption
    of using IPv6 vs using IPv4 on typical applications on a smartphone. The smartphone
    is connected on a 4G cellular network with either an IPv6 connection, or with
    an IPv4 connection, but not both simultaneously. The preliminary results expose
    a roughly 5% increase in power consumption on IPv6. More experiments are planned
    as future work that may confirm or infirm these figures.</p>"
