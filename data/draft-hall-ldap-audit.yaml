abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an LDAP auxiliary object class and a single attribute,
    which together can be used to store and track the entities who may have accessed
    or modified a specific entry in an LDAP directory information tree. For example,
    an LDAP application may need to store information which can indicate when an entry
    was created, when it was accessed, who modified it, and other kinds of similar
    information, with this information acting as a general- purpose auditing log for
    that entry. The object class and attributes defined herein are designed for that
    purpose in particular, and are not intended to serve as detailed auditing information
    capable of withstanding court-of-law scrutiny, nor are they designed to be used
    for journaling-playback purposes. They are simply to be used for storing general
    information about the changes which have been made to a specific entry.</p>"
