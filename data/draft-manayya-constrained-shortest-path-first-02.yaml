abstract:
- content: "<p>Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) is an advanced version of shortest
    path algorithms used in OSPF and IS-IS route computations. It is used in computing
    shortest path for label-switched paths (LSPs) based upon multiple constraints.
    While computing path for LSPs it considers topology of network, attributes of
    LSP and links. The path is computed using traffic engineering database which takes
    the extensions of OSPF(open shortest path first) and IS-IS (Intermediate system
    to Intermediate system) as input.</p>"
