abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide
    guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set
    of candidates, which are able to provide the desired resource. Now the members
    in alto group propose many solutions, such as P4P and PROXIDOR. These solutions
    still have unsolved problems regarding privacy and workload. The privacy and load
    issues are crucial aspects for the benefits of ISP and P2P.This draft is to do
    a comparative study to analyze and compare the privacy and workload of several
    existing solutions, hence to provide guidance in order to improve, optimize and
    deploy the protocol.</p>"
