abstract:
- content: "<p>BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) is perfectly suited for real-time consumption
    but less ideal in stream processing and off-wire historical scenarios. The main
    issue is that the ability to correctly parse BGP Update PDUs, carried in BMP Route
    Monitoring messages, depends on the BGP Capabilities exchanged during the establishment
    of the BGP session between the peers via BGP Open PDUs. The BGP Open PDUs, carried
    in BMP Peer Up Notification messages, are exported at the establishment of the
    BMP session. Similar to BGP, BMP sessions are typically long-lived, so the crucial
    information to correctly parse subsequent messages of such sessions was possibly
    sent a relatively long time ago (days, weeks, months). This document introduces
    the concept of Summaries. It defines a new optional BMP message type, called State
    Summary, and a new TLV, called Summary Id. A Summary is similar to the initial
    synchronisation performed upon establishment of the BMP session: all BGP session
    information is exported in Peer Up Notification messages, and all RIB contents
    are exported in Route Monitoring messages. All the messages carry the new Summary
    Id TLV, containing an ID uniquely identifying the summary these messages belong
    to. The messages are preceded by a State Summary message carrying the same Summary
    Id TLV, as well as meta-data describing the Summary.</p>"
