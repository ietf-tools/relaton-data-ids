abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents an additional architectural option for control
    of packet over optical networks by extending and complementing the IETF draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable
    and by introducing an additional approach for control of optical plugs in packet
    devices. It provides the direct read/write access of coherent plugs to the optical
    controller, thereby allowing the end-to-end optical service management. The approach,
    introduced in this draft, can be further generalized to support other uses cases.
    The architectural option for control of packet over optical networks, introduced
    by this draft, also provides a clear separation between control of packet functions
    and control of optical functions. The packet and optical controls are partitioned
    so that the functions specializing in control of the optical capabilities can
    control corresponding functions in packet devices, optical devices or both without
    interfering with packet control functions.</p>"
