abstract:
- content: "<p>Today's Internet is a product of its history. TCP is the main transport
    protocol responsible for sharing out bandwidth and preventing a recurrence of
    congestion collapse while packet drop is the primary signal of congestion at bottlenecks.
    Since packet drop (and increased delay) impacts all their customers negatively,
    network operators would like to be able to distinguish between overly aggressive
    congestion control and a confluence of many low-bandwidth, low-impact flows. But
    they are unable to see the actual congestion signal and thus, they have to implement
    bandwidth and/or usage limits based on the only information they can see or measure
    (the contents of the packet headers and the rate of the traffic). Such measures
    don't solve the packet-drop problems effectively and are leading to calls for
    government regulation (which also won't solve the problem). We propose congestion
    exposure as a possible solution. This allows packets to carry an accurate prediction
    of the congestion they expect to cause downstream thus allowing it to be visible
    to ISPs and network operators. This memo sets out the motivations for congestion
    exposure and introduces a strawman protocol designed to achieve congestion exposure.</p>"
