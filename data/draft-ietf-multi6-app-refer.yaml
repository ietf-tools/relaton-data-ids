abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to fully solve the scalable multihoming problem there is a
    need to separate the current IP address functionality into identifiers (which
    are used to identify e.g., TCP connections) and locators which are used to forward
    packets in the routing system. Such a separation has an impact on the current
    use of IP address in the application layer. This document presents these issues
    for the purposes of stimulating discussions.</p>"
