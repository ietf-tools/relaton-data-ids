abstract:
- content: "<p>As networking technology has evolved, a diverse set of technologies
    has been deployed to manage the resulting products. These very from Web based
    products, standard management protocols, and text scripts. The underlying systems
    to be manipulated are represented in varying ways including implicitly in the
    programmatics, with proprietary data descriptions, or with standardized descriptions
    using a range of technologies including MIBs, PIBs, or LDAP schemas. The result
    is that a single application such as DHCP or Differentiated Services may be represented
    in many different inconsistent fashions. Even the existing standard descriptive
    technologies have not been focussed on re-use across domains and commonality.
    The situation would be significantly improved if there were to be a common representation
    of data (an 'information model') from which technology-specific data models can
    be derived to suit application- specific configuration and management needs. This
    would allow the industry to build common descriptions, resulting in consistency
    across the paradigms, and better interoperability. Such an 'information model'
    would also assist other IETF working groups by reducing the work needed to determine
    how to represent those parts of their technology that are already in the common
    model.</p>"
