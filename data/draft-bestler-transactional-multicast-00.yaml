abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents techniques for controlling the membership of multicast
    groups which are constrained to be a subset of a pre- existing multicast group,
    where such subset groups are only used for short duration transactions which are
    multicast to a subset of the larger multicast group. Further the memberships of
    these transactional groups is pushed by the sender rather than being pulled by
    the receiver. These groups could be called Transactional Subset Push Multicast
    Groups, but that label would be a bit long.</p>"
