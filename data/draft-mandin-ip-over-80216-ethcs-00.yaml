abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo we describe a simple scheme for configuration and provisioning
    of an 802.16 network so that it emulates a broadcast network that uses the 802.3
    packet format. We briefly describe how this network supports IPv4 and IPv6 services
    in a manner similar to other broadcast media (eg. ethernet). Finally, we review
    some architectural issues behind the choice of broadcast network emulation and
    examine alternative approaches to supporting IP over 802.16. We additionally describe
    some possible system optimizations to reduce consumption of air resources.</p>"
