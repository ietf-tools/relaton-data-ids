abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined in
    RFC 862. However that document does not match current Internet Standards and specifies
    Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while a number of other transport-layer protocols
    have appeared since the time of publication of RFC 862. This document aligns Echo
    protocol specification with the current Internet Standards and specifies Echo
    protocol for the most wide- spread transport-layer protocols. It obsoletes RFC
    347 and RFC 862 and moves the last to Historic status.</p>"
