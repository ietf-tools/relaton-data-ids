abstract:
- content: "<p>In an EVPN or any other VPN deployment, there is an urgent need to
    tailor the reachability checks of the client nodes via off-box tools which can
    be triggered from a remote Overlay end-point or a centralized controller and also
    customize check if the knowledge known is partial or incomplete. This document
    aims to address the limitation in current standards for doing so and provides
    solution which can be made standards in future. As an additional requirement,
    in network border routers, there are liaison/dummy VRFs created to leak routes
    from one network/fabric to another. There are scenarios wherein an explicit reachability
    check for these type of VRFs is not possible with existing mpls-ping mechanisms.
    This draft intends to address this as well.</p>"
