abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>There are a number of IETF drafts that describe use of RADIUS
    in a \nvariety of scenarios.  However, in the context of Public Wireless \nLAN
    (PWLAN) deployments, there are still some areas where either \nuse of RADIUS is
    unclear or not covered. To address this problem, \nwe first need to generate a
    list of RADIUS issues significant to \npublic wireless LAN roaming (authenticating
    and obtaining service \non a network operated by or affiliated with a home provider’s
    \n'roaming partner').  Once these issues are understood and \nanalyzed, we can
    take appropriate actions to solve them.  This \ndocument describes some of RADIUS
    issues encountered in PWLAN \ndeployments and roaming scenarios.\n\t </p>\n      "
