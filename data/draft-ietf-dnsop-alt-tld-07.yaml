abstract:
- content: '<p>This document reserves a string (ALT) to be used as a TLD label in
    non-DNS contexts, or for names that have no meaning in a global context. It also
    provides advice and guidance to developers developing alternate namespaces. [Ed
    note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers
    to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc. They will be removed before
    publication.This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-
    wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld. The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc
    should all be available here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. NOTE:
    This document is currently a parked WG document -- as such, all changes are being
    handled in GitHub and a new version will be posted once unparked. It had been
    suggested (off-list) that the draft should contain &lt;TBD&gt; instead of .ALT,
    and then make the WG choose a string before publication. A version of the draft
    like this was published on GitHub (https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld/
    tree/7988fcf06100f7a17f21e6993b781690b5774472) (and generated no feedback). This
    version reverts to .ALT -- the chairs stated that the document was adopted with
    the string .alt, it has been discussed as .alt. IMO, it is more readable as .alt;
    it would also be a difficult consensus call, boiling down to beauty contests.
    If the WG selects a different string ("not-dns" had been suggested in the past),
    the editors will, of course, replace it. ]</p>'
