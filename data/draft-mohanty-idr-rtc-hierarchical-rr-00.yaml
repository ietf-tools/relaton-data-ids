abstract:
- content: <p>Route Target Constraints (RTC) is used to build a VPN route distribution
    graph such that routers only receive VPN routes corresponding to specified route-targets
    (RT) that they are interested in. This is done by exchanging the route-targets
    as routes in the RTC address-family and a corresponding "RT filter" is installed
    that influences the VPN route advertisement. In networks employing hierarchical
    Route Reflectors (RR) the use of RTC can lead to incorrect VPN route distribution
    and loss in connectivity as detailed in an earlier draft. Two solutions were provided
    to overcome the problem. This draft presents a method with suggested modifications
    to the RTC RFC in order to solve the hierarchical RR RTC problem in an efficient
    manner.</p>
