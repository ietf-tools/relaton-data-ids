abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the format and content of bitmap, cursor and
    icon images as are commonly used under the Graphical User Interface used on Personal
    Computers which is sold under the trade name of 'Microsoft Windows'. They are
    defined here in order to add three new MIME specifications for bitmaps and for
    icon files when these documents are transported by E-mail, because the format
    used by those files as described by this document is device independent, and thus
    should be usable by other Graphical User Interfaces. There is an RFC (0797) defining
    bitmaps, but it is deficient for covering bitmaps containing color, or for Icons
    or Cursors, which can be transparent or inverse colored to the background they
    are placed against. Suggestions on topics this document could cover if it becomes
    issued as an Internet RFC, in addition to corrections or oversights, are invited,
    as well as points that need to be covered for RFCs which are pending at the time
    this document is issued.</p>"
