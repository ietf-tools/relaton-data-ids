abstract:
- content: "<p>6lowpan applications sometimes need to include application-specific
    information in layer 2 packets that are intended to be processed as 6lowpan packets.
    This document specifies a way to include this information in a 6lowpan packet
    in such a way that it can be ignored by implementations that don't care for it.
