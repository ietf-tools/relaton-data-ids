abstract:
- content: "<p>The TRILL protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL
    switches, both point-to-point and broadcast links, and supports Ethernet links
    between edge TRILL switches and end stations. Communications links are constantly
    under attack by criminals and national intelligence agencies as discussed in RFC
    7258. Link security is an important element of security in depth, particularly
    for links that are not entirely under the physical control of the TRILL network
    operator or that include device which may have been compromised. This document
    specifies link security recommendations for TRILL over Ethernet, PPP, and pseudowire
    links. It updates RFC 6325, RFC 6361, and RFC 7173. It requires that link encryption
    MUST be implemented and that all TRILL Data packets between TRILL switch ports
    capable of encryption at line speed MUST default to being encrypted. [This is
    a early partial draft.]</p>"
