abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a way to perform simultaneous Mobile-IPv4 handoff
    and 802.11 Access Point Association/Reassociation. Mobile-IPv4 Registration messages
    are carried as Information Elements in 802.11 frames. This way Mobile-IPv4 can
    perform handoff at the same time as 802.11 handoffs. The Foreign Agent can be
    a part of the Access Point or may serve a number of Access Points. The implications
    to existing mobility entities such as Access Point, Mobile Node, and Foreign Agent
    are disccussed. Also pointed out are potential issues with 802.1x and the emerging
    802.11i standards.</p>"
