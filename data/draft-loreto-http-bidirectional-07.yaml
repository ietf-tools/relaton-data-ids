abstract:
- content: '<p>On today''s Internet, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is often
    used (some would say abused) to enable asynchronous, "server- initiated" communication
    from a server to a client as well as communication from a client to a server.
    This document describes known issues and best practices related to such "bidirectional
    HTTP" applications, focusing on the two most common mechanisms: HTTP long polling
    and HTTP streaming. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;
    it is published for informational purposes.</p>'
