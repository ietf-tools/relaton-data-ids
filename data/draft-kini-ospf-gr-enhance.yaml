abstract:
- content: "<p>Reliability is a fundamental concern for the network. As a solution
    to improve network stability, the non-stop forwarding paradigm depends on protocol
    recovery based on graceful restart techniques. One of the proposed graceful restart
    techniques for [OSPF], a widely deployed IGP, is described in [OSPF-GR]. This
    technique has a limitation of not being backward compatible, in the sense that
    if a neighbor does not support the helper mode described in [OSPF-GR], the graceful-restart
    procedure will fail (i.e., revert to normal restart). For large multi-vendor networks,
    this scenario is fairly common. In this draft, we describe techniques that can
    achieve OSPF graceful restart even if a neighboring router does not support the
    helper-mode of [OSPF-GR].</p>"
