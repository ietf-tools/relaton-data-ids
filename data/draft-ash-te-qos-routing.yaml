abstract:
- content: "<p>The draft describes, analyzes, and recommends traffic engineering (TE)
    methods which control a network's response to traffic demands and other stimuli,
    such as link failures or node failures. These TE methods include: *traffic management
    through control of routing functions, which include call routing (number/name
    translation to routing address), connection routing, QoS resource management,
    routing table management, and dynamic transport routing. *capacity management
    through control of network design. *TE operational requirements for traffic management
    and capacity management, including forecasting, performance monitoring, and short-term
    network adjustment. These TE methods are recommended for application across network
    types based on established practice and experience.</p>"
