abstract:
- content: "<p>When Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is deployed in commercial network, a mobile
    node needs AAA services for authentication, authorization and accounting. MIPv6,
    however, does not provide any mean to authenticate mobile nodes that are roaming
    in different domains, although visited networks will need to check whether access
    of mobile nodes should be authorized or not. Hence schemes which support both
    AAA services and mobility have been emerged. These schemes enable access of the
    mobile node to be authorized by visited networks through AAA as well as to perform
    a home registration during AAA procedure. However, they introduce lots of signal
    messages and long handover latency during handover, since Route Optimization mode
    for MIPv6 is performed using Return Routability procedure. Especially, the long
    handover latency is a critical problem in real-time communication such as voice
    over IP (VoIP). To solve these problems, we propose an optimized scheme which
    performs Route Optimization mode using the AAA infrastructure between the home
    agent and a correspondent node instead of Return Routability procedure.</p>"
