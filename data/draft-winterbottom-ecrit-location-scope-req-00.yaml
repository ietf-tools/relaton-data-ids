    and validated within a specific operating domain. An example of such a service
    is the emergency services network, where the location of a caller is known with
    in the domain of the telephone network, while the name or true identity of the
    caller is not intrinsically known. This paper describes the entities and key requirements
    necessary to provide such a service in an internet environment.</p>"
