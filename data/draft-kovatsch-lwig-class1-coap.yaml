abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is designed for resource-constrained
    nodes and networks, e.g., sensor nodes in low-power lossy networks (LLNs). Still,
    to implement this Internet protocol on Class 1 devices, i.e., ~10KiB of RAM and
    ~100KiB of ROM, light-weight implementation techniques are necessary. This document
    provides the lessons learned from implementing CoAP for Contiki, an operating
    system for tiny, battery-operated networked embedded systems. The information
    may become part of the Light-Weight Implementation Guidance document planned by
    the IETF working group LWIG.</p>"
