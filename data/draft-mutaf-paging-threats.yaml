abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an analysis of threats that arise from using link
    layer paging technologies or IP paging in the Internet where denial-of-service
    attacks are common and easy. These problems fall in the scope of IP paging, since
    link layer paging technologies do not have provisions for repelling such threats
    and the source of an attack may be anywhere in the Internet. In addition, vulnerabilities
    that may be added by IP paging are also discussed.</p>"
