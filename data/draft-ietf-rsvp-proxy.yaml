abstract:
- content: "<p>RSVP has been extended in several directions [POLICY], [RSVP-APPID],
    [DCLASS], [AGGRRSVP], [RSVPDIFF]. These extensions have broadened the applicability
    of RSVP characterizing it as a signaling protocol usable both inside and outside
    the Integrated Services [INTSERV] model. With the addition of the 'Null Service
    Type' [NULLSERV], RSVP is also being adopted by mission critical applications
    that require some form of prioritized service, but cannot quantify their resource
    requirements. In cases where RSVP cannot travel end-to-end, these applications
    may still benefit from reservations that are not truly end-to-end, but that are
    'proxied' by a network node on the data path between the sender and the receiver(s).
    RSVP Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing (not to the
    protocol itself) in which an intermediate network node originates the Resv message
    on behalf of the receiver(s) identified by the Path message.</p>"
