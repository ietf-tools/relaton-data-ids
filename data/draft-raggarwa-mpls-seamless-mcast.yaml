abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures for building inter-area point-to-
    multipoint (P2MP) segmented service LSPs by partitioning such LSPs into intra-area
    segments and using BGP as the inter-area routing and label distribution protocol.
    Within each IGP area the intra-area segments are either carried over intra-area
    P2MP LSPs, using P2MP LSP hierarchy, or instantiated using ingress replication.
    The intra-area P2MP LSPs may be signaled using P2MP RSVP-TE or P2MP mLDP. If ingress
    replication is used in an IGP area then MP2P LDP LSPs or P2P RSVP-TE LSPs may
    be used in the IGP area. The applications/services that use such an inter-area
    service LSP may be BGP MVPN, VPLS multicast or Internet multicast over MPLS.</p>"
