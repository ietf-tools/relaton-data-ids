abstract:
- content: <p>The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work is extending
    GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet LSPs. IEEE Ethernet Connectivity
    Fault Management (CFM) specifies an adjunct OAM flow to check connectivity in
    Ethernet networks. CFM can be also used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection
    and triggering recovery mechanisms. The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM
    and specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance Monitoring, for
    Ethernet networks. This document specifies extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE to support
    the setup of the associated Ethernet OAM (CFM and Y.1731) entities adding a technology
    specific TLV to [OAM-CONF-FWK].Changes from previous version Technology independent
    extensions were moved to a separate framework document leaving only the Ethernet
    specific extensions in this document.Requirements Language The key words "MUST",
    "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in</p>
