abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Dynamic Virtual Network Engine (DVNE) protocol.
    The DVNE protocol is a signaling protocol between a virtual network node (the
    DVNE Client) and a configuration server (the DVNE Mediator). The DVNE protocol
    is used to authenticate the nodes in a Virtual Network and assist them to setup
    and release VPN connections directly among themselves. A DVNE clients can be located
    anywhere in a private or public network, directly connected or behind one or more
    levels of NAT. The DVNE protocol performs client authentication, peer discovery,
    virtual network address management, and provides all parameters necessary to enable
    the clients setup a secure VPN connection. The protocol does not explicitly setup
    the VPN connection itself. It only enables the clients to be able to directly
    setup the VPN connection themselves.</p>"
