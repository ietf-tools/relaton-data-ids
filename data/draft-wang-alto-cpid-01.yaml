abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol
    is to provide guidance to applications which have to select one or several hosts
    from a set of candidates, all of which are able to provide the desired resource.
    The goal of the mechanisms specified in this document is to extend the existing
    solution, and provide basic attributes to each end terminal to make it network-
    aware. These mechanisms introduce a way to directly transfer the guidance or costs
    using Network Location identifiers/PIDs, called CPIDs. And the exisiting The proposed
    solution inherits the existing solution's architecture, messages, and other mechanisms.
    It can be used as an independent solution or function together with other functions
    in the existing solution to provide guidance for different client and balance
    the workload on the server. Additional details for the process will be provided
    in the next version of the draft.</p>"
