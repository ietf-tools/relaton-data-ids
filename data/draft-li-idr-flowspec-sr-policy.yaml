abstract:
- content: "<p>Flowspec, an extension to BGP, enables the dissemination of traffic
    flow specification rules and can be used to steer traffic into SR Policy. However,
    existing approaches using Flowspec to direct traffic into a SR Policy have certain
    drawbacks (for details, refer to section 1). This document difines two new standard
    actions for the BGP Flowspec V2 protocol (FSv2) [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-v2]: Redirect
    to SR Policy Action and SRv6 SID Action. The former allows traffic to be directed
    to a designated SR Policy, while the latter allows for the encapsulation of an
    additional SRv6 SID as required during redirection. The Redirect to SR Policy
    Action can be used independently or in conjunction with the SRv6 SID Action, depending
    on the application scenario. Additionally, the SRv6 SID Action can be used together
    with other actions defined in FSv2, such as Redirect to IPv6.</p>"
