abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an extension to the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) that allows an SCTP endpoint to signal to its peer that it should
    move the cumulative ack point forward. When both sides of an SCTP association
    support this extension, it can be used by an SCTP implementation to provide partially
    reliable data transmission service to an upper layer protocol. This memo describes
    the protocol extensions, which consist of a new parameter for INIT and INIT ACK,
    and a new FORWARD TSN chunk type, and provides one example of a partially reliable
    service that can be provided to the upper layer via this mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
