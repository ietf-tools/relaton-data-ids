abstract:
- content: "<p>As currently designed and implemented, the RPC-over-RDMA protocol requires
    use of multiple internode round trips to process many common operations. For example,
    NFS READ or WRITE operations require use of three internode round trips. This
    document looks at this issue and discusses what can and what should be done to
    address it, both within the context of an extensible version of RPC-over-RDMA
    and possibly outside that framework.</p>"
