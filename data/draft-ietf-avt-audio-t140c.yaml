abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes how to carry real-time text conversation session
    contents in RTP packets. Text conversation session contents are specified in ITU-T
    Recommendation T.140. One payload format is described for transmitting audio and
    text data within a single RTP session. This RTP payload description recommends
    a method to include redundant text from already transmitted packets in order to
    reduce the risk of text loss caused by packet loss. This memo defines a Historic
    Document for the Internet community.</p>"
