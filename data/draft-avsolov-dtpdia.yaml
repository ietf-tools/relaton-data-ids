    in distributed information measurement systems (IMS) at any stage of communication.
    It was designed for transmission of measured data from measuring devices to processing
    and storing equipment. Also it does support common device identification in distributed
    IMS. Due to its simplicity it can be easily implemented in firmware of any digital
    measuring device.</p>"
