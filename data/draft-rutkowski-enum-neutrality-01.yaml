abstract:
- content: "<p>The pursuit by major national Administrations of declared policies
    of ENUM technical and administrative neutrality among implementations in the marketplace
    suggest the need for a framework for such neutrality and a focus on interworking
    among them. [1] [2] This document draws upon the ENUM Working Group archive of
    discussions as well as public activities in other standards forums and the marketplace
    to construct an ENUM options framework for facilitating neutrality. This framework
    includes not only protocol considerations, but also various critical technical
    and administrative support functions such as authentication and ancillary directory
    services.</p>"
