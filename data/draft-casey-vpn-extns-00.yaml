abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft extends the framework for IP VPN's, as, for example,
    described by Heinanen et al.[1] and Gleeson et al [2], to include the concept
    of VPN Areas. VPN areas relate to the scoping of the mechanisms (membership dissemination,
    tunneling etc.) used to provide IP VPN service. VPN areas are a partitioning of
    the shared service provider's network. In general, all sites within a VPN area
    are one tunneled hop from each other, but multiple tunneled hops will be required
    for traffic between sites served by different VPN areas. Two reasons why Service
    Providers might partition their IP network into areas in support of VPN's are
    to achieve scalability, and to match administrative domain. VPN areas also facilitate
    the use of different IP VPN mechanisms in different parts of the network. There
    are multiple proposals for tunnel technology and discovery mechanisms for IP VPN's.
    The VPN area concept allows them to co-exist in one provider's network as well
    as smoothing migration to new mechanisms. This draft also examines the impact
    that VPN areas have on the IP VPN framework mechanisms described in [2]. The conclusion
    reached is that the best mechanism for intra-VPN reachability dissemination is
    a full routing protocol run by Virtual Routers.</p>"
