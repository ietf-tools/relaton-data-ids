abstract:
- content: "<p>This document highlights the challenges of creating multicast applications,
    and describes the solutions available or under development. It provides a taxonomy
    of multicast applications in terms of their requirements, and discusses some existing
    multicast- based protocols. Many of the solutions--especially in the areas of
    reliable multicast data delivery, congestion control, and security-- have not
    yet emerged from the research realms. We describe the general state of on-going
    research in these areas, highlighting the strategies under investigation.</p>"
