abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how to secure block storage and storage discovery
    protocols running over IP (Internet Protocol) using IPsec and IKE (Internet Key
    Exchange). Threat models and security protocols are developed for iSCSI (Internet
    Protocol Small Computer System Interface), iFCP (Internet Fibre Channel Storage
    Networking) and FCIP (Fibre Channel over TCP/IP), as well as the iSNS (Internet
    Storage Name Server) and SLPv2 (Service Location Protocol v2) discovery protocols.
    Performance issues and resource constraints are analyzed. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
