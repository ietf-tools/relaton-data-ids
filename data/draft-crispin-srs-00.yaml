abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes a protocol for a Shared Registry System
    (SRS) that allows multiple registrars to register domain names within a single
    Top Level Domain (TLD). The protocol is high-level, text-based, and can be used
    over many underlying transport mechanisms, including email. The semantic content
    of the protocol is expressed as a set of keyword-value pairs; the semantics and
    structure of this content is, in this document, loosely described as the 'payload'.
    The protocol described herein is essentially identical to the SRS version 1.5
    protocol, specified by the CORE SRS RFP and developed by Curt Meyer of Emergent
    Corporation.</p>"
