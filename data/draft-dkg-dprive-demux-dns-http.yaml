abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS over TCP and HTTP/1.x are both stream-oriented, client-speaks-
    first protocols. They can both be run over a stream-based security protocol like
    TLS. A server accepting a stream-based client can distinguish between a valid
    stream of DNS queries and valid stream of HTTP/1.x requests by simple observation
    of the first few octets sent by the client. This can be done without any external
    demultiplexing mechanism like TCP port number or ALPN. Implicit multiplexing of
    the two protocols over a single listening port can be useful for obscuring the
    presence of DNS queries from a network observer, which makes it relevant for DNS
    privacy. Widespread adoption of the described approach could constrain evolution
    of the stream-based variants of both DNS ([RFC1035]) and HTTP/1.x ([RFC7230])
    by ossifying existing distinguishing bit patterns in early octets sent by the
    client. However, this draft explicitly rules out multiplexing in this form with
    HTTP/2, so it should place no constraints on it or any higher version of HTTP.</p>"
