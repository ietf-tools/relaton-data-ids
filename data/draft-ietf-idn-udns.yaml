- content: "<p>Since the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was created there have
    been a desire to use other characters than ASCII in domain names. Lately this
    desire have grown very strong and several groups have started to experiment with
    non-ASCII names. This document defines how the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646]
    is to be used in DNS. It includes both a transition scheme for older software
    supporting non-ASCII handling in applications only, as well as how to use UCS
    in labels and having more than 63 octets in a label.</p>"
