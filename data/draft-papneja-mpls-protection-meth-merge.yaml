abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides the methodology for benchmarking MPLS Protection
    mechanisms especially the failover time of local protection (MPLS Fast Reroute
    as defined in RFC-4090). The failover to a backup tunnel could happen at the headend
    of the primary tunnel or a midpoint and the backup could offer link or node protection.
    It becomes vital to benchmark the failover time for all the cases and combinations.
    The failover time could also greatly differ based on the design and implementation
    and by factors like the number of prefixes carried by the tunnel, the routing
    protocols that installed these prefixes (IGP, BGP...), the number of primary tunnels
    affected by the event that caused the failover, number of primary tunnels the
    backup protects and type of failure, the physical media type on which the failover
    occurs etc. All the required benchmarking criteria and benchmarking topology required
    for measuring failover time of local protection is described Conventions used
    in this document</p>"
