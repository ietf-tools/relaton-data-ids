abstract:
- content: "<p>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol (I-D.ietf-mls-protocol)
    provides a Group Key Agreement protocol for messaging applications. MLS is meant
    to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, message forgery, and provide Forward
    Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). This document describes the architecture
    for using MLS in a general secure group messaging infrastructure and defines the
    security goals for MLS. It provides guidance on building a group messaging system
    and discusses security and privacy tradeoffs offered by multiple security mechanisms
    that are part of the MLS protocol (e.g., frequency of public encryption key rotation).
    The document also provides guidance for parts of the infrastructure that are not
    standardized by MLS and are instead left to the application. While the recommendations
    of this document are not mandatory to follow in order to interoperate at the protocol
    level, they affect the overall security guarantees that are achieved by a messaging
    application. This is especially true in the case of active adversaries that are
    able to compromise clients, the delivery service, or the authentication service.</p>"
