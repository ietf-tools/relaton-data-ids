abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft defines an architectural model for building Virtual
    Private Networks (VPNs) in an MPLS domain. The proposed model takes advantage
    of both network layer peering and packet switching, and link layer circuits and
    per-stream switching. The model provides a set of simple mechanisms for controlling
    VPN membership, including registration, propagation, discovery, and dynamic creation
    of Label Switch Paths to provide connectivity. The architectural constructs described
    in this document, when combined with the MPLS architecture [1], provide a flexible
    and scaleable basis for building VPNs.</p>"
