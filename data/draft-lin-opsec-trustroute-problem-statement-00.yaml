abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, network operators are trying to provide fine-granularity
    Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantee to achieve better Quality of Experience
    (QoE) for end users and engage customers, such as ultra- low latency and high
    reliability service. However, with increasing security threats, differentiated
    QOE services are insufficient, the demand for more differentiated security service
    are emerging. This document explores the requirements for differentiated security
    services and identifies the scenarios for network operators. To provide differentiated
    security services, possible trustworthiness- based routing solution is discussed.</p>"
