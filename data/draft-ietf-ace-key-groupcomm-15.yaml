abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how to use the Authentication and Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework to distribute keying material and
    configuration parameters for secure group communication. Candidate group members
    acting as Clients and authorized to join a group can do so by interacting with
    a Key Distribution Center (KDC) acting as Resource Server, from which they obtain
    the keying material to communicate with other group members. While defining general
    message formats as well as the interface and operations available at the KDC,
    this document supports different approaches and protocols for secure group communication.
    Therefore, details are delegated to separate application profiles of this document,
    as specialized instances that target a particular group communication approach
    and define how communications in the group are protected. Compliance requirements
    for such application profiles are also specified.</p>"
