abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the representation of identity information
    in POLICY_DATA object for supporting policy based admission control in the Resource
    ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP). The goal of identity representation is to allow a
    process on a system to securely identify the owner and the application of the
    communicating process (e.g., user id) and convey this information in RSVP messages
    (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner. We describe the encoding of identities as RSVP
    policy element. We describe the processing rules to generate identity policy elements
    for multicast merged flows. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
