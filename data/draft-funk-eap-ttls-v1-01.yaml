abstract:
- content: "<p>EAP-TTLS is an EAP type that utilizes TLS to establish a secure connection
    between a client and server, through which additional information may be exchanged.
    The initial TLS handshake may mutually authenticate client and server; or it may
    perform a one-way authentication, in which only the server is authenticated to
    the client. The secure connection established by the initial handshake may then
    be used to allow the server to authenticate the client using existing, widely-deployed
    authentication infrastructures such as RADIUS. The authentication of the client
    may itself be EAP, or it may be another authentication protocol such as PAP, CHAP,
    MS-CHAP or MS-CHAP-V2. Thus, EAP-TTLS allows legacy password-based authentication
    protocols to be used against existing authentication databases, while protecting
    the security of these legacy protocols against eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle
    and other cryptographic attacks. EAP-TTLS also allows client and server to exchange
    other information in addition to authentication-related information. This document
    describes EAP-TTLSv1; that is, version 1 of the EAP- TTLS protocol. It represents
    a significant enhancement to the original version 0 of the protocol. EAP-TTLSv1
    utilizes an extended version of TLS, called TLS/IA (TLS/InnerApplication) as its
    underlying protocol [TLS/IA].</p>"
