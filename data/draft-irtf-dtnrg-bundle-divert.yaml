abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines two extensions to the capabilities of a Bundle
    Protocol Agent (BPA) (as defined in [refs.DTNBP]) that is processing bundles within
    the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [refs.DTNarch]. It defines
    an operation called "diversion", which is the act of a bundle protocol agent moving
    an entire bundle from some point in bundle processing in the BPA to a DTN application
    agent. This diversion of a bundle from the BPA to an application agent is distinct
    from delivery of the bundle at that application agent. This document defines a
    second operation, called "injection", which is the inverse of diversion. Injection
    is the act of an application agent moving an entire bundle from the application
    agent into some point in bundle processing in the BPA. This injection of a bundle
    from an application agent to the BPA is distinct from bundle transmission.</p>
