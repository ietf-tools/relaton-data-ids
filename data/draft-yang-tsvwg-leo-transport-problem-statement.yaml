abstract:
- content: "<p>LSN, Starlink and OneWeb, can provide global Internet connectivity
    with latency comparable to terrestrial networks, but their fast movement and frequent
    handovers result in highly dynamic connectivity changes. The fast movement of
    LSN will introduce frequent handover and varying link delays every few minutes.
    As the path over LSN varies, TCP cannot tell whether changes in packet loss or
    RTT are due to path changes or network congestion, thus it might not be able to
    make proper adjustment. This greatly impact the performance of TCP.</p>"
