abstract:
- content: <p>The memo provides information and suggests processes for developers
    of applications based on the DNS protocol and for administrators of servers and
    networks. It suggests new procedures for DNS and DNSSEC implementations that would
    prevent abuse of the DNS protocol such as those seen by "Double Flux" service
    networks. Specifically, this document recommends that all resource records for
    NS records with Time-To-Live (TTL) settings under 24 hours be dropped as potentially
    malicious records designed to attack users. This document would update RFCs 1123,
    1912, 2181 and 2535. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST
    NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
    "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119
    [KWORDS].</p>
