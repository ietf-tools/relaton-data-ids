abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a consistent profile or subset of the features
    from the DeltaV specification [DeltaV]. The subset is suitable for simple linear
    document versioning in a WebDAV [RFC2518] environment. The subset is intended
    to limit functionality in order to improve predictability and thus interoperability.
    If a server advertises support for this subset, then a client can interoperate
    with that server very easily due to its predictability. A server advertising support
    for this subset MUST also support DeltaV.</p>"
