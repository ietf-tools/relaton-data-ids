abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not
    have a normative reference to another standards track document at a lower maturity
    level or to a non standards track specification (other than specifications from
    other standards bodies). For example, a standards track document may not have
    a normative reference to an informational RFC. Exceptions to this rule are sometimes
    needed as the IETF uses informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards or IETF-specific
    modes of use of such standards. This document clarifies and updates the procedure
    used in these circumstances.</p>"
