abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz words
    of the networking industry for the past couple of years. And yet, no clear definition
    of what SDN actually covers has been broadly admitted so far. This document aims
    at contributing to the clarification of the SDN landscape by providing a perspective
    on requirements, issues and other considerations about SDN, as seen from within
    a service provider environment. It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN
    truly means, but rather to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that
    can be used under a SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues
    the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises. As such, a definition
    of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of clarification.</p>"
