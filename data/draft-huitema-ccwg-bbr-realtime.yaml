abstract:
- content: '<p>We are studying the transmission of real-time Media over QUIC. There
    are two priorities: maintain low transmission delays by avoiding building queues,
    and use the available network capacity to provide the best possible experience.
    We found through experiments that while the BBR algorithm generally allow us to
    correctly and timely assess network capacity, we still see "glitches" in specific
    conditions, in particular when using wireless networks. We analyze these issues
    and propose small changes in the BBR algorithm that could improve the quality
    of experience delivered by the real-time media application.</p>'
