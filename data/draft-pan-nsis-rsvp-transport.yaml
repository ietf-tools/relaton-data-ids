abstract:
- content: "<p>In this memo, we look into some of the transport-layer design issues
    in the original RSVP as defined in RFC2205 [RFC2205]. Based on the observation,
    we conclude that the current RSVP transport mechanism may not be adequate to support
    some applications. We recommend to use a different transport layer protocol such
    as TCP for next-generation signaling protocols.</p>"
