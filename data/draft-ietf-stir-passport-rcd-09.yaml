abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed
    call information about personal communications, to include rich meta-data about
    a call and caller that can be signed and integrity protected, transmitted, and
    subsequently rendered to users. This framework is intended to extend caller and
    call specific information beyond human-readable display name comparable to the
    "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network. The JSON element defined
    for this purpose, Rich Call Data (RCD), is an extensible object defined to either
    be used as part of STIR or with SIP Call-Info to include related information about
    calls that helps people decide whether to pick up the phone. This signing of the
    RCD information is also enhanced with a integrity mechanism that is designed to
    protect the authoring and transport of this information between authoritative
    and non-authoritative parties authoring and signing the Rich Call Data for support
    of different usage and content policies.</p>
