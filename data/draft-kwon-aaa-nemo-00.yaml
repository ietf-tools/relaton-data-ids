abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this paper is to describe an AAA protocol designed for
    NEMO services. The proposed AAA protocol retains the NEMO mobility transparency
    in the NEMO basic support protocol, while providing all the required AAA functionalities
    for mobile network nodes. In addition, the proposed AAA protocol reduces authentication
    latency by localizing AAA process.</p>"
