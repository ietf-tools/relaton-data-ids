abstract:
- content: <p>Cryptographic domain validation procedures leverage authenticated communication
    channels to ensure resilience against attacks by both on-path and off-path network
    adversaries which may be located between the CA and the network resources related
    to the domain contained in the certificate. Domain owners can leverage "security"
    Property Tags specified in CAA records (defined in [RFC8659]) with the critical
    flag set, to ensure that CAs perform cryptographic domain validation during their
    issuance procedure, hence defending against global man- in-the-middle adversaries.
    This document defines the syntax of the CAA security Property as well as acceptable
    means for cryptographic domain validation procedures.</p>
