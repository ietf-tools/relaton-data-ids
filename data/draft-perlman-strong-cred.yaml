abstract:
- content: "<p>In a strong password-based protocol, the only thing the client needs
    to know is the user's password, and an eavesdropper, or someone impersonating
    either end, cannot do off-line password-guessing attacks. This sort of protocol
    can be used for credentials download, or for mutual authentication. Although password-based
    mutual authentication protocols can be used for credentials download, they are
    designed with some properties (such as not storing a password- equivalent at the
    server) that are not important in a credentials- download protocol. Therefore,
    a protocol designed specifically for credentials download can be fewer messages,
    higher performance at the server, and allow the server to operate in a stateless
    manner. Therefore it is possible, even likely, that different protocols might
    be preferable in one case (credentials download) than another.</p>"
