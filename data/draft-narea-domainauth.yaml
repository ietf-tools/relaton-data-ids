abstract:
- content: '<p>This document defines DomainAuth, a protocol to attribute digital signatures
    to domain names in such a way that verification can occur entirely offline without
    a prior distribution of public keys. Each signature is distributed as part of
    a self-contained "signature bundle" that encapsulates a complete chain of trust
    comprising: (1) a DNSSEC chain from the root zone to a TXT record containing a
    public key or its digest, (2) an X.509 certificate chain from the key specified
    in the TXT record to the final signing key, and (3) the digital signature in the
    form of a CMS SignedData structure. Finally, signatures can be attributed to the
    domain name itself (e.g. "example.com") or specific users (e.g. "alice" of "example.com").</p>'
