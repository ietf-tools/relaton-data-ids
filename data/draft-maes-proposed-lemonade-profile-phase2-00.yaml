abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an initial draft for LEMONADE profile phase
    2. It is based on a combination of the content of LEMONADE profile [4] and the
    OMA MEM realization internet draft [21] initially considered for internet draft
    publication as information or standard track by LEMONADE. This also provides an
    initial proposal on how to divide the specification work between OMA MEM and LEMONADE
    for a LEMONADE realization of the OMA MEM enabler.</p>"
