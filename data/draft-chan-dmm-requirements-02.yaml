abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional hierarchical structure of cellular networks has led
    to deployment models which are heavily centralized. Mobility management with centralized
    mobility anchoring in existing hierarchical mobile networks is quite prone to
    suboptimal routing and issues related to scalability. Centralized functions present
    a single point of failure, and inevitably introduce longer delays and higher signaling
    loads for network operations related to mobility management. This document defines
    the requirements for distributed mobility management for IPv6 deployment. The
    objectives are to match the mobility deployment with the current trend in network
    evolution, to improve scalability, to avoid single point of failure, to enable
    transparency to upper layers only when needed, etc. The distributed mobility management
    also needs to be compatible with existing network deployments and end hosts, and
    be secured.</p>"
