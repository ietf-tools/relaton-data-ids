abstract:
- content: <p>This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    Grouping Framework extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the
    SDP offer/answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple)
    for sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m="
    sections). Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, and the media
    is referred to as bundled media. The "m=" sections that use the BUNDLE transport
    form a BUNDLE group. This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
    Source Description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension. This specification
    updates RFCs 3264, 5888, and 7941. This specification obsoletes RFC 8843.</p>
