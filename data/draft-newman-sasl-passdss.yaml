abstract:
- content: "<p>Some system administrators are faced with a choice between deploying
    a new authentication infrastructure or sending unencrypted passwords in the clear
    over the Internet. Deploying a new authentication infrastructure often involves
    modifying operating system services or keeping parallel authentication databases
    up to date and is thus unacceptable to many administrators. Solutions which encrypt
    the entire session are often crippled with weak keys (due to government restrictions)
    which are unsuitable for passwords. In addition, such solutions often reduce performance
    of the entire session to an unacceptable level. This specification defines a SASL
    [SASL] mechanism which is compatible with existing password-based authentication
    databases and does not require a security layer for the remainder of the session.
    [NOTE: Public discussion of this mechanism may take place on the ietf-sasl@imc.org
    mailing list with a subscription address of ietf-sasl-request@imc.org. Private
    comments may be sent to the author].</p>"
