abstract:
- content: "<p>The internet and free flow of information has enabled the individual
    in society several advantages that have not been available in the past. The free
    flow of information has enabled social and political changes, open education for
    students, and now the free-flow of money without the need for intermediate institutions.
    This free flow of information etc. is continually under attack from institutions
    that are compromised by the Internet. So these institutions have and continue
    to implement controls in an attempt to stop the empowerment of the individual.
    These controls on information is what this RFC attempts to weaken.</p>"
