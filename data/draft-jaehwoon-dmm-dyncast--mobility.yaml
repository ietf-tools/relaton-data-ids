abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic anycast (Dyncast) network architecture is to choose the best
    edge computing server by considering both the network environment and available
    computing/storage resources of the edge computing server. This draft describes
    the mechanism in which service continuity is provided even when the client moves
    and connects to a new ingress Dyncast anycast Node (DAN) by using the PMIPv6-based
    mobility management method in the Dyncast-based edge computing networking environment.</p>"
