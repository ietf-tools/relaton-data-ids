abstract:
- content: "<p>Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IP address
    and a single destination IP address, as part of the identification for an individual
    data flow. TCP includes these in its definition of a connection and its calculation
    of the header checksum. Hence the transport service is tied to a particular IP
    address pair. This is problematic for multihomed hosts and for mobile hosts. They
    cannot use more than one, for any single transport association (context). Multiple
    Address Service for Transport (MAST) defines a mechanism that supports association
    of multiple IP addresses with any transport association. It requires no change
    to the Internet infrastructure, no change to IP modules or transport modules in
    the end-systems, and no new administrative effort. Instead, it defines a layer
    between classic IP and transport that operates only in the end systems and affects
    only participating hosts. Additional functionality is obtained by use of a DNS
    and 'presence' rendezvous service.</p>"
