abstract:
- content: "<p>DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Working Group is for developing the
    standard signaling mechanisms, together with the DDoS related telemetry and threat
    handling requests and data transmitted by them used in DDoS problem space. Although
    IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX), Packet Sampling (PSAMP), and Packet Selection
    methods are useful for network security inspection, there are still some gaps
    existing to identify some categories of DDoS attacks. To fill in the gaps, this
    document describes the connection sampling mechanism and explains why it is needed
    for detecting DDoS attacks. It also defines several new IPFIX Information Elements
    (IEs). Then, it presents some examples to show how to use these new IPFIX IEs
    together with the existing IPFIX IEs to detect specific DDoS attacks.</p>"
