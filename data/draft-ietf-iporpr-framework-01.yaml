abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses technical issues and requirements of running
    IP over Resilient Packet Rings. It is the intent of this document to produce a
    coherent description of all significant approaches, which were and are being considered
    by the IPORPR working group. Selections of specific approaches, making choices
    regarding engineering tradeoffs, and detailed protocol specification, are outside
    of the scope of this framework document.</p>"
