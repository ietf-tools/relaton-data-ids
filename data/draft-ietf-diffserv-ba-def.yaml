abstract:
- content: "<p>The diffserv WG has defined the general architecture for differen-
    tiated services (RFC 2475) and has been focused on the definition and standardization
    of the 'per-hop forwarding behaviors' (or PHBs) required in routers (RFCs 2474,
    2597, and 2598). The dif- ferentiated services framework creates services within
    a network by applying rules at the edges in the creation of traffic aggregates
    (known as Behavior Aggregates) coupled with the forwarding path behavior. The
    WG has also discussed the behavior required at diffserv network edges or boundaries
    for conditioning the aggregates, elements such as policers and shapers [MODEL,
    MIB]. A major feature of diffserv is that only the components applying the rules
    at the edge need to be changed in response to short-term changes in QoS goals
    in the network, rather than reconfiguring the interior behaviors.</p>"
