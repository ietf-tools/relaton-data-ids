abstract:
- content: "<p>Many solutions have been proposed to enable Automatically Switched
    Transport Networks (ASTN). This document describes an IP/MPLS based intra-domain
    control plane architecture that can be applied to different circuit switching
    technologies (including OTN, PDH and SONET/SDH). This memo includes generic procedures,
    key concepts, and technical considerations for the common control plane architecture.
    It is intended to accentuate understanding of the application domains, create
    architectural alignment, and serve as guide for protocol engineering.</p>"
