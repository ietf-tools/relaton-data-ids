abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) is initiated
    by a DHCPv6 client. A DHCPv6 server can force DHCPv6 client to send RENEW or INFORMATION-REQUEST
    by sending a RECONFIGURE message. There may be multiple DHCPv6 network devices
    connected in between a DHCPv6 client and a server, each one reserving resources
    for the DHCPv6 client. There are no DHCPv6 messages that a relay can initiate
    in order to control the client binding. A DHCPv6 client may not always send a
    RELEASE message when it no longer needs the IPv6 address or prefix and network
    resources for the associated services it is using. This document specifies a way
    to request release to be initiated by an intermediate DHCPv6 network device, e.g.
    DHCPv6 relay, on behalf of DHCPv6 client. This helps to relinquish network resources
    sooner than the lease expiration time.</p>"
