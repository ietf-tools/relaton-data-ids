abstract:
- content: "<p>Message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) do provision
    for data in TLV - Type, Length, Value - format, either in the shape of optional
    TLVs at the end of a BMP message or Stats Reports TLVs. However the space for
    Type value is unique and governed by IANA. To allow the usage of vendor-specific
    TLVs, a mechanism to define per-vendor Type values is required. In this document
    we introduce an Enterprise Bit, or E-bit, for such purpose.</p>"
