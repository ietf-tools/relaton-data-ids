abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an optional extension to a Simple Two-way Active
    Measurement Protocol (STAMP) that enables the use of STAMP test and reflected
    packets of variable length during a single STAMP test session. In some use cases,
    the use of asymmetrical test packets allow for the creation of more realistic
    flows of test packets and, thus, a closer approximation between active performance
    measurements and conditions experienced by the monitored application. Also, the
    document includes an analysis of challenges related to performance monitoring
    in a multicast network. It defines procedures and STAMP extensions to achieve
    more efficient measurements with a lesser impact on a network.</p>"
