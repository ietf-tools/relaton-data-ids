abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how Large Access Providers (LAP) could use
    IPv6 to solve current technical challenges. In particular, IPv6’s large address
    space and optional header mechanism can be used to provide scalable and manageable
    broadband Internet access and Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. A new optional
    header to support forwarding-plane based VPNs is proposed.</p>"
