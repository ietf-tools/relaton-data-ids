abstract:
- content: "<p>The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does
    not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses. The CoRE CoAP specification
    defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of congestion with minimal implementation
    requirements. It also leaves room for combining the base specification with advanced
    congestion control mechanisms with higher performance. This specification defines
    some simple advanced CoRE Congestion Control mechanisms, Simple CoCoA. In the
    present version -01, it is already making use of some input from simulations,
    but might still benefit from simplifying it further.</p>"
