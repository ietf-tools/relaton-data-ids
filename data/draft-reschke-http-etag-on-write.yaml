abstract:
- content: <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specifies a state identifier,
    called "Entity Tag", to be returned in the "ETag" response header. However, the
    description of this header for write operations such as PUT is incomplete, and
    has caused confusion among developers and protocol designers, and potentially
    interoperability problems. This document explains the problem in detail and suggests
    both a clarification for a revision to the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC2616) and
    a new header for use in responses, making HTTP entity tags more useful for user
    agents that want to avoid round-trips to the server after modifying a resource.</p>
