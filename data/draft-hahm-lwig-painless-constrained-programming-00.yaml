abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to fit the constraints of Class 0 devices (offering much less
    than 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) there are no alternatives to implementing
    IP protocols in special software environments, which impose programming paradigms
    that make implementation of protocol specifications significantly more complex.
    However, our experience implementing RFC 4944 and RFC 6282, TCP and UDP on Class
    1 devices (offering approximately 10KiB of RAM and 100KiB of ROM) shows that there
    are alternatives concerning software environments in which to implement IP protocols,
    which avoid such complexity by providing a more developer-friendly environment.
    This draft shares this experience.</p>"
