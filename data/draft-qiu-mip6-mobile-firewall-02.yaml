abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more activities rely on mobile devices. It is an important
    issue on how to protect mobile users engaged in mobile services. Unfortunately,
    the conventional firewalls are inappropriate for mobile networks. Furthermore,
    with a conventional firewall, an administrator of mobile nodes is unable to monitor
    / control dynamically the mobile nodes' activities when the mobile nodes roam.
    In this draft, we introduce a new concept of mobile personal firewall and propose
    a concrete scheme that matches the mobile environment and exploits the mobile
    network facilities. When a mobile node (MN) roams into a foreign network managed
    by a mobility anchor point (MAP), the home agent (HA) will authorize the MAP to
    serve as a security proxy. The HA will negotiate with the MAP on the security
    association and then transfer to the MAP the defined security rules that will
    be applied on all communications to the MN. According to HMIPv6 protocol, all
    packets to MN will go through MAP. Therefore, the MAP has the ability of filtering
    packets. The MAP could also send the MN's traffic logs to the HA. The MN's administrator
    could dynamically monitor the MN's activities by retrieving the MN's traffic logs
    through the HA. If necessary, the MN's administrator could update the security
    rules so that the MN's activities could be controlled dynamically. All the operations
    are transparent to the MN, and the MN will be served in a way specified by its
    administrator no matter where it roams.</p>"
