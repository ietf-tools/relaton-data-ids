abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the implementation of a group telephony feature
    commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA), Multiple Line Appearance (MLA),
    or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA). When implemented using the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as Multiple Appearances. This feature is commonly
    offered in the IP Centrex services and IP-PBX offerings and is likely to be implemented
    on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment. This
    specification defines a new SIP dialog event package tag "appearance" and a method
    for a group of SIP user agents to coordinate the identification of appearances
    between them using SIP dialog package subscriptions.</p>
