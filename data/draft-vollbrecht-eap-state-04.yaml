abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a set of state machines for EAP Peer, EAP Authenticator
    (supporting local, passthrough and backend), for EAP Passthrough method, and for
    'backend adapter' that adapts EAP traffic carried by an AAA protocol such as RADIUS
    or Diameter to a Backend Authenticator. This set of state machines shows how EAP
    can be implemented to support deployment in either a Peer/AP or Peer/AP/AAA Server
    environmnet. The Peer and Authenticator machines are illustrative of how the EAP
    protocol defined in [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis] may be implemented. The Passtrhough
    method and 'backend adapter' illustrate how EAP protocol support defined in [I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    may be implemented. Where there are differences [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/ [I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    are authoritative. This document describes a state machine based on an EAP 'Switch'
    model. This model includes events and actions for the interaction between the
    EAP Switch and EAP methods. The State Machine and associated model are informative
    only. Implementations may achieve the same results using different methods. A
    brief description of the EAP 'Switch' model is given in the Introduction section.
    This document is still a work in progress. The authors believe it corresponds
    to the current state of revisions to the defining [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis]
    documents, but it has not been vetted by the EAP working group as a whole. An
    appendix to this document points out issues the authors believe still need to
    be resolved between the documents. The intent is to synchronize this document
    with [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis] and [I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] revisions when
    they are released and then submit it as an RFC.</p>"
