abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increasing interest to replace parts of the public switched
    telephone network (PSTN) with the IP-based network, the core functionality of
    PSTN such as emergency services, has to be offered when using IP-based technologies.
    Since the PSTN and the Internet follow different design principles their architecture
    is quite different. This fact has to be considered and security threats for an
    IP-based emergency environment have to be re-evaluated. This document investigates
    the potential threats against the IP based emergency architecture. It focuses
    on some analysis of threats for both the end hosts and the infrastructure that
    aims to support emergency services.</p>"
