abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently the RSVP-TE ([7]) defines explicit route object and related
    procedure for traffic engineering based MPLS tunnels but for unicast situations
    only. This document extends the RSVP-TE's explicit route capability to multicast
    applications. The mechanism proposed in this document is also intended for multicast
    applications in GMPLS networks.</p>"
