abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Passphrase Authentication provides a way to authenticate a user
    to a service by using a pass phrase over an insecure network, without revealing
    the pass phrase to eavesdroppers. In addition, the service need not know and does
    not learn the user's pass phrase, making this scheme useful in distributed environments
    where it would be difficult or inappropriate to trust a service with a pass phrase
    database or to allow the server to learn enough to masquerade as the user in a
    future authentication attempt. This draft is part four of a four part series and
    explains the protocol between the service and the deity. Part one of this series
    (draft-petke-ext-intro-00.txt) provides an extended introduction to the problems
    of authentication over insecure networks. Part two (draft-petke-mech-00.txt) explains
    the RPA mechanism. Part three (draft-petke-http-auth-scheme-00.txt) explains how
    to incorporate the mechanism into HTTP. This scheme was inspired by Dave Raggett's
    Mediated Digest Authentication paper.</p>"
