abstract:
- content: "<p>[I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] introduces a new type of segment, Tunnel
    Segment, for the segment routing. Tunnel segment can be used to reduce SID stack
    depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or provide differentiated services. A
    binding label can be assigned to tunnel segment. An upstream node can use such
    a binding label for steering traffic into the appropriate tunnel. This document
    specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support that PCC reports binding label
    of tunnel to PCE and that PCE allocates label for tunnel and updates label binding
    of tunnel to PCC.</p>"
