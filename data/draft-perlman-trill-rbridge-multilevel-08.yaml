abstract:
- content: <p>Extending TRILL to multiple levels has one challenge that is not addressed
    by the already-existing capability of IS-IS to have multiple levels. The issue
    is with TRILL switch nicknames. There have been two proposed approaches. One approach,
    which we refer to as the "unique nickname" approach, gives unique nicknames to
    all the TRILL switches in the multilevel campus, either by having the level-1/level-2
    border TRILL switches advertise which nicknames are not available for assignment
    in the area, or by partitioning the 16-bit nickname into an "area" field and a
    "nickname inside the area" field. The other approach, which we refer to as the
    "aggregated nickname" approach, involves assigning nicknames to the areas, and
    allowing nicknames to be reused in different areas, by having the border TRILL
    switches rewrite the nickname fields when entering or leaving an area. Each of
    those approaches has advantages and disadvantages. The design in this document
    allows a choice of approach in each area, allowing the simplicity of the unique
    nickname approach in installations in which there is no danger of running out
    of nicknames, and allowing nickname rewriting to be phased into larger installations
    on a per-area basis.</p>
