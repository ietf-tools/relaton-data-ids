abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework for the transmission of precise
    time and frequency across packet switched networks, in particular IP and MPLS.
    It examines what is needed over and above the protocols themselves to allow accurate
    recovery of time and frequency at remote nodes across the packet network.</p>"
