abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[2] has a fundamental
    scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at all routers and end-systems
    supporting a flow. This paper examines the use of aggregation as a technique to
    reduce the amount of state needed to provide IIS. In our approach, routers at
    the edge of a region doing aggregation keep detailed IIS state, while in the interior
    of this region, routers keep a greatly reduced amount of state. Packets will be
    tagged at the edge with scheduling information that will be used in place of the
    detailed IIS state. The aggregation scheme described will allow large scale deployment
    of IIS without overloading routers with state and associated processing.</p>"
