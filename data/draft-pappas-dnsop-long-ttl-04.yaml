abstract:
- content: "<p>Due to the hierarchical tree structure of the Domain Name System [RFC1034][RFC1035],
    losing all of the authoritative servers that serve a zone can disrupt services
    to not only that zone but all of its descendants. This problem is particularly
    severe if all the authoritative servers of the root zone, or of a top level domain's
    zone, fail. Although proper placement of secondary servers, as discussed in [RFC2182],
    can be an effective means against isolated failures, it is insufficient to protect
    the DNS service against a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This document
    proposes to reduce the impact of DDoS attacks against top level DNS servers by
    setting long TTL values for NS records and their associated A and AAAA records.
    Our proposed changes are purely operational and can be deployed incrementally.</p>"
