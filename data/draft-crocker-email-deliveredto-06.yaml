abstract:
- content: <p>The address to which email is delivered might be different than any
    of the addresses shown in any of the content header fields that were created by
    the email's author. For example, the address used by the email transport service
    is provided separately, through an envelope SMTP "RCPT TO" command. Before final
    delivery, handling can entail a sequence of submission/delivery events, using
    different destination addresses that lead to the recipient. Also, the delivery
    process can produce local address transformations. It can be helpful for a message
    to have a common way to record each delivery in such a sequence, and to include
    each address used for that recipient, such as for analyzing the path a message
    has taken, for loop detection, or for formulating the author's address in a reply
    message. This document defines a header field for this information. Email handling
    information discloses details about the email infrastructure, as well as about
    a particular recipient; this can raise possible privacy concerns. A header field
    such as this is not automatically assured of widespread use. Therefore this is
    being published as an Experiment, looking for constituency and for operational
    utility. The document is produced through the Independent RFC stream and was not
    subject to the IETF's approval process.</p>
