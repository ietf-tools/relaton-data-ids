abstract:
- content: <p>Some aspects of the BOOTP protocol were rather loosely defined in its
    original specification. In particular, only a general description was provided
    for the behavior of "BOOTP relay agents" (originally called BOOTP forwarding agents").
    The client behavior description also suffered in certain ways. This memo attempts
    to clarify and strengthen the specification in these areas. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
