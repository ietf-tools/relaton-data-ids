abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is deployed
    in providers' core networks. As providers plan to grow these networks, they need
    to understand whether existing protocols and implementations can support the network
    sizes that they are planning. This document presents an analysis of some of the
    scaling concerns for the number of Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in MPLS-TE core
    networks, and examines the value of two techniques (LSP hierarchies and multipoint-to-point
    LSPs) for improving scaling. The intention is to motivate the development of appropriate
    deployment techniques and protocol extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE
    in large networks. This document only considers the question of achieving scalability
    for the support of point-to-point MPLS-TE LSPs. Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TE LSPs
    are for future study. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
