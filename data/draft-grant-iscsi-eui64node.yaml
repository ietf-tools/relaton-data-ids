abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new method of identifying iSCSI Nodes beyond
    the iSCSI name. The new method uses a 64-bit field to be compatible with technologies
    using 64-bit identifiers such as EUI-64. These technologies include Fibre Channel
    and Infiniband, but may also extend to storage features such as failover, LUN-level
    masking or storage asset management.</p>"
