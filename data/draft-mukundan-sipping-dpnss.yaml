abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Multipart Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type
    for application/Digital Private Network Signaling System (DPNSS) objects for use
    in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) applications, according to the rules defined
    in RFC 2048. These types can be used to identify Digital Private Network Signaling
    System 1 (DPNSS 1) objects within a SIP message such as INVITE or INFO, as might
    be implemented when using SIP in an environment where part of the call involves
    interworking to DPNSS 1 based Private Networks. RFC 3204 addresses a similar need
    for Integrated Service Digital Network User Part (ISUP) and Q Signaling (QSIG).</p>"
