abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes two new TCP mechanisms that can be used to more
    effectively recover lost segments when a connection's congestion window is small,
    or when a large number of segments are lost in a single transmission window. The
    first of these mechanisms, 'Limited Transmit', calls for sending a new data segment
    in response to each of the first two duplicate acknowledgments that arrive at
    the sender. The second mechanism is to reduce, in certain special circumstances,
    the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger a fast retransmission.</p>"
