abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes syslog-auth, an attempt to add origin authentication,
    message integrity, replay-resistance, message sequencing, and missing message
    detection to syslog, while continuing to allow the use of UDP for syslog messages.
    Syslog-auth supports many different setups for syslog devices, relays, and collectors.
    Syslog-auth should be implemented on all devices, relays, and collectors being
    used together</p>"
