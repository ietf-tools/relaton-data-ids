abstract:
- content: "<p>To ease the management of a site, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
    (DHCP) is often used. DHCP exists both for the Internet Protocol Version 4 (DHCPv4
    for IPv4) and Version 6 (DHCPv6 for IPv6). To avoid possible pitfalls that occur
    if both DHCP versions are used and to avoid redundancy, IPv4 Information Options
    may be transmitted using DHCPv6 as described in this document. In dual-stack IPv4/IPv6
    scenarios that employ DHCPv6, DHCPv4 can be completely replaced by using the DHCPv6
    IPv4 Information Options.</p>"
