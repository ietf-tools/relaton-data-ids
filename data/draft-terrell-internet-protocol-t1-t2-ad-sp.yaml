abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper Defines the 'IPtX Protocol Specification', and provides
    a visualization of the lack of IP Address Control, a Blunder, which may be excused
    partly because of the impossibility of Predicting the Current, as well as the
    Future use and growth of the Internet. However, this requires an investigation,
    or Analysis for the Current use of the HD-Ratio in the IPv4 and IPv6 IP Specifications.
    Moreover, while the IPv4 IP Specification, is indeed the primary focus of this
    investigation. To provide a fair comparison however, this Analysis requires, if
    not mandates, the use of the IPt1 and IPt2 specifications as well. The reasoning
    here nevertheless, is the difference in the respective Addressing Schematics.
    Where by, the Addressing Scheme of the former focuses primarily on the HOST IP
    Address (Assignment), while the focus of the latter emphasizes only the Network
    IP Address. Nevertheless,it shall be concluded, the Addressing Methods used in
    the Schematic also affects the Efficiency; 'the RATIO of Total Number of Nodes
    that can be attached to Service the Global Networking Community, and the Number
    of available IP Addresses used for the Connection'. In other words, this 'Analysis
    is Argument', whose focus upon the 'HD-Ratio' and the 'CIDR Notation' establishes
    the foundation defining the 'INTERNET PROTOCOL t1 and t2 ADDRESS SPACE' for the
    IPt1 and IPt2 Protocol Specifications. Which moreover, exceeds the Mandate Defining
    a New IP Addressing System specified as the Requirements outlined in RFC1550.</p>"
