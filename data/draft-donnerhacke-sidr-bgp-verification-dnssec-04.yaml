abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an infrastructure for real time verification
    of routes reveived via BGP4. Some DNS query types are introduced to check the
    origin of a prefix and validity of the AS path. The crypto part can be offloaded
    from the routing engine by sending a DNS query and checking the AD bit in the
    DNS response. The proposal depends on the DNS scalability and caching mechanisms
    as well as PKI introduced by DNSSEC.</p>"
