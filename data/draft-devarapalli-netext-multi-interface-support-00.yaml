abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6
    mobile node with no mobility management protocol. It makes it appear to the mobile
    node that its IP address does not change as the mobile node moves across the Proxy
    Mobile IPv6 domain. There have been some issues identified with supporting a host
    with multiple interfaces attaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. This document
    describes and analyzes some of the scenarios associated with this. It also describes
    the requirements for a handover across interfaces using Proxy Mobile IPv6.</p>"
