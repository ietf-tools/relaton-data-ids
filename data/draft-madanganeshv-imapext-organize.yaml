abstract:
- content: "<p>The ORGANIZE extension to Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4]
    specifies the mechanism by which the client can inform the server to maintain
    the entries for the messages to be organized. The organization of messages include
    appending, moving to a mailbox, deleting messages, or changing the attributes
    of received messages. This extension enables the lightweight IMAP clients to organize
    their messages on the server side, rather than performing it on the client side.
    In addition to the information on the IMAP ORGANIZE extension, this document describes
    implementation of the ORGANIZE extension for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP].</p>"
