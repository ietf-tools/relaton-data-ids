- content: "<p>This document provides a single reference point for requirements for
    Relying Party (RP) software for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
    (RPKI). It cites requirements that appear in several RPKI RFCs, making it easier
    for implementers to become aware of these requirements that are segmented with
    orthogonal functionalities.</p>"
