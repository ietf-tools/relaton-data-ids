abstract:
- content: "<p>An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate device between IPFIX Exporting
    Processes and IPFIX Collecting Processes. IPFIX Mediators act as an IPFIX Proxy,
    and IPFIX Concentrator. IPFIX Mediators mediate IPFIX protocol using several functions.
    That enables the flow-based measurement system to become a high-capacity system
    and accommodate a variety of monitoring methods. This document describes each
    function that is provided by IPFIX Mediators and the method of handling the Flow
    Records of each function. In addition, this document describes a model of an applicable
    scenario using IPFIX Mediators.</p>"
