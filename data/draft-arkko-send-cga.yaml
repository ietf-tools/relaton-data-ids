abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover other
    nodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to find routers
    and to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors.
    The original ND specifications called for the use of IPsec for protecting the
    ND messages. However, in this particular application the use of IPsec may not
    always be feasible, mainly due to difficulties in key management. If not secured,
    ND protocol is vulnerable to various attacks. This document specifies a ightweight
    security solution for ND that does not rely on pre- configuration or trusted third
    parties. The presented solution uses Cryptographically Generated Addresses.</p>"
