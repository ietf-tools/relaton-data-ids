abstract:
- content: "<p>Generic requirements for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
    have been described in [3]. This draft provides encapsulation formats and guidelines
    from transporting ATM services over a Packet Switched Network using IP, L2TP,
    or MPLS. It describes three cell relay services: VCC, VPC, and transparent port,
    as well as two methods for carrying AAL5 PDUs across a PSN.</p>"
