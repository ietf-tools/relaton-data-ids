abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet technical community is looking at ways to address pervasive
    attacks as described in several other internet drafts. [I-D.barnes-pervasive-problem]
    describes threat model to characterize various pervasive attacks on the Internet
    communications. There are many systems that need to be secured against such attacks
    but this paper considers one possible way to secure cloud based collaborations
    systems. At a high level, this paper sugests that users or enterprises could run
    a key server that manages the keys to access their content. The cloud service
    provider would not have access to decrypt the data stored in the cloud but various
    users of the cloud service could get the keys to encrypt and decrypt the contents
    of collaboration sessions facilitated by the cloud service. This does not protect
    the meta data of who is talking to who but can help protect the content of the
    conversations.</p>"
