abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic,
    stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext,
    such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension
    of its request methods, error codes and headers [I36]. A feature of HTTP is the
    typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently
    of the data being transferred.</p>"
