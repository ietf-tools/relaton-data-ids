abstract:
- content: "<p>Meeting the agreed service quality in a mobile ad hoc network is tough
    and addressed in [RFC1677]. A mechanism is provided in [RFC2501]. In this draft,
    usage of an integrated algorithm is described. The fading RF channels introduce
    the harmful self-similarity in to the traffic. To counter the same, another self-similar
    controlling mechanism may be inserted for the better wireless network performance
    and optimal resource utilization.</p>"
