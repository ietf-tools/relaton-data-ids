abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft pursues the standardization of the 'Hierarchical LSP' being
    a label-switched sequence of other LSPs (and interfaces), i.e. of hierarchically
    next-lower LSPs, which eventually, after some recursive cycles, consist of label-switched
    sequences of physical interfaces, i.e. of LSPs as of today. Hierarchically stacked
    LSPs will eliminate the notorious N-square problem when virtual networks (or even
    virtual networks on top of virtual networks) are to be built. Version 03 is based
    on RSVP-TE (not on CR-LDP anymore).</p>"
