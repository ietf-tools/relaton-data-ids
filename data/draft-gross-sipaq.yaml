abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the architecture, protocols and messages for
    SIP based IP communications between Internet domains in support of QoS and AAA.
    Detailed message flows and message contents are discussed and specified. AAA requirements
    including inter-domain and user authorization in mobile and non-mobile environments
    are addressed. A solution is proposed where session setup and teardown are linked
    with QoS and AAA signaling using AAA policy servers and clearinghouses.</p>"
