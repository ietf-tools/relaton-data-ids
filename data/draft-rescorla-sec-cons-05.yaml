abstract:
- content: "<p>All RFCs are required by [RFC1543] to contain a Security Considera-
    tions section. The purpose of this is both to encourage document authors to consider
    security in their designs and to inform the reader of relevant security issues.
    This memo is intended to provide guidance to RFC authors in service of both ends.
    This document is structured in three parts. The first is a combina- tion security
    tutorial and definition of common terms; the second is a series of guidelines
    for writing Security Considerations; the third is a series of examples.</p>"
