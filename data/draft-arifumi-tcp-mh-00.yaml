abstract:
- content: "<p>In the existing TCP, only one local and one remote address is used
    through a TCP session, even when a client or a server is located under multi-homed
    site and has multiple IP addresses. When a network outage occurs and the access-line
    associated with the local and remote addresses is down, the TCP session itself
    gets lost even if another access-line is alive. TCP MH option makes it possible
    to handle multiple local and remote address pairs in one TCP session and to survive
    network outages by finding out an alternative network path. Our path transition
    mechanism is simple, fast, lightweight and as secure as existing TCP.</p>"
