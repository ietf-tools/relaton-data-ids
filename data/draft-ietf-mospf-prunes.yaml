abstract:
- content: "<p>MOSPF is a link-state multicast routing protocol, based on OSPF. Inside
    a single OSPF area, the delivery of multicast datagrams is restricted to group
    members only, by propagating the location of group members through group-membership-LSAs.
    However, group membership is not propagated across area and/or AS boundaries,
    relying instead on so-called wild-card multicast receivers. This means that in
    some cases multicast datagrams are transmitted further than necessary, wasting
    link and processor resources in the process. This document defines a way to prune
    these excess branches off the MOSPF delivery tree, using a new Prune-LSA. In concept
    these are similar to the prunes employed by the DVMRP protocol. However, to reuse
    the reliability mechanisms present in the base OSPF protocol, MOSPF prunes are
    implemented as local-scope Opaque-LSAs. As a result, inter-area and inter-AS multicast
    datagrams are forwarded by MOSPF using the broadcast-and-prune strategy employed
    by DVMRP.</p>"
