abstract:
- content: "<p>There are a variety of servers, web pages, and the like, which holders
    of ISO 7812 financial transaction identification card (i.e., credit/debit card)
    numbers and ISO 7816 smart card or related numbers may need to locate on the Internet.
    For example, some systems assume a smart card holder can contact the issuer of
    a smart card application for maintenance and update functions and the payment
    protocols may assume that a card holder can locate the appropriate certification
    authority to obtain a card holder certificate. This document specifies a method
    using the DNS as an important element in locating card related facilities on the
    Internet by mapping ISO 7812 and ISO 7816 number systems into domain names.</p>"
