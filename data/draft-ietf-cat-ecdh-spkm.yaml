abstract:
- content: "<p>Elliptic curve cryptography is rapidly gaining acceptance and is being
    increasingly used in applications that are constrained in memory and bandwidth.
    Efforts are underway to standardize the use of elliptic curves for authentication
    [ECDSA], [X962] and key agreement [ISO15946], [P1363], [X963]. However, none of
    these efforts describe the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) method in a form
    suitable for inclusion in SPKM [RFC2025]. This document will define a new OID
    and AlgorithmIdentifier which is suitable for use in SPKM and describe how the
    ECDH algorithm is to be used in SPKM.</p>"
