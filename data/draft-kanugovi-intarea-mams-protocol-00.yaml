abstract:
- content: "<p>A communication network includes an access network element that delivers
    data to/from the user and an associated core network element that typically is
    the IP gateway having connectivity with the application servers. Multiconnectivity
    scenarios are common where a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple
    communication networks based on different technology implementations and network
    architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. A smart combination and selection of access
    and core network paths can improve quality of experience that a user in a multiconnectivity
    scenario. This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles.
    It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a multi access management
    services framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination of
    uplink and downlink access and core network paths, ensuring better network efficiency
    and enhanced application performance.</p>"
