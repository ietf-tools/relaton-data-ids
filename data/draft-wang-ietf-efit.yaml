abstract:
- content: "<p>Our measurement studies of the global Internet routing system show
    that prefix de-aggregation has led to the DFZ routing table size growing at a
    rate which is much faster than the Internet itself. The main causes of prefix
    de-aggregation include user site multihoming and traffic engineering. We propose
    to move Internet service providers to a separate address space as an effective
    solution to the routing scalability problem. We discuss different means to provide
    the mapping service between user and provider address spaces and the pros and
    cons of each approach, as well as why we believe such an architectural change
    is necessary to solve the routing scalability problem.</p>"
