abstract:
- content: "<p>This note sets requirements for a new routing and addressing architecture
    for the Internet. These requirements were developed by the IRTF's Routing Research
    Group. This draft is the product of Group ~B, which is one of the subgroups in
    the IRTF-Routing Research Group working on requirements for routing solutions
    for the future. This document sets out requirements that we believe are important
    for a future routing architecture and routing protocols. The IRTF Routing Research
    Group (RRG) does not endorse this set of requirements or any other set of requirements
    as the one and only set of requirements.</p>"
