abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start
    for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. For TCP connections
    that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands) of
    MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start
    procedure can result in increasing the congestion window by thousands of segments
    in a single round-trip time. Such an increase can easily result in thousands of
    packets being dropped in one round-trip time. This is often counter-productive
    for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the
    congested link. This note describes Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism
    for limiting the number of segments by which the congestion window is increased
    for one window of data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for
    TCP connections with large congestion windows. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
