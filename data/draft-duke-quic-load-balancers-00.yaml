abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across address/port
    5-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless or low-state
    layer 4 load balancers. They are also meant to prevent linkability of connections
    across deliberate address migration through the use of protected communications
    between client and server. This creates issues for load-balancing intermediaries.
    This specification standardizes the communication between load balancers and servers
    to overcome these issues in a protocol called QUIC-LB.</p>"
