abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a solution to enable an emulated LAN Service or
    Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) by decoupling the bridging and tunneling of
    Ethernet traffic into Customer Located Equipment (CLE) or Customer Edge (CE) and
    Provider Edge (PE), respectively. This decoupling of functions allows an operator
    to provision point-to- point transport of Ethernet services for customer on PEs,
    while leveraging bridging functions at CLEs to forward traffic towards the appropriate
    point-to-point Ethernet service leading to the destination node. This decoupling
    of functions also allow providers to leverage existing network infrastructures
    to enable VPLS while easing migration to new network infrastructures. This approach
    scales as the number of customers and sites increases, and as customers' emulated
    LAN sites span over a large wide area network. It is also the intention to show
    that an interface like Ethernet can be offered to customers and emulated LAN services
    can be enabled, but it is not mandatory to introduce VLAN like technologies (or
    PE-based type of VPLS) in the provider's network. In addition, existing and heterogeneous
    access technologies can be supported in a common network infrastructure.</p>"
