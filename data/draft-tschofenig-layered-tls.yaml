abstract:
- content: '<p>TLS and increasingly also DTLS are frequently used to provide channel
    security for Internet of Things (IoT) communication. On the Web and smart phones,
    TLS is already the defacto approach for securing protocol interactions. While
    the end-to-end security offered by TLS, particularly TLS 1.3, is already too much
    for some, there are others who believe that TLS is insufficient. While the former
    group is working on ways to weaken TLS security, the latter group is interested
    in designing an application layer security solution. Whether application-layer
    security is used in addition to or as a substitute for transport-layer security
    is of secondary importance. However, the security needs for such an application
    layer solution are similar, if not identical, to those that drove the design of
    TLS. This is for an obvious reason: Security requirements are not tied to the
    name of a security protocol nor to the layer at which it is executed. One can
    make this observation also in other areas, such as with the increasing similarity
    of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and the TLS handshake protocols. These discussions
    within the IETF inspired the document authors to explore whether TLS could actually
    be used also at the application layer and how complex it would be. We call this
    approach "Layered TLS" since TLS may, in some scenarios, be executed at two layers:
    above the transport layer in the traditional manner and also at the application
    layer.</p>'
