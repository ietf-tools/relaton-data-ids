abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms
    to support the next generation of the Pan European in- vehicle emergency call
    service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally
    referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special
    form of emergency calls placed by vehicles. eCall deployment is required by 2015
    in European Union member states, and eCall is also being deployed in other regions.
    eCall provides an integrated voice path and a standardized set of vehicle, sensor
    (e.g., crash related), and location data. An eCall is recognized and handled as
    a specialized form of emergency call and is routed to a specialized eCall-capable
    Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) capable of processing the vehicle data and
    trained in handling emergency calls from vehicles. Currently, eCall functions
    over circuit-switched cellular telephony; work on next-generation eCall (NG-eCall,
    sometimes called packet- switched eCall or PS-eCall) is now in process, and this
    document assists in that work by describing how to support eCall within the IP-based
    emergency services infrastructure. This document also registers a MIME Content
    Type and an Emergency Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data.</p>
