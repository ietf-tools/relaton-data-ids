abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Message Queue Protocol (SMQP) provides a standard form of
    sharing data between those that publish data and those that desire to subscribe
    to data. Publish/subscribe systems decouple the two end points from knowing about
    one another. SMQP will provide a common protocol to be used for a variety of implementation
    from simple chat applications to mission critical message flows.</p>"
