abstract:
- content: "<p>The dependability of location information is closely related to the
    degree of trust placed in the source of that information. This document describes
    techniques that can be used to mitigate the impact of falsifying location information.
    The application of digital signatures is described, relating these methods to
    the attacks that they address.</p>"
