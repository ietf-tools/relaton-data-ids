abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual network overlays are extremely useful for supporting multicast
    applications in multi-tenant data center networks, by distributing the per-tenant
    multicast state and forwarding actions at the network edges with minimal control
    plane load and simpler forwarding in the core. A virtual overlay network may use
    existing encapsulations such as MPLS-in-GRE or newer IP based encapsulations such
    as VXLAN and NVGRE. IP multicast sources and receivers are very commonly spread
    out across multiple subnets. Sources and receivers may also be spread within and
    outside a single network domain such as a data center. Hence, a Layer-3 multicast
    paradigm is the most suitable and efficient approach for delivery of IP multicast
    traffic. BGP based MVPNs provide a good basis for providing a solution to support
    IP multicast across these overlay networks. An appropriate subset of the MVPN
    control plane and procedures are sufficient to support the requirements, providing
    for a simpler model of operation. This document describes the use of BGP based
    MVPNs alongwith the new IP-based virtual network overlay encapsulations to provide
    a Layer-3 virtualization solution for IP multicast traffic, and specifies mechanisms
    to use the new encapsulations while continuing to leverage the BGP MVPN control
    plane techniques and extensions.</p>"
