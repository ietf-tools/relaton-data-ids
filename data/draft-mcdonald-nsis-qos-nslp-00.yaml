abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a protocol to be used for signaling QoS reservations
    in the Internet. It is compatible with the framework and requirements for such
    signaling protocols developed within NSIS; in conjunction with the NSIS Transport
    solution, it provides functionality comparable to RSVP: it is independent of the
    details of QoS specification, and adds support for a greater variety of reservation
    models, but is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.</p>"
