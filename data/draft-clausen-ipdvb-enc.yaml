abstract:
- content: "<p>This document contains the Simple Encapsulation, a simple and lean
    encapsulation mechanism for the transport of IP Datagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport
    Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS has been widely accepted not only for providing digital
    TV services, but also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. One
    example is the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), specified by standards published
    by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).</p>"
