abstract:
- content: "<p>The recently published [IEEE802154e] standard formalizes the concept
    of link-layer resources in LLNs. Nodes are synchronized and follow a schedule.
    A cell in that schedule corresponds to an atomic link- layer resource, and can
    be allocated to any pair of neighbors in the network. This allows the schedule
    to be built to tightly match each node's bandwidth, latency and energy constraints.
    The [IEEE802154e] standard does not, however, present a mechanism to do so, as
    building and managing the schedule is out of scope of the standard. This document
    describes the 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top) and the commands it provides to
    upper network layers such as RPL or GMPLS. The set of functionalities includes
    feedback metrics from cell states so network layers can take routing decisions,
    TSCH configuration and control procedures, and the support for decentralized and
    centralized scheduling. In addition, 6top can be configured to enable packet switching
    at layer 2.5, analogous to GMPLS.</p>"
