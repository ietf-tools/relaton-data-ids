- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) facilitates the steering of unicast traffic through
    leveraging the source routing paradigm. As introduced in Segment Path Programming
    (SPP), the concept of segment could be used in a more generalized manner that
    may be beyond reachability. This document describes the necessary IS-IS extensions
    for those cases.</p>"
