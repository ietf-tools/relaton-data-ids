abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of multimedia conferencing on the
    Internet. The protocols mentioned are specified elsewhere as RFCs, Internet-Drafts,
    or ITU recommendations. Each of these specifications gives details of the protocol
    itself, how it works and what it does. This document attempts to provide the reader
    with an overview of how the components fit together and of some of the assumptions
    made, as well as some statement of direction for those components still in a nascent
    stage.</p>"
