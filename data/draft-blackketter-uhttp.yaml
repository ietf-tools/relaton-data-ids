abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Unidirectional Hypertext Transfer Protocol,
    or UHTTP. UHTTP is a simple, robust, one-way data transfer protocol that is designed
    to efficiently deliver resource data in a one-way broadcast-only environment.
    This transfer protocol is appropriate for delivery of HTML and other content resources
    using IP multicast over television vertical blanking interval (IP/VBI) and other
    unidirectional transport systems.</p>"
