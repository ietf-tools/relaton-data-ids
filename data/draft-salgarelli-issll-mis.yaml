abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents an integrated, server-based mechanism for the efficient
    support of the IP Integrated Services (IIS) model in ATM networks, namely the
    Multicast Integration Server (MIS) architecture. Instead of viewing IP-ATM multicast
    address resolution and QoS support separately, the approach in this memo is to
    consider such issues in an integrated manner. In particular, the MIS architecture
    defines how a layer-3 setup protocol as RSVP can be mapped to and integrated with
    a layer-2 multicast address resolution protocol as EARTH - EAsy Multicast Routing
    THrough ATM clouds. With the use of EARTH, several ATM point-to-multipoint connections
    with different QoS parameters can be associated to a single IP multicast address.
    An RSVP server (RSVP-S) within the MIS is used to distribute RSVP messages inside
    the ATM cloud and to set the corresponding QoS state in the address resolution
    table of EARTH (setup protocol mapping). In addition, this memo defines a quantized
    heterogeneity model which supports, together with the MIS, advanced IIS features
    as QoS heterogeneity and dynamic QoS changes in IP-ATM networks.</p>"
