abstract:
- content: "<p>In various applications of MPLS, label stacks with multiple entries
    are used. In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label of the stack
    with an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling the application to run over networks
    which do not have MPLS enabled in their core routers. MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE
    encapsulations have already been specified by the MPLS WG. In some cases, in addition
    to IP and GRE tunnels, it may be desirable to use IPsec for transporting MPLS
    packets securely over non-MPLS networks, using standard IPsec authentication and/or
    encryption functions. This draft describes procedures for encapsulating MPLS packets
    in IPsec.</p>"
