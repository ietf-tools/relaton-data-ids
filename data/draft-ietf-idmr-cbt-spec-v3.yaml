abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Core Based Tree (CBT version 3) network
    layer multicast routing protocol. CBT builds a shared multicast dis- tribution
    tree per group, and is suited to inter- and intra-domain multicast routing. CBT
    may use a separate multicast routing table, or it may use that of underlying unicast
    routing, to establish paths between senders and receivers. The CBT architecture
    is described in [1]. This specification supercedes and obsoletes RFC 2189. Changes
    from RFC 2189 include support for source specific joining and pruning to provide
    better CBT transit domain capability, new packet formats, and new robustness features.
    Section 1 documents the primary changes to RFC 2189. This document is progressing
    through the IDMR working group of the IETF. CBT related documents include [1,
    2, 3, 5, 8]. For all IDMR- related documents, see http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ietf/idmr.</p>"
