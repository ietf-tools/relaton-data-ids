abstract:
- content: "<p>There has been, for several years, a rising concern over the energy
    usage of large scale networks. This concern is strongly focused on campus, data
    center, and other highly concentrated deployments of network infrastructure. Given
    the steadily increasing demand for higher network speeds, always-on service models,
    and ubiquitous network coverage, it is also of growing importance for telecommunication
    networks both local and wide area in scope. One of the issues in moving forward
    to reduce energy usage is to ensure that the network can still meet the performance
    specifications required to support the applications running over it. This document
    provides an overview of the various areas of concern in the interaction between
    network performance and efforts at energy aware control planes, as a guide for
    those working on modifying current control planes or designing new control planes
    to improve the energy efficiency of high density, highly complex, network deployments.</p>"
