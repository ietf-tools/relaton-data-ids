abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies (OR BETTER: specifies) protocol enhancements
    that enable mobile nodes to more quickly become connected at new points of attachment
    to the Internet. These protocol enhancements are intended to minimize the time
    during which the mobile node is unable to send or receive IPv6 packets (i.e.,
    the handover latency). Mobile IPv6 is considered to be the base protocol, but
    Mobile IPv6 does not mandate any mechanism which gives assurances about minimizing
    the handover latency. The protocol enhancements in this document should be considered
    as protocol enhancements to Mobile IPv6.</p>"
