abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed public interface through which an
    application, such as a network management console, interacts with an Asynchronous
    Management Protocol (AMP) Manager via a database supporting the Structured Query
    Language (SQL). The use of SQL as an interfacing layer provides a natural way
    to describe interactions with an AMP Manager independent of a particular implementation
    of either the Manager or the application. Specifically, this document presents
    a database schema capturing how to send controls to a Manager and how to accept
    reports received by a Manager from one or more AMP Agents.</p>"
