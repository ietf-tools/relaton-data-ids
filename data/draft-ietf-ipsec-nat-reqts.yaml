abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes known incompatibilities between Network Address
    Translation (NAT) and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing them.
    Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private networking
    capabilities. One very popular use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) is to provide
    telecommuter access to the corporate Intranet. Today, NATs are widely deployed
    in home gateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by telecommuters,
    such as hotels. The result is that IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major
    barrier in the deployment of IPsec in one of its principal uses. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
