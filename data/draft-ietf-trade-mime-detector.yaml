- content: "<p>Entities composing web pages to provide services over the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) frequently have the problem of not knowing what Multipurpose
    Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types have handlers installed at a user's browser.
    This document summarizes reasonable techniques to solve this problem for most
    of the browsers actually deployed on the Internet as of early 2000. This memo
    provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
