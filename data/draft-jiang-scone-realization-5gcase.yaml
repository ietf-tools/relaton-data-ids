abstract:
- content: "<p>The SCONE protocol provides a scheme for network elements (NEs) to
    signal the maximally possible throughput limits to end devices, i.e., the flow
    senders with the assistance from the corresponding flow receivers, for UDP flows
    transitting thru the NEs. This kind of 'throughput advice' is applied on the per-(UDP)-flow
    basis. While the advice signaling scheme from NEs inside the traditional public
    IP network might be challenging, the application of the SCONE scheme to the 5G
    scenario can be more streamlined and practical. This draft discusses from many
    perspectives how the SCONE can be realized in the 5G scenario, along with additional
    advantages that a 5G system might provide to the SCONE.</p>"
