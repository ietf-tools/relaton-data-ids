abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft specifies the requirements that should be satisfied in the
    definition of a parallel NFS protocol and the considerations recommended for its
    designs. It responds to the scalable bandwidth problem described in the pNFS Problem
    Statement, draft-gibson-pnfs-problem-statement-01.txt. In the interest of a timely
    adoption of scalable bandwidth file service, parallel NFS is proposed to be a
    NFSv4 minor extension for communicating file layout available through existing
    and future storage subsystem protocols such as other NFSv4 file servers (NFS),
    block-based SCSI subsystems (SBC), and object-based SCSI (OSD) subsystems.</p>"
