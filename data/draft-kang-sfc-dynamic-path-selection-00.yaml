abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we use SF classification of 1)indispensible SF for
    packet delivery, allegedly mandatory SFs, such as NAT and 2)optional SFs that
    a packet can be delivered without them, such as Firewall and IDS. The nodes of
    SFC-enabled domain can be various. Different vendors make different types of equipments,
    and this causes performance issues. Considering this diversity, the kind of SFs
    can be in myriad form. Thus, we should distinguish some mandatory SFs from not
    mandatory SFs and treat distinctively. Mandatory SFs should be matched with higher-performance
    SFF to achieve high availability as well as lower the probability of failure.
    Above all, whether each SF is mandatory or optional should be registered in advance.
    Mandatory SFs are to allocated to relatively higher-performance, larger capacity,
    more stable SFFs. SFC constructed using this way of allocation becomes the path
    for packets and packets are transferred to classifier through C1 interface, and
    to SFF through C2 interface, respectively.</p>"
