abstract:
- content: "<p>The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working group
    is defining a protocol by which control elements (CEs) can communicate with forwarding
    elements (FEs) and control the behaviors of FEs. It is well known that ForCES
    based solutions have good scalability. Therefore, it makes sense to adopt ForCES
    to better integrate existing physical routers with ForCES routers. Plus, someone
    may want going forward to be able to use the developed hardware and software from
    existing routers as a part of ForCES based solutions. This draft presents a framework
    in which some possible migration solutions are discussed in details and some security
    implications are considered.</p>"
