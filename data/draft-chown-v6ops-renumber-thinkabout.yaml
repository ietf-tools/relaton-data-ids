abstract:
- content: <p>This memo presents a summary of scenarios, issues for consideration
    and protocol features for IPv6 network renumbering, i.e. achieving the transition
    from the use of an existing network prefix to a new prefix in an IPv6 network.
    Its focus lies not in the procedure for renumbering, but as a set of "things to
    think about" when undertaking such a renumbering exercise.</p>
