abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6)
    Options to be used in the context of shared IP address solutions. In some deployment
    scenarios, DHCP (IPv4) cannot be used to configure customer devices because only
    IPv6 capabilities are deployed (e.g., DS-lite context or IPv6 Port Range). Therefore,
    DHCPv6 may be used to convey IPv4-related configuration information such as Port
    Range and/or Port Extended IPv4 addresses. This document defines also a DHCPv6
    Option aiming to convey the IPv6 prefix to be used to build IPv4 Embedded IPv6
    addresses [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format].</p>"
