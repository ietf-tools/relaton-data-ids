abstract:
- content: "<p>As the work of the NSIS working group has begun there are also concerns
    about security and its implication for the design of a signaling protocol. In
    order to understand the security properties and available options of RSVP a number
    of documents have to be read. This document tries to summarize the security properties
    of RSVP and to view them from a different point of view. This work in NSIS is
    part of the overall process of analyzing other protocols and to learn from their
    design considerations. This document should also provide a starting point for
    further discussions.</p>"
