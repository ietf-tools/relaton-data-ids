abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a new framework for the transport of IP Datagrams
    over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS has been widely accepted
    not only for providing digital TV services, but also as a subnetwork technology
    for building IP networks. Examples of systems using MPEG-2 include the Digital
    Video Broadcast (DVB) and Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Standards
    for Digital Television. The document identifies the need for a set of Internet
    standards defining the interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream and an IP
    subnetwork. It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP datagrams, and proposes
    protocols to perform IPv6/IPv4 address resolution, to associate IP packets with
    the properties of the Logical Channels provided by an MPEG-2 TS.</p>"
