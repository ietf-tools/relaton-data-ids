abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE)
    router. Specifically, the current version of this document focuses on the basic
    provisioning of an IPv6 CE router and the provisioning of IPv6 hosts attached
    to it. The document also covers several transition technologies, as required in
    a world where IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so hosts in the customer
    LANs with IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or devices, requiring to communicate
    with IPv4-only services at the Internet, are able to do so. The document obsoletes
    RFC 7084.</p>"
