abstract:
- content: "<p>The mobile nodes are increasingly capable of simultaneous multi-radio
    connectivity. This allows them to be attached to the Internet through multiple
    access technologies at the same time. With such multi-access, the mobile node
    (MN) can make use of the best-available access technology for a particular application
    at any given time. And, the network may be able to balance the flow of traffic
    across the available access technologies. The Mobile IPv6 flow binding work provides
    a mechanism for the MN to signal the Home Agent to balance the flows based on
    the MN'e needs. This document specifies a simple protocol for a mobile IP gateway
    (such as a Mobile IP Home Agent or a Proxy Mobile IP Local Mobility Anchor) to
    signal the MN of gateway's policy for traffic treatment across access technologies.
    Based on the response and the prevailing network conditions, the gateway then
    balances the traffic.</p>"
