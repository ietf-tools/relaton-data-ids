abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a type of private networks that interconnect
    thin CPEs at multiple client sites by IP tunnels, or more specifically, lay over
    multiple client sites' Thin CPEs via IP tunnels. Those private overlay networks
    not only interconnect those sites by secure IP tunnels but can also enforce the
    client specified policies to govern how applications or hosts within those sites
    communicate and how to access public internet. Hosts or applications in those
    sites can be interconnected by Layer 2 networks or/and by Layer 3 networks. The
    network that the IP tunnels are traversing can be IPv4 or IPv6 networks. This
    document describes the special properties of the client defined networks over
    Thin CPEs. A separate draft will describes the special features that those IP
    tunnels need to have in order to interconnect multiple sites as if those sites
    are directly connected by wires and how communication policies are enforced.</p>"
