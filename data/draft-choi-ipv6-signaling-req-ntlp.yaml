abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we present the features of IPv6 protocol related to
    NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) and requirements for IPv6 signaling as NTLP
    in different Internet transport infrastructure, such as SDH/SONET switch, Optical
    cross-connect (OXC), ATM switch, Ethernet switch, wireless system, and router.
    In this framework, user data is transported via nodes in the data plane and signaling
    messages are routed to NEs in the control plane. We propose the new protocol,
    Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP) for carrying signaling messages. And
    other delivering methods of signaling messages in IPv6 network are also presented
    in appendix.</p>"
