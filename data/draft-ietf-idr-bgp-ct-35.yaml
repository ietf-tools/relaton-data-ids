abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a mechanism referred to as "Intent Driven Service
    Mapping". The mechanism uses BGP to express intent based association of overlay
    routes with underlay routes having specific Traffic Engineering (TE) characteristics
    satisfying a certain Service Level Agreement (SLA). This is achieved by defining
    new constructs to group underlay routes with sufficiently similar TE characteristics
    into identifiable classes (called "Transport Classes"), that overlay routes use
    as an ordered set to resolve reachability (Resolution Schemes) towards service
    endpoints. These constructs can be used, for example, to realize the "IETF Network
    Slice" defined in TEAS Network Slices framework. Additionally, this document specifies
    protocol procedures for BGP that enable dissemination of service mapping information
    in a network that may span multiple cooperating administrative domains. These
    domains may be administered either by the same provider or by closely coordinating
    providers. A new BGP address family that leverages RFC 4364 ("BGP/MPLS IP Virtual
    Private Networks (VPNs)" procedures and follows RFC 8277 ("Using BGP to Bind MPLS
    Labels to Address Prefixes") NLRI encoding is defined to enable each advertised
    underlay route to be identified by its class. This new address family is called
    "BGP Classful Transport", a.k.a., BGP CT.</p>
