abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at providing an extended architecture, use case
    and applicability statement for management of MANETs, as a guideline for how to
    manage MANETs. This document describes different management activities, such as
    network configuration, monitoring of state, monitoring of performance, fault management,
    and software upgrades. Different aspects of a MANET management architecture are
    illustrated (e.g., distributed vs. centralized management, flat vs. hierarchical
    management, management of an entire network vs. an individual router, etc.) and
    contrasted to the NMS architecture in the Internet. A desciption of typical MANET
    use cases relevant for management is followed by an overview of current standard
    management protocols that can be used in MANETs.</p>"
