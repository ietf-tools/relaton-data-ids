abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo proposes a profile of the ACME protocol that allows the owner
    of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) to delegate to a third party access to
    a certificate associated with said identifier. A primary use case is that of a
    CDN (the third party) terminating TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider
    (the owner of a domain name). The presented mechanism allows the owner of the
    identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time by
    cancelling the associated STAR certificate renewal with the ACME CA. Another key
    property of this mechanism is it does not require any modification to the deployed
    TLS ecosystem.</p>"
