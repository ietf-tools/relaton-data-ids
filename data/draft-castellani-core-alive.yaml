abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of a Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE), hosts could
    frequently be energy-constrained and be turned off the vast majority of time for
    energy-saving purposes. In the case of a CoAP server, while it is offline, it
    is neither available to serve requests. Clients desiring to access its resources
    have no way to understand when they will find it up again. This specification
    provides a simple new message that gives to a CoAP server the ability to signal
    its current availability in the network.</p>"
