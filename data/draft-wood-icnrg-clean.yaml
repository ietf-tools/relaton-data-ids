abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies CCNx CLEAN - content-locked encryption and
    authentication of nameless objects. CLEAN describes how to transparently encrypt
    content objects in FLIC Manifests [I-D.irtf-icnrg-flic]. Relevant decryption information
    is carried in native FLIC nodes, i.e., without any extensions or modifications
    to FLIC. CLEAN transparently encrypts public data and supports application-specific
    configuration for private data.</p>"
