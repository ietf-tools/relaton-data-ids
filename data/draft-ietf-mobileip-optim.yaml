abstract:
- content: "<p>Using the base Mobile IP protocol, all datagrams destined to a mobile
    node are routed through that mobile node's home agent, which then tunnels each
    datagram to the mobile node's current location. This document defines Route Optimization
    messages and extensions to the base protocol to optimize datagram routing to a
    mobile node. Using these protocol extensions, correspondent nodes may cache the
    binding of a mobile node, and then tunnel their datagrams for the mobile node
    directly to the care-of address, bypassing the mobile node's home agent. Extensions
    are also provided to allow datagrams in flight when a mobile node moves, and datagrams
    sent based on an out-of-date cached binding, to be forwarded directly to the mobile
    node's new binding.</p>"
