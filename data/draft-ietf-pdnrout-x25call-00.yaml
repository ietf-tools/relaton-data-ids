abstract:
- content: "<p>Therefore, the X.25 Call Setup and Charging Determination Protocol
    (XCDP)', described in this document, has been developed, to support global Internet
    connectivity via the system of X.25 Public Data Networks PDN (even via VAN-gateways
    preventing local charges), by providing a pseudo-reverse charging option, which
    is indicated in the Call User Data(CUD) field of the call request. In addition,
    information about the source and destination address of the Internet datagram
    to be transmitted, can also be indicated in the user data field of the call request.</p>"
