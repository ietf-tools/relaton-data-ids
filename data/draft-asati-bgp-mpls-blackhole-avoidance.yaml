abstract:
- content: <p>In any BGP based MPLS network such as MPLS VPN [RFC4364], an ingress
    PE router would continue to attract traffic from the CE router by advertising
    the prefix reachability, even though the Label Switched Path (LSP) from the ingress
    PE router to the egress PE router may be broken. This causes the VPN traffic to
    be dropped inside the MPLS VPN network. This document proposes a framework to
    make BGP consider the MPLS path availability to the "NEXT_HOP" (i.e. egress PE
    router) during the BGP bestpath candidate selection process. This document also
    defines a local database for storing the MPLS path health information for one
    or more IP prefixes and its interaction with BGP.</p>
