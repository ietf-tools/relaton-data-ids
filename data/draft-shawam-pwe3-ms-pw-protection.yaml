abstract:
- content: "<p>In MPLS and MPLS-TP environments, statically provisioned Single- Segment
    Pseudowires (SS-PWs) are protected against tunnel failure via MPLS-level and MPLS-TP-level
    tunnel protection. With statically provisioned Multi-Segment Pseudowires (MS-PWs),
    each segment of the MS-PW is likewise protected from tunnel failures via MPLS-level
    and MPLS-TP-level tunnel protection. However, static MS-PWs are not protected
    end-to-end against failure of one of the switching PEs (S-PEs) along the path
    of the MS-PW. This document describes how to achieve this protection by updating
    the existing procedures in RFC 6870. It also contains an optional approach based
    on MPLS-TP Linear Protection.</p>"
