abstract:
- content: "<p>Currently, the DNSSEC security of a zone is limited by the strength
    of its weakest signature algorithm. DNSSEC Strict Mode makes zones as secure as
    their strongest algorithm instead. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed
    before publishing as an RFC. Discussion of this document takes place on the mailing
    list (dnsop@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/dnsop/.
