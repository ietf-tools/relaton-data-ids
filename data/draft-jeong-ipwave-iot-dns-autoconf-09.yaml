abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for device discovery
    and service discovery in IP-based vehicular networks. Through the device discovery,
    this document supports the global (or local) DNS naming of Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) devices, such as sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle units. By this scheme,
    the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's model information
    in wired and wireless target networks (e.g., vehicle, road network, home, office,
    shopping mall, and smart grid). Through the service discovery, IoT users (e.g.,
    drivers, passengers, home residents, and customers) in the Internet (or local
    network) can easily identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling
    it in a target network.</p>"
