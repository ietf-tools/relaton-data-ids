abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and its many extensions and supporting
    technologies define a solution for multimedia communications on the Internet.
    Much of the design and architecture for SIP is based on a key set of architectural
    principles which, while commonly discussed on mailing lists and other forums,
    have not been explicitly captured. This document seeks to rectify that gap by
    outlining the key set of architectural and design principles underlying SIP.</p>"
