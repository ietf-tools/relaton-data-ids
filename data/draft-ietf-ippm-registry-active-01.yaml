abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo defines the Active Performance Metrics sub-registry of the
    Performance Metric Registry. This sub-registry will contain Active Performance
    Metrics, especially those defined in RFCs prepared in the IP Performance Metrics
    (IPPM) Working Group of the IETF, and possibly applicable to other IETF metrics.
    Three aspects make IPPM metric registration difficult: (1) Use of the Type-P notion
    to allow users to specify their own packet types. (2) Use of flexible input variables,
    called Parameters in IPPM definitions, some of which determine the quantity measured
    and others of which should not be specified until execution of the measurement.
    (3) Allowing flexibility in choice of statistics to summarize the results on a
    stream of measurement packets. This memo proposes a way to organize registry entries
    into columns that are well-defined, permitting consistent development of entries
    over time (a column may marked NA if it is not applicable for that metric). The
    design is intended to foster development of registry entries based on existing
    reference RFCs, whilst each column serves as a check-list item to avoid omissions
    during the registration process. Every entry in the registry, before IANA action,
    requires Expert review as defined by concurrent IETF work in progress "Registry
    for Performance Metrics" (draft-ietf-ippm-metric-registry). The document contains
    two examples: a registry entry for an active Performance Metric entry based on
    RFC3393 and RFC5481, and a registry entry for an end-point Performance Metric
    based on RFC 7003. The examples are for Informational purposes and do not create
    any entry in the IANA registry.</p>'
