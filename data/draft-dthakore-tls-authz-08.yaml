abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of Digital Transmission Content Protection
    (DTCP) certificates as an authorization data type in the authorization extension
    for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol. This is in accordance with the
    guidelines for authorization extensions as specified in [RFC5878]. As with other
    TLS extensions, this authorization data can be included in the client and server
    Hello messages to confirm that both parties support the desired authorization
    data types. If supported by both the client and the server, DTCP certificates
    are exchanged in the supplemental data TLS handshake message as specified in RFC4680.
    This authorization data type extension is in support of devices containing DTCP
    certificates, issued by the Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator [DTLA].</p>"
