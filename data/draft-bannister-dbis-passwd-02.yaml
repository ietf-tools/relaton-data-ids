abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described
    in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support passwd and group databases. The
    passwd and group database schemas SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network
    Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be
    resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510]. A passwd database
    represents user login accounts on UNIX and UNIX- like systems and a group database
    represents user groups. This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis-
    mapping-00] for passwd and group databases, and database entries referenced by
    those maps. Overlays may optionally be used to help reduce the complexity of merging
    multiple DBIS domains in large environments by permitting groups of hosts to have
    variations in their UIDs, GIDs, home directories and login shells.</p>"
