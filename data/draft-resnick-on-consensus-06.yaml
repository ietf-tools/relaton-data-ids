abstract:
- content: '<p>The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through
    a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants
    and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters. In particular,
    the IETF is supposed not to be run by a "majority rule" philosophy. This is why
    we engage in rituals like "humming" instead of voting. However, more and more
    of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting
    the majority win the day without consideration of minority concerns. This document
    is a collection of thoughts on what rough consensus is, how we have gotten away
    from it, how we might think about it differently, and the things we can do in
    order to really achieve rough consensus. Note (to be removed before publication):
    This document is quite consciously being put forward as Informational. It does
    not propose to change any IETF processes and is therefore not a BCP. It is simply
    a collection of principles, hopefully around which the IETF can come to (at least
    rough) consensus.</p>'
