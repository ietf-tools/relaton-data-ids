abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines extended electronic signature policies (ext-SP)
    that extend the boundaries of the electronic signature policy defined in [RFC3125]
    in a manner that the relationships and dependences among multiple electronic signatures
    generated within the scope of the same electronic transaction can be established.
    A given legal/contractual context may recognize a particular ext-SP as meeting
    its requirements. An ext-SP has a globally unique reference, which is bound to
    an electronic signature by the signer as part of the signature calculation. The
    ext-SP can be defined in human readable form so that it can be assessed to meet
    the requirements of the legal and contractual context in which it is being applied.
    To allow for the automatic processing, the ext-SP specifies, using a computer
    processable form, the timing and sequence dependencies of the set of signatures
    that must be generated to make the transaction effective along with the set of
    attributes and rules that each signature must comply with. In the current document
    the format of the ext-SP is defined using ASN.1. The content of this document
    is based on the requirements and needs established in ETSI TR 102 045 V1.1.1 (2003-03)
    Copyright (C). Individual copies of this ETSI deliverable can be downloaded from
