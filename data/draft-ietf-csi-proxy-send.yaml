abstract:
- content: "<p>SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing Neighbor
    Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats. As defined today, SEND assumes
    that the node sending an ND message is the owner of the address from which the
    message is sent and/or possesses a key that authorizes the node to act as a router,
    so that it is in possession of the private key or keys used to generate the digital
    signature on each message. This means that the Proxy ND signaling performed by
    nodes that do not possess knowledge of the address owner's private key and/or
    knowledge of a router's key cannot be secured using SEND. This document extends
    the current SEND specification in order to secure Proxy ND operation. This document
    defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
