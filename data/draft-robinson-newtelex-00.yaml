abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides a major revision to my Internet RFC 1394 by: including
    new information which was not available to me when the original document was released;
    changes to old information due to the destruction of the Soviet Union, East Germany
    and Yugoslavia, and the Balkanization of Czechslovakia; corrects minor format
    errors; corrects some misunderstandings which occurred from some people's misreading
    of the original RFC document; and removes some omissions which occurred in the
    original RFC. As the corrections (including a whole new set of information which
    is added to the original document) are substantial, if accepted for publication
    as an Internet RFC, it will obsolete RFC 1394. This draft revises the first draft
    to insert minor corrections.</p>"
