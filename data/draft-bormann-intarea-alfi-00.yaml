abstract:
- content: <p>IPv6 defines a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes. Many link layers are more
    limited in their choice of packet size. Typically, IP adaptation layers for these
    link layers define a segmentation or fragmentation scheme to transport larger
    IP packets in multiple link layer packets. Often, adaption layer fragmentation
    schemes reduce some performance metric, such as the packet delivery rate. Where
    application or transport protocols have a choice, it would therefore be desirable
    for them to know about any adaptation layer fragmentation that is going on, so
    they can choose packet sizes that minimize adaptation layer fragmentation. At
    the IP layer, fragmentation can be detected using a number of mechanisms used
    in Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery [RFC4821]. However, adaptation later
    fragmentation schemes are often designed to be "transparent", i.e. there is no
    way at higher layers to find out they had to be employed (except maybe by elaborate
    measurement schemes targeting one of the impacted performance metrics; this approach
    does not appear to be viable) [WEI]. The present specification defines a mechanism
    for IPv6 adaptation layers to indicate the presence of adaptation layer fragmentation,
    as well as an indication of preferred packet sizes. The main objective of this
    version of the draft is to present a complete design in order to be able to gauge
    the complexity of the approach against the gains to be expected from implementing
    it. Comments are appreciated and should go to the intarea@ietf.org mailing list.</p>
