abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a summary of issues related to transmission of
    IP packets over optical networks. This is a compilation of many drafts presented
    so far in IETF. The goal is to create a common document, which by including all
    the views and proposals will serve as a better reference point for further discussion.
    The novelty of this draft is that we try to cover all the main areas of integration
    and deployment of IP and optical networks including architecture, routing, signaling,
    management, and survivability.</p>"
