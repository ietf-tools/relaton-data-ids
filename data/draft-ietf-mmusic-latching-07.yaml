abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes behavior of signaling intermediaries in Real-
    Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border
    Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT). HNT is a set of
    mechanisms, such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use
    to enable other RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other. This document
    is non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference
    to the IETF community, as well as an informative description to manufacturers,
    and users. Latching, which is one of the components of the HNT components, has
    a number of security issues covered here. Because of those, and unless all security
    considerations explained here are taken into account and solved, the IETF advises
    against use of latching mechanism over the Internet and recommends other solutions
    such as the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol.</p>"
