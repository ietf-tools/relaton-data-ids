abstract:
- content: "<p>As deployment of global IP networks become more widespread, there are
    several challenges that become apparent, one of the more important ones being
    secure access from a users perspective. Based on the users service requirements,
    secure access will have to be setup between a multitude of nodes in a distributed
    fashion. The nature of these security requirements may well be real-time and dynamic
    in nature and MUST protect the confidentiality of the user. These requirements
    are clearly manifested in the mobility domain. This draft outlines a general purpose
    Key Exchange framework for Network Architectures [KENA] with centralised key generation
    and management tailored for distributed nodes. The draft also describes a specific
    implementation of KENA in the IP mobility domain by extending Mobile IP [Perkins96].</p>"
