abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [1] and subsequently
    updated in [2], an IGMP/MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces called MUIIMP
    is proposed and analyzed. The MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy
    but extends with multiple upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each
    upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe to the same
    data simultaneously.</p>"
