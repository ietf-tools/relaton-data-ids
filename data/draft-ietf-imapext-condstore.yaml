abstract:
- content: "<p>Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes
    to a common IMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients working on behalf
    of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients
    need a mechanism to synchronize state changes for messages within the mailbox.
    They must be able to guarantee that only one client can change message state (e.g.,
    message flags) at any time. An example of such an application is use of an IMAP
    mailbox as a message queue with multiple dequeueing clients. The Conditional Store
    facility provides a protected update mechanism for message state information that
    can detect and resolve conflicts between multiple writing mail clients. The Conditional
    Store facility also allows a client to quickly resynchronize mailbox flag changes.
    This document defines an extension to IMAP (RFC 3501). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
