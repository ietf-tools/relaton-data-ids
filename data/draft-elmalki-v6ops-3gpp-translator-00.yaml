abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETF meetings
    regarding the suitability of translators (e.g. NAT-PT) as mechanisms for IPv4
    to IPv6 transition. It has often been stated that NAT-PT is not a mechanism to
    be recommended in general to solve the IPv6-IPv4 transition problem and some modifications
    to NAT-PT have been proposed. However there have also been discussions regarding
    special scenarios where some form of translators could be deployed if their use
    is documented appropriately. The aim of this draft is to document the rationale
    for using translators in 3GPP networks, in particular for IPv6-only IMS (IP Multimedia
    Subsystem) and to describe possible solutions to the problem and the interactions
    with SIP.</p>"
