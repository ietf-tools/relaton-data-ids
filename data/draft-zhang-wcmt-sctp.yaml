abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, WCMT-SCTP(WCMT:Wireless Concurrent Multi-path Transfer)is
    proposed to allow a host to improve the transmission throughput in wireless multi-hop
    networks using simultaneous multi- path transmission of Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol. Relevant issues of WCMT-SCTP included are: (1) data transmission mode
    and path selection, (2) path management and, (3) multi-path handover mechanism.
    Transmission modes of WCMT-SCTP, and the path handover mechanism, are designed
    to enhance the transmission throughput and solve the receive buffer blocking problem
    of different wireless link status. Since the transmission paths used for WCMT-SCTP
    may differ when an WCMT-SCTP host moves, the multi-path handover problem is defined,
    and a handover mechanism is proposed.</p>"
