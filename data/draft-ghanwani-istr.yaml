abstract:
- content: "<p>The RSVP and Integrated Services working groups have been working towards
    the goal of an 'Integrated Services Internet' where applications can request a
    Quality of Service (QoS) from the network in order to meet their end-to-end service
    requirements. This document reviews various issues related to supporting Integrated
    Service models over token ring networks. It also describes features of token ring
    networks that can be leveraged to provide QoS guarantees. It is intended as a
    starting point for building an architectural framework to support these services
    in token ring environments.</p>"
