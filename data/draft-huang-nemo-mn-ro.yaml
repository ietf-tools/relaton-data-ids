abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6
    mobile network to perform route optimization. The route optimization is possible
    because mobile router provides a care-of address for mobile nodes in mobile network
    which we call Virtual Care-of Address (VCoA). The VCoA uses the network prefix
    of the access network. Mobile nodes register VCoA as its own care-of address with
    home agent and correspondent nodes. With little modification to mobile nodes and
    correspondent nodes, mobile router deals with the packets forwarding between them.</p>"
