abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the missing features in the existing Internet mail and messaging
    standards is a facility for server-to-server and server-to- client event notifications
    related to message store events. As the scope of Internet mail expands to support
    more diverse media (such as voice mail) and devices (such as cell phones) and
    to provide rich interactions with other services (such as web portals and legal
    compliance systems), the need for an interoperable notification system increases.
    This document attempts to enumerate the types of events that interest real-world
    consumers of such a system. This document describes events and event parameters
    that are useful for several cases, including notification to administrative systems
    and end users. This is not intended as a replacement for a message access facility
    such as IMAP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
