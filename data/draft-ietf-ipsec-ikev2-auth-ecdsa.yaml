abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
    (ECDSA) may be used as the authentication method within the Internet Key Exchange
    protocol, version 2 (IKEv2). ECDSA may provide benefits including computational
    efficiency, small signature sizes, and minimal bandwidth, compared to other available
    digital signature methods. This document adds ECDSA capability to IKEv2 without
    introducing any changes to existing IKEv2 operation.</p>"
