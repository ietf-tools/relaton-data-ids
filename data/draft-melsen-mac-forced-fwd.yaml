abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism to ensure layer-2 separation of
    Local Area Network (LAN) stations accessing an IPv4 gateway over a bridged Ethernet
    segment. The mechanism - called "MAC-Forced Forwarding" - implements an Address
    Resolution Protocol (ARP) proxy function that prohibits Ethernet Media Access
    Control (MAC) address resolution between hosts located within the same IPv4 subnet
    but at different customer premises, and in effect directs all upstream traffic
    to an IPv4 gateway. The IPv4 gateway provides IP-layer connectivity between these
    same hosts. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
