abstract:
- content: "<p>There is confusion over how to get an RFC published in the IETF. Recently
    a long time IETF participant asked me what 'secret handshake' was need to get
    documents published as RFCs since he had been trying unsuccessfully to get that
    done. This memo is the result of that query and describes the procedures required,
    gives the proper references and the required email addresses.</p>"
