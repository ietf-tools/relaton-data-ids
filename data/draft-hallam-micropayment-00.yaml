abstract:
- content: "<p>A protocol for transfer of payments through the services of a common
    broker is described. The processing demands of the protocol make it practical
    for small payment amounts. The latency makes it practical for use in interactive
    applications. The scheme thus satisfies the two key criteria for a micropayments
    scheme. MPTP implements a variation of the Pay-Word proposal of Rivest and Shamir
    [RivestSh95]. It is also inspired by the Millicent proposal by Manasse [Manasse95]
    and the iKP proposal by Bellare et. al. [BellareEt95]. A proposal similar to the
    PayWord scheme by Torben Pedersen [Pedersen9?] was reported after this draft was
    begun. For efficiency it is desirable to be able to combine transfer of payments
    instructions with those accomplishing the delivery of goods. For this reason MPTP
    may be layered on a variety of Internet protocols including HTTP and SMTP/MIME.</p>"
