abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports multiple transports
    running both over IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. In more and more cases, a SIP user
    agent (UA) is connected to multiple network interfaces. In these cases setting
    up a connection from a dual stack client to a dual stack server may suffer from
    the issues described in RFC 6555 [RFC6555] - Happy Eyeballs - significant delays
    in the process of setting up a working flow to a server. This negatively affects
    user experience. This document builds on RFC 6555 and explains how a RFC3261 [RFC3261]
    compliant SIP implementation can quickly set up working flows to a given hostname
    (located by using DNS NAPTR and SRV lookups) in a dual stack network using connection
    oriented transport protocols. A solution for connectionless transport protocols
    is discussed in a separate document.</p>"
