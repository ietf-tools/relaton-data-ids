abstract:
- content: "<p>With the advent of 5G era, sensing devices and mobile Internet devices
    in smart factories are everywhere, and a variety of industrial data from different
    spatial devices becomes widely available and interwoven. These data are usually
    generated by streaming, with huge differences in data sources and structures,
    massive scale, strong correlation and complicated relationship. The great richness
    of data makes the problem of how to quickly, accurately and deeply dig the hidden
    value behind the data more complicated than ever. The data generated in different
    fields are distributed in a variety of business systems, and these data have different
    structures and forms, so it is difficult to use an efficient form of unified analysis.
    Based on the data characteristics of heterogeneous data, the multi-source heterogeneous
    data fusion method is studied based on tensor.</p>"
