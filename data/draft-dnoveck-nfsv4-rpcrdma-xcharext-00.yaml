abstract:
- content: "<p>It is expected that the RPC-over-RDMA transport will, at some point,
    allow protocol extensions to be defined. This would provide for the specification
    of OPTIONAL features, allowing participants who implement the OPTIONAL features,
    to cooperate as specified by that extension, while still interoperating with participants
    who do not support that extension. A particular extension is described herein,
    whose purpose is to allow RPC/RDMA Endpoints to specify and manage their transport
    characteristics in order to allow the other participant to optimize message transfer
    in light of the characteristics communicated by the initial sender.</p>"
