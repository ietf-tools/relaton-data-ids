abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the process through which individuals, working
    groups and external standards bodies can influence the development of MPLS and
    GMPLS standards. With respect to standardization, this process means that (G)MPLS
    extensions and changes can be done through the IETF only, the body that created
    the (G)MPLS technology. The IETF will not publish a (G)MPLS technology extension
    RFC outside of the processes described here.</p>"
