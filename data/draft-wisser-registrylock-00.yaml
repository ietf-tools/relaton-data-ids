abstract:
- content: "<p>This extensions defines an additional protective layer for changes
    to domain [RFC5731], host [RFC5732] and contact [RFC5733] objects managed through
    EPP. EPP allows changes to objects only by the sponsoring client. EPP objects
    are usually managed by the sponsoring client on behalf of the sponsoring clients
    customers. There is no protection in EPP to changes to an object by the sponsoring
    client that are not authorized by the the customer. This extension defines a protective
    layer that aims to break automated changes and work flows by requiring manual
    intervention by the sponsoring client or it's customers.</p>"
