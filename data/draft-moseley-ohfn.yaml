abstract:
- content: "<p>As use of the Internet has become widespread, it's become increasingly
    clear that the URL -- the mechanism most users employ to designate resources --
    is inherently confusing to non-technical users, and to a great extent, is unusable
    by them. For that reason, an easier naming scheme that employs human-friendly
    names ('HFNs') is desirable and necessary. Such schemes have been discussed at
    length in RFCs 1737[1], 2276[2] and 2168[3]. As use of the Internet has become
