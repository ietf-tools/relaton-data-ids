    a routing protocol to Full Standard have been satisfied by Border Gateway Protocol
    version 4 (BGP-4). This report documents experience with BGP. It is the second

    how BGP satisfies General Requirements specified in Section 3.0, as well as the
    Requirements for Full Standard as specified in Section 6.0 of the 'Internet Routing
    Protocol Standardization Criteria' document [1]. Please send comments to bgp@ans.net.</p>"
