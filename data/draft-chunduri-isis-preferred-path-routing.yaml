abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR) mechanism to
    simplify the path description of data plane traffic in Segment Routing (SR) deployments.
    PPR aims to mitigate the MTU and data plane processing issues that may result
    from SR packet overheads; and also supports traffic measurement, accounting statistics
    and further attribute extensions along the paths. Preferred Path Routing is achieved
    through the addition of descriptions to IS-IS advertised prefixes, and mapping
    those to a PPR data-plane identifier.</p>"
