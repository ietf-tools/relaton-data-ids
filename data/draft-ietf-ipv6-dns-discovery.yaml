abstract:
- content: "<p>This documents specifies 3 well known addresses to configure stub resolvers
    on IPv6 nodes to enable them to communicate with recursive DNS server with minimum
    configuration in the network and without running a discovery protocol on the end
    nodes. This method may be used when no other information about the addresses of
    recursive DNS servers is available. Implementation of stub resolvers using this
    as default configuration must provide a way to override this.</p>"
