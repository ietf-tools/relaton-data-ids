abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a new protocol for communication via sound (and
    in particular via near-ultrasound) that is simple enough to be implemented on
    devices with limited computational resources, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    devices. The near-ultrasonic frequency band in the range of 18-22kHz represents
    a novel and so far hardly used channel for the communication of different devices,
    such as mobile phones, computers, TVs, personal assistants, and potentially a
    wide range of IoT devices. Moreover, data-over-sound enables to connect low-end
    hardware devices to the Internet by near field communication with other Internet-connected
    devices. Data-over-sound requires only a standard loudspeaker and a microphone
    for communication, and thus has very low hardware requirements compared to other
    communication standards such as Bluetooth, WLAN and NFC. "SoniTalk" is designed
    as an open and transparent near-ultrasonic data transmission protocol for data-over-sound.
    This document provides a specification of the protocol at the lowest layer (physical
    layer) in the sense of the OSI model.</p>
