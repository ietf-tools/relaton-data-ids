abstract:
- content: "<p>This note presents one and two-flow test results for the SCE (Some
    Congestion Experienced) reference implementation. These tests are not intended
    to be a comprehensive real-world evaluation of SCE, but an illustration of SCE's
    influence on basic TCP metrics in a controlled environment.</p>"
