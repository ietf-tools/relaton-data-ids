abstract:
- content: <p>Several techniques are being developed which use IS-IS to deliver link
    state based layer 2 forwarding. The superset of the extensions proposed to IS-IS
    to allow these capabilities is found in [IS-IS- L2]. One technique for layer 2
    forwarding is being specified in the IEEE 802.1aq task group, under the over-arching
    title of "Shortest Path Bridging" (SPB). SPB however only requires a subset of
    the proposed IS-IS extensions in [IS-IS-L2]. For clarity this informational draft
    documents only the subset required by SPB. In addition a high level introduction,
    describing how these TLVs are used is provided for those who do not follow the
    IEEE work in detail. A reference is also given to the normative IEEE 802.1aq document
    The ordering of material in this document follows that of Clause 28 of IEEE 802.1aq,
    to aid cross-referencing.</p>
