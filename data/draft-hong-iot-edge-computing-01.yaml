abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes new challenges for IoT services originated
    from the changes in the IoT environment. In order to address those new challenges,
    the integration of Edge computing and IoT has been emerged as a promising solution.
    This document discribes the concept of IoT integrated with Edge computing as well
    as its use cases. It discusses benefits and challenges of Edge computing, focusing
    mainly on IoT data. The direction of Edge computing for IoT should be discussed
    in IETF/IRTF.</p>"
