abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a signing procedure for Japanese message in the context
    of security multipart. The procedure guarantees signature validity even if messages
    are processed through message transfer agents which carelessly transform character
    set encodings. To sign Japanese message digitally, local forms such as EUC/Japanese,
    Shift-JIS, etc., are first converted into the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP with
    an appropriate set of MIME headers. Then it is duplicated into two objects. The
    first object is transformed into the signature form defined in this memo and a
    detached digital signature is calculated over it. A 'Multipart/Signed' part is
    created with the second object and the detached digital signature. Japanese text
    is verified as the signature form instead of the transfer form. To encrypt Japanese
    message, the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP with an appropriate set of MIME headers,
    is used.</p>"
