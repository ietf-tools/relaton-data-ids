abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service, which allows an
    SMTP client to specify (a) that delivery status notifications (DSNs) should be
    generated under certain conditions, (b) whether such notifications should return
    the contents of the message, and (c) additional information, to be returned with
    a DSN, that allows the sender to identify both the recipient(s) for which the
    DSN was issued, and the transaction in which the original message was sent. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
