abstract:
- content: <p>SOAR-ity is intended to allow for "reliable" (this term is almost always
    a misnomer) messaging over HTTP. It achieves this goal by introducing two new
    request headers, Message-ID which provides a unique ID for a message and MsgCreate
    which contains the date and time on which the first instance of the message with
    the associated Message-ID was sent. The purpose of the Message-ID/MsgCreate pair
    is to allow any HTTP request (e.g. any HTTP method can be used) to be repeated
    multiple times with a guarantee that the message will be processed no more than
    one time. In essence it makes any HTTP method call idempotent.</p>
