abstract:
- content: "<p>For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or
    roadside assistance, it appears that the identity of the requestor is less important
    than accurate and trustworthy location information. To ensure adequate help location
    has to be left untouched by the end point or by entities in transit. This document
    lists different threats, an adversary model, outlines three frequentlly discussed
    solutions and discusses operational considerations. Finally, the document concludes
    with a suggestion on how to move forward.</p>"
