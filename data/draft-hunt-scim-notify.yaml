abstract:
- content: "<p>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
    is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi- domain scenarios
    easier to support through a standardized HTTP service. In a SCIM environment,
    changes to resources may be requested by multiple parties. As time goes by an
    interested subscriber may wish to be informed about resource state changes that
    are occurring at the SCIM service provider. This specification defines a hub notification
    service that can be used to publish and distribute events to interested registered
    subscribers.</p>"
