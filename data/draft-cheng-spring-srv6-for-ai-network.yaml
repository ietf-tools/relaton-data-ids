abstract:
- content: "<p>AI applications require fast processing and responses. Traffic using
    RoCEv2 has low entropy for ECMP. At the same time, AI elephant flows are predictable.
    Traffic engineering technology for AI backend networks becomes a possible solution.
    SRv6 TE can start from the host side, making SRv6 source routing and traffic path
    control from the host side an optional solution. This document presents a AI network
    Traffic Engineering (TE) application scenario for handling link faults and traffic
    congestion issues in data centers, based on Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) and
    Compressed Segment Identifier (CSID). The application scenario uses SRv6 CSID
    Network Programming to directly install all forwarding paths on the head-end device.
    When a data center experiences a link fault or traffic congestion, the head-end
    device switches the forwarding path to another optimal path for avoiding the location
    of link fault or traffic congestion, ensuring optimal AI data flow forwarding.</p>"
