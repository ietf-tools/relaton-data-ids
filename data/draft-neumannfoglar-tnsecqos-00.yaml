abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on the QoS architecture and the DS codepoints defined in RFC2474
    and RFC2475 we define an application that creates a trusted environment. We introduce
    the notion of Trusted Networks (TN) a network that has to satisfy a set of rules
    that can be specified by each network owner. Packets originating from this or
    another TN can be treated with higher confidence and higher QoS than packets from
    untrusted networks. The basic tool of our proposal is ingress filtering RFC2827.
    This approach may apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.</p>"
