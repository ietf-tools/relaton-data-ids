abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions
    in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and
    Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. A link or node failure can significantly impact
    network services in large-scale networks. Therefore it is important to ensure
    the survivability of large scale networks which consist of various connections
    provided over multiple interconnected networks with varying technologies. This
    document examines the applicability of the PCE architecture, protocols, and procedures
    for computing protection paths and restoration services, for single and multi-domain
    networks. This document also explains the mechanism of Fast Re-Route (FRR) where
    a point of local repair (PLR) needs to find the appropriate merge point (MP) to
    do bypass path computation using PCE.</p>"
