abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents different deployment models of PCN-based admission
    control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet- specific dual marking (PSDM)
    for encoding. Their major is that they require only a single DSCP for packet marking
    and that they work reliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates (IEAs)
    with only a very small average number of flows. Moreover, an advanced model even
    works with multipath routing.</p>"
