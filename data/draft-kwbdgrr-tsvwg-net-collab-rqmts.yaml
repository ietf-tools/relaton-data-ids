abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless networks (e.g., cellular or WLAN) experience significant but
    transient variations in link quality and have policy constraints (e.g., bandwidth)
    that affect user experience. Collaborative signaling (e.g., host-to-network and
    server-to-network) can improve the user experience by informing the network about
    the nature and relative importance of packets (frames, streams, etc.) without
    having to disclose the content of the packets. Moreover, the collaborative signalling
    may be enabled so that hosts are aware of the network's treatment of incoming
    packets. Also, host-to-network collaboration can be put in place without revealing
    the identity of the remote servers. This collaboration allows for differentiated
    services at the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive
    transmission), or through cooperation of server / host and the network. This document
    lists some use cases that illustrate the need for a mechanism to share metadata
    and outlines requirements for both host- to-network (and vice versa) and server-to-network
    (and vice versa). The document focuses on intra-flow or flows bound to the same
    user.</p>"
