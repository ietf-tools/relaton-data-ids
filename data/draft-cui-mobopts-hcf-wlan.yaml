abstract:
- content: "<p>This document propose a scheme to support MIP6 deployment based on
    Wireless LAN by extending HMIPv6. The HCF (Handover Control Function) described
    in this document should record all APs's MAC address, backend AR's address and
    network prefix of those APs. All MNs will periodically report all AP's MAC address
    and signal strength information to HCF which MN can probe, then HCF should decide
    whether or which AP MN shall associate with and notify MN about the new AP/ AR's
    information, meanwhile, a bi-cast mechanism shall be applied to further improve
    handover performance by reducing the packet loss during handover. This mechanism
    can be used in the nationwide university Wireless LAN based MIP6 network deployment
    to support VoIP and Video Telephony.</p>"
