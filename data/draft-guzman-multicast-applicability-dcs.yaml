abstract:
- content: "<p>This document questions the applicability of a multicast semantic for
    the distributed consensus problem. For this, it details the consensus problem
    and the solutions taken in current systems. It outlines how point-to-multipoint
    communication arises as part of the consensus solution. Then, it details a peer-centric
    realization of a permissionless approach, identifying key issues. These issues
    include communication costs, performance delays, and lack of finality. Hence,
    it discusses a multicast strawman and its expected improvements.</p>"
