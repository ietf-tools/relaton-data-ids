abstract:
- content: "<p>The route redistribution is often deployed in current network between
    two different protocols domain or instance/process, such as the ISIS domain redistribute
    to OSPF domain, the OSPF domain redistribute to BGP domain, IS-IS redistribute
    to another IS-IS instance/process and so on. The existing network have more complex
    multiple IGP domains architecture. Therefore, bidirectional route redistribution
    deployment is more complex for different protocols or instances/ processes to
    learn routes from each other. In recent years, these route redistributions have
    had many routing loops cases that cause network incident. This document proposes
    a simplified method to positively avoid routing loop, and introduces new sub-TLVs
    to support advertisement IPv4 and IPv6 prefix extended attribute as Redistribution
    Credibility ID, while redistributing route from one protocol domain or instance/
    process to another.</p>"
