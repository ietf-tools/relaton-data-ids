abstract:
- content: "<p>This document implements an accurate network delay measurement method
    based on the digital twin network. This is a use case of digital twin network.
    This method does not need to send measurement packets, does not need to change
    the physical network configuration, does not need to change the format of service
    packets, do not require physical network elements to support the time synchronization
    protocol, and support the one-way delay measurement of any service packet.The
    digital twin network architecture of this document follows the NMRG working group
    paper draft-irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch-00.</p>"
