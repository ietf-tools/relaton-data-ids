abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC2547-bis] is a peer-to-peer VPN model allowing customers to establish
    unicast routed connectivity over L3 VPNs. But [RFC2547bis] does not provide a
    means for customers to establish multicast distribution trees over these VPNs.
    This text proposes a simple means for supporting multicast over [RFC2547-bis]
    VPNs. The solution is generic and can be used with most multicast IGPs (M-IGPs)
    including PIM-SM, PIM-DM, IGMP proxy and CBT. The proposed technique allows a
    PE to act as a gateway between multicast M-IGP peers in the CE and the MBGP-based
    VPN. The PE maintains an M-IGMP peering relationship with an M-IGP agent at the
    CE. Through the M-IGP peering session the PE receives group membership information.
    The PE gateway exports this membership information to BGP. The information is
    then conveyed to the appropriate far-end PE by means of MBGP with proposed extensions.
    The far-end PE imports this membership information and acts on it according to
    the rules of the M-IGP it is supporting. In general the far-end PE will setup/teardown
    a forwarding entry for this group and pass the join/prune information toward the
    source. In order, to keep this protocol simple, this solution is directed only
    at the Source-Specific Multicast service model, but is structured in a way that
    does not explicitly preclude future expansion to cover the Any-Source Multicast
    service model. Another simplifying assumption regards the topology of the VPN.
    Multicast protocols are often designed with the assumption that the IGP routing
    on which it is based is symmetrical throughout the network. The proposal maintains
    this assumption. The solution is not necessarily applicable to all the possible
    multi-level, overlapping, asymmetrical VPN topologies that are possible within
    [2547-bis]. Rather, this proposal is directed at the fully-meshed VPNs with symmetrical
    routing metrics at each PE.</p>"
