abstract:
- content: '<p>The Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) offers several authentication
    chemes, but many sites use redirection-based protocols to authenticate users.
    Some servers are faced with a connundrum, having to choose between two mutually-exclusive
    options: redirect responses or 401 (authentication required) responses without
    knowing which the user-agent is most likely to support. This document specifies
    a new HTTP request header, "Accept-Auth", that user-agents may use to indicate
    their authentication capabilities, including support (or not) for chasing redirects.
    Also specified is a new HTTP authentication scheme named Redirect, operating via
    3xx or 401 responses at the server''s choice.</p>'
