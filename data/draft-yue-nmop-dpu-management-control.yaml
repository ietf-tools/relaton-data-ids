abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a DPU-based bare metal management solution to
    address inefficiencies in management and resource utilization associated with
    traditional bare metal deployments. The core idea of this solution is to leverage
    the DPU's high-performance processing and network acceleration capabilities, transforming
    traditional network/resource management into a DPU-centric control model. This
    not only simplifies bare-metal operations but achieves unified management across
    virtualized and physical environments through a consolidated framework.</p>"
