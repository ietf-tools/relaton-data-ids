abstract:
- content: "<p>The end-to-end principle is the core architectural guideline of the
    Internet. In this document, we briefly examine the development of the end-to-end
    principle as it has been applied to the Internet architecture over the years.
    We discuss current trends in the evolution of the Internet architecture in relation
    to the end-to-end principle, and try to draw some conclusion about the evolution
    of the end-to-end principle, and thus for the Internet architecture which it supports,
    in light of these current trends. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
