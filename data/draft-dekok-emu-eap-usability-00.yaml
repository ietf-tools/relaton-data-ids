abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines methods which enable simpler deployment of TLS-
    based EAP methods. It defines new certificate fields, and uses existing certificate
    fields in order describe new methods for bootstrapping security. The methods defined
    here change TLS-based EAP supplicant configuration from a complex and insecure
    process to one that is automated, and is essentially trivial. These methods are
    still, however, compatible with existing standards and practices.</p>"
