abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).
    HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes. HIP is
    based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers from a new
    Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication. The protocol is designed
    to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
    When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the Encapsulating
    Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional encryption
    for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP. This document obsoletes RFC 5201
    and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto agility.
    It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC 5201.</p>"
