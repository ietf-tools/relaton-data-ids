abstract:
- content: "<p>This document creates a registry for describing the types of services
    available at a specific location. The registry is expected to be referenced by
    other protocols that need a common set of service terms as protocol constants.
    In particular, we define location-based service as either a point at a specific
    geographic location (e.g., bus stop) or a service covering a specific region (e.g.,
    pizza delivery).</p>"
