abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it defines managed objects used for managing source routing and source routing
    transparent bridges. These bridges are also required to implement relevant groups
    in the Bridge MIB [8]. The MIB module contained in this memo is updated to be
    defined using the SNMPv2 SMI [1], but is otherwise identical to that contained
    in [18].</p>"
