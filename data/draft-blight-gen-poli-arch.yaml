abstract:
- content: "<p>Out goal is describe a simple policy framework (or architecture) which
    is both practical to implement, and easy to extend. Our framework is driven by
    the in- formation which needs to be exchanged, and the communication system required
    to implement it. We view policies as a specification for network management systems,
    and have constructed our framework based on that assumption. We forces us to consider
    a more general architecture, than one based on QoS assumptions alone.</p>"
