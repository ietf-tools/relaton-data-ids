abstract:
- content: "<p>The growing SIP message size and the ensuing IP fragmentation, scalability
    and performance efficiencies gained by multiplexing SIP sessions over fewer reliable
    transport connections, efficient use of security certificates etc. are engendering
    widespread use of connection-oriented protocols for SIP transport. A variety of
    SIP transport related issues are currently being discussed in the IETF including
    connection reuse, persistent connections, outbound connection flows, SIP over
    SCTP, NAT traversal, and SIP/TCP race conditions. This document attempts to unify
    these techniques by describing practical guidelines for implementers and takes
    a broad stroke at defining SIP Connection Management. We hope to abstract the
    diverse connection techniques into a few generic connection characteristics, which
    then help define a few common connection models and use cases.</p>"
