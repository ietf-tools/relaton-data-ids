abstract:
- content: "<p>Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or inter-data
    center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the operation of networks.
    They need on-demand and application-specific reservation of network connectivity,
    reliability, and resources (such as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications
    (such as point-to- point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile back-haul)
    and in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to optical.
    Additionally, existing services or capabilities like pseudowire connectivity or
    global concurrent optimization can benefit from a operational scheme that considers
    the application needs and the network status. An environment that operates to
    meet these types of requirement is said to have Application-Based Network Operations
    (ABNO). ABNO brings together many existing technologies for gathering information
    about the resources available in a network, for consideration of topologies and
    how those topologies map to underlying network resources, for requesting path
    computation, and for provisioning or reserving network resources. Thus, ABNO may
    be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new
    elements. The key component within an ABNO is the Path Computation Element (PCE),
    which can be used for computing paths and is further extended to provide policy
    enforcement capabilities for ABNO. This document describes an architecture and
    framework for ABNO showing how these components fit together. It provides a cookbook
    of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs of the
    applications.</p>"
