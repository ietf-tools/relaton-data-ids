abstract:
- content: "<p>Bump-in-the-Host (BIH) is a host-based IPv4 to IPv6 protocol translation
    mechanism that allows a class of IPv4-only applications that work through NATs
    to communicate with IPv6-only peers. The host on which applications are running
    may be connected to IPv6-only or dual-stack access networks. BIH hides IPv6 and
    makes the IPv4-only applications think they are talking with IPv4 peers by local
    synthesis of IPv4 addresses. This document obsoletes RFC 2767 and RFC 3338. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
