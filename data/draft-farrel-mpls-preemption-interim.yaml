abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an interim report into pre-emption in MPLS systems.
    At the 58th IETF, the MPLS Working Group determined that there are several interpretations
    of how pre-emption should be achieved within MPLS systems. This document is the
    result of the initial enquiries to vendors and other implementors into the question
    of how and why they offer pre-emption funtion in their MPLS inplementations. This
    document is intended to be a short-lived document and only exists to document
    the current findings. It will be superceded or retired.</p>"
