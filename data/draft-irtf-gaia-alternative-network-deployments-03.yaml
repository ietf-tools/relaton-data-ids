abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network Deployments",
    and a set of definitions and shared properties. It also surveys the technologies
    employed in these networks, and their differing architectural characteristics.
    The term "Alternative Network Deployments" includes a set of network access models
    that have emerged in the last decade. These networks aim to bring Internet connectivity
    to people, using topological, architectural and business models different from
    the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys or leases the network
    infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be connected
    and make use of it. Several initiatives throughout the world have built large
    scale Alternative Networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including
    long distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed spectrum. Wired technologies
    such as fiber are also used in some of these alternate networks. The emergence
    of these networks has been motivated by a variety of factors such as the reluctance
    of network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote
    areas. In these cases, the networks have self-sustaining business models that
    provide more localized communication services as well as Internet backhaul support
    through peering agreements with traditional network operators. In other cases,
    networks are built as a complement to commercial Internet access provided by "traditional"
    network operators. The present classification considers extant network models
    such as Community Networks, which are self-organized and decentralized networks
    wholly owned by the community; networks owned by individuals who act as Wireless
    Internet Service Providers (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out
    to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved
    population, and finally there are networks that provide connectivity by sharing
    wireless resources of the users. Different criteria are used in order to build
    a classification e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is
    organized, the participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a
    community, a company or a local stakeholder (public or private), etc. According
    to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind of network is presented
    in terms of specific network characteristics related to architecture, organization,
    etc.</p>
