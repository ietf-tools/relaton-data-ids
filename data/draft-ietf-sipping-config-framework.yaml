abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework to enable configuration of Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agents (UAs) in SIP deployments. The framework
    provides a means to deliver profile data that user agents need to be functional,
    automatically and with minimal or no User and Administrative intervention. The
    framework describes how SIP user agents can discover sources, request profiles,
    and receive notifications related to profile modifications. As part of this framework,
    a new SIP event package is defined for notification of profile changes. The framework
    provides minimal data retrieval options to ensure interoperability. The framework
    does not include specification of the profile data within its scope. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
