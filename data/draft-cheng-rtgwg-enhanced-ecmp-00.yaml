abstract:
- content: "<p>In AI training scenarios, the current mainstream load balancing technology
    is per-flow ECMP. However, hash collision issues lead to imbalanced traffic distribution,
    adversely affecting application performance. To address this problem, this document
    proposes an enhanced ECMP method that resolves load imbalance caused by hash collisions.
    The proposed solution effectively improves load balancing efficiency, reduces
    network congestion, and enhances overall network performance.</p>"
