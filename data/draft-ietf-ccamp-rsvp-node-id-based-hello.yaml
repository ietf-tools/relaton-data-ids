abstract:
- content: "<p>Use of Node-ID based Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Hello messages
    is implied in a number of cases, e.g., when data and control planes are separated,
    when TE links are unnumbered. Furthermore, when link level failure detection is
    performed by some means other than exchanging RSVP Hello messages, use of a Node-ID
    based Hello session is optimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for Resource
    reSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE). Nonetheless, this implied
    behavior is unclear, and this document formalizes use of the Node-ID based RSVP
    Hello session in some scenarios. The procedure described in this document applies
    to both Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) capable
    nodes. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
