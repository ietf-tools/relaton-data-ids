abstract:
- content: "<p>Path scheduling is required in many network scenarios. For example,
    some links or nodes will be shut down in the tidal network when the traffic decreases,
    which may lead to the expiration of some routing paths. This document defines
    a new type of component for BGP Flow Specification to identify the packets arrived
    at different time slot. Based on that, the headend can steer packets into different
    paths at different time.</p>"
