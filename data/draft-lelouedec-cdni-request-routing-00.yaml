abstract:
- content: <p>The present document proposes to clarify the CDNI Request Routing interface
    introduced in [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] and [I-D.ietf-cdni- problem-statement],
    as well as related terminology. In particular the present document proposes to
    split the CDNI Request Routing interface into two separate interfaces with clearer
    roles, named respectively CDNI Routing interface and CDNI Downstream Resource
    Identifier Signaling interface (CDNI DRIS interface). This part of the CDN interconnection
    framework the IETF has been referring to so far with the term "CDNI Request Routing"
    is just another routing, signaling and forwarding problem in a long series of
    the telecommunication history. For example, one can draw a direct analogy between
    the IP/MPLS-TE framework and the CDN interconnection framework. In addition, this
    document recommends that the specification of ALL CDN interconnection interfaces
    in the scope of the CDNI IETF WG relies on the equivalent concept to IP prefix
    for CDN interconnection, named 'contentRequestScope'. This highly useful and powerful
    concept SHALL be used to simplify the specification of ALL CDN interconnection
    interfaces, as well as to ensure performance and scalability in CDN interconnection.
    All these proposals can be smoothly integrated in the WG drafts, especially [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework]
    and [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements], as they essentially propose (useful) clarifications
    of the existing framework.</p>
