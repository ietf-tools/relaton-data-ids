abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an alternative approach to inter-area traffic
    engineering and path setup. It recognizes the potential issues with current proposals
    and presents a different approach based on concurrently sending path setup messages.
    The approach allows for fast, efficient path setup across multiple areas without
    crankback or flooding. It does so without introducing a new protocol or changing
    the IGP and requires only minimal extensions of the current signaling protocols.</p>"
