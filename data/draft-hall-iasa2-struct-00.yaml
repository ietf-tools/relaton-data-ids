abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established
    in 2005. In the intervening years, the needs of the IETF have evolved in ways
    that require changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this document
    is to spur discussion by outlining some details of what an "IASA 2.0" arrangement
    could look like. The proposal is for the execution of the IETF's administrative
    and fundraising tasks to be conducted by a new administrative organization ("IETFAdminOrg").
    The IAOC would be eliminated, and its oversight and advising functions transferred
    to the IETFAdminOrg board and a new IETF Administrative Advisory Council, respectively.</p>
