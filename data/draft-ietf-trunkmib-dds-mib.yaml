abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for management of Digital Dataphone Service (DDS) interfaces.
    Along with the Definition of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware Devices
    using SMIv2 [TBD], this memo also provides basic management capabilities for DDS
    DSU/CSU-like interfaces. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is
    both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
    definitions. This document reflects the work being done by the trunk-mib working
    group (trunk-mib@cisco.com).</p>"
