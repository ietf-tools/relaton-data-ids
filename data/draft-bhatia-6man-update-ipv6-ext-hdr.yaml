abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate
    headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the upper-layer header
    in a packet. There are a small number of such extension headers, each identified
    by a distinct Next Header value. However, it presents no backward compatible way
    for incrementally introducing new IPv6 extension headers inside the network. Additionally
    since there is no standard format for extension headers, it becomes impossible
    for intermediaries that want to deep inspect the packet to parse an incoming packet
    which carries an extension header that it does not recognize. This document attempts
    to standardize the IPv6 extension header format to fix these issues.</p>"
