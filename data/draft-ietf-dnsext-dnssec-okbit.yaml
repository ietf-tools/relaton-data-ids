abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to deploy DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)
    operationally, DNSSEC aware servers should only perform automatic inclusion of
    DNSSEC RRs when there is an explicit indication that the resolver can understand
    those RRs. This document proposes the use of a bit in the EDNS0 header to provide
    that explicit indication and describes the necessary protocol changes to implement
    that notification. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
