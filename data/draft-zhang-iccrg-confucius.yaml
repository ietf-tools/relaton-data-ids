- content: "<p>This document describes Confucius -- a practical queue management scheme
    designed for offering real-time flows with consistently low latency regardless
    of competition. Confucius employs an age-aware weight adjustment mechanism to
    slows down bandwidth adjustment to match the reaction of congestion control, so
    that the end host can reduce the sending rate without overshooting the network.
    Confucius is deployed on home routers and requires no configuration in normal
    Internet deployments.</p>"
