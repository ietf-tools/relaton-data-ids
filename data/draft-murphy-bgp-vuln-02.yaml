abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed before
    the Internet environment became perilous, was originally designed with little
    consideration for protection of the information it carries. There are no mechanisms
    internal to the BGP protocol to protect against attacks that modify, delete, forge,
    or replay data, any of which has the potential to disrupt overall network routing
    behavior. This internet draft discusses some of the security issues with BGP routing
    data dissemination. This internet draft does not discuss security issues with
    forwarding of packets.</p>"
