abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last six years the IETF has developed a number of protocols
    that are expected to be useful for localized mobility management (LMM), both for
    IPv4 and IPv6. All of these protocols were designed as extensions to Mobile IPv4
    and Mobile IPv6. However, more recently, the IESG has approved the formation of
    the NETLMM WG, which aims to develop a network-based localized mobility management
    protocol. This memo discusses the impacts of a network-based mobility management
    protocol on the Internet and the IETF. The aim of this memo is to generate discussion
    in this area in order to better critique the network-based approach and show its
    impacts.</p>"
