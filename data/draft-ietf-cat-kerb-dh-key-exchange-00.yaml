abstract:
- content: "<p>The Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] currently establishes session keys
    by the assertion of one party (usually the KDC). This document describes a method
    for using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to establish the shared secret between
    a Kerberos client and application service. For the purposes of this document,
    the Ticket Granting Service is considered an application service.</p>"
