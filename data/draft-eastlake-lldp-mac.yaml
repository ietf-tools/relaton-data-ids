abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802 has defined a number of protocols which operate between adjacent
    Ethernet stations at Layer 2, including bridges, such as the Link Layer Discover
    Protocol (IEEE 802.1AB, LLDP). LLDP and other such protocols may be useful between
    Layer 3 aware stations such as IP routers and hosts. This document specifies a
    MAC address that can be used for this purpose despite intervening bridges.</p>"
