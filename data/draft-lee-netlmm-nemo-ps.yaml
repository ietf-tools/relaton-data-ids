abstract:
- content: "<p>The PMIPv6 protocol provides local mobility to a mobile node without
    its involvement in mobility management. To provide session continuity without
    involvement of the mobile node, MAG and LMA maintain forwarding information for
    the mobile node's HNP. If the mobile node is a mobile router and the PMIPv6 domain
    is a home network of it, the MAG and LMA should also have forwarding state for
    MNP. This memo describes several NEMO related issues including this.</p>"
