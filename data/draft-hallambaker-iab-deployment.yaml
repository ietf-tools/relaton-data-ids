abstract:
- content: "<p>The defining feature of a standard is that it be widely, preferably
    ubiquitously used. The deployment strategies of previous protocol standardization
    efforts are compared and best practice suggested for application and infrastructure
    protocol deployment strategies are described. Recommendations for enabling deployment
    of specific protocols and for future IETF working practices are made. This draft
    is a generalization of the principles used to develop the deployment strategy
    for the Mathematical Mesh. Many documents describing deployment considerations
    have been developed during the development of the Mesh and these have motivated
    many changes to the design during the course of development. The Mesh is consciously
    and deliberately modeled on the same strategies that succeeded in the Web. Some
    of these strategies are well known: Other parts of the Web strategy have not been
    widely discussed. This paper presents some parts of the strategy most relevant
    to the IAB workshop program. This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-iab-deployment.html
