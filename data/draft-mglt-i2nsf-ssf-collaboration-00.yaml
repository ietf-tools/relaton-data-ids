abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a collaboration agreement protocol. The collaboration
    agreement makes possible individual security services functions (SSF) to collaborate
    with each other. The collaboration is mostly intended for SSF located in different
    administrative domains, in which case the collaboration cannot be performed by
    a shared orchestrator. The collaboration between SSF in different domains assumes
    the traffic is steered through the two domains.</p>"
