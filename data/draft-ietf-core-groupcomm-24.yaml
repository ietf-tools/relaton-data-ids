abstract:
- content: "<p>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer
    protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks. It is anticipated that
    constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building
    automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off
    as a group). This specification defines how the CoAP protocol should be used in
    a group communication context. An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast
    is detailed based on both existing CoAP functionality as well as new features
    introduced in this specification. Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol
    flows are provided to illustrate important concepts. Finally, guidance is provided
    for deployment in various network topologies.</p>"
