abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is
    based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as specified in
    the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) and multi-segment PW (MS-PW)
    architectures complemented with additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance
    (OAM) procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management for
    packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of a control plane.
    This document provides a framework that supports a comprehensive set of OAM procedures
    that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [11].</p>"
