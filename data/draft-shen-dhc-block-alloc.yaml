abstract:
- content: "<p>A new DHCP address allocation mechanism called Micro-blocking is proposed
    in this document. It is used for DHCP proxy servers or routers working with DHCP
    servers to maximize the IP address allocation efficiency while improve dynamic
    routing scalability in provider's networks. A DHCP sub-option within the relay
    agent information option 82 is defined in this document. This simple DHCP extension
    can be applied as a simple IP address-pool management among multiple IP devices.</p>"
