abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Pisces, an ensemble video transport framework
    for real-time communication. Pisces complements the benefits of rule-based and
    learning-based approaches, without modifying the codec layer. Pisces uses an incremental
    and iterative reinforcement learning model to adapt to the unseen environment.
    When the real environment well matches the training environment, the learning-based
    approach is actively working. Otherwise, the rule- based approach is used to ensure
    transport safety. By simultaneously leveraging both rule-based logic and learning
    models to proactively probe network capacity, Pisces achieves high efficiency
    in both single-flow and cross-flow scenarios, while ensuring stable and fair cross-flow
    convergence. Pisces can be deployed in WebRTC, which replaces the default Google
    congestion control algorithm.</p>"
