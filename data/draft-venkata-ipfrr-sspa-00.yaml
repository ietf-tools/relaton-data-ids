abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a practical mechanism to implement IP fast
    reroute using dynamic SPF to compute local and remote loop free nexthops efficiently.
    Upon link failure, all the destinations reachable via the primary nexthop will
    be forwarded to alternative loop free nexthop, if any. If the alternative nexthop
    is remote, packet will be forwarded using any connectionless (for example, IP-in-IP)
    or connection-oriented (for example, MPLS) tunnels. This mechanism doesn't impose
    any new protocol message/capability exchange. It is shown that simple changes
    to existing IGP shortest path computation and routing table structures are sufficient
    to achieve the desired functionality. More over, routers which implement the proposed
    mechanism can co-exist and can be fully backward compatible with existing unmodified
    routers.</p>"
