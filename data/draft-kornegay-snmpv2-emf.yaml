abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo is a response to the SNMPv2 working group's current request
    for proposals related to the security aspects of SNMPv2. It is the purpose of
    this memo, Extensible Message Framework for the SNMP, to propose a unified and
    extensible framework supporting multiple versions of both SNMP and its security
    models. It is the intent of this proposal to, in theory, support SNMPv1, SNMPv2t,
    SNMPv2AM, USEC, and future versions of both SNMP and its security models. It is
    hoped that the SNMPv2 working group will determine that such a unified message
    format supporting extensibility in these areas is a necessary feature for SNMPv2,
    and SNMP in general, and will determine which security models using this proposal
    become a part of SNMP on the Internet standards track.</p>"
