abstract:
- content: "<p>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in which
    both the routers and their interconnects are constrained. LLN routers typically
    operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).
    LLN router supported traffic flows include point-to-point, point-to-multipoint,
    and multipoint-to- point. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provides the
    mechanisms to support those traffic flows. The currently available security services
    in RPL will not protect against a compromised internal node that can also construct
    and disseminate fake messages. In this document, a service is described that prevents
    an internal attacker from impersonating a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DODAG) root. Moreover, the establishment and maintenance of any cryptographic
    key is out of the scope of the current RPL proposal. In this document a service
    that allows nodes to agree on local keys with their neighborhood is also presented.</p>"
