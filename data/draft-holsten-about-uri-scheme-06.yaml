abstract:
- content: <p>A URI using the "about:" scheme, henceforth referred to as an "about"
    URI, is designed to be used internally by applications for almost any desired
    purpose. Such URIs have commonly been used by web browsers for providing access
    to built-in functionality, such as application information, preferences, settings,
    or "easter eggs".</p>
