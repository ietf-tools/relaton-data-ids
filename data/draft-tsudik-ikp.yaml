abstract:
- content: "<p>iKP - the Internet Keyed Payments protocol - defines an architecture
    for secure payments involving three or more participants. 'Architecture' means
    that iKP specifies a base protocol with a number of options that can be selected
    to meet varying business or security requirements. 'Secure payments' means that
    iKP employs cryptographic techniques to minimize potential risks concerning payments
    over the open Internet. 'Three or more parties' means that iKP addresses scenarios
    in which buyers and sellers invoke third-parties such as credit card systems or
    banks to accomplish payment transactions.</p>"
