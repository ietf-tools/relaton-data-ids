abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases on IP-
    based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent
    Transportation Systems (ITS). The main scenarios of vehicular communications are
    vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) communications. First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I, and
    V2X networking. Second, it analyzes proposed protocols for IP-based vehicular
    networking and highlights the limitations and difficulties found on those protocols.
    Third, it presents a problem exploration for key aspects in IP-based vehicular
    networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security
    &amp; Privacy. For each key aspect, this document discusses a problem statement
    to evaluate the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in
    IP-based vehicular networking.</p>"
