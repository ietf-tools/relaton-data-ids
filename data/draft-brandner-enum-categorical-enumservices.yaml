    communications categories. These are used as elements within the services field
    of NAPTR resource records within ENUM domain space. Each category identifies a
    kind of communications service in which an end user might want to engage using
    the associated resource. It includes the expected 'low level' service that comes
    under each category, together with a list of the URI schemes that are appropriate
    for use with each categorical enumservice.</p>"
