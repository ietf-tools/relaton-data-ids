abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss,
    delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic engineering
    (TE). This data provides operators the characteristics of their networks for performance
    evaluation that is required to ensure the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Performance
    measurement (PM) mechanisms can be employed to monitor these metrics for TE Label
    Switched Paths (LSPs) in real-time. This document describes Path Computation Element
    Protocol (PCEP) extensions for reporting such performance measurements to an Active
    Stateful PCE.</p>"
