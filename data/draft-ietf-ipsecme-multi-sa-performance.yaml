abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines two Notify Message Type Payloads for the Internet
    Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to support the negotiation of multiple
    Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors used on different resources, such as
    CPUs, to increase bandwidth of IPsec traffic between peers. The SA_RESOURCE_INFO
    notification is used to convey information that the negotiated Child SA and subsequent
    new Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors are a logical group of Child SAs
    where most or all of the Child SAs are bound to a specific resource, such as a
    specific CPU. The TS_MAX_QUEUE notify conveys that the peer is unwilling to create
    more additional Child SAs for this particular negotiated Traffic Selector combination.
    Using multiple Child SAs with the same Traffic Selectors has the benefit that
    each resource holding the Child SA has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring
    that CPUs don't have to synchronize their cryptographic state or disable their
    packet replay protection.</p>"
