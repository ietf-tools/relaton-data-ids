abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of the importance of the work done in the IETF, and because
    of the increasing cultural diversity of the participants, some of whom find our
    most-unrestrained 'style' hard to accommodate, I believe the time has come for
    the IETF to adopt a Code of Conduct to govern our interactions.</p>"
