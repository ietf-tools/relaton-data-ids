abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess
    the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide whether to engage
    in secure interactions with it. Evidence about trustworthiness can be rather complex
    and it is deemed unrealistic that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal
    of Evidence. Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to a Verifier. In order
    to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires not only fresh Evidence from
    an Attester, but also trusted Endorsements and Reference Values from Endorsers
    and Reference Value Providers, such as manufacturers, distributors, or device
    owners. This document specifies Concise Reference Integrity Manifests (CoRIM)
    that represent Endorsements and Reference Values in CBOR format. Composite devices
    or systems are represented by a collection of Concise Module Identifiers (CoMID)
    and Concise Software Identifiers (CoSWID) bundled in a CoRIM document.</p>"
