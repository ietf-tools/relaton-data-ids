abstract:
- content: '<p>In this draft, MMP-SCTP (MMP: Mobile Multi-Path) is proposed to allow
    a host to improve the transmission throughput in wireless mobile networks using
    simultaneous multi-path transmission of Stream Control Transmission Protocol.
    Relevant mobility issues of MMP-SCTP included are: (1) data transmission modes
    and path selection, (2) multi-path handover, and (3) location management. Two
    transmission modes of MMP- SCTP, i.e., the "Data-duplicating Mode" and "Data-striping
    Mode", and the switching mechanism, are designed to enhance transmission throughput
    for different wireless link status. Since the transmission paths used for MMP-SCTP
    may differ when an MMP-SCTP host moves, the multi-path handover problem is defined,
    and a multi-path handover mechanism for MMP-SCTP is proposed. Additionally, a
    location management scheme is also designed in this draft to tackle the locating
    of an MMP-SCTP host.</p>'
