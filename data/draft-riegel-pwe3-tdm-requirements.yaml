abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the particular requirements for edge-to-edge-emulation
    of circuits carrying time division multiplexed digital signals of the PDH as well
    as the SONET/SDH hierarchy over packet-switched networks. It is based on the common
    architecture for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) as defined in [PWE3-ARCH].
    It makes references to requirements in [PWE3-REQ] where applicable and complements
    [PWE3-REQ] by defining requirements originating from specifics of TDM circuits.</p>"
