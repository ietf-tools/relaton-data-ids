abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG module for policy-based network access
    control, which provides consistent and efficient enforcement of network access
    control policies based on group identity. Moreover, this document defines a mechanism
    to ease the maintenance of the mapping between a user group identifier and a set
    of IP/MAC addresses to enforce policy-based network access control. Also, the
    document defines a common schedule YANG module which is designed to be applicable
    for policy activation based on date and time conditions. In addition, the document
    defines a RADIUS attribute that is used to communicate the user group identifier
    as part of identification and authorization information.</p>"
