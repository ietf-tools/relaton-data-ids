abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to describe how Ethernet Virtual Private
    Network (E-VPN) can be used as the control plane for Network Virtual Overlays.
    Currently this protocol is defined to act as the control plane for Virtual Extensible
    Local Area Network (VXLAN), Network Virtualization using Generic Routing Encapsulation
    (NVGRE), MPLS or VLANs while maintaining their existing data plane encapsulations.
    The intent is that this protocol will be capable of extensions in the future to
    handle additinal data plane encapsulations and functions as needed.</p>"
