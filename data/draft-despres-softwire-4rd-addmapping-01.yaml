abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a mechanism, the 4rd address mapping, for service
    providers to offer residual deployment of the IPv4 service across IPv6-only domains.
    Ease of operation and scalability are due to this address mapping being stateless
    (no per customer states). IPv4 address sharing is based on exclusive port sets
    assigned to customers, these sets being algorithmically derived from bits used
    as port-set identifiers. Features include support of shared IPv4 addresses, same
    routes for IPv4 as for IPv6, and compatibility with both provider aggregatable
    and provider-independent IPv4 prefixes. The whole 4rd address mapping or part
    of it can be used combined with various tunneling and double-translation methods.
    It can also be used either alone or in parallel with stateful mechanisms used
    for their flexibility where necessary.</p>"
