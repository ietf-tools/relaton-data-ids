abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses privacy properties of the SCONE metadata or
    network-to-host signals. This covers questions that were raised during the IETF
    119 BoF and subsequent discussions. It is not intended to be published as a separate
    RFC but might be incorporated as a part of the security considerations or other
    content within eventual SCONE RFCs together with other documents covering security
    considerations. Other documents will address additional aspects of the security
    considerations for SCONE metadata.</p>"
