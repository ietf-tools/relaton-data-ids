abstract:
- content: "<p>As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach
    is needed to Mobile IPv6. This document defines a distributed mobility management
    protocol with multicast support. Protocol is based on Mobile IPv6 and its extensions
    for multiple care of address registration, flow mobility and dual stack mobile
    IPv6 with minimum extensions. Control and data plane separation is achieved by
    separating Home Agent functionalities into the control and data planes.</p>"
