abstract:
- content: "<p>This document extends the base definition of ABNF (Augmented Backus-
    Naur Form) to express a rule that is constrained by another rule. If a rule B
    is constrained by rule A, then every production generated by rule B must also
    be generated by rule A. By creating subordinate production forms, ABNF-using specifications
    can formally denote the relationship between a general rule and specific subsets
    of that rule, while preserving ABNF's context-free nature.</p>"
