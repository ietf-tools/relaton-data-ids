abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security
    (DTLS) protocol to protect user messages sent over the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP). It is an improved update of the existing rfc6083. DTLS over SCTP
    provides mutual authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection, and replay
    protection for applications that use SCTP as their transport protocol and allows
    client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to give communications
    privacy and to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery.
    Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport features provided
    by SCTP and its extensions. This document intends to obsolete RFC 6083 and removes
    the 16 kB limitation due to DTLS on user message size by defining a secure user
    message fragmentation so that multiple DTLS records can be used to protect a single
    user message. It further updates the DTLS versions to use, as well as the HMAC
    algorithms for SCTP-AUTH, and simplifies secure implementation by some stricter
    requirements on the establishment procedures.</p>"
