abstract:
- content: <p>This memo documents an extension of the OSPF protocol to reach "ExStart"
    state more quickly. Currently, the OSPF behavior requires the Hello Packet to
    be sent between the neighbors every HelloInterval. This document proposes to generalize
    the use of Immediately Replying Hello which could reduce the time required to
    reach the OSPF "ExStart" state and expedite the routing table convergence.</p>
