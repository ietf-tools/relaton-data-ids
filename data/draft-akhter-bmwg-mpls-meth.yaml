abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this draft is to describe a methodology specific to
    the benchmarking of MPLS forwarding devices. The scope of this benchmarking will
    be limited to various types of packet-forwarding and delay measurements. It builds
    upon the tenets set forth in RFC2544 [RFC2544], RFC1242 [RFC1242] and other IETF
    Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts. This document seeks to
    extend these efforts to the MPLS paradigm.</p>"
