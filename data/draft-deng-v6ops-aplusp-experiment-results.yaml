abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an implementation of A+P in a provider's IPv6-
    only network. It provides details of the implementation, network elements, configurations
    and test results as well. Besides traditional port range A+P, a scattered port
    sets flavour of A+P is also implemented and verified for the sake of distributing
    incoming ports among customers in a more discrete way. The test results consist
    of the application compatibility test, UPnP extension for A+P, port usage and
    BitTorrent behaviour with A+P. This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor of A+P.</p>"
