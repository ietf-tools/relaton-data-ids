abstract:
- content: <p>The CXTP specification uses basic SCTP as transport for CXTP message
    exchanges between a mobile node's previous and new access routers. It also relies
    on a pre-established IPsec ESP transport mode tunnel. This document discusses
    two alternative approaches based on "persistent" associations using either SCTP
    streams feature or GIST protocol. While both approaches reduce context transfer
    latency during handovers, GIST also offers more flexible transport and richer
    security properties.</p>
