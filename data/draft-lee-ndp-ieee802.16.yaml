abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.16 issued the new standards for PHY and MAC providing broadband
    wireless access network. Currently, it is being developed under the assumption
    that IPv4 is used over it and the use of IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 networks has not
    been considered yet. Hence, this draft describes several problems in running NDP
    over IEEE 802.16 networks and presents some proposed solutions for those problems.</p>"
