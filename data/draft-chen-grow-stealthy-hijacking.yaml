abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how incomplete adoption of Route Origin Validation
    (ROV) makes certain forms of BGP hijacking less visible on the control plane while
    still capable of diverting traffic. We explain the underlying mechanism, define
    the form of the threat, analyze an real-world incident that exemplifies the issue,
    and discuss potential countermeasures to mitigate its impact.</p>"
