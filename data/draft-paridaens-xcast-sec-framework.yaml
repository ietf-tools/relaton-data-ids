abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the general issues related to securing explicit
    multicast traffic. Explicit multicast is a mechanism aiming at providing multicast
    services for small groups of users. The distinctive characteristics of explicit
    multicast is that the sender specifies the list of receivers. This document reviews
    and discusses security issues related to the explicit IP multicast model, hence
    providing a general framework for securing explicit multicast IP traffic as described
    in [1].</p>"
