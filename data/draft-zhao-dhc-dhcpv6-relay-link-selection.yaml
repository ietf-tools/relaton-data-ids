abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new Relay Agent Link Selection(RALS) option
    for the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).The new option is
    inserted by the DHCPv6 relay agent when forwarding client- originated DHCPv6 packets
    to a DHCPv6 server. Servers recognizing this new option can include link-selection
    information as part of policies about address assignment, prefix delegation, or
    other DHCP parameters.</p>"
