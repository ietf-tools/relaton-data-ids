abstract:
- content: <p>This document contains a "roadmap" to the Requests for Comments (RFC)
    documents relating to the Internet's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This
    roadmap provides a brief summary of the documents defining TCP and various TCP
    extensions that have accumulated in the RFC series. This serves as a guide and
    quick reference for both TCP implementers and other parties who desire information
    contained in the TCP-related RFCs. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>
