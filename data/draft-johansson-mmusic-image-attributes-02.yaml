abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to make
    it possible to negotiate different image attributes such as image size. A possible
    use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-end hand-held terminal to display
    video without the need to rescale the image, something that may consume large
    amounts of memory and processing power. The draft also helps to maintain an optimal
    bitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is transmitted.Requirements
