abstract:
- content: "<p>MOBIKE is a protocol which adds mobility and multihome support for
    IKEv2. MOBIKE peers continuously exchange a list of available IP addresses each
    other. A MOBIKE peer should have some information about the status of each address
    and interface in order to execute the respective actions. Examples may comprise
    switching from one address or interface to another. This information, which will
    be referred as trigger, is distributed over a number of protocol daemons at an
    end host. To make this information available to a MOBIKE daemon, it is necessary
    to store it centrally at the host (called trigger database) and to enable the
    protocols to insert the triggers and to allow MOBIKE to obtain timely information.</p>"
