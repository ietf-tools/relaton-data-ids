abstract:
- content: '<p>The Sieve Email Filtering "include" extension permits users to include
    one Sieve script inside another. This can make managing large scripts or multiple
    sets of scripts much easier, as well as supporting common ''libraries'' of scripts.
    Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide scripts provided
    by the local Sieve implementation. Change History (to be removed prior to publication
    as an RFC) Changes from -05 to -06: a. Aaron Stone joins as author. b. Removed
    | characters from the script examples. c. Updated draft references to published
    RFCs. Changes from -04 to -05: a. Fixed examples. b. Relaxed requirement that
    imported/exported variables be set before being used. Changes from -03 to -04:
    a. Fixed missing 2119 definitions. b. Defined interaction with variables through
    use of import and export commands. Changes from -02 to -03: a. Refreshing expired
    draft (updated for nits). b. Syntax -&gt; Usage. c. Updated to 3028bis reference.
    Changes from -01 to -02: a. Minor formatting changes only - refreshing expired
    draft. Changes from -00 to -01: a. Added IPR boiler plate. b. Re-ordered sections
    at start to conform to RFC style. c. Moved recursion comment into General Considerations
    section. d. Switched to using optional parameter to indicate personal vs global.
    e. Explicitly state that an error occurs when a missing script is included.Open
    Issues (to be resolved prior to publication as an RFC) a. Interaction with variables
    (scoping). Should variables be carried over between scripts that are included?
    Or should variables defined in an included script be local to that script only?</p>'
