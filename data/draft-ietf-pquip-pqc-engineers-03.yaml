abstract:
- content: "<p>The presence of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC)
    would render state-of-the-art, traditional public-key algorithms deployed today
    obsolete, since the assumptions about the intractability of the mathematical problems
    for these algorithms that offer confident levels of security today no longer apply
    in the presence of a CRQC. This means there is a requirement to update protocols
    and infrastructure to use post-quantum algorithms, which are public-key algorithms
    designed to be secure against CRQCs as well as classical computers. These new
    public-key algorithms behave similarly to previous public key algorithms, however
    the intractable mathematical problems have been carefully chosen so they are hard
    for CRQCs as well as classical computers. This document explains why engineers
    need to be aware of and understand post-quantum cryptography. It emphasizes the
    potential impact of CRQCs on current cryptographic systems and the need to transition
    to post-quantum algorithms to ensure long-term security. The most important thing
    to understand is that this transition is not like previous transitions from DES
    to AES or from SHA-1 to SHA-2. While drop-in replacement may be possible in some
    cases, others will require protocol re-design to accommodate significant differences
    in behavior between the new post-quantum algorithms and the classical algorithms
    that they are replacing.</p>"
