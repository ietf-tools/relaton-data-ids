abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to provide a means of proving ownership of telephone numbers
    on the Internet, some kind of public structure needs to exist that binds cryptographic
    keys to authority over telephone numbers. This document describes a certificate-based
    credential system for telephone numbers, which could be used as a part of a broader
    architecture for managing telephone numbers as identities in protocols like SIP.</p>"
