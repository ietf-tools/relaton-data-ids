abstract:
- content: "<p>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport
    Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and the ITU-T is document in
    RFC 5317 as the decision of the Joint Working Team on MPLS-TP. This document provides
    additional detail of the processes for the development of IETF RFCs on MPLS-TP.
    It provides an adaptation of the IETF working group process; identifies the expected
    participation in the process by the ITU-T; and clarifies the rules and conventions
    regarding MPLS-TP documents. This document does not specify any ITU-T process;
    ITU-T activities will be done according to ITU-T process/rules. This document
    does not specify or modify the normal IETF working group process. It is limited
    to the specific adaptations of that process to facilitate the cooperation agreement
    between the IETF and the ITU-T on MPLS-TP, and to ensure a good and consistent
    document review across the two organizations. This document is a product of a
    joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication
    Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS
    Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities
    and functionalities of a packet transport network.</p>"
