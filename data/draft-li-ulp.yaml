abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a payload format for generic forward error
    correction to achieve uneven level protection (ULP) of media encapsulated in RTP.
    It is an extension to the forward error correction scheme specified in RFC 2733
    [1], and it is also based on the exclusive-or (parity) operation. The payload
    format allows end systems to transmit using arbitrary protection length and levels,
    in additional to using arbitrary block lengths. It also allows for the both complete
    recovery of the critical payload and RTP header fields, and partial recovery when
    complete recovery is not possible due to the packet lost situation. This scheme
    is backward compatible with non-FEC capable hosts, and hosts that are only capable
    of FEC schemes specified in RFC2733 [1], so that receivers which do not wish to
    implement ULP forward error correction can just ignore the extensions.</p>"
