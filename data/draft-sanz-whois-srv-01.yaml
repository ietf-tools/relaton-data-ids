abstract:
- content: "<p>Whois servers are used to locate administrative, technical and security
    contacts for given IP addresses, domain names or other network objects associated
    with an organisation, e.g. AS numbers. While usually Top Level Domain (TLD) registries
    run a whois server, there is no generic name for it and it may not even be obvious
    that the TLD registry's whois server is the right one to ask, since there are
    TLDs where registration takes place under specialised second level domains (e.g.
    UK, AT). The Regional Internet Registries (RIR) also provide whois service as
    part of their coordination task. All this can be solved by central 'master' or
    'meta' whois servers, which keep track of all new and changing servers and refer
    to the DNS registries' or RIRs' whois servers. This document proposes a DNS-based
    approach which eliminates the need for a central master repository and works down
    to lower levels in the hierarchy. It is the intent to locate a whois server as
    close to the target (in terms of hierarchy) as possible, while preserving the
    opportunity to locate higher level servers for escalation purposes.</p>"
