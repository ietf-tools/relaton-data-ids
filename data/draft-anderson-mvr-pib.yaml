abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Policy Information Base (PIB) for partitioning
    a single switch into a set of virtual switches. ([SPPI] describes a structure
    for specifying policy information that can then be transmitted to a network device
    for the purpose of configuring policy at that device. The model underlying this
    structure is one of well defined policy rule classes and instances of these classes
    residing in a virtual information store called the Policy Information Base (PIB).)
    The partitioning PIB defined here is largely based on the Base Switch Partitioning
    MIB (MSF 00.069) [MSF-VSMIB]. However, unlike that MIB, this document does not
    provide a management interface for the switch as a whole but instead only specifies
    the ports and resources assigned to virtual switches. The management interface(s)
    to discover switch resources as a whole are outside the scope of this document.</p>"
