abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) uses digital signature to associate
    a message with a given sending domain. Currently, there is only one cryptography
    algorithm defined for use with DKIM (RSA). This document defines four new elliptic
    curve cryptography algorithms for use with DKIM. This will allow for algorithm
    agility if a weakness is found in RSA, and allows for smaller key length to provide
    the same digital signature strength.</p>"
