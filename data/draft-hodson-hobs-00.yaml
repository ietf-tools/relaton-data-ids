abstract:
- content: "<p>Where LDAP servers are based on X.500 DSAs for the holding of distributed
    Directory information, the maintenance of the necessary security and networking
    relationships between DSAs is an important factor to consider. The '93 X.500 Directory
    standards define HOB (Hierarchical Operational Binding) procedures for the creation
    of a new naming context in another DSA, and also for the maintenance of the relationship
    between two DSAs where one holds a superior naming context and the other holds
    a subordinate naming context. The standards also define the use of the Directory
    Operational Binding Management Protocol (DOP) to mediate these procedures. The
    use of HOBs provides a major simplification for managers of X.500 systems, since
    it provides a way to update policies automatically from one DSA to another. But
    practical design for HOBs requires decisions in a number of respects not fully
    treated by the standards. This document simplifies the implementor's task by defining
    viable and practical subsets of the standards and by clarifying some of the issues
    left undefined by the standards. HOBs always represent an intimate relationship
    between DSAs which must be protected from masquerade. A method of providing this
    protection is given in the '93 Directory standards by requiring mutual authentication
    at the bind between DSAs. HOBS will normally only be established between DSAs
    owned by a single administrative authority, so security needs to be considered
    in this somewhat easier context than complete openness. Although simple unprotected
    authentication (name and password) can be a valid option in an already-secure
    environment, simple protected authentication using an encrypted password is potentially
    a much more secure technique, as is strong authentica</p>"
