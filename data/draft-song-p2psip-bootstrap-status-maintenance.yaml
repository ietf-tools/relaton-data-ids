abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to join the overlay, a joining peer/client has to find the
    enrollment server first, and then acquire the configuration file from the enrollment
    server where it can find the bootstrap peers' information, and after that it contact
    a bootstrap node to route the join request message to join the overlay. However,
    nodes in P2PSIP overlay network are dynamic. They can leave gracefully or abruptly
    at any time. This document focuses on the bootstrap server mechanism and proposes
    a mechanism to select proper bootstrap peers and improve the availability of bootstrap
    nodes through bootstrap peer status maintenance.</p>"
