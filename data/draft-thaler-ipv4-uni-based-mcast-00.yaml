abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an extension to the multicast addressing
    architecture of the IP Version 4 protocol. The extension presented in this document
    allows for unicast-prefix- based allocation of multicast addresses. By delegating
    multicast addresses at the same time as unicast prefixes, network operators will
    be able to identify their multicast addresses without needing to run an inter-domain
    allocation protocol.</p>"
