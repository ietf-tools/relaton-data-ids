abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML) format
    as a genearlized file format for any type of data in a hierarchical form. EBML
    is designed as a binary equivalent to XML and utilizes a storage-efficient approach
    to building nested Elements with identifiers, lengths, and values. Similar to
    how an XML Schema defines the structure and semantics of an XML Document, this
    document defines an EBML Schema to convey the semantics of an EBML Document.</p>"
