abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the requirements and challenges to employ artificial
    intelligence (AI) into the constraint Internet of Things (IoT) service environment
    for embedding intelligence and increasing efficiency. The IoT service environment
    includes heterogeneous and multiple IoT devices and systems that work together
    in a cooperative and intelligent way to manage homes, buildings, and complex autonomous
    systems. Therefore, it is becoming very essential to integrate IoT and AI technologies
    to increase the synergy between them. However, there are several limitations to
    achieve AI enabled IoT as the availability of IoT devices is not always high,
    and IoT networks cannot guarantee a certain level of performance in real-time
    applications due to resource constraints. This document intends to present a right
    direction to empower AI in IoT for learning and analyzing the usage behaviors
    of IoT devices/systems and human behaviors based on previous records and experiences.
    With AI enabled IoT, the IoT service environment can be intelligently managed
    in order to compensate for the unexpected performance degradation often caused
    by abnormal situations. This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with
    the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79. Internet-Drafts are working documents of
    the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Note that other groups may also distribute
    working documents as Internet-Drafts. The list of current Internet- Drafts is
    at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/. Internet-Drafts are draft documents
    valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by
    other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
    material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." This Internet-Draft
    will expire on January 8, 2020</p>
