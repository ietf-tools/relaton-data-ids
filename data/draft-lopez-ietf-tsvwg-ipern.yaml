abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo introduces an architecture, called IP-ERN, which allows Explicit
    Rate Notification (ERN) protocols to be inter-operable with current IP-based networks.
    IP-ERN is based on the execution of both End-to-End (E2E) and ERN protocols at
    the end hosts. The resulting E2E-ERN protocol provides inter and intra protocol
    fairness and benefits from all ERN advantages when possible. We detail the principle
    of this novel architecture, which is compliant with every TCP feature, as well
    as IP-in-IP tunneling solutions. In particular, IP-ERN is an alternative to splitting
    Performance Enhancement Proxies.</p>"
