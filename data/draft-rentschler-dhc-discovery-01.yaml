abstract:
- content: "<p>The discovery mechanism described here is built upon and coexists with
    BOOTP according to RFC 1542 and DHCP according to RFC 2131 and RFC 3203. It allows
    server-initiated communication to specific or all clients in the network, using
    the DHCP packet format and with that the relay agent functionality. The Discovery
    Extensons are a powerful and flexible add-on to client-initiated DHCP that allow
    a variety of applications.</p>"
