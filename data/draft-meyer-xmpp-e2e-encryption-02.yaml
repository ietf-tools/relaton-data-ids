abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies "XTLS", a protocol for end-to-end encryption
    of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) traffic. XTLS is an application-level
    usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) that is set up using the XMPP Jingle extension
    for session negotiation and transported using any streaming transport as the data
    delivery mechanism. Thus XTLS treats the end-to-end exchange of XML stanzas as
    a virtual transport and uses TLS to secure that transport, enabling XMPP entities
    to communicate in a way that is designed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity
    XML stanzas. The protocol can be used for secure end-to-end messaging as well
    as other XMPP applications, such as file transfer.</p>
