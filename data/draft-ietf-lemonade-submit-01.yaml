abstract:
- content: "<p>IMAP clients operating over low-bandwidth or high-latency links, such
    as cellular telephones, need to be able to submit mail messages containing all
    or part of previously-received IMAP messages. Clients need to be able to do this
    without sloshing the bits both ways, that is, without being forced to download
    IMAP messages solely to be able to upload the content in a submitted message.
    This document currently identifies the two main approaches to doing this (called
    'IMAP push' and 'IMAP pull'), one which adds submission to IMAP, and another which
    adds the expansion of IMAP references to message submission. This version of the
    document attempts to lay out the protocol mechanisms along with associated trade-offs
    and security considerations of each. Once a decision has been made to go with
    a particular technique, this document will describe the specifics of that choice
    as a standards-track proposal.</p>"
