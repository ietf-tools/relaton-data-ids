abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces various problems and issues relating to the
    usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for group messaging. Several potential
    extensions are analyzed and proposed. Both one-shot group messaging (paging) and
    session based group messaging are covered in the document. Group chat between
    human beings is one application for group messaging, others exists also such as
    SIP group messaging between robots or game applets.</p>"
