abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes an application-layer authentication protocol
    in Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) applications using Generic Security Services
    Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanisms. The GSS-API is used, for
    simplicity, via the Simple Authentication and Security Layers (SASL) mechanism
    bridge known as "GS2". This approach to authentication allows for simplicity,
    pluggability, mutual authentication, and channel binding, all with no changes
    to any vbe ersion of HTTP nor the Transport Layer Security (TLS). Although this
    is an application-layer protocol, we hope that it will be implemented in HTTP
    stacks for ease of use. That is, this protocol should be implemented at the HTTP
    application programming interface (API) layer wherever possible even though it
    is an application-layer protocol. We hope that the use of authentication at the
    application layer will make REST-GSS deployable.</p>
