abstract:
- content: "<p>Degradation or forced service termination may occur because of frequent
    handoffs that may occur within NEMO networks. This paper presents a resource reservation
    scheme aiming at supporting quality of service guaranty. We focus on a reservation
    protocol adapted to NEMO specifications. For doing so, we use a generic signaling
    protocol that may exploit advantages of both reservation protocols; IntServ and
    DiffServ.</p>"
