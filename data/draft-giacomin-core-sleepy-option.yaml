abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a framework for allowing asynchronous communication
    between sleepy sensors mediated by a supporting Proxy node. The Proxy acts as
    a store-and-forward agent that handles requests on behalf of a sleepy client,
    and buffers responses coming from the target origin until the requesting client
    wakes up and get the computation results. A new CoAP option, Sleepy, is defined
    to initiate and control the asynchronous exchange.</p>"
