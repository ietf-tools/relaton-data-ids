abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes Confirmation with Human in the Loop (HITL) Exchange
    of Quotations (CHEQ). CHEQ allows humans to confirm decisions and actions proposed
    by AI Agents prior to those decisions being acted upon. It also allows humans
    to provide information required for tool invocation, without disclosing that information
    to the AI agent, protecting their privacy. CHEQ aims to guarantee that AI Agent
    hallucinations cannot result in unwanted actions by the human on whose behalf
    they are made. CHEQ can be integrated into protocols like the Model Context Protocol
    (MCP) and the Agent-to- Agent (A2A) protocols. It makes use of a signed object
    which can be carried in those protocols.</p>"
