abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETBLT protocol [RFC998] was designed as an experimental transport
    layer protocol, intended for moving large quantities of data across a wide variety
    of networks. It provides reliable bulk transfer with an end-to-end flow-control
    mechanism meant to deal with network congestion by throttling the rate at which
    data is inserted into the network. However, experiments with NETBLT across shared
    links revealed problems with fairness; traffic from one connection could hog most
    of a link's bandwidth, and there seems to be no way to prevent this under the
    current rate-control scheme, so further application of NETBLT was not pursued
    by its original developers. However, NETBLT has a number of characteristics which
    make it very attractive for use across noisy, long-delay, slow-turnaround, or
    asymmetric communications links. Such links are common in military usage, and
    may become more widespread with the development of mobile computing. NETBLT's
    attractive characteristics include selective retransmission of lost packets, potentially
    large transmission windows, and control of transmission from the receiving, rather
    than the sending side; the latter makes NETBLT relatively insensitive to network
    delays. NETBLT, with minor</p>"
