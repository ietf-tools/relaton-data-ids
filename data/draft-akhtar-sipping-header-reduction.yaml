abstract:
- content: "<p>Current SIP messages are text based and inherently large, especially
    when these messages are to be transmitted over the bandwidth-strained wireless
    access technologies (a typical orginiating SIP Invite is about 1200 bytes). For
    most wireless technologies, transmitting the session initiation messages (such
    as SIP Invite) over the signaling channel can reduce the call setup time substantially.
    The size limitation of these wireless signaling channels are typically very small
    (~210 bytes in the uplink and ~110 bytes in the downlink). To address this problem,
    a new function called Encoding Assitant (EA) has been introduced in the User Agent
    (UA) and in the SIP Proxy server within the network. Additionally, the method
    provided in this document defines new SIP option tags and headers. These new option
    tags and headers allow the UA and a SIP Proxy server within the network (such
    as the P-CSCF), to exchange information using the signaling channels supported
    by most wireless access networks.</p>"
