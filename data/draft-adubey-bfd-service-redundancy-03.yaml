abstract:
- content: "<p>In a data center, when multiple routing/service nodes are providing
    single active redundancy for a set of L2, L3 and/or L4-L7 services. Both non-revertive
    and revertive fail over modes are required for the services. This draft describes
    a method to achieve the non-revertive and revertive fail over modes for services
    using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD).</p>"
