abstract:
- content: "<p>At present an IS-IS purge does not contain any information identifying
    the Intermediate System (IS) that generates the purge. This makes it difficult
    to locate the source IS. To address this issue, this document defines a TLV to
    be added to purges to record the system ID of the IS generating it. Since normal
    LSP flooding does not change LSP contents, this TLV should propagate with the
    purge.</p>"
