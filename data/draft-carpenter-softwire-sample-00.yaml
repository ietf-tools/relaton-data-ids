abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6 deployment is delayed by the existence of millions of subscriber
    network address translators (NATs) that cannot be upgraded to support IPv6. This
    document specifies a mechanism for traversal of such NATs. It is based on an address
    mapping and on a mechanism whereby suitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain
    IPv6 connectivity via a stateless server, known as a SAMPLE server, operated by
    their Internet Service Provider. SAMPLE is an alternative to the Teredo protocol.</p>"
