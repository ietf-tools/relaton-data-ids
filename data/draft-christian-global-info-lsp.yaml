abstract:
- content: "<p>This profile is intended to be used for locating electronic and other
    information resources without requiring a fixed hierarchy among the locators.
    The profile specifies the minimum set of required behaviors of conforming servers
    so that clients using distributed search may discover characteristics of the information
    resources, perhaps represented as Uniform Resource Characteristics. The profile
    does not specify how characterization of information resources may be accomplished,
    how sets of records containing locator information may be compiled, how servers
    actually conduct searches, nor how user interfaces may operate.</p>"
