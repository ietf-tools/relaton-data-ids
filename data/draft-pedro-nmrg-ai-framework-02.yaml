abstract:
- content: "<p>The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in network management
    (NM) solutions is the way to resolve complex management problems arisen from the
    adoption of NFV, SDN, and network slicing technologies. The AINEMA framework,
    as discussed in this document, includes the functions, capabilities, and components
    that MUST be provided by AI modules and models to be successfully applied to NM.
    This is enlarged by the consideration of seamless integration of different services,
    including the ability of having multiple AI models working in parallel, as well
    as the ability of complex reasoning and event processing. In addition, disparate
    sources of information are put together with limited complexity, through the definition
    of a control and management service bus. It allows, for instance, to involve external
    events in NM operations. Using all available sources of information --- namely,
    intelligence sources --- allows NM solutions to apply proper intelligence processes
    instead of simple AI-based guesses. Such processes are highly based in reasoning
    and formal and target-based intelligence analysis and decision --- providing evidence-based
    conclusions and proofs for the decisions. This will allow computer and network
    system infrastructures --- and user demands --- to grow in complexity. The construction
    and maintenance of AINEMA-compatible components MUST consider the existence several
    mechanisms, which are extended beyond machine learning (ML). For instance, intelligent
    reasoning is a key aspect of AINEMA that MUST be taken into account by autonomic
    management components and solutions. It will provide enormous benefits to NM solutions
    by, for example, inferring new knowledge and applying different kind of rules
    (e.g. logical) to choose from several actions. While ML solutions work with data,
    so they only require to retrieve data from the network infrastructure, AINEMA
    modules MUST work in collaboration to the network it is managing. This makes the
    challenges arisen from intelligent reasoning essential for the evolution of NM.
    They will be addressed within the context of AINEMA.</p>"
