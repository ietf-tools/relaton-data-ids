abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a reference to third generation partner ship project
    (3GPP) defined traffic flow template (TFT) as a traffic selector in the flow based
    routing mechanism described in the flow binding draft [1]. This memo, further
    specifies a new traffic selector sub-option format to be used with the flow binding
    mobility option defined in draft [1], in order to transport the TFT reference
    from the mobile node to its home agent in a 3GPP SAE (service architecture evolution)
    scenario.</p>"
