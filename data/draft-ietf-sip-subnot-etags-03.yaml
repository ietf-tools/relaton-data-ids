abstract:
- content: "<p>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving
    asynchronous notification of various events from other SIP user agents. This framework
    defines the procedures for creating, refreshing and terminating subscriptions,
    as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state. These procedures have
    a serious deficiency in that they provide no tools to avoid replaying event notifications
    that have already been received by a user agent. This memo defines an extension
    to SIP events that allows the subscriber to condition the subscription request
    to whether the state has changed since the previous notification was received.
    When such a condition is true, either the body of a resulting event notification
    or the entire notification message is suppressed.</p>"
