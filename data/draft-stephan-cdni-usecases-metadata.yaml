abstract:
- content: "<p>There are use cases where the delivery of contents by a CDN on the
    behalf of another requires the exchange of extra information between these CDNs.
    This memo proposes a RESTful framework for the exchange of content distribution
    metadata between an upstream and a downstream CDN. Then it applies this framework
    to the use cases selected by te CDNi WG [I-D.ietf-cdni-use-cases] to identify
    relevant operations, objects and information elements of the CDNi metadata interface
    and to verify that the RESTful approach suits for these operations.</p>"
