abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a profile for delegating client authentication
    and authorization in a constrained environment by establishing a Datagram Transport
    Layer Security (DTLS) channel between resource-constrained nodes. The protocol
    relies on DTLS for communication security between entities in a constrained network.
    A resource-constrained node can use this protocol to delegate management of authorization
    information to a trusted host with less severe limitations regarding processing
    power and memory.</p>"
