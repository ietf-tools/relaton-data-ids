abstract:
- content: "<p>The OCSP protocol [RFC2560] enables online validation of the reliability
    of a digital certificate. RFC2560 defines a mandatory-to-implement mechanism supporting
    the revocation status of the certificate and defines and optional extension mechanism
    to support a richer set of semantics (e.g. full path validation by the OCSP server).
    This document defines Internet-standard extensions to OCSP that enable a client
    to delegate processing of certificate acceptance functions to a trusted server.
    The client may control the degree to which delegation takes place. In addition
    limited support is provided for delegating authorization decisions.</p>"
