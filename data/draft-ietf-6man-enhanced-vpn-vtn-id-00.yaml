abstract:
- content: "<p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide different customers with logically
    separated connectivity over a common network infrastructure. With the introduction
    and evolvement of 5G and other network scenarios, some existing or new customers
    may require connectivity services with advanced characteristics comparing to traditional
    VPNs. Such kind of network service is called enhanced VPNs (VPN+). A Virtual Transport
    Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which consists of a set of dedicated
    or shared network resources allocated from the physical underlay network, and
    is associated with a customized logical network topology. VPN+ services can be
    delivered by mapping one or a group of overlay VPNs to the appropriate VTNs as
    the virtual underlay. In packet forwarding, some fields in the data packet needs
    to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so that the VTN-specific
    processing can be performed on each node the packet traverses. This document proposes
    a new Hop-by-Hop option of IPv6 extension header to carry the VTN Resource ID,
    which is used to identify the set of network resources allocated to a VTN for
    packet processing. The procedure for processing the VTN option is also specified.</p>"
