abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Fast Multicast Protocol for Mobile IPv6 [2]
    in the Fast Handovers environments whereby a mobile node (MN) can receive multicast
    data with reduced loss and delay after handoffs. The proposed protocol can be
    implemented by the simple modification of the Fast Handovers protocol [1] so that
    it can be easily applied to the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6. This document
    does not need a certain assumption of a specific multicast routing protocol, so
    that any existing multicast routing protocol can be used with the proposed protocol.</p>"
