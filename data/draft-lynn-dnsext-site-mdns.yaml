abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like operations
    on the local link in the absence of any conventional unicast DNS server. Extended
    mDNS (xmDNS) extends the specification of mDNS to site-local scope in order to
    support multi-hop LANs that forward multicast packets but do not provide a unicast
    DNS service. Like mDNS, xmDNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to apply
    to the site-local network and specifies rules for its use.</p>"
