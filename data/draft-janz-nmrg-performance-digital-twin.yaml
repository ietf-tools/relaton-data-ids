abstract:
- content: <p>Performance-Oriented Digital Twins (PODTs) provide "what-if" analysis
    - predictions of performance or, perhaps, of other behaviours in hypothetical
    situations of network, services, traffic, etc. Key functional and design aspects
    of PODTs in support of multiple, concurrently-operating use case Management Plane
    (MP) applications are discussed. Data and model management in concurrent session
    handling, inter-working with variable composition (from data and functional model
    perspectives) networks, performance and scalability are considered.</p>
