abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a service chaining mechanism, which is used
    to indicate the data packets going through multiple Service Processing Entities
    and processed by those Service Processing Entities with preset order. This document
    also provides a new service chaining header encapsulation for packets in a service
    chain. The system can get the information of the next Service Processing Entity
    where the data packet should go by checking the service chaining header.</p>"
