abstract:
- content: "<p>For bidirectional lightpaths provisioning, in the case of optical nodes
    that do not support wavelength conversion, it would be necessary to use the same
    wavelength along the route on each direction. In certain optical network scenarios,
    the use of the same wavelength on both directions would be advantageous. For instance,
    some ROADMs may add/drop the same wavelength simultaneously. In other cases, the
    users' optical end nodes are equipped with fixed-wavelength transponders. This
    document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling for bidirectional wavelength
    lightpaths that require the same wavelength on both directions. By using an LSP_ATTRIBUTES
    object defined in [RFC4420], the extensions enable the new type lightpaths to
    support the low cost configuration at users' optical end nodes.</p>"
