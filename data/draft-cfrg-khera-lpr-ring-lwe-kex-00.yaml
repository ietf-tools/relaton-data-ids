abstract:
- content: <p>This note describes a key exchange method based on the ring-LWE (RLWE)
    assumption. It builds upon several results, including Regev's landmark quantum
    reduction from certain worst case lattice problems (approx. GapSVP and SIVP) to
    random instances of the search variant of a particular learning problem (LWE).
    It also builds on the follow on work of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev on the
    average case hardness of the RLWE search variant for polynomially bounded numbers
    of RLWE samples, along with novel applications of automorphism groups in number
    fields for a RLWE search to decision reduction (thereby demonstrating pseudorandomness
    of RLWE in these number fields). Subsequently, these results were adopted for
    the construction of Diffie-Hellman like key exchange methods by Peikert, and then
    by Lindner and Peikert followed by Ding and then by Ding, Xie and Lin who proposed
    efficient variants of such protocols. Subsequent work by Peikert proposed another
    efficient variant, phrased as a key encapsulation method, incorporating a low
    bandwidth "reconciliation" technique allowing two parties to exactly agree on
    a uniformly distributed secret value from noisy RLWE instances. This was followed
    by a concrete instantiation with parameter sets by Bos, Costello, Naehrig, Stebila,
    followed by another instantiation by Alkim, Ducas, Poppelmann and Schwabe with
    the same ring polynomial but a smaller modulus and a different reconciliation
    method. Unlike most other public key cryptography based key exchange methods,
    it is believed that RLWE based key exchange would remain secure in the event that
    an adversary is able to build a quantum computer. This document is a product of
    the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG).</p>
