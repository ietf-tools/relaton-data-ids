abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR), a routing protocol
    mechanism to simplify the path description of data plane traffic in Segment Routing
    (SR) deployments with OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 protocols. PPR aims to mitigate the MTU
    and data plane processing issues that may result from SR packet overheads; and
    also supports further extensions along the paths. Preferred path routing is achieved
    through the addition of path descriptions to the OSPF advertised prefixes, and
    mapping those to a PPR data-plane identifier.</p>"
