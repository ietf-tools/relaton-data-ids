abstract:
- content: "<p>Self-certifying names are one way of binding a given public key to
    a certain name in Information Centric Networking. However, an additional binding
    of a self-certifying name to a Real-World identity is needed in most cases, so
    that a recipient of some information cannot only verify that the publisher was
    in possession of the correct corressponding private key for the requested name,
    but that in addition the name itself is the intended one. This draft specifies
    how such a binding of Real-World identities with self- certifying ICN names can
    be done, taking existing IETF specifications into account.</p>"
