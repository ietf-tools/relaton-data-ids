abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the structure, format, and features of the naming
    scheme for the objects defined in the Delay-Tolerant Networking Autonomous Management
    Model (AMM), in support of challenged network management solutions described in
    the Delay- Tolerant Networking Autonomous Management Architecture (AMA). This
    document defines a new AMM Resource Identifier (ARI), based on the structure of
    a common URI, meeting the needs for a concise, typed, parameterized, and hierarchically
    organized set of data elements.</p>"
