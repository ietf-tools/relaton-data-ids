abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides considerations for some requirements on the
    IPv6 nodes using MIPv6 to communicate with their peers across a network boundary
    where some specific packet filtering is deployed for operator and service provider
    controlled access to the services and network resources. Depending on the operational
    policies, the packet filtering can be applied on either the incoming packets or
    the outgoing packets or in both directions. A mobile node using MIPv6 sends packets
    with Home IP address in the extension headers, while the packet filtering is often
    based on either the source address or the destination address or both in the basic
    IPv6 header.Packet filtering that complies with the policies from the mobility
    unaware applications will fail to perform properly due to the change of the source
    and destination addresses in the basic IPv6 header when MIPv6 is used. This document
    provides an analysis on the operation requirements on packet filtering and then
    proposes a simple solution that does not impose any change on IPv6 but requires
    an addition to IPv6 nodes using MIPv6.</p>"
