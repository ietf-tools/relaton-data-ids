abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC is a new multiplexed and secure transport atop UDP. QUIC builds
    on decades of transport and security experience, and implements mechanisms that
    make it attractive as a modern general-purpose transport. QUIC implements the
    spirit of known TCP loss detection mechanisms, described in RFCs, various Internet-drafts,
    and also those prevalent in the Linux TCP implementation. This document describes
    QUIC loss detection and congestion control, and attributes the TCP equivalent
    in RFCs, Internet-drafts, academic papers, and TCP implementations.</p>"
