abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms
    in order to provide security services. The Internet Key Exchange protocol provides
    a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms should be used in any given association.
    However, to ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is necessary
    to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there is
    at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document
    defines the current set of algorithms that are mandatory to implement as part
    of IKEv2, as well as algorithms that should be implemented because they may be
    promoted to mandatory at some future time.</p>"
