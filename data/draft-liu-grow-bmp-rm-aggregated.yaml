abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an aggregated BMP route monitoring message.
    It can compress multiple BMP route monitoring messages into one aggregated BMP
    route monitoring message to reduce the amount of reported BMP route monitoring
    messages and reduce network overhead. This document updates RFC 7854 by adding
    new BMP Messages type.</p>"
