abstract:
- content: "<p>Long-term archiving storage fundamentally begins with archive data
    Accumulation, then Geo-duplication and then Management. Using A-&gt;G-&gt;M, LTASP
    has been created to solve mid-range and below, long- term archiving requirements
    of the small-medium enterprise. Where tape has been deployed in the past, LTASP
    now offers an alternative solution designed to be more robust and manageable in
    the long term than network attached storage devices or simple disk storage alone.</p>"
