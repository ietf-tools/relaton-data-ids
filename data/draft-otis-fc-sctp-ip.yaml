abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification incorporates an encapsulation scheme for Fibre-
    Channel (FC) using SCTP. The essential advantages for using SCTP compared to TCP
    as it relates to FC are as follows: - Headers contained within one frame. - Objects
    aligned at 32-bit boundaries. - Out of sequence frame processing. - Standard authentication.
    - Independent streams under common control. - Session restart. - Improved error
    detection. - Prevention of blind spoofing and denial of service attacks. - Standard
    Heartbeat and multi-homing. (optional)</p>"
