abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular,
    it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on the IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard
    between Local Area Network (LAN) segments. Provisions are made for the support
    of transparent bridging. Provisions are also made so that these objects apply
    to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments. The MIB module presented
    in this memo is a translation of the BRIDGE-MIB defined in RFC 1493 to the SMIv2
    syntax. This memo obsoletes RFC 1493. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
