abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a number of known mechanisms used to direct client
    application requests to surrogate servers based on various policies. In this memo
    we group mechanisms commonly called request routing, content routing or content
    redirection under the term request mapping. There exist multiple request mapping
    mechanisms. At a high-level, these may be classified under: DNS Request Mapping,
    Transport-layer Mapping, and Application-layer Mapping.</p>"
