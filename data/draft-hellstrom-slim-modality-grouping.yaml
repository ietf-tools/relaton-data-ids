abstract:
- content: "<p>When setting up a real-time communication session, there may be a need
    to indicate preference for which media and modality (spoken, written or signed)
    to use for language communications or a need to indicate preference for receiving
    the same language content simultaneously in two modalities. This document defines
    the semantics for grouping media for such purposes in the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP). The semantics defined in this document are based on the SDP Grouping
    Framework. Applications are for example negotiation the most suitable common modality
    or modalities for language communications in a real-time session. The indications
    are specified for the sending and receiving direction separately.</p>"
