abstract:
- content: "<p>The multiple care-of addresses registration protocol [1] allows a mobile
    node to maintain, at the same time, multiple virtual paths with its home agent
    or correspondent nodes. This document presents a policy data set for flow distribution
    to be used with the multiple care-of addresses registration protocol. This policy
    data set defines policies, in an OS-independant manner, for a mobile node and
    its home agent or correspondent node, from the point of view of one of these nodes.
    This data set is aimed to be processed by this node and the output is a set of
    filter rules to be used and exchanged with its correspondents.</p>"
