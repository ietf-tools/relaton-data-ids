abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the transport of call control related User
    to User Information (UUI) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), and develops
    several requirements for a new SIP mechanism. Some SIP sessions are established
    by or related to a non-SIP application. This application may have information
    that needs to be transported between the SIP User Agents during session establishment.
    A common example in another protocol is the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information
    Service. As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this
    data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork
    with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency. This document discusses requirements
    and approaches. This extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing
    similar services and interworking with ISDN services. Example use cases include
    an exchange between two user agents, retargeting by a proxy, and redirection.
    An example application is an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) in a contact center.</p>"
