abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to support advanced interactivity as envisaged for MPEG-4
    applications, this document proposes a simple RTSP- based [1] streams control
    framework - including necessary extensions to RTP methods syntax and semantics.
    Reflecting syntax and semantics of the MPEG-4 BIFS scene description [2], VRML
    nodes [4] and the MPEG-4 media delivery framework (DMIF)[3], in the spirit of
    HTMLSMIL [5], Random Access Point information, Range and Time parameters are introduced
    into the relevant URL(s) and related signaling methods accordingly. Two additional
    optional methods, R-MUTE, for Remote-MUTE, and RESUME are also proposed.</p>"
