abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single
    best path for each prefix. As defined today BGP has no mechanisms to distribute
    paths other then best path between it's speakers. This behavior results in number
    of disadvantages for new applications and services. This document presents an
    alternative mechanism for solving the problem based on the concept of parallel
    route reflector planes. It also compares existing solutions and proposed ideas
    that enable distribution of more paths than just the best path. This proposal
    does not specify any changes to the BGP protocol definition. It does not require
    upgrades to provider edge or core routers nor does it need network wide upgrades.
    The authors believe that the GROW WG would be the best place for this work.</p>"
