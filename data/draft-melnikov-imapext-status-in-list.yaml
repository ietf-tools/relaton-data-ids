abstract:
- content: "<p>Many IMAP clients display information about total number of messages/
    total number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes. In order to do that they are
    forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command, to list all available mailboxes, followed
    by a STATUS command for each mailbox found. This document provides an extension
    to LIST command that allows the client to request STATUS information for mailboxes
    together with other information typically returned by the LIST command.Note A
    revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as
    a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community. Discussion and suggestions for
    improvement are requested, and should be sent to morg@ietf.org.</p>"
