abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent Linux kernels offer a wide variety of traffic control functions,
    which can be combined in a modular way. We have designed support for Differentiated
    Services based on the existing traffic control elements, and we have implemented
    new components where necessary. In this document we give a brief overview of the
    structure of Linux traffic control, and we describe our prototype implementation
    in more detail.</p>"
