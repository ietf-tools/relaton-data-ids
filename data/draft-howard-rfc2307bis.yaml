abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for mapping entities related to
    TCP/IP and the UNIX system [UNIX] into [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved
    with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4511]. A set of attribute types
    and object classes are proposed, along with specific guidelines for interpreting
    them. The intention is to assist the deployment of LDAP as an organizational nameservice.
    No proposed solutions are intended as standards for the Internet. Rather, it is
    hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution to such
    problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards. The proposed mechanism
    has already been implemented with some success.</p>"
