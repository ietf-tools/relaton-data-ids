abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a P2P CDN (Content Delivery Network) based content
    sharing system using PPSP (Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol) and RELOAD (REsource
    LOcation And Discovery). The P2P CDN provides a unified platform for service/content
    providers and content sharing users to share content efficiently and safely. The
    shared contents may include streaming media, files, etc. This content sharing
    system uses PPSP as signaling protocol for P2P content distributing, and uses
    RELOAD to improve reliability and scalability. More specifically, RELOAD is used
    to construct P2P overlays storing of massive contents and locating contents reliably.</p>"
