abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the publication of [RFC5050] a number of transport and convergence
    layer protocols have been developed to carry bundles between nodes in a delay-tolerant
    network. Before the publication of Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) in [RFC9171],
    there was only one standardized version of the Bundle Protocol, version 6, and
    as many of these transport and convergence-layer protocols pre-date the publication
    of version 7, they do not include any protocol mechanism to differentiate between
    versions of the Bundle Protocol. This document updates [RFC9171] by defining a
    CBOR [RFC8949] tag that should be used as an explicit indicator that a particular
    CBOR array is a Bundle Protocol version 7 bundle. It also describes a mechanism
    by which an implementation can determine the version of the Bundle Protocol that
    was used to encode a bundle by examining the initial octets of the encoded data.</p>"
