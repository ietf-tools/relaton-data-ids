abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a possible solution for the discovery problem
    in MIMI (More Instant Messaging Interoperability). The problem is defined in a
    narrow sense, only including the conversion of a non-service-specific user identifier
    (email address, telephone number or a new MIMI-specific format) into one or more
    service- specific user identifiers, then retrieving the necessary information
    to establish a connection with their provider. The solution is based on the Domain
    Name System, so that it could be easily and quickly deployed on existing, well-known
    and broadly available infrastructure.</p>"
