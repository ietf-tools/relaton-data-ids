abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies how to interconnect multiple Transparent Interconnection
    of Lots of links (TRILL) sites with an intervening MPLS network using existing
    TRILL and VPLS standards. This draft addresses two problems as follows: 1) Providing
    connection between more than two TRILL sites that are separated by MPLS provider
    network. 2) Providing a single logical virtualized TRILL network for different
    tenants that are separated by an MPLS provider network.</p>"
