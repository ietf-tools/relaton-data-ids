abstract:
- content: "<p>This document diagrams the packet flows - both signaling and data -
    of Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) related protocols. This document serves
    as a point of reference for the WG when discussing which QoS mechanisms can be
    employed for each individual (application) protocol packet flow to function properly
    during congestion events from IP source to IP destination, as well as a potentially
    different QOS mechanism for a related but separate data flow (if present).</p>"
