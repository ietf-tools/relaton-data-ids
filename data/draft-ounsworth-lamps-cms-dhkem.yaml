abstract:
- content: "<p>The DHKEM Algorithm is a one-pass (store-and-forward) mechanism for
    establishing keying data to a recipient using the recipient's Diffie- Hellman
    or elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman public key. This document defines a mechanism
    to wrap Ephemeral-Static (E-S) Diffie-Hellman (DH) and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDH) such that it can be used in KEM interfaces within the Cryptographic Message
    Syntax (CMS). This is a sister document to RSA-KEM [RFC5990] and simplifies future
    cryptographic protocol design by only needing to handle KEMs at the protocol level.</p>"
