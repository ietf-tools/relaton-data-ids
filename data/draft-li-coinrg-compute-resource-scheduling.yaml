abstract:
- content: "<p>With massive data growing in the internet, how to effectively use the
    compute resources has become a quite hot topic. In order to cool down the pressure
    in today's large data centers, some compute resources have been moved towards
    the edge, gradually forming a distributed Compute Force Network. Force is a physical
    cause which can change the state of a motion or an object. We refer the definition
    from physics and extend its philosophy to network that in future, the network
    can be a compute force which can facilitate the integration of different kinds
    of compute resources, no matter hardware or software, making the computation fast
    and effective. In this draft, we present a compute resources oriented scheduling
    mechanism based on dataplane programmability, which can effectively schedule and
    manage compute resources in the network.</p>"
