abstract:
- content: "<p>With the rapid rise in digital content, cloud computing has become
    the focus of academia and industry. Cloud computing comes with sophisticated technologies
    for data storage, management, and distribution. Ubiquitous access facility and
    pay-as-you-go billing features are additional advantages associated with this
    paradigm. However, the massive digital content, more importantly multimedia, has
    to be managed in a more effective way. Heterogeneous cloud customers, accessing
    different customized services, with more advanced access networks and devices
    available today, makes it tough at times for solitary clouds to fulfill the needs.
    In such cases, different clouds have to interoperate and federate their resources.
    This scenario is called inter-cloud computing of cloud federation. Since the concept
    of inter-cloud computing is still very new, it lacks standard architecture. This
    document focuses on presenting architectural fundamentals and key concerns associated
    with inter-cloud computing.</p>"
