abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the UDP-based Lightweight GeneRic Autonomic
    Signaling Protocol (LW-GRASP), which is designed to be a lightweight version of
    the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the standard GRASP), with shortened
    messages and a built-in reliability mechanism. LW-GRASP can work reliably over
    UDP, making it suitable for the IoT, where lightweight and resource-constrained
    devices dominate. Furthermore, this document also discusses the potential way
    to adapt the LW-GRASP to work on the network without IP connectivity.</p>"
