abstract:
- content: "<p>ICMPv6 is a companion protocol to IPv6. It defines messages that inform
    the source of IPv6 packets of errors during packet delivery. It also defines the
    Echo Request/Reply messages that are used for basic network troubleshooting (ping
    command). ICMPv6 messages are transported on IPv6. This document describes how
    to adapt ICMPv6 to Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) by compressing ICMPv6/IPv6
    headers and by protecting the LPWAN network and the Device from undesirable ICMPv6
    traffic.</p>"
