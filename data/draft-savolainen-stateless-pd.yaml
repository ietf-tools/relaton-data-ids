abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an automatic and stateless IPv6 prefix delegation
    solution for IPv6-only and dual-stack access networks. The solution builds on
    automatic delegation mechanism defined by 6RD, but is suitable for IPv6-only networks,
    including those that have not deployed stateful DHCPv6. The described stateless
    approach essentially exchanges the complexity of the stateful prefix delegation
    to increased consumption of IPv6 address space and less flexible properties.</p>"
