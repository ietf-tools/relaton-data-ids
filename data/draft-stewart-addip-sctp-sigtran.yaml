abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Stream Control Transmission
    Protocol (SCTP) [RFCXXXX] to provide a method to add or delete an IP address from
    a existing association. Also this document will provide a generic method for transmitting
    a reliable control chunk. The benefits of these extensions are a) uniform methods
    for the addition of control chunks that must be reliable and b) for machines with
    hot pluggable interface cards the ability to add (and or delete) IP addresses
    dynamically without forcing an association restart.</p>"
