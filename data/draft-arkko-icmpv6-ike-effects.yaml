abstract:
- content: "<p>The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions which in IPv4 were either
    non-existent or provided by lower layers. IPv6 architecture also makes it possible
    to secure all IP packets using IPsec, even ICMPv6 messages. IPsec architecture
    has a Security Policy Database that specifies which traffic is protected, and
    how. It turns out that the specification of policies in the presence of ICMPv6
    traffic is hard, particularly with ICMPv6 packets related to Neighbor Discovery.
    Sound looking policies may easily lead to loops: The establishment of security
    requires Neighbor Discovery messages which can not be sent since security has
    not been established yet. The purpose of this draft is to inform system administrators
    and IPsec implementors in which manner they can handle the ICMPv6 messages. Common
    understanding of the way that these messages are handled is also necessary for
    interoperability, in case vendors hardcode such rules in to products.</p>"
