abstract:
- content: "<p>The RSVP and Integrated Services working groups have been working towards
    the goal of an 'Integrated Services Internet' where applications can request a
    Quality of Service (QoS) from the network in order to meet their end-to- end service
    requirements. Simultaneously, the IP-over-ATM working group has been specifying
    the requirements and interactions between IP and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
    technology. The internals and interoperability of ATM devices are specified by
    the ATM Forum and its working groups. One of the features of ATM technology is
    the ability to request a virtual circuit (VC) with a specified QoS. Obviously,
    it would be useful for the work of the Integrated Services Internet to be able
    to take advantage of the QoS abilities of ATM. This document outlines the issues
    related to running RSVP and Integrated Service models over ATM and presents an
    initial attempt at dividing up the issues between the various working groups and
    organizations. This is intended as a starting point for the discussions in the
    joint IP-ATM, RSVP, and Int-Serv meeting to be held at the Los Angeles IETF meeting
    in March, 1996.</p>"
