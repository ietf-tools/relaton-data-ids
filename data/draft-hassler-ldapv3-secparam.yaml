abstract:
- content: "<p>Two security services that are required in many applications but have
    not been addressed by LDAPv3 [ldapv3] in a satisfactory manner yet are integrity
    and non-repudiation. According to the latest LDAPv3 security draft [ldapv3-auth]
    integrity can be achieved within a secure association only. Non-repudiation, and
    by this we mean digital signing of operations, is mentioned in [ldapv3] as an
    example of the use of the LDAPv3 extended operation mechanism. A disadvantage
    of this approach is that it would be necessary to define a new Extended Request/Response
    pair for each basic operation that should be signed. This document defines an
    LDAP control called LDAPSecurityParameters for transferring security parameters
    with LDAP operations. With this control it is possible to append digital signature
    to LDAP operations and in this way provide for message authenticity, message integrity,
    non-repudiation of message origin and message freshness.</p>"
