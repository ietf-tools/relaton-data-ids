abstract:
- content: "<p>Administrative metadata - referred to as 'Admin Core' - is useful to
    designate information about the creation and availability of other sets of metadata.
    The objective of Admin Core is to provide simple authentication to verify the
    integrity and provenance of information retrieved from networked resources. The
    Admin Core elements are utilised to associate date and creator information about
    metadata.</p>"
