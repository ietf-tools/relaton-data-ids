abstract:
- content: <p>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme
    resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems] have been devised
    in their process of creating standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project
    (DVB), the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and
    the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
    publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications such as HTTP,
    MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based metadata. These URI are used
    to locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia broadcast programme
    services (i.e., channels or events) and also the audio-visual components related
    to that programme, for example an HTTP-based programme guide on the Web or other
    XML-based electronic programme guides in digital broadcast receivers. This document
    defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the Internet community, given
    its definition as part of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.</p>
