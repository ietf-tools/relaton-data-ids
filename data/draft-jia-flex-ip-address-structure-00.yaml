abstract:
- content: "<p>Along as the popularization and adoption of IP in emerging scenarios,
    challenges emerge as well due to the ossified address structure. To enable TCP/IP
    in networks that previously using exclusive protocol, a flexible address structure
    would be far more preferred for their particular properties [draft-jia-scenarios-flexible-address-structure].
    This document describes a flexible address structure -- Flexible IP (FlexIP) acting
    on limited domains [RFC8799]. FlexIP is expected to proactively adapt scenarios
    under flexible address structure. Meanwhile, FlexIP still benefit from global
    reachability based on the IPv6 interoperability.</p>"
