abstract:
- content: <p>The "persistently full buffer" problem has been discussed in the IETF
    community since the early 80's [RFC896]. The IRTF's End-to-End Working Group called
    for the deployment of active queue management to solve the problem in 1998 [RFC2309].
    Despite the awareness and recommendations, the "full buffer" problem has not gone
    away, but on the contrary has become worse as buffers have grown in size and proliferated
    and today's networks proved intractable for available AQM approaches. The overall
    problem is presently known as "bufferbloat"[TSVBB2011, BB2011] and has become
    increasingly important, particularly at the consumer edge. This document describes
    a recently developed AQM, Controlled Delay (CoDel) algorithm, which was designed
    to work in modern networking environments and can be deployed as a major part
    of the solution to bufferbloat [CODEL2012]. The goal of the CoDel work is to provide
    a solution with cost-effective implementation that is particularly well-suited
    to the consumer edge.</p>
