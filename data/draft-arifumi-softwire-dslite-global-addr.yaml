abstract:
- content: "<p>When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 address
    depletion, DS-Lite is reasonable approach for solving both of the problems. However,
    it is troublesome for an ISP to have the existing IPv4 service facilities and
    DS-Lite facilities at the same time for not a short period of time. This document
    proposes a mechanism to assign an IPv4 global address in DS-Lite framework, which
    makes every customer to move to DS-Lite based network, and enables an ISP to maintain
    single facility of the service network.</p>"
