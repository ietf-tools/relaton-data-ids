abstract:
- content: "<p>Packet loss measurement for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) PseudoWires,
    Label Switched Paths, and Sections, is an important Operation, Administration
    and Maintenance (OAM) function of the MPLS-TP. When this OAM function is performed,
    counting the transmitted and received packets at both the source MEP and the sink
    MEP needs to be activated at first. This document specifies OAM packets and protocol
    mechanism to facilitate the counting activation and deactivation at the sink MEP,
    and leave out the unnecessary management configuration at the sink MEP when the
    MPLS-TP connection is bidirectional or there exists an out-of-band return path.</p>"
