abstract:
- content: "<p>QoS routing needs some stabilization mechanism to prevent a delayed
    negative feedback on the link QoS information by the routed traffic. So far, route
    pinning was the only known way of the stabilization. But, as RSVP merges multiple
    RESV messages to create a new one, pinned route computed elsewhere for different
    QoS requirement is not useful after the merge. That is, we need a sticky hop-by-hop
    QoS routing algorithm. Path QoS Collection is such an algorithm to collect true
    upstream link QoS in PATH messages to correct the link QoS information distributed
    by QoS routing protocols.</p>"
