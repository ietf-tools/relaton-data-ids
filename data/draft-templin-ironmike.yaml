abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new routing and addressing
    architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer packets within outer
    network layer headers using a non-broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface
    model. The IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) allows a Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) client to keep a connection to a VPN gateway active across multiple
    network points of attachment or while moving from one network point of attachment
    to another. This document examines the similarities between IRON and MOBIKE, and
    observes that they are addressing the same fundamental networking objectives.
    It further proposes ways in which the basic MOBIKE model could be extended through
    adoption of IRON architectural constructs.</p>"
