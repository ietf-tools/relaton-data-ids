abstract:
- content: "<p>Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced
    as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols. SDNVs encode
    an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bitstring with minimum
    overhead. They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing
    economy and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development. This document
    describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes
    on implementation and usage. This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant
    Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to
    its publication as an RFC were raised. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
