abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new Capsule (RFC9297) that can be used with
    CONNECT-UDP (RFC9298), CONNECT-IP (RFC9484), or other future CONNECT extensions
    to signal the available bitrate for media traffic that is proxied through an HTTP
    server. This information can be used by a media application to regulate its media
    bitrate in accordance with a network policy, as an alternative to in-network traffic
    shaping.</p>"
