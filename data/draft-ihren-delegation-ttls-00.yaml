abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a consequence of how the TTL re-writing mechanism
    works (or rather does not work) for the case of a resolver chasing a referral
    chain several layers deep. The most common example of this is the case of a recursive
    resolver trying to look up a third level domain name starting from the root. A
    result of how this works is that it seems to be a good idea to recommend an increase
    of the present standard TTL for delegations from the root zone from the present
    48 hours to something significantly longer. But, more importantly, the choice
    of TTL for the referral from the parent should be a decision made by the child,
    not the parent.</p>"
