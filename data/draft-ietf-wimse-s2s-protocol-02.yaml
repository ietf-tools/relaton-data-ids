abstract:
- content: "<p>The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
    software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the most basic ones
    up to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi- tenant deployments. This document
    defines the simplest, atomic unit of this architecture: the protocol between two
    workloads that need to verify each other's identity in order to communicate securely.
    The scope of this protocol is a single HTTP request-and-response pair. To address
    the needs of different setups, we propose two protocols, one at the application
    level and one that makes use of trusted TLS transport. These two protocols are
    compatible, in the sense that a single call chain can have some calls use one
    protocol and some use the other. Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS
    authentication, while the next call from Service B to Service C would be authenticated
    at the application level.</p>"
