abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Hybrid Hierarchical Multi-Domain Service
    Function Chaining (hhSFC) architecture that extends Service Function Chaining
    (SFC) to multiple domains with different technology, administration or ownership.
    The goals of Hybrid Hierarchical SFC are to reduce the complexity of the control
    plane in a multi-domain scene and make the negotiation between different domains
    possible.</p>"
