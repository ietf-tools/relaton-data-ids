abstract:
- content: "<p>A logical interface is used to hide the existence and the change of
    physical interface from the IP layer of a host and it also can be used for a multiple
    interfaces mobile node in PMIPv6 domain. If a LMA assigns multiple home network
    prefixes to a multiple interfaces mobile node with a logical interface, there
    are various usages of multiple home network prefixes on the logical interface.
    As following general PMIPv6 operations described in RFC 5213, all multiple home
    network prefixes are shown to the IP layer. Also, the logical interface hides
    the existence of multiple home network prefixes and shows only one home network
    prefix to host IP layer. And in a LMA point of view, a LMA may acknowledge each
    physical interface or only logical interface of a mobile node when a multiple
    interfaces mobile node utilizes the logical interface. In this internet draft,
    we describe various scenarios of the usage of multiple home network prefixes on
    a logical interface.</p>"
