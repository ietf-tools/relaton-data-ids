abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines conferencing call control features for the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP). This document builds on the Conferencing Requirements
    and Framework documents to define how a tightly coupled SIP conference works.
    The approach is explored from different user agent (UA) types perspective: conference-unaware,
    conference-aware and focus UAs. The use of URIs in conferencing, OPTIONS for capabilities
    discovery, and call control using REFER are covered in detail with example call
    flow diagrams.</p>"
