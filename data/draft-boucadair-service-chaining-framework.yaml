abstract:
- content: "<p>IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced functions
    (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions) for the delivery of added
    value services. This document defines a framework to enforce Service Function
    Chaining (SFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network. The proposed
    framework allows for Differentiated Forwarding (DiffForward): packets are initially
    classified and marked at the entry point of an SFC-enabled domain, and are then
    forwarded on a per SF Map Index basis.</p>"
