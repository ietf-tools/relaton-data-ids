abstract:
- content: "<p>This design provides the ability to have an entire campus, with multiple
    physical links, look to IP like a single subnet. This capability is often provided
    today with bridges. Bridges have the advantage of being plug-and-play. However,
    they have disadvantages: routing is confined to a spanning tree, the header on
    which the spanning tree forwards has no hop count, spanning tree forwarding in
    the presence of loops spawns exponential copies of packets, nodes can have only
    a single point of attachment, and the spanning tree, in order to avoid temporary
    loops, is slow to start forwarding on new ports. The design in this paper avoids
    those disadvantages of bridges. The basic design is layer 3-independent, and is
    a design for bridging with a shortest-path routing algorithm (instead of spanning
    tree paths), and with more robust forwarding. Then the design is extended to provide
    IP-specific optimizations.</p>"
