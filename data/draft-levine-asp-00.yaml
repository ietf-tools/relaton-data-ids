abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication
    framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to
    permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transport
    Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs). The primary DKIM protocol is described
    in [RFC4871]. This document describes the records that authors can use to advertise
    their practices for signing their outgoing mail, and how other hosts can access
    those records.</p>"
