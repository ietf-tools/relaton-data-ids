abstract:
- content: "<p>When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers are configured
    to send IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey information to nodes that enable
    them to autoconfigure on the network. This information includes the implied default
    router address taken from the observed source address of the Router Advertisement
    (RA) message, as well as on-link prefix information. However, unintended misconfigurations
    by users or administrators, or possibly malicious attacks on the network, may
    lead to bogus RAs being present, which in turn can cause operational problems
    for hosts on the network. In this draft we summarise the scenarios in which rogue
    RAs may be observed and present a list of possible solutions to the problem. We
    focus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text. The goal of this text
    is to be Informational, and as such to present a framework around which solutions
    can be proposed and discussed.</p>"
