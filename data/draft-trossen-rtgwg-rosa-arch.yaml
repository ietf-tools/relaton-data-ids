abstract:
- content: "<p>The term 'service-based routing' (SBR) captures the set of mechanisms
    for the steering of traffic in an application-level service scenario. As in the
    related use case and gap analysis drafts, we position this steering as an anycast
    problem, requiring the selection of one of the possibly many choices for service
    execution at the very start of a service transaction. This document outlines a
    possible architecture for realizing SBR so as to address the issues identified
    in the use case and gap analysis companion documents, specifically aiming at the
    realization of the requirements in the latter document. We outline the architecture,
    with pointers to possible realizations of the interactions, while also outlining
    possible extensions to a base SBR capability through a ROSA system as an outlook
    to possible richer capabilities.</p>"
