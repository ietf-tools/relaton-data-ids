abstract:
- content: "<p>The advertisement of multiple paths for the same prefix in the Border
    Gateway Protocol is possible by using an extension to the attributes developed
    for multiprotocol transfer. This allows better path diversity in the adj-rib-ins,
    and can prevent some routing inconsistencies with Route Reflection. However, if
    not carefully used, this mechanism can also introduce routing oscillations and
    inconsistencies in topologies with Route Reflection that were correct without
    this extension.</p>"
