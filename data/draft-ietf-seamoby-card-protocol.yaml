abstract:
- content: '<p>To enable seamless IP-layer handover of a mobile node (MN) from one
    access router (AR) to another, the MN is required to discover the identities and
    capabilities of candidate ARs (CARs) for handover prior to the initiation of the
    handover. The act of discovery of CARs has two aspects: identifying the IP addresses
    of the CARs and finding their capabilities. This process is called "candidate
    access router discovery" (CARD). At the time of IP-layer handover, the CAR, whose
    capabilities are a good match to the preferences of the MN, is chosen as the target
    AR for handover. The protocol described in this document allows a mobile node
    to perform CARD. This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>'
