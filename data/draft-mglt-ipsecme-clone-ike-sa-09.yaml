abstract:
- content: "<p>This document considers a VPN end user establishing an IPsec Security
    Association (SA) with a Security Gateway using the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    version 2 (IKEv2), where at least one of the peers has multiple interfaces or
    where Security Gateway is a cluster with each node having its own IP address.
    The protocol described allows a peer to clone an IKEv2 SA, where an additional
    SA is derived from an existing one. The newly created IKE SA is set without the
    IKEv2 authentication exchange. This IKE SA can later be assigned to another interface
    or moved to another cluster node.</p>"
