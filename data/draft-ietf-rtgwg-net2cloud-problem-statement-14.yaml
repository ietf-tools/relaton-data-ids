abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the network-related problems enterprises face
    today when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third-party
    data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can be many problems associated with connecting
    to or among Clouds; the Net2Cloud problem statements are mainly for enterprises
    who already have traditional MPLS services and are interested in leveraging those
    networks (instead of completely abandoning them). This document aims to describe
    the problems of continuing using the MPLS networks when connecting workloads in
    the Cloud, and to clarify additional work in the IETF Routing area. Other problems
    are out of the scope of this document. Current operational problems are examined
    to determine whether there is a need to improve existing protocols or whether
    a new protocol is necessary to solve them.</p>"
