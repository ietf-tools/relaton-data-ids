abstract:
- content: "<p>Many different kinds of commercial networks require users to perform
    registration before being allowed usage to resources. Resources could include
    basic access to the network to resources that are more specific such as services
    in the network or a certain grade of service, etc. The registration process is
    normally specific to the type of network that a user is attaching to and the registration
    process itself occurs in the protocol layers that are specific to an access technology.
    With a network layer (IP) or above solution, a common protocol for performing
    registration could be defined.</p>"
