abstract:
- content: "<p>Logically Succinct Basic Policy Rule Components (LSBPRC) provides model
    extensions to the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and implementable extensions
    to the Policy Core LDAP Schema (PCLS) in which the logic of conditions and actions
    can be succinctly expressed and explicitly interpreted. LSBPRC offers a direct
    and invariant connection between the rule designer's intention and the rule interpreter's
    evaluation of the rulebase.</p>"
