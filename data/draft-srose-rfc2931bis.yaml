abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensions to the Domain Name System (DNS) can provide data origin
    and transaction integrity and authentication to security aware resolvers and applications
    through the use of cryptographic digital signatures. However, these security extensions
    do not provide authentication at the transaction or message level. This document
    describes a message authentication scheme (called SIG(0)) that provides message
    level authentication and integrity checking by means of a meta-RR in the additional
    section of a DNS message.</p>"
