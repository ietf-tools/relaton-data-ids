abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a scalable method for establishing group session keys for
    secure large, dynamic groups such as multicast sessions. Our method is based on
    a novel application of One-Way Function Trees (OFTs). The number of keys stored
    by group members, the number of keys broadcast to the group when new members are
    added or evicted, and the computational efforts of group members, are logarithmic
    in the number of group members. The method provides perfect forward and backward
    security: evicted members cannot read future messages, even with collusion by
    arbitrarily many evicted members, and newly admitted group members cannot read
    previous messages.</p>"
