abstract:
- content: "<p>Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures require
    cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding a share of a common
    private key. Consequently, generating signatures in a threshold setting imposes
    overhead due to network rounds among signers, proving costly when secret shares
    are stored on network- limited devices or when coordination occurs over unreliable
    networks. This draft describes FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold
    signature scheme that reduces network overhead during signing operations while
    employing a novel technique to protect against forgery attacks applicable to similar
    schemes in the literature. FROST improves upon the state of the art in Schnorr
    threshold signature protocols, as it can safely perform signing operations in
    a single round without limiting concurrency of signing operations, yet allows
    for true threshold signing, as only a threshold number of participants are required
    for signing operations. FROST can be used as either a two-round protocol where
    signers send and receive two messages in total, or optimized to a single-round
    signing protocol with a pre-processing stage. FROST achieves its efficiency improvements
    in part by allowing the protocol to abort in the presence of a misbehaving participant
    (who is then identified and excluded from future operations)--a reasonable model
    for practical deployment scenarios.</p>"
