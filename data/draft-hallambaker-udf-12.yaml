abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint
    (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs. Uses of UDF
    fingerprints include but are not limited to creating Strong Internet Names (SINs).
    Cryptographic digests provide a means of uniquely identifying static data without
    the need for a registration authority. A fingerprint is a form of presenting a
    cryptographic digest that makes it suitable for use in applications where human
    readability is required. The UDF fingerprint format improves over existing formats
    through the introduction of a compact algorithm identifier affording an intentionally
    limited choice of digest algorithm and the inclusion of an IANA registered MIME
    Content-Type identifier within the scope of the digest input to allow the use
    of a single fingerprint format in multiple application domains. Alternative means
    of rendering fingerprint values are considered including machine-readable codes,
    word and image lists. This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-udf.html
