abstract:
  content: "\n\t <p>This document defines the CDN-Loop request header field for HTTP.
    \ CDN-Loop addresses an operational need that occurs when an HTTP request is intentionally
    forwarded between Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), but is then accidentally or
    maliciously re-routed back into the original CDN causing a non-terminating loop.
    \ The new header field can be used to identify the error and terminate the loop.\n\t
    </p>\n      "
