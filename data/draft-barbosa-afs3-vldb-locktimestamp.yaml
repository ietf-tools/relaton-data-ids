abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the repurposing of the currently unused spares2
    field within the nvldbentry and uvldbentry structures. The primary objective is
    to utilize this field for storing the timestamp representing the date and time
    when a given volume location entry was locked. To make this possible, this memo
    requests the allocation of a new capability bit, VLDB_CAPABILITY_LOCKTIMESTAMP,
    to be advertised by the Volume Location Server. When advertised, this bit indicates
    that the server has the capacity to provide the timestamp in question.</p>"
