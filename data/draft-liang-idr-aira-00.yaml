abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple, incremental, autonomous system (AS)-based
    inter-domain routing architecture to solve the scalability problems of the Internet,
    by separation of Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) for identifying endpoints and Routing
    Identifiers (RIDs) for locating endpoints in the Internet. The proposed architecture
    uses AS numbers as RIDs so that global routing tables can grow only with of AS
    numbers, thus avoiding the rapid growth driven by constantly increasing IP prefixes.
    This proposal was stimulated by the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam
    IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop in October 2006.</p>"
