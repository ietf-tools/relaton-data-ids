abstract:
- content: "<p>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) specification defines
    the concept of Provider-defined Identifiers (PIDs) as the aggregation of network
    endpoints for network nodes. Each PID can be associated with a set of endpoint
    addresses, e.g. aggregating endpoints that use the same network access point.
    This document focuses on mobile networks and introduces proposes the toidea of
    using use cells of cellular access networks as an aggregation points. This allows
    applications to make decisions based on the path cost of using the current cell
    as a network attachment point, or to even choose which network access points network
    attachment point to select. Use cases are described which can benefit from this.
    The draft elaborates on possible ALTO modifications enabling such use cases. The
    intent of the draft is to start discussion on the topic.</p>"
