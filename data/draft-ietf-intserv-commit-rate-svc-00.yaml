abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the network element behavior required to deliver
    a Committed Rate service in the Internet. The Committed Rate service provides
    applications with a firm commitment from the network, that at a minimum the transmission
    rate they requested is available to them at each network element on their path.
    The commitment of a given transmission rate by a network element is not associated
    with a specific delay guarantee, but requires that network elements perform admission
    control to avoid over-allocation of resources.</p>"
