abstract:
- content: "<p>In TSCH mode of IEEE802.15.4, as described by [RFC8180], opportunities
    for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels. Nodes in a
    TSCH network typically frequently send Enhanced Beacon (EB) frames to announce
    the presence of the network. This document provides a mechanism by which small
    details critical for new nodes (pledges) and long sleeping nodes may be carried
    within the Enhanced Beacon.</p>"
