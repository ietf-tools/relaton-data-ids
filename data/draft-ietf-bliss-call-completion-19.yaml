abstract:
- content: <p>The "completion of calls" feature defined in this specification allows
    the caller of a failed call to be notified when the callee becomes available to
    receive a call. For the realization of a basic solution without queuing, this
    document references the usage of the dialog event package (RFC 4235) that is described
    as 'Automatic Redial' in "Session Initiation Protocol Service Examples" (RFC 5359).
    For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queuing, this document
    introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation
    Protocol where "completion of calls" implementations associated with the caller's
    and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for completion
    of calls into a queue at the callee's endpoint; when a caller's request is ready
    to be serviced, re-attempt of the original, failed call is then made. The architecture
    is designed to interoperate well with existing completion of calls solutions in
    other networks.</p>
