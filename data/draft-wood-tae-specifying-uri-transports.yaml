abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple extension of the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) format that allows preferred transport mechanisms, including
    protocols, ports and interfaces, to be specified as parseable additions to the
    scheme name. This explicit configuration is beneficial for separation of the HyperText
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from underlying transports, which has been increasingly
    recognised as useful when a variety of ways of transporting or configuring use
    of HTTP are available and a choice of mechanism to use must be indicated.</p>"
