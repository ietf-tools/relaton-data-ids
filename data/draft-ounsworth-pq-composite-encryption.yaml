abstract:
- content: "<p>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come
    the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic
    algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is
    at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in
    such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms
    individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite encryption
    data. This document defines a content encryption process following the hybrid
    model as described in the NIST Post-Quantum Crypto FAQ. This draft defines three
    composite encryption modes. First, Composite Key Transport using Encryption primitives
    which encrypts a message (typically a content encryption key) for a recipient
    with a composite public key composed entirely of encryption keys by encrypting
    it with multiple one-time-pad keys, each encrypted under a different recipient
    public key. Second, Composite Key Transport using Encryption and KEM primitives
    is the generalization of the previous mode to support a mixture of encryption
    and KEM algorithms. Third, Composite Key Exchange is the most general and supports
    establishing a shared secret using any combination of encryption, KEM, and key
    exchange primitives where a master shared secret is generated using NIST SP 800-56Cr2.</p>"
