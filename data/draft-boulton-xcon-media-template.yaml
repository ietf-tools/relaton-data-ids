abstract:
- content: "<p>The xcon framework[1] specifies the object model for centralized conferencing.
    The Conference Object, which is defined in the framework data model, comprises
    of two distinct components - the Common Conference Information and Conference
    Templates. This memo specifies the Conference Templates that describe various
    common conference scenarios. The templates define controls (and media properties
    like type of media supported, what streams are supported etc) through which participants
    of the conference can manipulate the media they receive from the conference server.
    This document provides a minimum set of media templates that can be instantiated
    during conference creation and manipulated during the life cycle of a conference
    instance. This draft is currently under major revision and should be considered
    a work in progress as it aligns with current technical direction of the Working
    Group. A revision of this draft will be submitted very soon. This work is being
    discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
