abstract:
- content: "<p>This proposal defines key management approaches for the Quantum Safe
    Cryptographic (QSC) algorithm FALCON which has been selected for standardization
    by the NIST Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) process. This includes key identification
    and key serialization. The purpose is to provide guidance such that the adoption
    of quantum safe algorithms is not hampered with the fragmented evolution of necessary
    key management standards. Early definition of key material standards will help
    expedite the adoption of new quantum safe algorithms and at the same time as improving
    interoperability between implementations and minimizing divergence across standards.</p>"
