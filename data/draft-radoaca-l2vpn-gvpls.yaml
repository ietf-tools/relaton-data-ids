abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes distributed virtual private LAN service (VPLS)
    solution over MPLS using LDP signaling. For VPLS solutions, the VPLS Reference
    Model [VPLS-L2-FRW] introduces two types of models: distributed and non-distributed.
    While [VPLS] solution presents a non-distributed model, it is recognized that
    both models may co-exist in the same SP network. This implies a need of signaling
    mechanisms to support these new classes of solutions. The current draft presents
    the GVPLS solution that addresses such issues. The term 'Generalized' in this
    document is used to reflect the unified aspect of the two models.</p>"
