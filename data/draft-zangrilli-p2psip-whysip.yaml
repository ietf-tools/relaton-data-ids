abstract:
- content: <p>The P2PSIP working group's charter charges the group to define a P2PSIP
    peer protocol that defines how peers "collectively provide for user and resource
    location in a SIP environment with no or minimal centralized servers." The charter
    also states that the group may define a peer protocol that is syntactically based
    on SIP. This document outlines the motivation and merits of using conventional
    SIP messages as the syntax to encode the P2PSIP peer protocol and discusses arguments
    made against this design decision.</p>
