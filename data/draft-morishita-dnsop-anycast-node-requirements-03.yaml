abstract:
- content: <p>IP anycast [1] is a technology to share one IP address for Internet
    services with multiple server nodes. It is now being deployed for improving service
    reliability, scalability, and stability. Especially, "Global-Scope" IP anycast
    is now being deployed for authoritative name servers, typically for root servers.
    RFC 3258 [2] describes a set of practices to apply IP anycast technology for authoritative
    name servers. And "Operation of Anycast Services" Internet-Draft [3] (hereafter,
    called "Anycast BCP") describes a series of recommendations and considerations
    for distribution of services using IP anycast. On the other hand, operators of
    authoritative name servers can also refer to RFC 2182 [4] and 2870 [5] for general
    guidances on appropriate practices for authoritative name servers. This memo describes
    the details of requirements and preconditions for making "Global-Scope" IP anycast
    nodes for authoritative name servers, with the conformance of the practices in
    RFC 2182, 2870, 3258 and Anycast BCP. And this memo also describes our findings
    and experiences for making IP anycast nodes for us. Authors hope that it is useful
    for DNS operators that they will walk on the same way in the future, especially
    for TLD operators.</p>
