abstract:
- content: "<p>The UIDBATCHES extension of the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
    allows clients to retrieve UIDs from the server such that these UIDs split the
    messages of a mailbox into equally sized batches. This lets the client perform
    operations such as FETCH/SEARCH/STORE on these specific batches. This limits the
    number of messages that each command operates on and may limit the size of the
    response.</p>"
