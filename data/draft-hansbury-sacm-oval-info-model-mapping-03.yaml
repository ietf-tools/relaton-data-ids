abstract:
- content: "<p>The OVAL community has spent more than ten years developing and employing
    the OVAL Language. During this time, the community has made a number of design
    decisions and learned a number of lessons that should be leveraged as the next-generation
    endpoint posture assessment standards are formulated. There are also a number
    of places where portions of the OVAL Language align with the SACM Information
    Model and could serve as a starting point for related work. Another output of
    the work executed under the OVAL project is a number of lessons that are applicable
    to the SACM work. These lessons include a clear separation of data collection
    and evaluation; a call to focus on ensuring both primary source vendors and third
    party security experts feel invited to the discussion and are empowered to leverage
    their unique domain knowledge; and to strive for simplicity and flexibility, where
    possible. In addition, the OVAL community has a set of clear recommendations with
    respect to which parts of OVAL should be used by SACM as a means to make best
    use of the efforts of those that have worked on and supported OVAL over the past
    ten years. Those recommendations are: o Use the OVAL System Characteristics Model
    to inform the development of a data model for representing endpoint posture attributes.
    o Use the OVAL Definitions Model to inform the development of data models for
    representing evaluation and collection guidance. o Do not use the OVAL Results
    Model to inform the development of a data model for representing evaluation results.
    Lastly, this document will discuss the OVAL submission, how it is expected to
    be used, and how it aligns with the SACM Vulnerability Assessment Scenario.</p>"
