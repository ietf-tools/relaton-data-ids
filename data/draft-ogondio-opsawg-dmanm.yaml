abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an approach for exposing Device Models as Network
    Models (DMaNM). In particular, this document provides guidance for structuring
    a data model to facilitate the reuse of device models within the customer-facing
    interface of Software- Defined Networking (SDN) controllers. The objective of
    this approach is to enhance the reusability of device models in various network
    scenarios and ease the mapping between network/service models with device models.</p>"
