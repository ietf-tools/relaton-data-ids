abstract:
- content: <p>The core IPv6 specification requires that when a host receives an ICMPv6
    "Packet Too Big" message reporting a "Next-Hop MTU" smaller than 1280, the host
    includes a Fragment Header in all subsequent packets sent to that destination,
    without reducing the assumed Path- MTU. The simplicity with which ICMPv6 "Packet
    Too Big" messages can be forged, coupled with the widespread filtering of IPv6
    fragments, results in an attack vector that can be leveraged for Denial of Service
    purposes. This document briefly discusses the aforementioned attack vector, and
    formally updates RFC2460 such that generation of IPv6 atomic fragments is deprecated,
    thus eliminating the aforementioned attack vector. Additionally, it formally updates
    RFC6145 such that the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) does not
    rely on the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments, thus improving the robustness
    of the protocol.</p>
