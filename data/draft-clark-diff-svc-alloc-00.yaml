abstract:
- content: "<p>This note describes the Service Allocation Profile scheme for differential
    service allocation within the Internet. The scheme is based on a simple packet
    drop preference mechanism at interior nodes, and highly flexible service profiles
    at edges and inter- provider boundary points within the net. The service profiles
    capture a wide variety of user requirements and expectations, and allow different
    users to receive different levels of service from the network in a scalable and
    efficient manner. The note describes the basic form of the mechanism, discusses
    the range of services that users and providers can obtain by employing it, and
    gives a more detailed presentation of particular technical, deployment, standardization,
    and economic issues related to its use.</p>"
