abstract:
- content: "<p>The dominant protocol for name resolution on the Internet is the Domain
    Name System (DNS). However, other protocols exist that are fundamentally different
    from the DNS, and may or may not share the same namespace. When an end-user triggers
    resolution of a name on a system that supports multiple, different protocols or
    resolution mechanisms, it is desirable that the protocol used is unambiguous,
    and that requests intended for one protocol are not inadvertently answered using
    another protocol. RFC 6761 introduced a framework by which a particular domain
    name could be acknowledged as being special. Various challenges have become apparent
    with this application of the guidance provided in RFC 6761. This document focuses
    solely on documenting the specific challenges created by RFC 6761 in the form
    of a problem statement in order to facilitate further discussions of potential
    solutions. In particular, it refrains from proposing or promoting any solution.
    Also, the current document does not focus on other general issues related to the
    use of special use domain names.</p>"
