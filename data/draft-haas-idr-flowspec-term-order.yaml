abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP Flowspec (RFC 8955) provides a mechanism for matching traffic flows.
    The ordering of the Flow Specifications defined by that RFC is provided by a sorting
    function that uses the contents of the received BGP NLRI; that NLRI does not contain
    an explicit ordering component. The RFC's sorting function permits for origination
    of Flowspec NLRI from multiple BGP Speakers and is generally appropriate for mitigating
    distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. There are circumstances where the
    implicit RFC 8955 sorting order is not appropriate. This document defines a mechanism
    that permits individual Flowspec NLRI to influence their sort order.</p>"
