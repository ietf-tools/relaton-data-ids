abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this document is to provide a mapping of QoS policy
    information to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses (L)DAP
    as its access protocol. Its derivation is as follows. The structure of generic
    policy information is defined in the Policy Core Information Model ([PCIM]). The
    mapping of this information to a form that can be implemented in a directory is
    defined in the Policy Core Schema ([PFSCHEMA]). The [PCIM] is extended to represent
    specific information needed to represent QoS policies with the QoS Information
    Model ([QOSIM]). This draft, then, maps the data defined in the [QOSIM] to a form
    that can be implemented in a directory. Specifically, this draft refines the concept
    of generic policy rules, conditions and actions to cover extensions necessary
    for representing policies to control the configuration and management of RSVP
    and Differentiated Services. This document also discusses LDAP related issues
    regarding the implementation of such a schema.</p>"
