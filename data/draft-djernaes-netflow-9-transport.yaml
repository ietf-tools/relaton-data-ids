abstract:
- content: "<p>NetFlow Export Version 9 Export is defined in the internet draft draft-claise-netflow-9
    [NFv9], which describes how to transport NetFlow over UDP [RFC768]. This document
    describes how NetFlow would use SCTP [RFC2960] as a transport protocol. Traditionally
    NetFlow was transmitted over UDP to a physically closely located collector. As
    the networks grow this is not necessarily the case any longer, so issues like
    congestion avoidance and reliability are becoming an increasing issue for applications
    using NetFlow. This document addresses these issues in a simple way using the
    SCTP protocol.</p>"
