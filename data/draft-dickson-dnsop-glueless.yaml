abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft proposes a method for protecting authority servers
    against MITM and poisoning attacks, using a domain naming strategy to not require
    glue A/AAAA records and use of DNSSEC. This technique assumes the use of validating
    resolvers. MITM and poisoning attacks should only be effective/possible against
    unsigned domains. However, until all domains are signed, this guidance is relevant,
    in that it can limit the attack surface of unsigned domains. This guidance should
    be combined with [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]</p>"
