abstract:
- content: "<p>It has become common for Internet mail users to have more than one
    account where mail is received, to access multiple accounts from the same machine,
    to access the same accounts from different machines, and to use multiple programs
    which require email account configuration information. The Application Configuration
    Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an ideal mechanism for storage of email account
    data. This specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for email accounts,
    and a common option for indicating a default email account.</p>"
