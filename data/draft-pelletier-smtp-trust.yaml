abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an SMTP service extension [ESMTP] whereby an
    SMTP client may establish a trust relationship with the server attesting its confidence
    in the validity of the originator of a message. This confidence, or its absence,
    can then be used to mitigate the cost of undesirable messages (primarily spam)
    without disrupting operations between, or with, SMTP implementations not supporting
    the extension.</p>"
