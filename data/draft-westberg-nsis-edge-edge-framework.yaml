abstract:
- content: "<p>Real-time applications impose very strict requirements on the underlying
    transmission network that requires a high level of quality of service (QoS). This
    level of QoS can only be achieved by means of QoS management on an end-to-end
    basis (i.e., end user to end user), from application to application, potentially
    across many domains, as the current Internet is a concatenation of many domains,
    usually managed by different QoS administrators (operators). The requirement for
    end-to-end QoS management does not necessarily mean that a single resource reservation
    protocol must be applied end- to-end. In fact it is most likely that the end-to-end
    QoS management architecture will consist of many interoperable and concatenated
    QoS management architectures rather than one global end-to-end QoS infrastructure.
    Usually a network consists of three network parts, i.e., a host to first hop router,
    access network and the backbone of the network. Each of these three network parts
    imposes different requirements on the provided QoS solution. This draft describes
    a framework for NSIS QoS signaling in edge to edge networks. The main goal is
    to provide a skeleton for lightweight edge to edge NSIS signaling in a network.
    This skeleton would be used as input to the NSIS 'Framework signaling architecture'.
    Even though designed for edge-to-edge signaling the applicability of this framework
    is not to be limited only to signaling between the edges of a network, but it
    can be extended in other signaling scenarios as well, such as end host - to -
    end host signaling. The QoS protocol that will be applied in an edge to edge network
    is denoted as edge-to-edge NSIS protocol.</p>"
