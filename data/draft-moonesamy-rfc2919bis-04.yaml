abstract:
- content: "<p>Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers and
    user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to a particular
    mailing list. With the advent of list header fields, it has become even more important
    to provide a unique identifier for a mailing list regardless of the particular
    host that runs the mailing list manager at any given time. The List-Id header
    field provides a standard location for such an identifier. In addition, a namespace
    for mailing list identifiers based on fully qualified domain names is described.
    This namespace is intended to guarantee uniqueness for list owners who require
    it, while allowing for a less rigorous namespace for experimental and personal
    use. By including the List-Id field, mailing list managers can make it easier
    for mail user agents to provide automated tools for users to perform mailing list
    functions. The mailing list identifier can serve as a key for automated processing
    tasks</p>"
