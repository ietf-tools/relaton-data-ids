abstract:
- content: "<p>The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, defines
    a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles)
    for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed packet streams. And
    another draft [IPPROFILE] posted by Jonsson deals with the IP only profile. However,
    no profile was defined for compression of IP extension headers. But in the coming
    wireless applications, mobile IP will play an important role. In mobile IPv4,
    there is no difference to the packet's IP header, so we don't have to make a profile
    for mobile IPv4; while as to mobile IPv6[MIPV6], there is difference, since some
    specific IPv6 extension headers will be included in almost every packet in the
    mobile IPv6 packets. The extension headers will also cost a lot of bandwidth,
    and we should do compression over them. This document addresses this issue and
    defines a ROHC compression profile for mobile IPv6, which may work as a complementarity
    to the profiles defined by RFC3095.</p>"
