abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the BBR congestion control algorithm. BBR uses
    recent measurements of a transport connection's delivery rate and round-trip time
    to build an explicit model that includes both the maximum recent bandwidth available
    to that connection, and its minimum recent round-trip delay. BBR then uses this
    model to control both how fast it sends data and the maximum amount of data it
    allows in flight in the network at any time. Relative to loss-based congestion
    control algorithms such as Reno [RFC5681] or CUBIC [draft-ietf-tcpm-cubic], BBR
    offers substantially higher throughput for bottlenecks with shallow buffers or
    random losses, and substantially lower queueing delays for bottlenecks with deep
    buffers (avoiding "bufferbloat"). This algorithm can be implemented in any transport
    protocol that supports packet-delivery acknowledgment (thus far, open source implementations
    are available for TCP [RFC793] and QUIC [draft-ietf-quic-transport-00]).</p>
