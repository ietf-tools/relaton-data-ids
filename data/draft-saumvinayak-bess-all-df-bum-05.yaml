abstract:
- content: "<p>The Designated forwarder concept is leveraged to prevent looping of
    BUM traffic into tenant network sourced across NVO fabric for multihoming deployments.
    [RFC7432] defines a preliminary approach to select the DF for an ES,VLAN or ES,Vlan
    Group, panning across multiple NVE's. [RFC8584] makes the election logic more
    robust and fine grained by inculcating fair election of DF handling most of the
    prevalent use-cases. This document presents a deployment problem and a corresponding
    solution which cannot be easily resolve by rules mentioned in [RFC7432] and [RFC8584].
    It involves redundant firewall deployment on disparate overlay sites connected
    over WAN. The requirement is to allow reachability, ONLY, to the local firewall,
    unless there is an outage. In case of outage the reachability can be extended
    to remote site's firewall over WAN.</p>"
