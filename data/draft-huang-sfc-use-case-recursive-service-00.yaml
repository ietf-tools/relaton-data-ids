abstract:
- content: "<p>Service function chaining (SFC) provides various services that can
    be tailored to different requirements from diversified user groups, where each
    user group forms a collective client that requires similar service. SFC is typically
    deployed as a service overlay with its own service topology on top of existing
    network topology. This kind of virtualized structure naturally enables recursive
    service relationship where a client may become a service provider and resell SFC
    services to its own user groups. This document describes some exemplary use cases
    that show the usage of recursive (e.g. nested) service function chaining relationship.</p>"
