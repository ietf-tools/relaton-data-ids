abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4) header includes a 16 bit Identification
    field in all packets, but this length is too small to ensure reassembly integrity
    even at moderate data rates in modern networks. Even for Internet Protocol, version
    6 (IPv6), the 32 bit Identification field may be smaller than desired for some
    intended uses. This document addresses these limitations by defining both an Identification
    Extension option for IPv4 and a corresponding Destination Option for IPv6.</p>"
