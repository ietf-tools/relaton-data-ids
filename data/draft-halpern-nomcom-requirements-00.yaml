abstract:
- content: <p>With the change in the rules for disclosure of nominees, the tools that
    support the Nominating Committee need to change. Also, given that some of these
    tools are critical to the Nominating Committee's work, and have critical constraints,
    it is important to have a clear description of the requirements. Status of this
