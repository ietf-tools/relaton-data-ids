abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol currently only
    supports raw RSA keys. In some environments it is useful to make use of other
    types of public keys, such as those based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. This
    documents adds support for other types of raw public keys to IKEv2 and obsoletes
    the old raw RSA key format.</p>"
