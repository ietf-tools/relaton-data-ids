abstract:
- content: "<p>RPC transports such as RPC-over-RDMA Version One require reply buffers
    to be in place before an RPC Call is sent. However, Upper Layer Protocols sometimes
    have difficulty estimating the expected maximum size of RPC replies. This introduces
    the risk that an RPC Reply message can overrun reply resources provided by the
    requester, preventing delivery of the message, through no fault of the requester.
    This document describes a mechanism that eliminates the need for pre-allocation
    of reply resources for unpredictably large replies.</p>"
