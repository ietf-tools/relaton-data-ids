abstract:
- content: "<p>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
    BGP Path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route Monitoring
    (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to convey the status
    of a BGP path before and after being processed by the BGP best-path selection
    algorithm. This extension makes use of the TLV mechanims described in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv
    [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit [I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].</p>"
