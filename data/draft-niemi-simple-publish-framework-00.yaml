abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible framework for
    publication of SIP specific data. This extension derives from the recent Internet
    Draft defining the PUBLISH method, but instead of using the SIP events framework,
    it introduces a specific publication framework for the publish mechanism. The
    main motivations for decoupling publications from events are that the event framework
    is not overloaded, and the applicability of the PUBLISH method to problem sets
    similar to those surfacing in the publication of event state is improved. The
    SIP publication framework is neither intended for general data manipulation, nor
    is it intended to foster any discussion on the issue of using SIP for everything.</p>"
