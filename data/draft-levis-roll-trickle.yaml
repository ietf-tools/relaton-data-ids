abstract:
- content: "<p>The Trickle algorithm allows wireless nodes to exchange information
    in a highly robust, energy efficient, simple, and scalable manner. Dynamically
    adjusting transmission windows allows Trickle to spread new information on the
    scale of link-layer transmission times while sending only a few messages per hour
    when information does not change. A simple suppression nechanism and transmission
    point selection allows Trickle's communication rate to scale logarithmically with
    density. This document describes Trickle and considerations in its use.</p>"
