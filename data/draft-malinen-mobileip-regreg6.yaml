abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Mobile IPv6 regional registration as an optional
    extension to Mobile IPv6. Regional registration introduces visited-domain mobility
    agent functionality for proxying a public care-of-address which remains the same
    while the mobile node moves in the visited domain. This reduces the binding update
    signaling latency for the mobile node and signaling load outside the visited domain.
    The protocol defines regional mobility capability negotiation, regional binding
    update signaling, and regional-aware data routing through a hierarchy of visited-domain
    mobility agents. The protocol allows for an arbitrary point in the visited-domain
    hierarchy to distribute the connection-state maintenance between several mobility
    agents. IPSec AH is used for securing the protocol as in basic Mobile IPv6.</p>"
