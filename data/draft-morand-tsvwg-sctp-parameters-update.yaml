abstract:
- content: "<p>In the SCTP protocol stack implementations available for deployment
    in operational networks, it has been usually observed that the list of parameters
    that can be configured by the operators is often restricted to the list of SCTP
    protocol parameter values that are recommended for SCTP given in the IETF RFC
    4960. However, this list is not exhaustive. This document updates the IETF RFC
    4960 by including the SACK delay as part of the list of SCTP protocol parameters
    that can be configurable by an SCTP administrator. The associated recommended
    value is also given, according to the IETF RFC 4960</p>"
