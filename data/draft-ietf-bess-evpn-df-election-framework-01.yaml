abstract:
- content: <p>The Designated Forwarder (DF) in EVPN networks is the PE responsible
    for sending broadcast, unknown unicast and multicast (BUM) traffic to a multi-homed
    CE, on a given VLAN on a particular Ethernet Segment (ES). The DF is selected
    out of a list of candidate PEs that advertise the same Ethernet Segment Identifier
    (ESI) to the EVPN network. By default, EVPN uses a DF Election algorithm referred
    to as "Service Carving" and it is based on a modulus function (V mod N) that takes
    the number of PEs in the ES (N) and the VLAN value (V) as input. This default
    DF Election algorithm has some inefficiencies that this document addresses by
    defining a new DF Election algorithm and a capability to influence the DF Election
    result for a VLAN, depending on the state of the associated Attachment Circuit
    (AC). In addition, this document creates a registry with IANA, for future DF Election
    Algorithms and Capabilities. It also presents a formal definition and clarification
    of the DF Election Finite State Machine.</p>
