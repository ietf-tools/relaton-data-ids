abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes the solution of vanilla inter-as option-B connection
    between NVO3 network and MPLS/IP VPN network through centralized NVE-NVA architecture.
    The ASBR located in NVO3 network is called ASBR-d, NVO3 tunnel and MPLS tunnel
    stitching should be performed on the ASBR-d. No distributed BGP VPN protocol (RFC4364)
    is running between NVEs and ASBR-d in NVO3 network, NVEs and ASBR-d are controlled
    by centralized NVA.</p>"
