abstract:
- content: "<p>The amount of resources required by a source to send data to a multicast
    group within a network is dependent on the service level the source requested
    and the number of egress points for the group in a network. Since the egress points
    in a multicast group can change during a multicast session, a source node would
    not know how many or which egress points it would be sending to when it specifies
    the service level it requires for multicast data. This document describes methods
    to control the number of egress points of a dynamic multicast group in a differentiated
    services (DS) network. A source node specifies the bandwidth, type of service
    and a limit on the number of egress points that it wants to send multicast data
    to. If this limit on the number of egress points is reached, no further egress
    points will be grafted to the branch of the multicast tree rooted at this source
    node.</p>"
