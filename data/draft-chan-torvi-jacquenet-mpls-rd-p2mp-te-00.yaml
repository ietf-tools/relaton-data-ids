abstract:
- content: "<p>For content delivery services that rely upon the IP multicast transmission
    scheme, the distribution trees are receiver initiated. The delivery of such services
    over MPLS networking infrastructures may rely upon P2MP LSP tree structures that
    are sender initiated, with the root of the P2MP tree being at the LSR router directly
    connected to the sender. This document describes a mechanism that aims at establishing
    MPLS P2MP tree structures that are receiver initiated. This mechanism builds on
    the works of Point-to-MultiPoint Traffic Engineered Lable Swithched Paths (P2MP-TE
    LSPs). This mechanism can also be used to establish receiver driven BiDirectional
    P2MP TE LSPs.</p>"
