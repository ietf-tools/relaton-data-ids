abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes version 1.3 of the Ethernet Automatic Protection
    Switching (EAPS) (TM) technology invented by Extreme Networks to increase the
    availability and robustness of Ethernet rings. An Ethernet ring built using EAPS
    can have resilience comparable to that provided by SONET rings, at lower cost
    and without some of the constraints (e.g. ring size) of SONET.</p>"
