abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols. In particular it defines objects for
    managing RBridges, which are devices that implement the TRILL base protocol. Since
    RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration there is no
    required configuration. Status information that may be helpful in network management
    is specified. The MIB is specified with all objects read-only for simplicity and
    since that is how the MIB is expected to be used. The description is used to indicate
    those objects that can be configured, although the actual configuration is outside
    the scope of this document.</p>"
