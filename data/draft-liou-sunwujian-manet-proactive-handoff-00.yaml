abstract:
- content: "<p>Driven by government policy and advanced radio technologies , opportunistic
    spectrum usage plays an ever-increasing role in the next generation communication
    system. Due to the random characteristics of primary users, it is impossible to
    fully describe the activity feature in terms of time and space, rendering opportunity
    usage unsafe. In order to minimize interference to primary users, a history knowledge
    based algorithm is proposed in this work, which compound historical statistics
    with current information. Random early detection (RED) algorithm, which proves
    to be efficient in active queue management (AQM) for switching fabrics, is introduced
    to help select the desirable channel. In order to further suppress the collision
    probability, all the channels are sorted according to availability. Simulation
    results show that, compared with completely random spectrum selection method,
    the proposed RED-based channel access method gives better performance in terms
    of channel selection delay.</p>"
