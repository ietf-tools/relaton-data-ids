abstract:
- content: "<p>Domain name registries (the producer) and registrars (the consumer)
    report to each other by sharing bulk information through files. This document
    creates two IANA registries to establish a standard reporting mechanism between
    domain name registries and registrars. The first IANA registry lists standard
    data elements and their syntax for inclusion in the files. The second IANA registry
    lists standard reports based on the standard data elements. Each report is a file
    formatted as a CSV file. The advantage of this reporting mechanism is that a report,
    each file, can be imported by recipients without any prior knowledge of their
    contents, although reporting is enhanced with a minimum of knowledge about the
    files. The mechanism for the distribution of and access of the files is a matter
    of local policy.</p>"
