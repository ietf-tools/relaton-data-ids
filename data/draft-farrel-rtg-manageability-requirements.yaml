abstract:
- content: <p>It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been
    retrofitted to protocols. This is sub-optimal. Similarly, new protocols or protocol
    extensions are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability
    requirements. This document specifies the requirement for all new Routing Area
    Internet-Drafts to include an "Manageability Considerations" section, and gives
    guidance on what that section should contain.</p>
