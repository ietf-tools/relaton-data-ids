abstract:
- content: "<p>The United States Government has published the National Security Agency
    (NSA) Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic
    algorithm policy for national security applications. This document specifies the
    conventions for using the United States National Security Agency's CNSA Suite
    algorithms in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) as specified
    in RFC 8551. It applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all
    components of US National Security Systems that employ S/MIME messaging. US National
    Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also
    appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information.
    It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and
    any other system deployments.</p>"
