abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo provides multi-requirement extensions for DHCPv6, which allow
    hosts to generate or fetch addresses according to the user or network requirements,
    and DHCP servers to centrally manage all types of addresses including SLAAC-configured
    addresses, DHCPv6-configured addresses, and manual-configured addresses. Moreover,
    a general extension for address generation is designed to allow multiple types
    of requirements to be introduced into the DHCPv6 exchanges.</p>"
