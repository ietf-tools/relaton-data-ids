abstract:
- content: "<p>A multicast router should keep forwarding state for every multicast
    tree passing through it. The number of forwarding states grows with the number
    of groups. In this paper, we present a new approach, the MPLS multicast Tree (MMT),
    which utilizes MPLS LSPs between multicast tree branching node routers in order
    to reduce forwarding states and enhance scalability. In our approach only routers
    that are acting as multicast tree branching node routers for a group need to keep
    forwarding state for that group. All other non- branching node routers simply
    forward data packets by traffic engineered unicast routing using MPLS LSPs. We
    can deduce that our approach can be largely deployed because it uses for multicast
    traffic the same unicast MPLS forwarding scheme. We will briefly discuss the multicast
    scalability problem, related works and different techniques for forwarding state
    reduction. We discuss also the advantages of our approach, and conclude that it
    is feasible and promising. Finally, we analytically evaluate our approach.</p>"
