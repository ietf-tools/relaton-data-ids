abstract:
- content: "<p>The congestion avoidance processes of transmission capacity sharing
    TCP flows tend to be synchronized among each other, so that the rate variations
    of the individual flows do not compensate. In contrary, they accumulate into large
    variations of the whole aggregate. The effect is known as global synchronization.
    Large queuing buffer demand and large latency and jitter are the consequences.
    Global Synchronization Protection (GSP) is an extension of regular tail drop packet
    queuing schemes that prevents global synchronization. For large traffic aggregates
    the de-correlation between the individual flow variations reduces buffer demand
    and packet sojourn time by an order of magnitude and more. Even though quite simple,
    the solution has a theoretical background and is not heuristic. It has been tested
    with a Linux kernel implementation and shows equivalent performance as other relevant
    AQM schemes.</p>"
