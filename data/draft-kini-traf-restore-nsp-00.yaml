abstract:
- content: "<p>Traffic recovery time when a link (or node) fails is typically in the
    order of tens of seconds for a link state IGP. The recovery time is governed by
    factors like the time it takes to detect an adjacency down, the time taken to
    propagate link state database changes throughout the network and the time it takes
    to run the SPF algorithm and install the new routes in the FIB. Till this entire
    process is complete, traffic in the network can be blackholed. This draft describes
    a technique to reduce the time for which traffic is blackholed by routing the
    traffic through a neighbor's shortest path.</p>"
