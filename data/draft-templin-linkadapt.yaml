abstract:
- content: "<p>IPv6-in-(foo)*-in-IPv4 tunnels must support a minimum Maximum Transmission
    Unit (MTU) of 1280 bytes for IPv6 via static prearrangements and/or dynamic MTU
    determination based on ICMPv4 messages, but these methods have known operational
    limitations. This document specifies a link adaptation mechanism for IPv6-in-(foo)*-in-
    IPv4 tunnels that presents an assured MTU to the IPv6 layer using tunnel endpoint-based
    segmentation/reassembly and dynamic segment size probing.</p>"
