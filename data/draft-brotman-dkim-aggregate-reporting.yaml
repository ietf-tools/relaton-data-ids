abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a mechanism enabling DKIM-signing domain owners
    to solicit aggregate reports from email receivers. Presented in an XML format,
    these reports possess adaptable elements conducive for integration with current
    and future drafts and standards like DMARCbis. They capture the evaluation outcomes
    of DKIM signatures, such as 'pass' or 'fail', alongside other potential data attributes.
    Receivers can relay these aggregate reports to destinations designated by the
    DKIM-signing domain holder, contingent upon their support capabilities.</p>"
