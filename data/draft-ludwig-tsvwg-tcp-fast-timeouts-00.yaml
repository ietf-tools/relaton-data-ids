abstract:
- content: "<p>A 'fast timeout' occurs if the retransmission timer expires, and afterwards
    the TCP sender receives the duplicate ACK that would have triggered a fast retransmit
    of the oldest outstanding segment. In this case, staying in slow start is an unnecessarily
    drastic response to the congestion indication. Instead, we believe it is safe
    to back out of the slow start phase but instead go into the fast recovery phase.
    One benefit of this approach is that the potentially following duplicate ACKs
    can be exploited for advanced loss recovery algorithms.</p>"
