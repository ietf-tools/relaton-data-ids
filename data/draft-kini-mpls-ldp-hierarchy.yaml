abstract:
- content: "<p>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is used to advertise mappings of
    Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FECs) to labels. IP prefix FECs are used to setup
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs) along routed paths. LDP advertises label mappings
    for IP Prefix FECs that appear as routes in the route table. As the number of
    FECs in the network increases the number of labels correspondingly increases.
    During certain failure conditions a large number of label mappings may have to
    be generated and/or installed in the data plane. In this document we describe
    an LDP extension to advertise hierarchical label mappings. This helps to reduce
    the number of label mappings that are downloaded during certain failure conditions
    and hence improves convergence times.</p>"
