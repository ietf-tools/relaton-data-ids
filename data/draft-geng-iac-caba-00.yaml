abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC5286] introduces Loop-Free Criterion (LFC) in detail, which is
    a technology for local fast rerouting when network failures occur. With LFC, alternate
    next hops are stored alongside with the default next hops in a routers forwarding
    table, and can be immediately activated to invoke a loop free repair path in face
    of link failure. As long as not introducing routing loops, these alternative next
    hops can also be used for multipath transmission if there are stringent demands
    on bandwidth or load balancing. However, in such link state networks, computing
    loop free alternates typically requires one or more rounds of full shortest path
    tree computation on a graph, and poses a heavy burden to both the processor load
    and the memory consumption of a network equipment. In this document, we describe
    an efficient Loop-free Criterion (LFC) implementation method which is based on
    incremental shortest path first (i-SPF), which is suitable for practical deployment
    in large scale networks. The computational complexity of the method is independent
    of the average node degree of the network.</p>"
