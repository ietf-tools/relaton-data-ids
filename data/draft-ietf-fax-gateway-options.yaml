abstract:
- content: <p>To allow connectivity between the general switched telephone network
    facsimile service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax service (i-fax),
    an "Internet Fax Gateway" is required. This document provides guidelines for the
    optional functionality of Internet Fax Gateways. In this context, an "offramp
    gateway" provides facsimile data transmission from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa,
    an "onramp gateway" provides data transmission from GSTN fax to i-fax. The recommendations
    in this document apply to the integrated service including Internet Fax terminals,
    computers with i-fax software on the Internet, and GSTN fax terminals on the GSTN.
    This document supplements the recommendation for minimal features of an Internet
    Fax Gateway. In particular, it covers techniques for dropping duplicated fax messages,
    automatic fax re-transmission, error, return notice, and log handling, and possible
    authorization methods by DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) for onramp gateways.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>
