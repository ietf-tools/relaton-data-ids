abstract:
- content: "<p>Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] provides data integrity
    protection, confidentiality and data origin authentication for data transported
    in an IP packet. There are various applications and protocols that do not require
    confidentiality but only need data integrity assurance or data origin authentication.
    Since ESP support is mandatory for IPSec, such applications end up using ESP with
    NULL encryption. However, because of the way ESP is defined, it is impossible
    for firewalls and intermediate routers to differentiate between encrypted ESP
    and ESP NULL packets by simply examining them. This poses problems for the firewalls
    since such packets cannot be filtered and identified. It poses a different set
    of problems for routers since such packets cannot be properly filtered, classified
    and prioritized. This document proposes an extension to ESP so that firewalls
    and routers can disambiguate between ESP encrypted and ESP NULL encrypted packets.</p>"
