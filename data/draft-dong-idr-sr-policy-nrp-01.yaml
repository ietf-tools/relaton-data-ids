abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated information. The header of a packet
    steered in an SR Policy is augmented with an ordered list of segments associated
    with that SR Policy. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a collection of network
    resources allocated in the network which can be used to support one or a group
    of IETF network slice services. In networks where there are multiple NRPs, an
    SR Policy may be associated with a particular NRP. The association between SR
    Policy and NRP needs to be specified, so that for service traffic which is steered
    into the SR Policy, the header of the packets can be augmented with the information
    associated with the NRP. An SR Policy candidate path can be distributed using
    BGP SR Policy. This document defines the extensions to BGP SR policy to specify
    the NRP which the SR Policy candidate path is associated with.</p>"
