abstract:
- content: <p>DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism that enables
    development of a security-related service, such as authentication or encryption,
    with keys based on domain names; the name owner can be any actor involved in the
    handling of the data, such as the author's organization, a server operator or
    one of their agents. The DOSETA Library provides a collection of common capabilities,
    including canonicalization, parameter tagging, and retrieval of self-certified
    keys. The DOSETA Signing Template affixes a signature to data that is in a "header/content"
    form. Defining the meaning of the signature is the responsibility of the service
    that incorporates DOSETA. The signature is validated through a cryptographic signature
    and querying the signer's domain directly, to retrieve the appropriate public
    key.</p>
