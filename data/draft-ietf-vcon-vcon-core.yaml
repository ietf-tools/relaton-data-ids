abstract:
- content: "<p>vCon is a standardized framework for the exchange of conversational
    data. Conversations, which may involve one or more participants, occur across
    a wide variety of modes and application platforms. This document defines a JSON
    format for representing conversational data, encompassing metadata, conversation
    media, related documents, and analysis. The goal of this standard is to provide
    an abstracted, platform-independent data format for conversations, regardless
    of the mode or application platform. By doing so, it facilitates the integration
    and seamless exchange of conversational data across application platforms, enterprises,
    and trust boundaries.</p>"
