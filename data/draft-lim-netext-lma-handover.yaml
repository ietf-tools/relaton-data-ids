abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for context transfer between Local
    Mobility Anchors (LMAs) in a large Proxy MIPv6 domain to provide the IP ongoing
    session continuity of mobile nodes. In order to enhance the performance of the
    LMA handover, a bi-directional tunnel between a previous LMA and a new target
    LMA is established.</p>"
