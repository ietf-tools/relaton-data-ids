abstract:
- content: "<p>This document standardizes both 1) a means of requesting a stream of
    packet samples from any device generating, routing, or forwarding traffic, and
    2) receiving metadata information from the network element about these packet
    samples, and the structure of said stream metadata. A main design requirement
    is to provide network elements with widely varying capabilities (e.g., ASICs,
    NPUs, NICs, vSwitches, CPUs) a mechanism to sample and export packets at high
    rates, by allowing communication of the specific bit formats of internal data
    headers applied to the packet flow, in a way that enhances interoperability between
    traffic sources and sinks. Historically, Netflow and similar mechanisms have been
    used for these use cases; however, the increasing packet rates of very high-speed
    devices and increasing variance in the information available to data planes lends
    itself to both a less-prescriptive set of packet formats as well as a decoupling
    of the sampling action from the collection and analysis mechanisms.</p>"
