abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not
    have a normative reference to a non standards track specification except those
    from other standards bodies. This document creates an External Specification registry,
    similar to the DownRef registry that has been created based on [RFC3967] and permits
    normative references to community accepted external specifications.</p>"
