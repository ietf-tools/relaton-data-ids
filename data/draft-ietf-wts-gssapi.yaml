abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes a means of using the Generic Security
    Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) to secure World Wide Web transactions.
    Use of the GSS-API enables mutual authentication and data encryption capabilities
    to be incorporated into Web clients (browsers) and servers in a security technology-independent
    manner. Such an approach facilitates the use of Web applications in a variety
    of security environments, and provides a basis for Web applications to negotiate
    common security mechanisms at run-time.</p>"
