abstract:
- content: "<p>This document argues for and describes alternatives that shift specific
    language conventions used by RFC Authors and RFC Editors to avoid offensive terminology
    in the technical documentation of the RFC series. Specifically, this document
    details two sets of terms that are normalised on the technical level but offensive
    on a societal level. First, arguments are presented for why any offensive terms
    should be avoided by the IETF/IRTF. Second, problem statements for both sets of
    terms are presented and alternatives are referenced and proposed. There is a third
    section on additional considerations and general action points to address the
    RFC series, past and future. Lastly, a summary of recommendations is presented.</p>"
