abstract:
- content: <p>The document describes an IPv6 header compression format for transmission
    of IPv6 packets in 6LoWPAN networks. Specifications of the compression format
    rely on specific contexts for which the implementation of fragmentation and defragmentation/reassembly
    is not recommended. Specifications include frameworks for compressing and decompressing
    header as well as compression and decompression of source and destination addresses.
    This document complements "Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams in 6LoWPAN Networks",
    [draft-ietf-6lowpan-hc-07].</p>
