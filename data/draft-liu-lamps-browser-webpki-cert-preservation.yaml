abstract:
- content: "<p>The management of Web PKI certificate resources presents a challenge
    when the misalignment of ownership and management rights over certificate resources
    of one organization creating a risk of unilateral suspension and revocation by
    another competing organizations. This situation undermines the stability of critical
    infrastructure and affects the integrity of authentication systems. To address
    these concerns, this document proposes a mechanism that allows Internet browsers
    to create a customized management view of certificate resources, enabling them
    to override verification results from specific certification authorities as needed.
    This approach enhances security, facilitates stakeholder collaboration, and preserves
    the operational integrity of essential industry systems.</p>"
