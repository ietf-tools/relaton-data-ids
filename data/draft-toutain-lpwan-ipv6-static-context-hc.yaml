abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a header compression scheme for IPv6, IPv6/
    UDP based on static contexts. This technique is especially tailored for LPWA networks
    and could be extended to other protocol stacks. During the IETF history several
    compression mechanisms have been proposed. First mechanisms, such as RoHC, are
    using a context to store header field values and send smaller incremental differences
    on the link. Values in the context evolve dynamically with information contained
    in the compressed header. The challenge is to maintain sender's and receiver's
    contexts synchronized even with packet losses. Based on the fact that IPv6 contains
    only static fields, 6LoWPAN developed an efficient context-free compression mechanisms,
    allowing better flexibility and performance. The Static Context Header Compression
    (SCHC) combines the advantages of RoHC context which offers a great level of flexibility
    in the processing of fields, and 6LoWPAN behavior to elide fields that are known
    from the other side. Static context means that values in the context field do
    not change during the transmission, avoiding complex resynchronization mechanisms,
    incompatible with LPWA characteristics. In most of the cases, IPv6/UDP headers
    are reduced to a small identifier. This document focuses on IPv6/UDP headers compression,
    but the mechanism can be applied to other protocols such as CoAP. It will be described
    in a separate document.</p>"
