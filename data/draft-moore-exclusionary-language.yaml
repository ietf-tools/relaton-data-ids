abstract:
- content: <p>It has been asserted that some language in IETF documents is "exclusionary"
    - that it offends some readers or groups of people, and/or discourages participation
    in IETF by doing so. While there is some debate about exactly which language is
    exclusionary, at least some cited examples of such language can credibly have
    such effects. It is believed that most instances of such language are accidental,
    and that most document authors and editors wish to avoid use of language that
    may be offensive. This memo therefore attempts to establish procedures that warn
    document authors and editors about language that may credibly having such effects,
    and thereby, to reduce both accidental and deliberate use of such language. At
    the same time, it is recognized that in some cases there an be strong and conflicting
    opinions about whether or not particular language is desirable or appropriate.
    IETF's primary function is providing technical direction for the benefit of the
    Internet community, rather than social engineering. If a document can be blocked
    or substantially delayed over disputes about the proprietary of language in that
    document, this can be disruptive to IETF's primary function. This memo therefore
    makes recommendations to prevent such disputes from blocking progress on technical
    documents.</p>
