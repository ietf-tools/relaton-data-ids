abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for
    establishing and configuring secure links in an ad hoc mesh radio network. Effective
    mesh networking using radio links requires identifying, configuring, and securing
    usable links to neighboring devices. In an ad hoc mesh network a device's neighbors
    may come and go as the network's membership and physical environment change. Newly
    usable links need to be identified and configured automatically, where configuration
    values can include link-layer addresses, transmit and receive modes, security
    parameters, and so forth. MLE includes the option of securing the configuration
    messages themselves, as link-layer security is typically not available prior to
    configuration.</p>"
