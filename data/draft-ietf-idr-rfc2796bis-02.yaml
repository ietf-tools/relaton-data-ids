abstract:
- content: <p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system routing
    protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. Typically, all BGP speakers within a single
    AS must be fully meshed so that any external routing information must be re-distributed
    to all other routers within that Autonomous System (AS). This represents a serious
    scaling problem that has been well documented with several alternatives proposed.
    This document describes the use and design of a method known as "route reflection"
    to alleviate the need for "full mesh" Internal BGP (IBGP). This document obsoletes
    RFC 2796 and RFC 1966. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
