abstract:
- content: "<p>The text currently present in section 6.3 from RFC 3280 is dedicated
    to CRL validation. This text needs to be more detailed to explain exactly how
    it can made be sure that a CRL is issued by the right entity. In addition, a text
    dedicated to the characteristics that conforming applications MUST support needs
    to be provided: the current text covers the most complex case and is too complicated
    to be easily simplified. Text is proposed to be included in 3280bis and to partially
    replace section 6.3.</p>"
