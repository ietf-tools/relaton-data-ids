abstract:
- content: "<p>The Link Management Protocol (LMP) requires that a bi-directional control
    channel is established to form an LMP adjacency. The control channel may be transmitted
    either in-band with the data links or out-of-band over a separate wavelength,
    fiber, or IP network. This draft specifies a simple procedure to dynamically bootstrap
    LMP control channels and exchange interface mappings using a new LMP message that
    is transmitted in-band over the data links. This memo also details how this mechanism
    is used in implementing Layer Adjacency Discovery as described in [G.7714.1].</p>"
