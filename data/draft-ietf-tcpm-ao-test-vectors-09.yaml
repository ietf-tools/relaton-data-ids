abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides test vectors to validate implementations of
    the two mandatory authentication algorithms specified for the TCP Authentication
    Option over both IPv4 and IPv6. This includes validation of the key derivation
    function (KDF) based on a set of test connection parameters as well as validation
    of the message authentication code (MAC). Vectors are provided for both currently
    required pairs of KDF and MAC algorithms: KDF_HMAC_SHA1 and HMAC- SHA-1-96, and
    KDF_AES_128_CMAC and AES-128-CMAC-96. The vectors also validate both whole TCP
    segments as well as segments whose options are excluded for middlebox traversal.</p>"
