abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents a way to include information on active routers
    capabilities in routing protocols. In this document, a special focus will be put
    on OSPF protocol release 2 [2], meanwhile other routing protocols might be considered.
    These information on active routers transferred through routing protocols will
    help active routers to exploit as better as possible the abilities of other active
    routers. This draft especially focus on OSPF protocol v2 and describes the corresponding
    opaque LSA complements according to the RFC 2370 [3].</p>"
