abstract:
- content: "<p>Compute First Networking (CFN) enables the dispatching of the service
    request to an optimal edge site to improve the overall system load balancing and
    efficiency. Especially when an edge site is overloaded, other edges with service
    equivalency can dynamically serve the request. This document describes a CFN field
    trial to show the effect that CFN can achieve. Edge to edge interaction to get
    the available computing resources information for services and the network status
    to each other is introduced. Data plane to support late binding based dynamic
    anycast is illustrated too. The field trial shows that CFN can greatly improve
    the overall query per second served for a service hosted on multiple edges in
    a more balanced way.</p>"
