abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Post Sockets, an asynchronous abstract programming
    interface for the atomic transmission of objects in an explicitly multipath environment.
    Post replaces connections with long-lived associations between endpoints, with
    the possibility to cache cryptographic state in order to reduce amortized connection
    latency. We present this abstract interface as an illustration of what is possible
    with present developments in transport protocols when freed from the strictures
    of the current sockets API.</p>"
