abstract:
- content: "<p>MIME is a method of packaging and labeling aggregations of data; it
    is used both for email and the Web. Many usage scenarios would benefit by having
    an objective method of assessing the validity of MIME data, based on an authenticated
    identity. MIMEAUTH leverages technology developed for DKIM to provide such a method.
    Its use can be extended to cover specific header-fields of a containing email
    message or World Wide Web HTTP content. Existing authentication mechanisms have
    achieved only limited success due to challenges with administration and use. MIMEAUTH
    has very low administration and use overhead, through self-certifying keys in
    the DNS and a labeling method that can be transparent to end-users. For relayed
    and mediated sequences, MIMEAUTH can be implemented within a service and therefore
    can be transparent to end-system software.</p>"
