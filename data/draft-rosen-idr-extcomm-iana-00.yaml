abstract:
- content: <p>This document reorganizes the IANA Registries for the type values and
    sub-type values of BGP Extended Communities attribute and the BGP IPv6-Address-Specific
    Extended Communities attribute. This is done in order to remove inter-dependencies
    among the registries, thus making it easier for IANA to determine which codepoints
    are available for assignment in which registries. This document also clarifies
    the information that must be provided to IANA when requesting an allocation from
    one or more of these registries. These changes are compatible with the existing
    allocations, and thus do not affect protocol implementations. The changes will
    however impact the "IANA Considerations" sections of future protocol specifications.
    This document updates RFCs 4360 and 5701.</p>
