abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of firewalls deployed today are Mobile IPv6 unaware. Widespread
    Mobile IPv6 deployment is not possible unless Mobile IPv6 messages can pass through
    these firewalls. In this memo, policy servers are used to communicate with firewalls
    and instruct them to bypass Mobile IPv6 messages. To achieve the goal, Network
    Access Identifier (NAI) and authentication information are included in Mobile
    IPv6 control signalling or data packets. Firewalls extract these information and
    send them to a policy server, and the policy server then installs corresponding
    states in firewalls based on authentication result and user's predefined policy.
    The new defined IPv6 extension header and the policy-based frame can also facilitate
    dynamic configuration in any application firewall traversal.</p>"
