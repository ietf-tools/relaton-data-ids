    the world of data transmission, efficiency and reliability are paramount. Custom
    protocols can be tailored to specific needs, optimizing data transfer and enabling
    advanced features. This document presents a custom protocol designed to facilitate
    data exchange while integrating compression and decompression techniques for improved
    efficiency. 1.2 Objectives The main objectives of this protocol are as follows:
    Efficient data transmission using compression techniques. Ensuring data integrity
    through Merkle Tree-based verification. Implementing a flexible protocol capable
    of handling various data types. Seamless transition between states for connection
    establishment, data transfer, and termination. 1.3 Scope This document focuses
    on the protocol''s design, functions, and implementation details, emphasizing
    compression and decompression features. It provides code snippets and explanations
    to illustrate the key aspects of the protocol. 2. Protocol Architecture 2.1 Overview
    The custom protocol is designed to operate in different states, from establishing
    connections to transmitting compressed data and verifying data integrity. It incorporates
    compression and decompression techniques to optimize data transmission while maintaining
    data integrity. The protocol''s architecture is modular, allowing for easy expansion
    and customization. 2.2 State Diagram The protocol''s state diagram depicts the
    various states and their transitions. It encompasses states such as connection
    establishment, compression, decompression, data transmission, integrity verification,
    and termination. (Insert State Diagram Image) 2.3 Protocol Components The protocol
    includes the following key components: State Machine: Manages state transitions
    based on protocol operations and events. Compression and Decompression Functions:
    Implement efficient data compression and decompression techniques. Merkle Tree:
    Constructs a Merkle Tree for data integrity verification. Data Handling Functions:
    Facilitate sending and receiving data, including MP4 files. 3. Compression and
    Decompression 3.1 Compression Techniques The protocol employs a compression algorithm
    that combines multiple data packets into a single compressed buffer. This technique
    reduces the overhead associated with individual packet headers, resulting in efficient
    data transmission. 3.2 Decompression Techniques The decompression process involves
    extracting individual data packets from the compressed buffer and reconstructing
    the original data. Decompression ensures that the data can be processed and utilized
    seamlessly. 3.3 Implementation Details The protocol''s compressPackets function
    combines a set of packets into a single compressed buffer, updating the protocol''s
    state and data attributes accordingly. Conversely, the decompressPackets function
    performs the reverse process, extracting the original packets from the compressed
    buffer. 4. Protocol States and Transitions 4.1 State Descriptions The protocol
    operates in several states, including: Closed: Initial state before any connection
    is established. Connecting: Establishing a connection with another entity. Established:
    Connection successfully established. Compressing: Performing data compression.
    Sending Compressed Data: Transmitting the compressed data. Receiving Compressed
    Data: Receiving compressed data from another entity. Decompressing: Performing
    data decompression. Sending Decompressed Data: Transmitting the decompressed data.
    Disconnecting: Initiating disconnection. Disconnect Acknowledgment: Acknowledging
    the disconnection request. Disconnect Complete: Disconnection process completed.
    Error: Handling erroneous situations. CRC Check: Performing CRC (Cyclic Redundancy
    Check) verification. Data Loss: Handling data loss situations. FEC Decoding: Forward
    Error Correction (FEC) decoding. Retransmit: Re-transmitting lost data. Timeout:
    Handling timeout situations. Graceful Disconnect: Initiating a graceful disconnection.
    Disconnect Verification: Verifying the success of disconnection. 4.2 State Transition
    Diagram The state transition diagram illustrates the flow of the protocol through
    various states based on user interactions, data transmission, and events. (Insert
    State Transition Diagram Image) 5. Code Implementation 5.1 Compression Functions
    The protocol''s compressPackets function combines multiple packets into a single
    compressed buffer. The function calculates the compressed size, allocates memory,
    and updates the protocol''s attributes. (Insert compressPackets Function Code)
    5.2 Decompression Functions The protocol''s decompressPackets function extracts
    individual packets from a compressed buffer, reconstructing the original data.
    The function updates the protocol''s attributes accordingly. (Insert decompressPackets
    Function Code) 5.3 Sending Commands The protocol''s sendCommand function handles
    various commands, including compression commands. When the "COMPRESS" command
    is received, the function triggers the compression process. (Insert sendCommand
    Function Code) 5.4 Receiving Data The protocol''s receiveMP4Data function handles
    received data, including compressed data. If the received data is compressed,
    the function automatically triggers the decompression process. (Insert receiveMP4Data
    Function Code) 5.5 Merkle Tree Construction The protocol constructs a Merkle Tree
    for data integrity verification. The constructMerkleTree103 function creates a
    Merkle Tree from an array of packet hashes. (Insert constructMerkleTree103 Function
    Code) 6. Integration and Testing 6.1 Unit Testing Unit testing ensures the correctness
    of individual functions and components. It involves testing compression, decompression,
    Merkle Tree construction, and other critical functions. 6.2 Integration Testing
    Integration testing validates the interactions between different components of
    the protocol. It ensures seamless data flow between states, successful compression
    and decompression, and accurate integrity verification. 6.3 Performance Evaluation
    Performance evaluation assesses the protocol''s efficiency in terms of data transmission
    speed, compression ratio, and integrity verification time. It involves testing
    the protocol with various data sizes and scenarios. 7. Conclusion 7.1 Achievements
    The implemented custom protocol successfully combines efficient data transmission
    with compression and decompression techniques. It ensures data integrity through
    Merkle Tree-based verification and facilitates various operations, including connection
    establishment and graceful termination. 7.2 Future Enhancements Future enhancements
    to the protocol could include: Support for additional compression algorithms.
    Advanced error correction mechanisms. Integration with real-world applications
    for practical testing. 8. References [List of references used for protocol design
