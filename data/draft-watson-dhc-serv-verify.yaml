abstract:
- content: "<p>The document defines a mechanism to allow a DHCP client to verify the
    authenticity of a DHCP server configuration offer using DNSSEC. Currently DHCP
    clients have no way to assess which of DHCP OFFERS are from valid DHCP servers,
    and which are not. Malicious DHCP servers can cause various network problems for
    unsuspecting clients. In order to support DHCP server authorization a new DNS
    Resource Record type (ALLOC) is added. Using the ALLOC record in combination with
    the servers KEY record the client can authoritatively assess if the server is
    authorized.</p>"
