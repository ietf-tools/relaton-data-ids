abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP/2 spec requires that TLS renegotiation not be employed when
    the negotiated application protocol is HTTP/2. This document defines an extension
    to HTTP/2 which permits renegotiation to be employed by peers which mutually consent
    to do so, while allowing peers to understand whether renegotiation is permitted
    before attempting it.</p>"
