abstract:
- content: "<p>Network mobility is proposed to let a mobile network change its point
    of attachment and still to keep all nodes attached to the mobile network globally
    reachable. However, due to scare bandwidth, limited signaling coverage and frequent
    link failure, a mobile network needs multihoming, i.e., multiple paths simultaneously
    to access the Internet, on the perspective of performance and reliability. The
    document specifies how to support multihoming in network mobility using the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP). The proposed Multihomed SIP-based Network Mobility
    (SIP-NEMO) can dynamically select a path per session according to the status of
    egress interfaces and/or gateways.</p>"
