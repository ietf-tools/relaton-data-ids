abstract:
- content: "<p>The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) was developed to prevent
    IP source address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic
    redirection. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) who provides Internet access services,
    information services and value- added services to the customers should guarantee
    security of its network and customers' privacy. Thus, the mechanism is essential
    for ISPs. However, due to a diversity of ISPs' access network, SAVI solution is
    also different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of ISPs'IPv6
    access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements and according tentative
    solutions.</p>"
