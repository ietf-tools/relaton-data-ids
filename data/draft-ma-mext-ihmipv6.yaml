abstract:
- content: "<p>In HMIPv6 (RFC5213), a mobile node has three IPv6 addresses: HoA, RCoA
    and LCoA. Outside the domain of a MAP, RCoA is used for routing, while HoA is
    used for authentication. Hence HA and CN should maintain the binding of RCoA and
    HoA. Inside the domain of a MAP, RCoA is used for authentication, while LCoA is
    used for routing. Hence MAP should maintain the binding of RCoA and LCoA. Since
    RCoA is used for authentication, it should be unique to a mobile node. Therefore,
    how many mobile nodes there are inside domain of a MAP, how many different RCoAs
    the MAP has to allocate to the mobile nodes. In this Internet Draft, an improved
    or alternative solution to HMIPv6 is presented, where RCoA is no longer used for
    authentication inside the domains of a MAP. RCoA is used only for routing outside
    the domain of a MAP, as LCoA does inside the domain of a MAP. Inside the domain
    of a MAP, HoA is used for authentication, as it does outside the domain of a MAP.
    Since RCoA is no longer used for authentication, only one RCoA will be enough
    for all mobile nodes inside the domain of a MAP. Remark: This Internet Draft is
    based on HMIPv6 (RFC5380). Only those parts in HMIPv6 related to RCoA have been
    rewritten, while the other parts in HMIPv6 remain almost unchanged.</p>"
