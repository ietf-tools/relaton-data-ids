abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the use of RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol),
    including all the necessary extensions, to establish label-switched paths (LSPs)
    in MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching). Since the flow along an LSP is completely
    identified by the label applied at the ingress node of the path, these paths may
    be treated as tunnels. A key application of LSP tunnels is traffic engineering
    with MPLS as specified in RFC 2702. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
