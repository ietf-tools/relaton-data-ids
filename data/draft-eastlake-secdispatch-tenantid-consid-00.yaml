abstract:
- content: "<p>Many protocols provide for header fields to be added to a packet on
    ingress to a network domain and removed on egress from that domain. Examples of
    such fields are Tenant ID for multi-tenant networks, ingress port ID and/or type,
    and other identity or handling directive fields. These fields mean that a packet
    may be accompanied by supplemental information as it transits the network domain
    that would not be present with the packet or not be visible if it were simply
    forwarded in a traditional manner. A particular concern is that these fields may
    harm privacy by identifying, in detail, the packet source and intended traffic
    handling. This document provides Security Considerations for the inclusion of
    such fields with a packet.</p>"
