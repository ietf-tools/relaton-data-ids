abstract:
- content: "<p>Security incidents, such as system compromises, worms, viruses, phishing
    incidents, and denial of service, typically result in the loss of service, data,
    and resources both human and system. Service providers and Computer Security Incident
    Response Teams need to be equipped and ready to assist in communicating and tracing
    security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of
    an attack. Real-time Inter-network Defense (RID) outlines a proactive inter-network
    communication method to facilitate sharing incident-handling data while integrating
    existing detection, tracing, source identification, and mitigation mechanisms
    for a complete incident-handling solution. Combining these capabilities in a communication
    system provides a way to achieve higher security levels on networks. Policy guidelines
    for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium
    using the security recommendations and considerations. This document obsoletes
    RFC 6045. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
