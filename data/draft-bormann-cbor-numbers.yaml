abstract:
- content: "<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as defined in STD
    94 (RFC 8949), is a data representation format whose design goals include the
    possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility
    without the need for version negotiation. Among the kinds of data that a data
    representation format needs to be able to carry, numbers have a prominent role,
    but also have inherent complexity that needs attention from protocol designers
    and implementers of CBOR libraries and of the applications that use them. This
    document gives an overview over number formats available in CBOR and some notable
    CBOR tags registered, and it attempts to provide information about opportunities
    and potential pitfalls of these number formats. // This is a rather drafty initial
    revision, pieced together from // various components, so it has a higher level
    of redundancy than // ultimately desired.</p>"
