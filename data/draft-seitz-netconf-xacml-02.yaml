abstract:
- content: "<p>The NETCONF remote network configuration protocol currently lacks an
    access control model. The need for such a model has been recognised within the
    NETCONF working group. The eXtended Access Control Markup Language (XACML) is
    an XML-based access control standard, with widespread acceptance from the industry
    and good open-source support. This document proposes a profile that defines how
    to use XACML to provide fine-grain access control for NETCONF commands.</p>"
