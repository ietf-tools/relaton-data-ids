abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) PUT method only
    allows a complete replacement of a resource. This does not permit applications
    to perform partial resource modifications. In case of resources with larger or
    complex data, or in situations where a resource continuity is required, replacing
    a resource is not an option. Several applications using CoAP will need to perform
    partial resource modifications. This proposal adds new CoAP methods, PATCH and
    iPATCH, to modify an existing CoAP resource partially.</p>"
