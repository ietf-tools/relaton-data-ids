abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an IPv6 protocol extension that allows IPv6
    packets to be backward compatible with IPv4. An IPv6 packet encapsulated in IPv4
    in this way (called IPv64) would be processed as native IPv6 by IPv6 routers,
    and at the same time, in case there is an IPv4-only router in the path, it will
    be processed as IPv4. Consequently, it is possible to have native end-to-end IPv6
    communication, with IPv6 processing at IPv6 routers, through a path that contains
    some IPv4-only routers. Protocol conversion from/to IPv6 to/from IPv64 is made
    at edge routers, and therefore the advantages of IPv64 are achieved with standard
    native IPv6 hosts</p>"
