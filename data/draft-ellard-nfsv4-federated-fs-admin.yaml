abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the administration protocol for a federated
    file system that enables file access and namespace traversal across collections
    of independently administered fileservers. The protocol specifies a set of interfaces
    by which fileservers and collections of fileservers with different administrators
    can form a fileserver federation that provides a namespace composed of the filesystems
    physically hosted on and exported by the constituent fileservers.</p>"
