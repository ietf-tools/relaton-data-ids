abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies a need for improvement of the unicast Reverse
    Path Filtering techniques (uRPF) [BCP84] for source address validation (SAV) [BCP38].
    The strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious
    to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance
    between the two [BCP84]. However, as shown in this draft, the existing feasible-path
    uRPF still has short comings. This document describes an enhanced feasible-path
    uRPF technique, which aims to be more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality
    than the feasible-path uRPF. It can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about
    the possibility of disrupting service for their customers, and encourage greater
    deployment of uRPF techniques.</p>"
