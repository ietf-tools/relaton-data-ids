abstract:
- content: "<p>Weak Identifier Multihoming Protocol Framework (WIMP-F) is a wedge
    layer 3.5 framework to be applied with different kind of routable application
    layer identifiers (AIDs) and layer 3.5 context identifiers (CIDs) presented in
    Group-F. WIMP-F consists of context establishment and re-addressing exchanges
    that are protected with one-way hash chains and a technique called as secret splitting.
    The hash chain protects a host from re-direction attacks, but not directly from
    an CID or AID theft. The ownerships can be provided in variable ways presented
    in other Multi6 drafts.</p>"
