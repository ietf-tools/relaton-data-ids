abstract:
- content: "<p>Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a routing protocol designed
    for use in mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol divides the nodes of the ad hoc
    network into a number of overlapping or disjoint 2-hop- diameter clusters in a
    distributed manner. A cluster head is elected for each cluster to maintain cluster
    membership information. Inter- cluster routes are discovered dynamically using
    the cluster membership information kept at each cluster head. By clustering nodes
    into groups, the protocol efficiently minimizes the flooding traffic during route
    discovery and speeds up this process as well. Furthermore, the protocol takes
    into consideration the existence of uni-directional links and uses these links
    for both intra-cluster and inter-cluster routing.</p>"
