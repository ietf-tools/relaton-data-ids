abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic bandwidth management using ATM Resource Adjuster Cells provides
    the capability to support fast effective end-to-end bandwidth control for IP traffic
    transported over an ATM backbone network. This feature can open up potential new
    services for Service Providers to offer dynamic service levels traffic agreements
    to their customers. By offering dynamic service levels, Service Providers can
    broaden their scope of service differentiation. For example, using dynamic bandwidth
    feature, Service Providers can offer their customers real-time video or multimedia
    transport capability across the networks. Using Dynamic Resource Adjuster Cells
    (DRACs), the network supporting it can quickly adjust bandwidth without taking
    down the ATM network connection and re-establishing it. In a fast changing dynamic
    environment, this dynamic adjuster capability makes a difference in both performance
    and scalability.</p>"
