abstract:
- content: "<p>Authorization is a key component in conference policy. Authorization
    rules specify who is allowed to join a conference, see floors and request them,
    subscribe to conference-information and so on. This document proposes an Extensible
    Markup Language (XML) document format for conference authorization rules. This
    draft is intended for discussion purposes only, and in case this approach is taken,
    it would need to be merged with the on-going Conference Policy Control Protocol
    (CPCP) work.</p>"
