abstract:
- content: "<p>As IPsec is widely deployed, there is increasing need to negotiate
    security keys using IKE at application level granularity. IKE, as currently proposed,
    has restrictions in negotiating keys for applications with bundled sessions and
    complex policies. The draft identifies the problem with IKE and suggests extensions
    to make IKE application and policy friendly. The proposed solution suggests extensions
    to the conceptual operation of IPsec as well as IKE, but does not require changes
    to existing IKE payloads. The document introduces a new policy payload that complements
    existing IKE payloads and suggests replacing ID payload with the Policy payload,
    in Quick mode.</p>"
