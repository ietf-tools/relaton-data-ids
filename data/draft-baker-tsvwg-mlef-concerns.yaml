abstract:
- content: "<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States Department
    of Defense, with is contractors, has proposed a service architecture for military
    (NATO and related agencies) telephone systems. This is called the Assured Service,
    and is defined in two documents: 'Architecture for Assured Service Capabilities
    in Voice over IP' and 'Requirements for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice
    over IP'. Responding to these are four documents: 'Reason Header Field for the
    Session Initiation Protocol', 'Extending the Session Initiation Protocol Reason
    Header to account for Preemption Events', 'Communications Resource Priority for
    the Session Initiation Protocol', and the 'Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding Per
    Hop Behavior' (MLEF PHB). MLEF, as currently defined, has serious problems, which
    this draft seeks to discuss.</p>"
