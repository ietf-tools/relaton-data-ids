abstract:
- content: "<p>In an EVPN or any other VPN deployment, there is an urgent need to
    tailor the reachability checks of the client nodes via off-box tools which can
    be triggered from a remote Overlay end-point or a centralized controller. There
    is also a ease of operability needed when the knowledge known is partial or incomplete.
    This document aims to address the limitation in current standards for doing so
    and provides solution which can be made standards in future. As an additional
    requirement, in network border routers, there are liaison/ dummy VRFs created
    to leak routes from one network/fabric to another. There are scenarios wherein
    an explicit reachability check for these type of VRFs is not possible with existing
    mpls-ping mechanisms. This draft intends to address this as well. Few of missing
    pieces are equally applicable to the native lsp ping as well.</p>"
