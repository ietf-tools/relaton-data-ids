abstract:
- content: '<p>This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible
    enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while avoiding elements
    that harm human-to-human interoperation. This is one of a pair of documents: this
    contains recommendations for what addresses humans should use, such that address
    provisioning systems can restrain themselves to addresses that email valdidators
    accept. (This set can also be described in other ways, including "simple to cut-and-paste"
    and "understandable by some community".) Its companion defines simpler rules,
    accepts more addresses, and is intended for software like MTAs.</p>'
