abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism for conveying multiple IP addresses
    of different address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for a given medium, in the same
    Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer. This proposed mechanism solves the backward
    compatibility which exists with ANAT, due to its syntax, and provides a migration
    path towards support for ICE. The proposed mechanism is significantly less complex
    then ICE or ICE-Lite but uses ICE syntax. The mechanism described in this document
    has been named ICE-microLite.</p>"
