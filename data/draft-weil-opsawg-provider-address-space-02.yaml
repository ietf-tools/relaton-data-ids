abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the use of a reserved IANA IPv4 address allocation
    to support the deployment of IPv6 transition technologies and IPv4 address sharing
    technologies post IPv4 exhaustion. Service providers are in the process of implementing
    IPv6 support by providing dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 services to their end-users.
    One method for continued support of the IPv4 Internet post IANA IPv4 depletion
    is through the use of a carrier-provided NAT444 infrastructure. Another mechanism
    used to transition to IPv6 is an IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel such as IPv6 Rapid Deployment
    (6RD). This document details the use of an IANA reserved address block for these
    purposes.</p>"
