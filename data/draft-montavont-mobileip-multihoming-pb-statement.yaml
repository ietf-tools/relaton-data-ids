abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of multiple interfaces is foreseen to provide ubiquitous, permanent
    and fault-tolerant access to the Internet, particularly on mobile nodes which
    are more prone to failure or sudden lack of connectivity. However, Mobile IPv6
    currently lacks support for such multihomed nodes. Individual solutions have been
    proposed to extend Mobile IPv6 but all issues have not been addressed in a single
    document. The purpose of the present document is thus to fill up this gap and
    to raise the discussion in order to make sure that forthcoming solutions will
    address all the issues. In this document, we propose a taxonomy to classify the
    situations where a mobile node could be multihomed. This taxonomy is then used
    to highlight the issues preventing mobile nodes operating Mobile IPv6 to be multihomed.</p>"
