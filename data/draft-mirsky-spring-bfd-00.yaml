abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.
    It can be realized in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network without
    any change to the data plane. A segment is encoded as an MPLS label and an ordered
    list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
    (BFD) is expected to monitor any kind of paths between systems. This document
    defines how to use Label Switched Path Ping to bootstrap and control path in reverse
    direction of a BFD session on the Segment Routing network over MPLS dataplane.</p>"
