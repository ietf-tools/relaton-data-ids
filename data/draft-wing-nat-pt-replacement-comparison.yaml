abstract:
- content: "<p>As we approach IPv4 address depletion, the IETF must provide for IPv4
    and IPv6 coexistence: a way for ISPs and enterprises to reduce public IPv4 address
    consumption and a way for hosts to migrate to IPv6 connectivity -- while providing
    reasonable access for those IPv6 hosts to access the IPv4 Internet. This draft
    compares eight proposals for IPv6 and IPv4 coexistence.</p>"
