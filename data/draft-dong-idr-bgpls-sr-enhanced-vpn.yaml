abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support
    some applications' needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.
    VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the resources
    and characteristics provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network
    (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which can be used to support one or a group
    of VPN+ services. In the context of network slicing, a VTN could be instantiated
    as a network resource partition (NRP). This document specifies the BGP-LS mechanisms
    with necessary extensions to advertise the information of scalable Segment Routing
    (SR) based NRPs to a centralized network controller. Each NRP can have a customized
    topology and a set of network resources allocated from the physical network. Multiple
    NRPs may shared the same topology, and multiple NRPs may share the same set of
    network resources on specific network segments. This allows flexible combination
    of network topology and network resource attributes to build a large number of
    NRPs with a relatively small number of logical topologies. The proposed mechanism
    is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment
    routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</p>"
