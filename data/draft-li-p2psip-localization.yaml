abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the traffic problems due to randomly distributed
    data storage in P2PSIP overlay, identifies the traffic localization requirements,
    and then proposes an overlay construction and data storage mechanism to implement
    traffic localization for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD). Specifically,
    it's proposed to add location indicator to the Peer node ID, for example, the
    beginning 5 bit hash ID stands for the peer location, and user data with the location
    indication shall be possible to be stored in local peer, thus to achieve traffic
    localization, reduce backbone network traffic, and improve the efficiency and
    QoS of the whole network.</p>"
