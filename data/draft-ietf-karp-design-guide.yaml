abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of a series concerned with defining a roadmap
    of protocol specification work for the use of modern cryptographic mechanisms
    and algorithms for message authentication in routing protocols. In particular,
    it defines the framework for a key management protocol that may be used to create
    and manage session keys for message authentication and integrity. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
