abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) conformant
    with an Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA). The AMP provides monitoring
    and configuration services between managing devices (Managers) and managed devices
    (Agents), some of which may operate on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption
    links. The AMP minimizes the number of transmitted bytes, operates without sessions
    or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions autonomously when there is no timely
    contact with a network operator. The AMP accomplishes this without requiring mobile
    code and generally reduces the processor, memory, and storage requirements of
    implementing Managers and Agents.</p>"
