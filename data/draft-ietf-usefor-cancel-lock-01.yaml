abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines a method that may be used by authors of successor
    (or canceling) articles to authenticate their authorship of the original article.
    As a proto-article article passes through various agents they may include the
    hash of a secret string in a Cancel-Key header. Later if they wish to use a standard
    mechanism to remove the original article (eg Cancel or Supersede) they can include
    this string in the Cancel-Lock header to verify that they are entitled to perform
    this operation. Familiarity with the current News Article Format draft [ARTICLE]
    is assumed.</p>"
