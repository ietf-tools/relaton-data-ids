abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 6222 describes a number of mechanisms for generating a unique CNAME
    Unfortunately, these algorithms are rather complicated and also produce CNAMEs
    which in some cases are potentially linkable over multiple RTCP sessions even
    if a new CNAME is generated for each session. This document specifies a replacement
    algorithm for the algorithm in Section 5 which does not have this limitation and
    is also simpler to implement.</p>"
