abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests a protocol for messaging notification in which a
    messaging system (e.g. email server, voice mail system, etc.) notifies a notification
    service, and through it the user, that changes have occurred in a user's mailbox
    (new message arrived, mailbox is full, etc.). The protocol aims to provide the
    end-user with unified notification of events occurring on different messaging
    systems. A mailing list has been established to discuss this draft and promote
    the issue of Notification to RFC. To subscribe, send email with 'subscribe snap'
    to majordomo@lists.neystadt.org or using web at http://www.neystadt.org/cgi-bin/majordomo.</p>"
