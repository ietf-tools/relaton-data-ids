abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS zone administrators occasionally need to update data published
    by a parent zone, such as NS and DS records. Traditionally these updates have
    happened out-of-band: through DNS registrar interfaces, EPP, websites, or manually
    by operators. Some updates could also be done using DNS Dynamic Update [RFC2136].
    The IETF's DNSOP working group is considering proposing additional mechanisms
    for such updates, possibly leveraging DNSSEC for authentication. This document
    presents some use cases to drive this design work.</p>"
