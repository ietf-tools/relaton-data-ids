abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an extension to the OAuth 2 protocol as
    defined in [RFC6749] which enables a Client Instance to include a key-bound attestation
    in interactions with an Authorization Server or a Resource Server. This new method
    enables Client Instances involved in a client deployment that is traditionally
    viewed as a public client, to be able to utilize this key-bound attestation to
    authenticate.</p>"
