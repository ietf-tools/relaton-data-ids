abstract:
- content: "<p>This document replaces RFC 1591, with all the guidelines and procedures
    updated and modified in the light of experience. This document describes the types
    of the top level domains (TLD), and introduces new TLD classes. It also introduces
    new TLD names to expand and take some pressure off the international commercial
    namespace (.COM). This document suggests some ideas for the management of the
    establishment of new top level domains, some procedures for domain name registries,
    and some constraints on top level domain names. The guidelines and these policies
    are subject to revision at the direction of the IANA. The newdom, iahc-discuss
    and shared-tld mailing lists will be discussing these issues and may provide advice
    to the IANA about possible revisions. This document can be considered the base
    set of operational guidelines in use by all top level domain administrators and
    domain name registries. Additional guidelines may be imposed within a specific
    TLD's charter, or by a particular registry as appropriate. This document does
    not attempt to provide a direct solution for preventing or resolving the domain
    name or trademark conflicts we have recently witnessed, but it does create a foundation
    where</p>"
