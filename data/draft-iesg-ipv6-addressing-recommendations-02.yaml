abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides recommendations to the addressing registries
    (APNIC, ARIN and RIPE-NCC) on policies for assigning IPv6 address blocks to end
    sites. In particular, it recommends the assignment of /48 in the general case,
    /64 when it is known that one and only one subnet is needed and /128 when it is
    absolutely known that one and only one device is connecting.</p>"
