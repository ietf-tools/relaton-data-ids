abstract:
- content: "<p>The long latency associated with Mobile IPv6's home-address and care-of-address
    tests can significantly impact delay-sensitive applications. We propose a modified
    binding-update procedure that evades the latency of both address tests. The modified
    binding update runs in half, or less, of the time that a standard binding update
    takes. Moreover, the modified binding update is nearly equivalent to the standard
    procedure with respect to security, and it increases the resources required at
    the correspondent node only marginally. The modification is realized as an optional,
    and fully backward-compatible, extension to Mobile IPv6.</p>"
