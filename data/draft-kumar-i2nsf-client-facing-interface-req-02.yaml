abstract:
- content: "<p>This document captures the requirements for the client-facing interface
    to the security controller. The interfaces are based on user constructs understood
    by a security admin instead of a vendor or a device specific mechanism requiring
    deep knowledge of individual products and features. This document identifies the
    requirements needed to enforce the user-construct oriented policies onto network
    security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions are realized. The
    function may be physical or virtual in nature and may be implemented in networking
    or dedicated appliances.</p>"
