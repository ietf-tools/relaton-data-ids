abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of the shortage of remaining IPv4 addresses you have to expect
    that in a near time there will be IPv6-only services in the internet (such as
    web servers). Because many internet service providers do not support IPv6, yet,
    there is the need of a reliable translation mechanism so customers only having
    access to IPv4 only can access IPv6 services. This document describes a translation
    mechanism which is similar to the Teredo protocol [RFC4380]. However this protocol
    is based on anycast addressing and should also work with symmetric NATs.</p>"
