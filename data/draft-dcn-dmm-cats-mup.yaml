abstract:
- content: "<p>The document [I-D.draft-mhkk-dmm-srv6mup-architecture] describes the
    Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture for Distributed Mobility Management. The
    proposed architecture converts the user mobility session information from the
    control plane entity to an optimal IPv6 dataplane routing information. However,
    when anycast address is used for service in data network (DN), this solution can
    be enhanced to dynamically set up the dataplane to the optimal service instance.
    This document discusses a solution to integrate computing-aware traffic steering
    capabilities to the mentioned MUP architecture. The target applied use-case is
    the anycast IP services scenario, where different instances that share the same
    anycast address of the service can serve the user request. For each session request,
    based on the up-to-date collected computing and network information, the MUP controller
    can convert the session information to the dataplane routing information to the
    optimal service instance.</p>"
