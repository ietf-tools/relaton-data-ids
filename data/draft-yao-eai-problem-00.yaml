    email systems based on the key RFCs which have been published. This document points
    out some problems, which blocks the receiver to receive the internationalized
    email address and may impede the deployment and use of the internationalized email
    address. Knowing the problems will help the smooth deployment of Email Address
    Internationalization system.</p>"
