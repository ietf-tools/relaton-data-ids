abstract:
- content: "<p>Collective communication is the basic logical communication model for
    distributed applications. When distributed systems scales, the communication overhead
    becomes the bottleneck of the entire system, impeding system performance to increase.
    This draft describes the performance challenges when the collective communication
    is employed in a network with more nodes or processes participating in or a larger
    number of such communication rounds required to complete a single job. And the
    document presents several use cases where different aspects of collective communication
    optimization are needed.</p>"
