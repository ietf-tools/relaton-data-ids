abstract:
- content: "<p>IGMP is the protocol used by IPv4 systems to report their IP multicast
    group memberships to neighboring multicast routers. Version 3 of IGMP adds support
    for source filtering, that is, the ability for a system to report interest in
    receiving packets only from specific source addresses, or from all but specific
    source addresses, sent to a particular multicast address. That information may
    be used by multicast routing protocols to avoid delivering multicast packets from
    specific sources to networks where there are no interested receivers. This document
    specifies Version 3 of the Internet Group Management Protocol, IGMPv3. It is a
    revised version of the specification to include clarifications and fixes for errata
    in RFC 3376 and is backwards compatible with RFC 3376. This document updates RFC
    2236 and obsoletes RFC 3376.</p>"
