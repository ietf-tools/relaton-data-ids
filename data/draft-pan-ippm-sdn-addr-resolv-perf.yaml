abstract:
- content: "<p>To send data packets from one host to another in traditional local
    area networks, one needs to know the MAC of destination host. This is called the
    address resolution and is handled by the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) protocol.
    However the ARP Request and ARP Response mechanism in Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) (RFC7149) is different from that in traditional local area networks. In
    SDN, when there are no flow registrations in switches to forward ARP packets,
    ARP packets have to be sent to the controller first. As resolving the ARP packets
    may be time consuming depending on the load on the controller and may potentially
    have different implications on address resolution in SDN, characterization of
    this delay performance can thus help users to know the approximate delay before
    the actual data forwarding process. In this document, we define performance parameters
    to characterize the delay metrics of address resolution in SDN.</p>"
