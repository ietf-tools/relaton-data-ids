abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of congestion
    on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM algorithms and transports as
    an earlier signal of congestion than CE. It is a simple, transparent, and backward
    compatible upgrade to existing IETF-approved AQMs, RFC3168, and nearly all congestion
    control algorithms.</p>"
