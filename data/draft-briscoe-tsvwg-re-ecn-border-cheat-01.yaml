abstract:
- content: "<p>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.
    A recently proposed approach combines Diffserv and pre-congestion notification
    (PCN) to provide a service slightly better than Intserv controlled load. It scales
    to networks of any size, but only if domains trust each other to comply with admission
    control and rate policing. This memo claims to solve this trust problem without
    losing scalability. It describes bulk border policing that provides a sufficient
    emulation of per-flow policing with the help of another recently proposed extension
    to ECN, involving re-echoing ECN feedback (re-ECN). With only passive bulk measurements
    at borders, sanctions can be applied against cheating networks.</p>"
