abstract:
- content: "<p>Explicit Multicast (Xcast) is a newly proposed multicast scheme to
    support a very large number of small multicast groups. Current Xcast specification
    mentions its data plane only, and does not specify a control plane. Therefore,
    this document describes an enhanced scheme for the support of receiver initiated
    join in explicit multicast, named Xcast extension (Xcast+), which complements
    the existing Xcast.</p>"
