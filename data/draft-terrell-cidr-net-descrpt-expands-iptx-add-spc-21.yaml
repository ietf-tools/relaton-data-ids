abstract:
- content: '<p>This document, which Obsoletes RFC 2373, RFC 1517, RFC 1518, RFC 1519,
    and IEEE Specification 1541-2002 (Re-defining the Electromagnetic Spectrum and
    the ''SI Units'' as a Base 2 Exponential Binary Conversion - defines the IPtX
    Bit-Map Specification and Technique for Bit-Mapping any ''Decimal Fraction'' -
    Page [93], [94], [106] - [''DCE Unit'' = '' 2E''Q '']), provides the final clarification
    of the conclusions that redefines the ''CIDR'' notation as the ''Network Descriptor'',
    and proves that the IP Address Pool Total for the IPtX Specification is greater
    than IPv6. And more importantly, because these conclusions reveal the actual design
    of the Binary Communication System, the Revolutionary impact sustained, is an
    upheaval affecting the entire field of Computer Science; ''The Rudiments of Finite
    Quantum Computing and Finite Quantum Computer Programming''. In other words, IPtX
    is a more powerful and cost effective IP Addressing Specification, and when using
    the ''IPtX-MX Protocol'' {''2"X : 1''; the Compression Ratio for "The Intelligent
    Quantum Tunneling Worm Protocol" - The Design of the ''Internet Protocol telecommunications
    Xchange Specification''}, the interface of the "Front-End" can mimic or simulate
    a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address. And this, in conjunction with the IPv4 IP Addressing
    Overlay, provides a 100% Backward Compatibility with the IPv4 Specification (Meeting
    the Requirements of RFC 1550), in the Backbone environment approaching an unlimited
    size ''Bit-Map'' Address Space.</p>'
