abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISAKMP, IKE and IPSec DOI RFCs [RFC2408, RFC2409, RFC2407] specify
    how an IPSec tunnel is negotiated with an encrypting security gateway (peer),
    however, they do not specify how the initiator knows who the encrypting peer is.
    This document specifies a method where the initiator can find the appropriate
    peer, and also negotiate a mutually acceptable set of proxies.</p>"
