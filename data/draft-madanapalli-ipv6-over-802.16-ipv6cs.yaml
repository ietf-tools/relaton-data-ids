abstract:
- content: "<p>IEEE 802.16d and 802.16e are air interface specifications for fixed
    and mobile broadband wireless access systems. 802.16d/e is the air interface that
    is used in the WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability of Microwave Access) architecture
    and specified by the WiMAX forum. This document defines the operation of IPv6
    over the IPv6 convergence sublayer of 802.16d/e within the scope of the WiMAX
    network architecture. It specifies various aspects of IPv6 such as neighbor discovery,
    address configuration, Path MTU and the transmission/ receiving of IPv6 packets.</p>"
