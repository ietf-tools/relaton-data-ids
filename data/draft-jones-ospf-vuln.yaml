abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very early stages
    of computer networks when 'cyberspace' was still perceived as a benign environment.
    As a consequence, malicious attacks were not considered to be a major risk when
    these protocols were designed, leaving today's Internet vulnerable. This paper
    provides an analysis of OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to modify
    the normal routing process across a single domain together with an assessment
    of when internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to better secure a
    domain.</p>"
