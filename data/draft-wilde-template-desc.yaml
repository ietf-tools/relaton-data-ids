abstract:
- content: <p>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by and/or can
    be described by URI Templates. RFC 6570 says that "a URI Template is a compact
    sequence of characters for describing a range of Uniform Resource Identifiers
    through variable expansion." This specification defines Template Descriptions,
    a schema and a media type that can be used to document and describe a URI Template
    by supporting descriptive markup that allows variables to be associated with documentation
    (human-oriented) and/or descriptions (machine- oriented). Template Descriptions
    can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make URI
    Templates self- describing, without having to create their own representation.</p>
