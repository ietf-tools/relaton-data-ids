abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has provided some tools for remote participation in its activities
    for many years, and some IETF participants have also used their own tools when
    they felt the need arise. The IETF now wishes to support enhanced remote participation
    that is as seamless as possible, approaching the quality of direct physical attendance
    for the various roles, including chair, presenter and simple attendee. Before
    deploying the new tools and services needed for this enhanced remote participation,
    the requirements for such tools and services must be defined. This document is
    meant to be that definition.</p>"
