abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP communities [RFC 1997] are 64-bit values that are used to tag the
    originated or traversing prefixes for the different purposes, such as origination
    tagging or policy application purposes. These values can be displayed in a new
    and old format, which notes different representation of the same 64-bit value.
    This document defines the way of tagging prefixes based upon their geographical
    origination to assist in development of geographically-based policies that, ideally,
    will result in RTD (Round Trip Delay) value improvements, as optimized paths can
    be established.</p>"
