abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the message and procedure related to the Multicast
    Announce and Control Protocol (MACP). This protocol is considered as one 'building
    blocks' of a reliable multicast transport framework. The Multicast Announce and
    Control Protocol (MACP) organizes the process by which a multicast sender node
    (Msender) manages transmissions to dynamic groups of receivers (Mreceivers) in
    the 'one-to-many' model. The prime objective of MACP is to work in conjunction
    with various data transport protocols in order to meet various network requirements.
    One other main objective is to provide a unified announce transport mechanism
    for both bulk data transfer and streamed data.</p>"
