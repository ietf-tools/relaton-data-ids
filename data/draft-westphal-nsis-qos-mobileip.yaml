abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft provides a framework for QoS signaling that is optimized
    for Mobile IP handoffs. It covers the horizontal signaling between access routers
    (ARs) as well as the vertical signaling along the packet data path, both of which
    are triggered by handoff of mobile node (MN). The key design goals are wireless
    bandwidth economy, fast QoS establishment along the new data path after handoff
    and secure protocol operation.</p>"
