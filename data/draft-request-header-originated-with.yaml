abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new Request Header that must be initiated
    every time a user-agent sends XMLHttpRequest. The aim of this header is to limit
    the possibilities of XSS to RCE and preventing Javascript from stealing CSRF tokens
    on other URLs of same domain. This will allow developers to block request if it
    wasn't supposed to be sent via XMLHttpRequest.</p>"
