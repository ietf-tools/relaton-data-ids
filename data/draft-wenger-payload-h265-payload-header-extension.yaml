abstract:
- content: '<p>Proposed are the allocation of a NAL unit type from the "unspecified"
    set of NAL units of H.265 [HEVC] for the purpose of payload header extensions,
    a generic syntax for the use of that pseudo NAL unit, and one application for
    it: the signaling of temporal scalability support information. Two alternative
    designs are included. The content of this draft is intended for incorporation
    into the H.265 RTP payload [h265-payload].</p>'
