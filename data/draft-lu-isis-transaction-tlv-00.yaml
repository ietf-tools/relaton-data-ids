abstract:
- content: "<p>ISIS local updates may require multiple LSPs to convey. Receiving routers,
    whose decision processes are without such knowledge, may generate incorrect routing
    table updates based on the partial set of LSPs it receives and hence the traffic
    outage before they are corrected by another run of the decision process. This
    memo describes a method that makes the decision process more informed so that
    the interim results can be minimized or avoided.</p>"
