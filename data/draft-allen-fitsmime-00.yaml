abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the registration of the Multipurpose Internet
    Mail Extensions (MIME) sub-types to be used by the international astronomical
    community for the interchange of Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files.
    The encoding is defined by the published FITS standard documents. The FITS format
    has been in use since 1979, and almost all data from astronomical observations
    are interchanged by using FITS. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
