abstract:
- content: "<p>The document proposes a solution called Resilient Cycle Queuing and
    Forwarding (RCQF) for DetNet extremely low data loss rates, bounded latency and
    minimal jitter. RCQF is a technological advancement built upon Cycle Queuing and
    Forwarding (CQF), designed to provide a capability for the delivery of end-to-end
    DetNet flows. RCQF extends the capabilities of CQF and makes it suitable for large
    scaling networks. The elasticity of RCQF includes adaptive bonded latency, minimal
    jitter, high bandwidth, large packet size, interface speed, and only requires
    frequency synchronization. This document aims to introduce the concept of RCQF
    and its potential in providing resilient and adaptable solutions for Deterministic
    Networks.</p>"
