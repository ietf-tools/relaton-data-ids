abstract:
- content: "<p>Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (DIME) is a lightweight, binary
    message format that can be used to encapsulate one or more application-defined
    payloads of arbitrary type and size into a single message construct. Each payload
    is described by a type, a length, and an optional identifier. Both URIs and MIME
    media type constructs are supported as type identifiers. The payload length is
    an integer indicating the number of octets of the payload. The optional payload
    identifier is a URI enabling cross-referencing between payloads. DIME payloads
    may include nested DIME messages or chains of linked chunks of unknown length
    at the time the data is generated. DIME is strictly a message format: it provides
    no concept of a connection or of a logical circuit, nor does it address head-of-line
    problems.</p>"
