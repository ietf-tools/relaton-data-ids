abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a schema for the Remote Access Dialin User Service
    (RADIUS). This schema makes it possible to integrate a RADIUS server with an LDAP-based
    directory service, making it possible for an organization to maintain a single
    store of user information. This consolidation is desirable since it results in
    a reduction in the administrative workload, and eliminates the need to synchronize
    across multiple user information stores.</p>"
