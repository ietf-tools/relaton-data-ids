abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism to notify a BMP collector of the
    need to purge the state associated with a RIB view of a specific peer. This is
    useful, for example, when the BMP sender decides to stop exporting a specific
    RIB view after providing an initial export. The BMP collector can use the per-peer
    Purge message to take appropriate action to remove the stale state and avoid holding
    on to irrelevant network data.</p>"
