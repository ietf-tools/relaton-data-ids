- content: "<p>This document focuses on requirements for control-plane based recovery
    from data-plane failures in optical transport networks that use an IP-based (GMPLS)
    control plane. It aims to gather and systematically lay out the requirements so
    that they can serve as a coherent basis for work on solution and protocol enhancements
    and developments.</p>"
