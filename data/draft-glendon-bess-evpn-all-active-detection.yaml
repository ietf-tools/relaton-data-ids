abstract:
- content: "<p>A principal feature of EVPN is the ability to support universal detection
    including ping/trace, twamp, 2544, 1564 and so on. This draft specifies a mechanism
    of valid universal detection in all- active anycast scenes based on connectivity
    negotiations to avoid detection interruption due to the inconsistency between
    the request packet path and the response packet path.</p>"
