abstract:
- content: "<p>DNSSEC as defined in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035 is based on authenticated
    messages. That design has allowed DNSSEC to be deployed at the upper levels of
    the DNS tree, but operational issues with message-based authentication has caused
    lower levels fo the DNS tree to mostly forego DNSSEC. This document extends DNSSEC
    with a second type of authentication, based on session authentication from TLS,
    that is easier to deploy by some (but certainly not all) authoritative DNS servers.
    The goal is to have many more zones be DNSSEC-enabled. Note that this document
    does _not_ replace current DNSSEC. A validating resolver needs to implement all
    of traditional DNSSEC, and might also implement the protocol defined here. A server
    might protect the contents of DNS zones for which it is authoritative with traditional
    DNSSEC, with the protocol defined here, or both. The protocol defined here is
    only useful for some authoritative servers, and is explicitly not useful for others.
    *** Notice for -00 *** This -00 draft is meant to engender discussion, particularly
    to find out if there is a good use case for this proposal. This draft is definitely
    not considered ready for consideration in an IETF WG.</p>"
