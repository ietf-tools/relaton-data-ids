abstract:
- content: "<p>With the development of new multimedia applications, such as voice,
    audio, picture, and video communication, the demands on the resource reservation
    service are increasing, especially as Internet traffic volume grows explosively
    due to these applications. Therefore, tariff systems for Internet service have
    tended to adopt measured rate billing, and the resource reservation setup protocol
    [1, 2] is increasingly important as a method for implementing measured rate billing.
    The resource reservation setup protocol must support billing if it is to be applied
    to the commercial Internet, especially measured rate billing between interconnected
    Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is needed. The purpose of this document is to
    clarify the architecture that should be used for the resource reservation service
    for the commercial Internet. First, this document explains the basis of the tariff
    for current telecommunication and Internet services. Then it clarifies problems
    in the billing for Internet service, and describes how billing can be improved
    by using the resource reservation setup protocol. Finally, it also studies technical
    and application models for a commercial resource reservation service model, and
    clarifies an architecture for the resource reservation setup protocol. Incidentally,
    it is essential to examine billing based on business administration issues, not
    technical ones. For example, on a telephone service, it technically makes sense
    to charge the caller when the user being called is on another line. This is because,
    telephone switches were in operation when they notified the caller that the number
    he called was busy. However, such a billing policy is contrary to the customs
    of business. Readers should note that the billing problems and solutions discussed
    in this document are not only based on the technical viewpoint.</p>"
