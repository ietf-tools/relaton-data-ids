abstract:
- content: "<p>[PWE3 Control] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing point-to-point
    pseudowires between two provider edge (PE) nodes. The Generalized ID FEC element
    contained in PWE3 signaling protocols include TLV fields that identify pseudowire
    endpoints called attachment individual identifiers (AII). This document defines
    an AII structure in the form of new AII type-length-value fields that supports
    AII aggregation for improved scalability. It is envisioned that this would be
    useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where pseudowires
    are established between selected local and remote PE nodes based on customer need.</p>"
