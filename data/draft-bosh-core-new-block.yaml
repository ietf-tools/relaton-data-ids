abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies new Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    Block-Wise transfer options: Block3 and Block4 Options. These options are similar
    to the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options, but enable faster transmission rates for
    large amounts of data with less packet interchanges as well as supporting faster
    recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</p>"
