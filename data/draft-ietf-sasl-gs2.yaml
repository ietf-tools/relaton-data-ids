abstract:
- content: '<p>This document describes how to use a Generic Security Service Application
    Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism in the Simple Authentication and Security
    Layer (SASL) framework. This is done by defining a new SASL mechanism family,
    called GS2. This mechanism family offers a number of improvements over the previous
    "SASL/ GSSAPI" mechanism: it is more general, uses fewer messages for the authentication
    phase in some cases, and supports negotiable use of channel binding. Only GSS-API
    mechanisms that support channel binding and mutual authentication are supported.
