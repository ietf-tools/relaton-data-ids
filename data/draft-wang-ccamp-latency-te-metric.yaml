abstract:
- content: <p>Latency is such requirement that must be achieved according to the Service
    Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers. Network Performance
    Objective (NPO) defined in ITU-T Y.1540 and Y.1541 is used for describing the
    meaning and numerical values performance parameters traversing multiple packet
    networks. The definitions of the packet network performance parameters are often
    also used as the basis of SLAs service providers, but possibly with different
    numerical values. A SLA is a part of a service contract where the level of service
    is formally defined between service providers and customers. For example, the
    service level includes platinum, golden, silver and bronze. Different service
    level may associate with different protection/restoration requirement. Latency
    can also be associated with different service level. The user may select a private
    line provider based on the ability to meet a latency SLA. The key driver for latency
    is stock/commodity trading applications that use data base mirroring. A few milli
    seconds can impact a transaction. Financial or trading companies are very focused
    on end- to-end private pipe line latency optimizations that improve things 2-3
    ms. Latency and latency SLA is one of the key parameters that these "high value"
    customers use to select a private pipe line provider. Other key applications like
    video gaming, conferencing and storage area networks require stringent latency
    and bandwidth. This document describes the requirements and mechanisms to communicate
    latency as a traffic engineering performance metric in today's network which is
    consisting of potentially multiple layers of packet transport network and optical
    transport network in order to meet the latency SLA between service provider and
    his customers. This document also extends RSVP-TE and IGP to support these requirement.
    These extensions are intended to advertise and convey the latency information
    of nodes and links as traffic engineering performance metric.</p>
