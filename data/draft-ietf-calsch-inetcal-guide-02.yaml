abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the various Internet calendaring and scheduling
    standards and works in progress, and the relationships between them. Its intent
    is to provide a context for these documents, assist in their understanding, and
    potentially aid in the design of standards-based calendaring and scheduling systems.
    The standards addressed are RFC 2445 (iCalendar), RFC 2446 (iTIP), and RFC 2447
    (iMIP). The work in progress addressed is "Calendar Access Protocol" (CAP). This
    document also describes issues and problems that are not solved by these protocols,
    and that could be targets for future work. This memo provides information for
    the Internet community.</p>
