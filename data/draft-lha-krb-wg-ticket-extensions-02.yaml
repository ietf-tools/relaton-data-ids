abstract:
- content: "<p>The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions. This make it
    harder to deploy features like referrals and PKCROSS. Since the Kerberos protocol
    did not specified extensibility for the Ticket structure and the current implementations
    are aware of the contents of tickets, the extension protocol cannot simply extend
    the Ticket ASN.1 structure. Instead, the extension data needs to be hidden inside
    the ticket. This protocol defines two methods to add extend the tickets. The first
    method requires updated clients and is more in line with the future development
    of Kerberos. The second way does not require update client. To take advantage
    of this protocol the server (KDC or application server) need to update a well.
    The two methods are equivalent and there is a 1-1 mapping between them.</p>"
