abstract:
- content: "<p>More and more ISPs are multihomed and need to engineer their interdomain
    traffic. Unfortunately, both multihoming and traffic engineering contribute to
    the growth of the BGP routing tables. For IPv6, a better solution for multihoming
    and traffic engineering is required. This document proposes a host-centric IPv6
    multihoming solution that relies on the utilization of a 'Name, Address and ROute
    System' (NAROS) server. A key advantage of using this server is that it allows
    a multihomed site to engineer its interdomain traffic without transmitting any
    BGP message.</p>"
