abstract:
- content: "<p>The HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2068) is silent about various details
    of TCP connection management when using persistent connections. This document
    discusses some of the implementation issues discussed during HTTP/1.1's design,
    and introduces a few new requirements on HTTP/1.1 implementations learned from
    implementation experience, not fully understood when RFC 2068 was issued. This
    is an initial draft for working group comment, and we expect further drafts.</p>"
