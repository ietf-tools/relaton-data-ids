abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a framework document for modeling network elements
    (NE), facilities, lines, protocols and services for substantially easing development
    and operation of element manager systems (EMS), network management systems (NMS)
    and operations support systems (OSS). The framework is independent of the access
    method used, including SNMP, CLI, Netconf, Corba, CMIP, XML-RPC, etc.) It covers
    configuration, alarms, current-historical performance, accounting management and
    security. The frameworks builds on and reuses the existing base of MIBs. The documents
    presents a light-weight, structured and very simplified framework and method to
    data modeling for defining and maintaining meta models, device etc. models, and
    device etc. descriptors.</p>"
