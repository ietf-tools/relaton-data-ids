abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to provide interoperable implementations of certain Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) based features, such as automated call handling, it
    is necessary for devices to configure network servers with feature data. An example
    is a call forwarding number for a call forwarding service. This document introduces
    the concept of Representational State Transfer (REST) and gives an example of
    how REST can be used for such configuration.</p>"
