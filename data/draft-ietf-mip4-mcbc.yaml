abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is used to
    negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in the case of
    Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode registration. With this extension
    the mobile node is able to negotiate the type of traffic that needs to be encapsulated
    for delivery to the foreign agent while other types of traffic use the direct
    delivery style. This mechanism eliminates the tunnel overhead between the mobile
    node and the foreign agent. Multicast and broadcast applications on a mobile IPv4
    mobile node are better served with this extension.</p>"
