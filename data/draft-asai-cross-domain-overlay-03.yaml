abstract:
- content: "<p>Application-layer or overlay routing has been applied to various distributed
    systems such as content delivery networks and live media streaming systems. The
    problems with these systems for the layer 3 network providers, such as Internet
    service providers, are that these systems utilize higher-cost network resources
    (e.g., transit links) from the viewpoint of the layer 3 network providers but
    the operators have difficulties in controlling and optimizing the traffic of these
    systems because these systems construct their own networks over the layer 3 network.
    The ALTO Working Group has worked on application- layer traffic optimization to
    fill the gaps in routing policies between the layer 3 network and applications
    by providing the underlay network topology and cost information to these systems.
    However, there are considerations on applying application-layer traffic optimization
    techniques to cross-domain traffic because the cost is assumed to be configured
    by each AS although ASes are autonomously operated. This document summarizes general
    problems with overlay networks and considerations on the AS-level application-
    layer traffic optimization from the viewpoint of inter-AS economics. The main
    concerns on the AS-level application-layer traffic optimization are unfair policy
    configuration between distinct administrative domains and asymmetric economic
    policies on transit links. The underlying problem inducing these concerns is that
    the economic policies between interconnected ASes are non-disclosure due to commercial
    contracts. This document also discusses the conceivable approaches to solve the
    problems and considerations.</p>"
