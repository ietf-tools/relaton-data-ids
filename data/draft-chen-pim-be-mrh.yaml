abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes stateless best effort Multicast along the shortest
    paths to the egress nodes of a P2MP Path/Tree. The multicast data packet is encapsulated
    in an IPv6 Multicast Routing Header (MRH). The MRH contains the egress nodes represented
    by the indexes of the nodes and flexible bit strings for the nodes. The packet
    is delivered to each of the egress nodes along the shortest path. There is no
    state stored in the core of the network.</p>"
