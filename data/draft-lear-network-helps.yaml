abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the Edward Snowden's release of secret information, some in the
    IETF have taken an approach that the network is such a useful tool that it is
    also an enemy. With several high visibility attacks that have been based on low
    end systems (Things), it is now clear that not only is the network not the enemy,
    but that it is required to protect the system as a whole. When the network has
    at least some information about a device, we get a second chance to limit attacks
    against the device and, in some cases, a third chance to limit attacks from the
    device. This memo discusses ways in which network protection assists in protection
    of devices, and some caveats around that protection, and suggests considerations
    implementers and protocol developers should consider as connectivity continues
    to expand to new applications.</p>"
