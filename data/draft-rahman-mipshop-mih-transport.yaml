abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for using UDP/IP for the transport
    of Media Independent Handover (MIH) messages between network nodes. MIH messages
    carry technology specific link layer information and commands that can be used
    to optimize handover procedures across different access technologies such as cellular
    and WLAN. MIH will complement Layer 3 mobility protocols such as Mobile IP.</p>"
