abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Open Shortest Path First - Traffic Engineering
    (OSPF-TE) routing protocol extensions to support GMPLS control of Optical Transport
    Networks (OTNs) specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.709 published in 2016. The
    2016 version of G.709 [ITU-T_G709_2016] introduces support for higher rate OTU
    signals, termed OTUCn (which have a nominal rate of 100n Gbps). The newly introduced
    OTUCn represent a very powerful extension to the OTN capabilities, and one which
    naturally scales to transport any newer clients with bit rates in excess of 100G,
    as they are introduced. This document extends the mechanisms defined in [RFC7138].</p>"
