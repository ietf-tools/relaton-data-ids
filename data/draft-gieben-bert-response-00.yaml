abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft contains a number of loose ends and does not include any
    text on any (known) corner cases. Its primary goal is to document the choices
    the DNSEXT working group has on the subject of fixing the NSEC enumeration in
    DNSSEC. If at any point in time the working group feels this idea needs further
    work, this draft will be updated. DNSSECbis [RFC LIST] allow for zone enumeration
    by walking NSEC chains. It also has a large impact on the zone size at the initial
    deployment stage. This draft proposes a method to address these issues by the
    use of online signing of negative and wildcard responses.</p>"
