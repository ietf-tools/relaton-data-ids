abstract:
- content: "<p>An accepted SIP REFER method creates an implicit subscription using
    the SIP-Specific Event Notification Framework. That framework was revised by RFC6665.
    This document highlights the implications of the requirement changes in RFC6665,
    and updates the definition of the REFER method, RFC3515, to clarify and disambiguate
    the impact of those changes.</p>"
