abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the procedures for resolving Fully Qualified
    Domain Names (FQDNs) in IPv6 and IPv4 networks when both the Media Access Control
    (MAC) and the Domain Name System (DNS) cache are empty. The procedures aim to
    reduce the latency and improve the efficiency of FQDN resolution in such scenarios.
    The procedures described in this document are relevant for both IPv6 and IPv4
    networks, and they can be implemented in hosts and routers.</p>"
