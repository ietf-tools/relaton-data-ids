abstract:
- content: "<p>This is an informational document submitted in response to a request
    from the IETF Traffic Engineering Working Group (TEWG) for service provider uses,
    requirements, and desires for traffic engineering best current practices. As such,
    the work sets a direction for routing and traffic performance management in networks
    based on traffic engineering (TE) and QoS best current practices and operational
    experience, such as used in the AT&amp;T dynamic routing/class-of-service network.</p>"
