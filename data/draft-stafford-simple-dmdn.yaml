abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo expands the set of use cases for SIP MESSAGE and SIP- controlled
    MSRP sessions. Following OMA, the new use cases include MSRP for one time messages
    that exceed the size limit for SIP requests over UDP, and extend the paradigm
    to deferred messaging. In deferred messaging, which is invoked when the intended
    recipient is not available, the message is sent to a store and forward server.
    The new requirements are for disposition notification functionality in this context.</p>"
