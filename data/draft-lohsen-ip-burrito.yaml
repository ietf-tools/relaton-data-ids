abstract:
- content: "<p>IP over Burrito Carriers describes an experimental method for the creation
    of edible data packets. This standard is intended to be implemented in metropolitan
    area networks due to the preexisting burrito delivery infrastructure. While currently
    only flour tortillas have been found acceptable for encapsulating the data contained
    in the packet, tests are underway to determine the viability of using corn tortillas.
    One must be wary of disreputable IP over Burrito service providers as packet corruption
    and bad data handling can result in damage to the receiving unit and may result
    in an extremely messy packet rejection. Conveniently, there is a rating system
    already in place. While the rating by the health department doesn't ensure proper
    data encapsulation, it does allow the end user to determine if the service provider's
    quality to cost ratio is adequate. This is an experimental standard, not a recommended
    standard.</p>"
