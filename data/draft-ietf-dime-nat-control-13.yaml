abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for
    the Diameter Network address and port translation Control Application. This Diameter
    application allows per endpoint control of Network Address Translators and Network
    Address and Port Translators, which are added to networks to cope with IPv4-address
    space depletion. This Diameter application allows external devices to configure
    and manage a Network Address Translator device - expanding the existing Diameter-based
    AAA and policy control capabilities with a Network Address Translators and Network
    Address and Port Translators control component. These external devices can be
    network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server, or can be
    more centralized control plane devices such as AAA- servers. This Diameter application
    establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or
    server, and a Network Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator
    device. This includes, for example, the control of the total number of Network
    Address Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific Network Address
    Translator binding for a particular endpoint. In addition, it allows Network Address
    Translator devices to provide information relevant to accounting purposes.</p>"
