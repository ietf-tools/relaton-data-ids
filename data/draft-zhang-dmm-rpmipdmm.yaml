abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based centralized mobility
    management protocol, which has many disadvantages for utilizing the centralized
    anchor LMA. As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach
    is needed to PMIPv6. This document defines a robust solution for PMIPv6-based
    distributed mobility management which ensures the robustness by organizing the
    distributed anchors (MAARs) into a Chord ring.</p>"
