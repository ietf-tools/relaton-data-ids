abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need for a WHois email address service
    similar to the internet domainname WHois service. Theres a need for a registered
    email address as opposed to non-registered email address to fight internet SPAM,
    as well as encouraging email use for personal, commercial and all kinds of purposes.An
    internet user can have multiple email identities. This service implementation
    would also help deliver a Single SignON solution for WWW services.</p>"
