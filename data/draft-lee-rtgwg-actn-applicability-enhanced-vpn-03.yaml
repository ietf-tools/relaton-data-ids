abstract:
- content: "<p>The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) defines
    an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of network and service abstraction
    to detach network and service control from the underlying data plane. This document
    outlines the overview of ACTN capability and the applicability of ACTN to Enhanced
    VPN. In particular, this document also discusses how ACTN features can fulfill
    some of the requirements of the enhanced VPN, which is also known as VPN+ [VPN+].</p>"
