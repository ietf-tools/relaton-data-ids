abstract:
- content: "<p>One desirable application of BFD is to detect a MPLS LSP data plane
    failure. LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping] is an existing mechanism for detecting MPLS data
    plane failures and for verifying the MPLS LSP data plane against the control plane.
    BFD can be used for the former, but not for the latter. However a combination
    of LSP-Ping and BFD can be used to provide faster data plane failure detection
    and/or make it possible to provide such detection on a greater number of LSPs.
    This document describes the applicability of BFD in relation to LSP-Ping for this
    application. It also describes procedures for using BFD in this environment.</p>"
