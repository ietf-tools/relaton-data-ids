abstract:
- content: "<p>Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) represents a paradigm
    shift in wireless networks, where sensing and communication functions are jointly
    designed and optimized. By leveraging the same spectral and hardware resources,
    ISAC enables advanced capabilities such as environment perception, object tracking,
    and situational awareness, while maintaining efficient and reliable data transmission.
    This integration holds great potential for applications in areas such as autonomous
    systems, smart cities, and industrial automation, where precise sensing and low-latency
    communication are critical. This document presents the ISAC as a typical CATS
    scenario to facilitate discussions on the potential challenges and requirements.</p>"
