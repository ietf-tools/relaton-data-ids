abstract:
- content: "<p>There are 3 major functions that must be performed to achieve multicast
    tagswitching. 1) Tag Allocation, which requires each multicast Tag Switching Router
    (TSR) to have a tag value range that it uses. 2) Tag Binding, using the tags allocated,
    a TSR must assign them to multicast routes. 3) Tag Binding Distribution, after
    binding tag values to routes, they must be distributed to other TSRs so they all
    forward on a common and consistent distribution tree. In this document we present
    how tags are allocated uniquely across multicast capable TSRs on a LAN and point-to-point
    IP subnets.</p>"
