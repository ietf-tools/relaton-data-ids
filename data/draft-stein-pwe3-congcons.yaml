abstract:
- content: "<p>Pseudowires (PWs) have become a common mechanism for tunneling traffic,
    and may be found competing for network resources both with other PWs and with
    non-PW traffic, such as TCP/IP flows. It is thus worthwhile specifying under what
    conditions such competition is safe, i.e., the PW traffic does not significantly
    harm other traffic or contribute more than it should to congestion. We conclude
    that PWs transporting responsive traffic behave as desired without the need for
    additional mechanisms. For inelastic PWs (such as TDM PWs) we derive a bound under
    which such PWs consume no more network capacity than a TCP flow.</p>"
