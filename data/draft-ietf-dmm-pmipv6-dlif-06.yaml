abstract:
- content: "<p>Distributed Mobility Management solutions allow networks to be set
    up in such a way that traffic is distributed optimally and centrally deployed
    anchors are not relied upon to provide IP mobility support. There are many different
    approaches to address Distributed Mobility Management -- for example, extending
    network-based mobility protocols (like Proxy Mobile IPv6) or client-based mobility
    protocols (like Mobile IPv6), among others. This document follows the former approach
    and proposes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, in which mobility sessions
    are anchored at the last IP hop router (called the mobility anchor and access
    router). The mobility anchor and access router is an enhanced access router that
    is also able to operate as a local mobility anchor or mobility access gateway
    on a per-prefix basis. The document focuses on the required extensions to effectively
    support the simultaneous anchoring several flows at different distributed gateways.</p>"
