abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an alternate mechanism to [6PE] to interconnect
    IPv6 routes over MPLS-enabled IPv4clouds. This approach relies on IPv6 Provider
    Edge routers (6PE-Alt) which are Dual Stack in order to connect to IPv6 islands
    and to the MPLS core which is only required to run IPv4 MPLS and run the mechanism
    as described in this document. The 6PE-Alt routers exchange the IPv6 reachability
    information transparently over the core using the Multi-Protocol Border Gateway
    Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4 or IPv6. In doing so, the BGP Next Hop field is used
    to convey the IPv4 address of the 6PE-Alt router so that dynamically established
    IPv4-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel
    configuration. Unlike [6PE] case the labels are not sent with each route and does
    not use BGP to transport labels [RFC3107]. It instead makes use of the IPv6 Explicit
    NULL label as the VPN label, which is defined [RFC3032] and updated in [RFC4182].
    This document elegantly uses the concept of non overlapping IPv6 routes to provide
    BGP MPLS IP VPN functionality. The document can be further used for provinding
    the functionality in case of non-overlapping IPv6 routes. This approach allows
    a functionality similar to [RFC4659], without the cumbursome extensions required
    for the same. With the [RFC3879] IPv6 addresses are now globally unique (except
    for Link local). It also reduces the number of multi AS scenarios.</p>"
