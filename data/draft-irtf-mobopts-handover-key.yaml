abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiple IPv6 handover optimization protocols (for example, Fast Mobile
    IPv6 and Context Transfer Protocol) require an Access Router to verify that signaling
    received to perform an IP handover operation originated from a Mobile Node having
    authorization to claim a particular address on the Access Router's wireless subnet.
    In this document, a method for securing such signaling is defined. The method
    utilizes a secret key sent from the Access Router to the Mobile Node prior to
    handover, encrypted with an RSA public key that the Mobile Node used to generate
    its Cryptographically Generated Address. The ability of the Mobile Node to decrypt
    the secret key verifies its possession of the private key corresponding to the
    public key used to generate the address. This allows the Mobile Node to use the
    secret key to sign and authorize signaling causing changes affecting traffic to
    and from that address. The use of symmetric cryptography avoids the time consuming
    public key operation associated with using the RSA key directly during performance-sensitive
    IP subnet handover.</p>"
