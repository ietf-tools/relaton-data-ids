abstract:
- content: "<p>Often with SIP a request can only be routed over an existing connection
    or flow, such as when there is a firewall or network address translation (NAT)
    device in the network path. TLS is also affected when the user agent (UA) does
    not have a certificate suitable for mutual TLS authentication. This draft addresses
    how user agents and proxies need to behave to work in these environments. This
    work shows how existing SIP mechanisms can be used to allow the UA to register
    multiple times over different connections or flows and the proxies can use the
    instance-id in the contact header to identify that the multiple flows go to the
    same UA. It can then choose which flow to use to route requests to this UA.</p>"
