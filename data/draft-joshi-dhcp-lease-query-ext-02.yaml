abstract:
- content: "<p>As per industry trends, Access Networks have been migrating from traditional
    ATM based networks to Ethernet networks. In Ethernet based access networks, Access
    Concentrators are typically configured to act as traditional bridge. These Access
    Concentrators also act as relay agents and relay DHCP messages between hosts and
    DHCP servers. It also maintains and updates lease/location information while relaying
    the DHCP messages. Access Concentrators may use the lease/ location information
    for anti-spoofing, data forwarding etc. This lease/location information is lost
    if an Access Concentrator gets rebooted. RFC 4388 [5] has defined a new message
    type DHCPLEASEQUERY to address similar limitation in Routed Access Networks. This
    document initially gives an overview of the functioning of the Access Concentrator
    acting as a relay agent in a Layer 2 aggregation network. The limitation[as mentioned
    above] in a typical switched/ bridged[layer 2] is then discussed followed by the
    proposal to extend the DHCPLEASEQUERY message to address this limitation.</p>"
