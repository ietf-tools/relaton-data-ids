abstract:
- content: "<p>The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol defines
    a standard communication and control mechanism through which a Control Element
    (CE) can control the behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE). That control is accomplished
    through manipulating attributes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs), whose structure
    is defined in a model RFC produced by the working group. In order to build an
    actual solution based on this protocol, defining a set of Logical Function Block
    definitions that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs is welcome.
    A base library definition of LFBs is already given in library [5]. VPN (Virtual
    Private Network) services, as a kind of important services widely employed in
    Internet, will certainly be implemented in routers using this protocol. This document
    provides an initial set of VPN LFB definitions in particular, a set of tunnel
    encapsulator and decapsulator LFBs. It is anticipated that additional VPN-related
    LFB definitions like L2VPN, L3VPN can be defined over time.</p>"
