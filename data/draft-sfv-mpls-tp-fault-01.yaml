abstract:
- content: <p>This draft specifies OAM messages to indicate service disruptive conditions
    for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The notification
    mechanism employs a generic method for a service disruptive condition to be communicated
    to a Maintenance End Point (MEP). An MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
    (OAM) channel is defined along with messages to communicate various types of service
    disruptive conditions. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to
