abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC2183] introduces a Content-Disposition header field for Internet
    Mail Messages to transmit presentation information as well as a suggested file
    name for saving the content to disk and the file's date information. All of this
    information is missing from HTTP entities [RFC2068]. However, there is nothing
    that would prevent the use of the Content- Disposition header with this HTTP.
    Without being standard, the Content-Disposition header has already been introduced
    by some software products. [HTTP1.1-REV] documents this practice, based on [RFC1806].
    This memo also extends the specification to cover [RFC2183] and corrects the common
    abuse of the Content-Type header to cover presentation information.</p>"
