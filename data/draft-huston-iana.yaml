abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the role and function of the IETF-IANA. Many IETF
    protocols make use of commonly defined values that are passed within protocol
    objects. To ensure consistent interpretation of these values between independent
    implementations, there is a need to ensure that the values and associated semantic
    intent are uniquely defined. The IETF uses a single registry to register these
    protocol values and their associated semantic intent. In this memo the registry
    function is referred to as the IETF Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IETF-IANA).
    This document provides a description of this function and proposes that this description
    be adopted by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).</p>"
