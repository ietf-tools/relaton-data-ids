abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a standard profile for the framework of Forwarding
    Commitment BGP (FC-BGP). Forwarding Commitment（FC）is a cryptographically signed
    code to certify an AS's routing intent on its directly connected hops. Based on
    FC, the goal of FC-BGP is to build a secure inter-domain system that can simultaneously
    authenticate AS_PATH attribute in BGP-UPDATE and validate network forwarding on
    the dataplane.</p>"
