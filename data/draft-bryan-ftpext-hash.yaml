abstract:
- content: "<p>The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify the
    integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared against each other
    without actually transferring them first. Cryptographic hashes are a possible
    solution to this problem. In the past, several attempts have been made to add
    commands to obtain checksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,
    leading to non-interoperability and confusion. To solve these issues, this document
    specifies a new FTP command to be used by clients to request cryptographic hashes
    of files.</p>"
