abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the PCRP (Ping, Challenge, Resolve, Product)
    Specification for Webhook events in a standardized way. It is specifically designed
    to address the challenges faced in current webhook event implementations, which
    lack consistency and a defined flow. PCRP introduces a new header X-PCRP-Type
    to indicate the step of the process, and its values include ping, challenge, resolve,
    and product.</p>"
