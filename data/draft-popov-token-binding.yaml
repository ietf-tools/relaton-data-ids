abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Version 1.0 of the Token Binding protocol.
    The Token Binding protocol allows client/server applications to create long-lived,
    uniquely identifiable TLS [RFC5246] bindings spanning multiple TLS sessions and
    connections. Applications are then enabled to cryptographically bind security
    tokens to the TLS layer, preventing token export and replay attacks. To protect
    privacy, the TLS Token Binding identifiers are only transmitted encrypted and
    can be reset by the user at any time.</p>"
