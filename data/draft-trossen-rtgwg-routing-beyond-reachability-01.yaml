abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses the evolution of the Internet routing system
    beyond mere reachability. We observe, through examples of past development, that
    such evolution has been taking place to improve on capabilities of the Internet,
    deal with more complicated network deployments and cater to changing requirements
    by end users as well as novel and emerging applications. For achieving a routing
    system that serves more than a singular reachability purpose, more information
    is taken into account when performing the purpose-specific functions. Such extra
    information can be obtained by extending current routing protocols to exchange
    more information or by carrying that information within packets. This document
    is intended to seed discussions of how the observed evolution of the Internet's
    routing system can continue, what issues may occur when simply continuing the
    current approach for achieving routing beyond 'mere' reachability and what may
    be needed to address those issues. Ultimately, however, this document recognizes
    the positive impact that moving beyond reachability has brought to the Internet
    and will continue to do so.</p>"
