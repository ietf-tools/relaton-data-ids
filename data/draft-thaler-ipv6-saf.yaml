abstract:
- content: "<p>There are various recent proposals that would result in IPv6 translation
    becoming permanent. RFC 3424 discusses UNilateral Self- Address Fixing (UNSAF)
    mechanisms which are required for applications to work with most translation schemes,
    points out a number of problems with them, and requires an exit strategy for any
    UNSAF mechanism. This document discusses an alternative to UNSAF mechanisms should
    IPv6 translation become permanent.</p>"
