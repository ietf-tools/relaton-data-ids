abstract:
- content: "<p>Many people have expressed a desire to extract material from IETF RFCs
    for use in documentation, textbooks, on-line help systems, and for similar uses.
    In addition, some IETF RFCs contain MIBs and other types of program code that
    could be compiled. This document proposes an update to RFC RFC3978 to explicitly
    permit extracting material for a wide range of uses.</p>"
