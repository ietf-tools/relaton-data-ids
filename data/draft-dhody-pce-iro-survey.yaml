abstract:
- content: "<p>During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation
    and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element (PCE) communication
    Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
    a PCE, or between two PCEs. It was determined that there was a need for clarification
    with respect to the ordered nature of the Include Route Object (IRO). Since there
    was a proposal to have a new IRO type with ordering, as well as handling of Loose
    bit (L-Bit), it felt necessary to conduct a survey of the existing and planned
    implementations. This document summarizes the survey questions and captures the
    results. Some conclusions are also presented. This survey was informal and conducted
    via email. Responses were collected and anonymized by the PCE working group chairs.</p>"
