abstract:
- content: "<p>ENUM uses NAPTR DNS Resource Records (RRs) to map an E.164 telephone
    number to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of other ways of contacting (for
    example, by email) a specific resource. This memo proposes an ENUM-like service
    called EADDR where an email address, instead of a telephone number, is used as
    the key to fetch other contact URIs. At human level, EADDR seems more useful than
    ENUM because it is easier to remember an email address than a telephone number
    as the key. At machine level, both services are equally useful.</p>"
