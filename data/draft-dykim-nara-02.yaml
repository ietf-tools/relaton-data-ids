abstract:
- content: "<p>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The
    Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a collection
    of nodes. Each site is named by a exterior address whereas each node by a interior
    local address. Exterior routing depends solely on site addresses while interior
    routing on node addresses. Both interior and exterior routings render inherent
    mobility as well as seamless multihoming capability. The model can recursively
    repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability,
    for example, to inter-planetary as well as Internet of Things.</p>"
