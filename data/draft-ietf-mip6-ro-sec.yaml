abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an account of the rationale behind the Mobile IPv6
    (MIPv6) Route Optimization security design. The purpose of this document is to
    present the thinking and to preserve the reasoning behind the Mobile IPv6 security
    design in 2001 - 2002. The document has two target audiences: (1) helping MIPv6
    implementors to better understand the design choices in MIPv6 security procedures,
    and (2) allowing people dealing with mobility or multi-homing to avoid a number
    of potential security pitfalls in their designs. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
