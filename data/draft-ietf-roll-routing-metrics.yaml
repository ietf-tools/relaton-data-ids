abstract:
- content: "<p>Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared
    with traditional wired and ad hoc networks that require the specification of new
    routing metrics and constraints. By contrast, with typical Interior Gateway Protocol
    (IGP) routing metrics using hop counts or link metrics, this document specifies
    a set of link and node routing metrics and constraints suitable to LLNs to be
    used by the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
