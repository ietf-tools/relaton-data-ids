abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the Waypoint path oriented delivery mechanism.
    Waypoint attempts to rationalize the packet interception problem that has been
    addressed by different mechanisms such as router alert or RSVP protocol number
    46 intercept. It borrows concepts from prior mechanisms, including the hop by
    hop security model of RSVP. Waypoint strives to be complete, eliminating the need
    to reimplement common functionality in the higher layers of the signaling protocol
    stack.</p>"
