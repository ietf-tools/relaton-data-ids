abstract:
- content: "<p>With the onset of the climate emergency, all areas of human activity
    are expected to continuously assess their Greenhouse Gas emissions and encourage
    the use of clean energy sources as much as possible. The current discussion on
    green networking in the Network Management research field still needs to be expanded
    to the adjoined areas, such as Network Security. This document summarizes the
    security considerations of the existing works and outlines possible research directions
    for energy-aware security mechanisms.</p>"
