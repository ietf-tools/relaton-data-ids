abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPDY, a protocol designed for low-latency transport
    of content over the World Wide Web. SPDY introduces two layers of protocol. The
    lower layer is a general purpose framing layer which can be used atop a reliable
    transport (likely TCP) for multiplexed, prioritized, and compressed data communication
    of many concurrent streams. The upper layer of the protocol provides HTTP- like
    RFC2616 [RFC2616] semantics for compatibility with existing HTTP application servers.</p>"
