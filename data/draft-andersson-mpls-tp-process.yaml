abstract:
- content: "<p>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport
    Profile in cooperation between IETF and ITU-T does not fully define and document
    processes for development of the required RFCs. This document complements the
    processes documented in the JWT decision with a few separate elements; it: o provides
    an adaptation of the IETF working group process, o identifies the expected participation
    in the process by the ITU-T, o clarifies the decision rules regarding MPLS-TP
    documents. This document is not intended to specify any ITU-T process; to the
    extent necessary ITU-T activities will be done according to ITU-T process/rules.
    Nor is this document is intended to specify the IETF working group process, it
    is limited to the temporary adaptations of that process that is the result of
    that IETF and ITU-T accepted the proposal in the JWT report to jointly develop
    the MPLS Transport Profile. In general it may be said that these adaptations are
    introduced to ensure a good and consistent document review across the two organizations.</p>"
