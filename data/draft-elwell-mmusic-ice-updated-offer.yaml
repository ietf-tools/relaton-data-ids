abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) requires an updated offer-answer
    cycle under some circumstances, to satisfy the needs of some devices on the signalling
    path. When used with SIP, this additional offer-answer cycle interacts with other
    things, such as fax and third party call control (3PCC). This document describes
    the problems and discusses possible remedies. This work is being discussed on
    the mmusic@ietf.org mailing list.</p>"
