abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to
    locate items. These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced tracking network
    in which devices belonging to other network users (e.g., phones) report which
    tags they see and their location, thus allowing the owner of the tag to determine
    where their tag was most recently seen. This document defines the protocol by
    which devices report tags they have seen and by which owners look up their location.</p>"
