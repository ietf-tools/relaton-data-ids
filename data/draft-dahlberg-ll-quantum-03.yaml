abstract:
- content: "<p>In a classical network the link layer is responsible for transferring
    a datagram between two nodes that are connected by a single link, possibly including
    switches. In a quantum network however, the link layer will need to provide a
    robust entanglement generation service between two quantum nodes which are connected
    by a quantum link. This service can be used by higher layers to produce entanglement
    between distant nodes or to perform other operations such as qubit transmission,
    without full knowledge of the underlying hardware and its parameters. This draft
    defines what can be expected from the service provided by a link layer for a Quantum
    Network and defines an interface between higher layers and the link layer.</p>"
