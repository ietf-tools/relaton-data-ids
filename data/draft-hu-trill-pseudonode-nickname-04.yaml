abstract:
- content: "<p>RBridges provide frame forwarding service to layer2 switches or end
    stations at the edge of TRILL campus. As defined in [RFC6325], when there are
    multiple RBridges attached to the same LAN segment, only one edge RBridge is allowed
    to be the frame forwarder of a specific VLAN in order to avoid potential frame
    duplication and loops in the TRILL campus. However, in some application scenarios,
    for example an end station is multi-homed to multiple RBridges needs to improve
    the resiliency and increase the available network bandwidth of the connection.
    This means all those RBriges attached to the end station can act as the frame
    forwarders of a specific VLAN. This kind of active-active connection violates
    the definition above. Frame duplication and forwarding loops may happen and it
    may cause the flip-flopping of the egress RBridge nickname associated to the MAC
    address of such an end station in remote RBridges' forwarding tables. The Reverse
    Path Forwarding Check does not work as well, which has been addressed in [CMT].
    This document proposes the concept of Virtual RBridge, along with the pseudo-nickname
    configuration for this Virtual RBridge, to address the above problems in accompany
    with [CMT].</p>"
