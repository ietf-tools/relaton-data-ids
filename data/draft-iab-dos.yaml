abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of possible avenues for denial-of-service
    (DoS) attack on Internet systems. The aim is to encourage protocol designers and
    network engineers towards designs that are more robust. We discuss partial solutions
    that reduce the effectiveness of attacks, and how some solutions might inadvertently
    open up alternative vulnerabilities. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
