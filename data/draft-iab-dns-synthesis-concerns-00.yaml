abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many architectural assumptions regarding DNS behavior that
    are not specified in the IETF standards documents describing DNS, but which are
    deeply embedded in the behavior as expected by Internet protocols and applications.
    These assumptions are inherent parts of the network architecture of which the
    DNS is one component. It has long been known that it is possible to use DNS wildcards
    in ways that violate these assumptions. More recently there have been deployments
    of middleboxes -- in most cases recursive nameservers or DNS proxies at the ISP
    level -- that synthesize answers in ways that not only violate these assumptions
    but also violate the DNS architecture. Experience with DNS synthesis in the DNS
    infrastructure have show that the cost of violating these assumptions is significant.
    In this document we provide an explanation of how DNS wildcards function, and
    many examples of how their injudicious use negatively impacts both individual
    Internet applications and indeed the Internet architecture itself. We also explain
    that similar problems arise with the synthesis of DNS responses by middleboxes.
    We recommend that DNS wildcards should not be used in a zone unless the zone operator
    has a clear understanding of the risks, and that they should not be used without
    the informed consent of those entities which have been delegated below the zone.
    In addition we recommend that middleboxes do not perform DNS query synthesis unless
    (1)there are informed consents of those that use the forwarding name server, and
    (2)there exists an opt-out mechanism that allows them to receive the original
    DNS answers.</p>"
