abstract:
- content: "<p>Peer-to-peer traffic optimization techniques that aim at improving
    locality in the peer selection process have attracted great interest in the research
    community and have been subject of much discussion. Some of this discussion has
    produced controversial myths, some rooted in reality while others remain unfounded.
    This document evaluates the most prominent myths attributed to P2P optimization
    techniques by referencing the most relevant study (or studies) that have addressed
    facts pertaining to the myth. Using these studies, we hope to either confirm or
    refute each specific myth.</p>"
