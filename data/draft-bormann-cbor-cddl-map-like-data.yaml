abstract:
- content: <p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 8949) is a data
    format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size,
    fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.
    Basic CBOR supports non-ordered maps free of duplicate keys, similar to the way
    JSON defines JSON objects (RFC 8259). Using the CBOR extension point of tags,
    tags for a selection of variants of maps and multimaps have been registered, but
    gaps remain. The present document defines a consolidated set of CBOR tags for
    map-like data items involving key-value pairs. The Concise Data Definition Language
    (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610, is often used to express CBOR data structure
    specifications. It provides "control operators" as its main language extension
    point. The present document defines a number of control operators that enable
    the description of CBOR data structures that make use of the newly defined tags
    or that employ the same underlying structures.</p>
