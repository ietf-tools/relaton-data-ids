abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPSec DOI for ISAKMP defines identities for phase 2 exchanges that
    are suitable for a flat, unique address space. On the other hand, different VPN's
    cannot guarantee a non-overlapping address space among them. Therefore when security
    gateways on an ISP network negotiate IPSec SA's in the context of multiple VPN's,
    identifying traffic flows for this multiplicity of VPN's become an issue. Of course,
    an alternative would be to have multiple contexts of security gateways, one for
    each VPN. Unfortunately that would impose severe administrative challenges to
    an ISP, some of which are described later. Another alternative and a more appealing
    one would be to have a single security gateway with a single tunnel endpoint address,
    a single X.509 certificate, etc., that exists in a common context and is able
    to negotiate IPSec tunnels for any VPN with a presence in the security gateway.
    For the later to be possible however, it is required for this common security
    gateway to be able to negotiate phase 2 SA's on behalf of each one of these VPN's
    with overlapping address spaces. A second motivation for the later approach would
    be to simply negotiate IPSec tunnels for each VPN as a whole without implying
    any specific traffic flow. This specification describes an extended DOI for ISAKMP
    which, while inheriting the existing IPSec DOI in its entirety, defines extra
    types of phase 2 identities which include a VPN-ID field as an extra piece of
    tunnel identity, i.e., a qualifier for the IP addresses selectors. The VPN-ID
    is defined in RFC 2685.</p>"
