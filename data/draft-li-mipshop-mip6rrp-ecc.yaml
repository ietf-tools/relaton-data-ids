abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IPv6 Return Routability Procedure (RRP) is used to secure the
    Binding Updates between a Mobile Node and a Correspondent Node where there is
    no pre-established security relationship between the two parties. This document
    puts forward a mechanism called ECC RRP, which enhances the key management for
    Return Routability Procedure with anonymous Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
    Key Agreement Protocol. The proposed procedure is not prone to attacks by nodes
    on the route from correspondent node to home agent in way that the RRP process
    described in RFC3775 is. It also reduces the latency related to handovers that
    require new binding updates.</p>"
