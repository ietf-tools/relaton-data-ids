abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent discussions on the need to translate or not between IPv4 and
    IPv6 have brought a better understanding on the impact of tools like NAT-PT [NAT-PT].
    Several problems have been identified around the DNS ALG functionality. An alternative
    solution that does not require this DNS ALG for connections initiated by the IPv6
    side has been proposed. This memo aims at analyzing the pros and cons of both
    solutions in that case. Connections initiated by the IPv4 side would always require
    the help of a DNS-ALG and thus are not covered by this memo.</p>"
