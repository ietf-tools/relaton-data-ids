abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an extension to the Time Zone Data Distribution
    Service (RFC 7808) to allow a mobile device to retrieve the time zones associated
    with a geographic location as specified by a 'geo' URI (RFC 5870). Open Issues
    o Determine which, if any, GEOPRIV requirements we need to follow and how they
    impact Security/Privacy considerations. o Need a new field(s) in the response
    to indicate which time zone(s) contain the point location vs those which are nearby
    (intersect the radius of uncertainty).</p>"
