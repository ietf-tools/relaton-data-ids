abstract:
- content: "<p>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be
    able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce sending
    traffic for some period of time. Otherwise, it must continue to expend resources
    parsing and responding to Diameter messages, possibly resulting in congestion
    collapse. The existing Diameter mechanisms are not sufficient for this purpose.
    This document describes the limitations of the existing mechanisms. Requirements
    for new overload management mechanisms are also provided.</p>"
