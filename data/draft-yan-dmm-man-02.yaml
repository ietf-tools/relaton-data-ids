abstract:
  content: "<p>The draft analyzes the issue that multiple mobility management protocols
    have been developed according to different requirements. These different protocols
    have different functional requirements on the network element or the host. A scheme
    is then proposed to support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility
    management protocol when a host accesses a new network.</p>"
