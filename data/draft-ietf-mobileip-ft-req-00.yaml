abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses problems arising out of the use of Mobile IP
    in a security conscious Internet and presents a list of solution requirements
    deemed important. These problems may need to be resolved in several stages. A
    priority order in which these problems should be solved is also proposed. All
    firewalls are assumed to implement standard mechanisms [RFCs 1825,1826,1827] for
    authentication and encryption proposed by the IPSec working group of the IETF.</p>"
