abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism under which a client can request
    that an upstream recursive resolver perform DNS filtering on behalf of a client-requested
    policy. This is may be done, for example, under a subscription model, where the
    client wishes not to get redirected to domains known to host malware or malicious
    content. This request is sent as an EDNS0 option with every DNS request, or potentially
    to just the first DNS request in a stream when using DNS over TLS, DNS over DTLS
    or DNS over DOH for example.</p>"
