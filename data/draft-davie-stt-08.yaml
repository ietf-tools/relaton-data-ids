abstract:
- content: "<p>Network Virtualization places unique requirements on tunneling protocols.
    This draft describes STT (Stateless Transport Tunneling), a tunnel encapsulation
    that enables overlay networks to be built in virtualized networks. STT is particularly
    useful when some tunnel endpoints are in end-systems, as it utilizes the capabilities
    of the network interface card to improve performance. This draft documents the
    protocol and the rationale for its design, and highlights issues that may arise
    in deployments.</p>"
