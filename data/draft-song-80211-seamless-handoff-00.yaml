abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo documents the concept of virtual AP which refers to using
    multi physical APs to simulate only one virtual AP, method and process used for
    seamless handoff between APs upon IEEE802.11 network. It defines the stages to
    actualize smooth handoff, mentions the concepts, theories and requirements in
    these stages.</p>"
