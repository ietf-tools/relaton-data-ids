abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a framework for defining encryption and checksum
    mechanisms for use with the Kerberos protocol, defining an abstraction layer between
    the Kerberos protocol and related protocols, and the actual mechanisms themselves.
    The document also defines several mechanisms. Some are taken from RFC 1510, modified
    in form to fit this new framework and occasionally modified in content when the
    old specification was incorrect. New mechanisms are presented here as well. This
    document does NOT indicate which mechanisms may be considered "required to implement".
