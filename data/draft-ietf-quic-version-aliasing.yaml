abstract:
- content: "<p>The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] preserves its future extensibility
    partly by specifying its version number. There will be a relatively small number
    of published version numbers for the foreseeable future. This document provides
    a method for clients and servers to negotiate the use of other version numbers
    in subsequent connections. If a sizeable subset of QUIC connections use this mechanism,
    this should prevent middlebox ossification around the current set of published
    version numbers and the contents of QUIC Initial packets.</p>"
