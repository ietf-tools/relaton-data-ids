abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol BGP (MP-BGP) has support for distributing next-hop information
    for multiple address families using one AFI/SAFI Network Layer Reachability Information
    (NLRI). [RFC5549] specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising IPv4
    NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol.
    While the next-hop info is learnt via MP-BGP, certain procedures are needed to
    enable traffic forwarding. This document describes PIM extensions and the use-cases
    for multicast forwarding in various scenarios.</p>"
