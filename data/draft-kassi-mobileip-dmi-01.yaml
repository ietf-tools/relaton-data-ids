abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft introduces a different mode for the mobility usage in IP
    networks. This mode does not modify the Mobile IP protocol specifications [2],
    but makes their use more efficient according to the movements of the mobile node
    as far as its communications are concerned. The Mobile IP mechanisms will be used
    only for the ongoing communications while the mobile node is in motion. That is,
    the Mobile IP mechanisms will be used for the communications established from
    an IP sub-network and which continue whenever the mobile node moves to another
    IP sub-network. For all the communications that are opened and closed in the same
    IP sub-network there is no need to use Mobile IP mechanisms even if the mobile
    node is away from its home network.</p>"
