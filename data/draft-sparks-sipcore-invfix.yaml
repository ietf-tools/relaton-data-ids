abstract:
- content: "<p>This document normatively updates RFC 3261, the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP), to address an error in the specified handling of success (200
    class) responses to INVITE requests. Elements following RFC 3261 exactly will
    misidentify retransmissions of the request as a new, unassociated, request. The
    correction involves modifying the INVITE transaction state machines. The correction
    also changes the way responses that cannot be matched to an existing transaction
    are handled to address a security risk.</p>"
