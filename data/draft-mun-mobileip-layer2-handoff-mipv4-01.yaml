abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile-IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform layer 3 handoff
    between subnets served by different Foreign Agents. Sometimes the delay during
    handoffs can exceed the threshold of delay sensitive applications. So low delay
    must be considered. This document describes a method to perform fast handoff on
    the Layer 2 for Mobile-IPv4 with 802.11's Access Point. Mobile-IPv4 Registration
    messages are carried in the Information Elements of 802.11 frames. According to
    this method, Mobile-IPv4 can perform handoff at the same time as 802.11 handoff.
    But some modifications bust be adopted in the existing Mobile-IPv4 and 802.11's
    entities such as Mobile Node and Access Point.</p>"
