abstract:
- content: "<p>Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IP Address
    and a single destination IP Address, as part of the identification for an individual
    transport data flow. This is problematic for multihomed hosts and for mobile hosts,
    collectively needing 'multiaddressing' support. The basic goal, then, is to find
    a method for multiaddressing that makes the smallest possible change to the architecture
    and to current systems, while maintaining flexibility for different emerging solutions.
    This draft proposes a framework for methods for creating Common Endpoint Locator
    Pools that can be used by and among the proposed solutions.</p>"
