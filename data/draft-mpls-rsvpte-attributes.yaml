abstract:
- content: "<p>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) may
    be established using the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering extensions
    (RSVP-TE). This protocol includes an object (the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object) which
    carries a flags field used to indicate options and attributes of the LSP. That
    flags field has eight bits allowing for eight options to be set. Recent proposals
    in many documents that extend RSVP-TE for signaling additional features and function
    for MPLS LSPs have suggested uses for each of the previously unused bits. This
    document defines a new object for RSVP-TE messages that allows the signaling of
    further attribute bits and also the carriage of arbitrary attribute parameters.
    This makes RSVP-TE easily extensible to support new requirements.</p>"
