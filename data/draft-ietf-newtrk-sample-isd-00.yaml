abstract:
- content: <p>The proposal to define what is actually an IETF standard and to create
    ways of explaining and qualifying its applicability and relationship to other
    documents has been described in an Internet-Draft, "Internet Standards Documentation
    (ISDs)" (draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd-00). This document provides some examples
    of what such documents might look like. It includes a very complicated example
    (SMTP) and a fairly simple one (the IMAP/POP authorization specification of RFC
    2195, which has not progressed beyond Proposed Standard).</p>
