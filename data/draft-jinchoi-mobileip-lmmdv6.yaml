abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents Localized Mobility Management for Mobile IPv6
    in Distributed Manner (LMMDv6). Localized Mobility Management, in general introduces
    Local Mobility Agent functionality for proxying a Regional care of address that
    remains the same while the mobile node moves within a Local Mobility Domain, which
    reduces the binding update signaling latency and the signaling load outside the
    Local Mobility Domain. We present a new way of forming Local Mobility Domains
    and Local Mobility Agents. In this protocol, Local Mobility Agent functionality
    is distributed across all access routers and a Local Mobility Domain is formed
    dynamically according to the mobile node's movement.</p>"
