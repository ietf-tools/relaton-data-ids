abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a YANG data model to map customer service models
    (e.g., L3VPN Service Delivery model) to Traffic Engineering (TE) models (e.g.,
    the TE Tunnel or the Virtual Network (VN) model). These models are referred to
    as TE Service Mapping Model and are applicable generically to the operator's need
    for seamless control and management of their VPN services with underlying TE support.
    The models are principally used for monitoring and diagnostics of the management
    systems to show how the service requests are mapped onto underlying network resource
    and TE models.</p>"
