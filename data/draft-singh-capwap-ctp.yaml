abstract:
- content: "<p>With the overwhelming choice of proprietary implementations of centralized
    control and management of wireless access points and access controllers there
    is a great demand for a standard protocol and architecture that enables the deployment
    of large scale wireless networks. This document describes the CAPWAP Tunneling
    Protocol, a protocol that allows for the centralized control and provisioning
    of a large number of wireless access points from access controllers. It is supported
    by an architecture where the MAC layer of the RF technology is terminated within
    the AP. This allows for the protocol to be extensible to multiple radio technologies.
    It assumes an IP connection between the access points and access controllers and
    has signaling primitives to enable wireless station mobility between access points.
    Therefore, seamless Layer 3 subnet mobility is seamlessly enabled by this protocol.</p>"
