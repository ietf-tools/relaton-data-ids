abstract:
- content: "<p>There are many issues concerning the deployment and implementation,
    and to a lesser degree, specification of IPv6 multicast. This memo describes known
    problems, trying to raise awareness. Currently, global IPv6 interdomain multicast
    is completely impossible except using SSM: there is no way to convey information
    about multicast sources between PIM RPs. Site-scoped multicast is also problematic
    when used alongside to global multicast because of that. A few possible solutions
    are outlined or referred to. In addition, an issue regarding link-local multicast-blocking
    Ethernet switches is brought up. Finally, a feature request for MLD snooping switches
    is noted.</p>"
