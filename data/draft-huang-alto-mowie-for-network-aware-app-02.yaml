abstract:
- content: "<p>With the quick deployment of 5G networks in the world, cloud based
    interactive services such as clouding gaming have gained substantial attention
    and are regarded as potential killer applications. To ensure users' quality of
    experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may require not only high bandwidth
    (e.g., high-resolution media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency
    and low lagging). However, the bandwidth and delay experienced by a mobile and
    wireless user can be dynamic, as a function of many factors, and unhandled changes
    can substantially compromise users' QoE. In this document, we investigate network-aware
    applications (NAA), which realize cloud based interactive services with improved
    QoE, by efficient utilization of Mobile and Wireless Information Exposure (MoWIE)
    . In particular, this document demonstrates, through realistic evaluations, that
    mobile network information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can effectively
    expose the dynamicity of the underlying network and can be made available to applications
    through MoWIE; using such information, the applications can then adapt key control
    knobs such as media codec scheme, encapsulation and application logical function
    to minimize QoE deduction. Based on the evaluations, we discuss how MoWIE can
    be a systematic extension of the ALTO protocol, to expose more lower-layer and
    finer grain network dynamics.</p>"
