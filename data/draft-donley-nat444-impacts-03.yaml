abstract:
- content: <p>NAT444 is an IPv4 extension technology being considered by Service Providers
    to continue offering IPv4 service to customers while transitioning to IPv6. This
    technology adds an extra Carrier-Grade NAT ("CGN") in the Service Provider network,
    often resulting in two NATs. CableLabs, Time Warner Cable, and Rogers Communications
    independently tested the impacts of NAT444 on many popular Internet services using
    a variety of test scenarios, network topologies, and vendor equipment. This document
    identifies areas where adding a second layer of NAT disrupts the communication
    channel for common Internet applications. This document was updated to also include
    Dual-Stack Lite impacts.</p>
