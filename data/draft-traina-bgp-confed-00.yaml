abstract:
- content: "<p>Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol
    designed for TCP/IP internets. This document describes an extension to BGP which
    may be used to create a confederation of autonomous systems which is represented
    as one single autonomous system to BGP peers external to the confederation. The
    intention of the proposed technique is to aid in policy administration and reduce
    the management complexity of maintaining a large autonomous system.</p>"
