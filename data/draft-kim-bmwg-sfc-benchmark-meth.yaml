abstract:
- content: "<p>Service Function Chain is the ordered set of service functions such
    as firewall, Deep Packet Inspection(DPI), virtualized Evolved Packet Core (vEPC),
    and etc,. Operators make chains with several service functions depending on the
    service which they have to provide. The chain needs to be evaluated to measure
    the SLA. This draft describes the benchmarking methodologies for Service Function
    Chain(SFC) performance and the affecting factors to SFC performance.</p>"
