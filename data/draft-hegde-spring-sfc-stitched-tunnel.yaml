abstract:
- content: <p>The term "service function chaining" is used to describe the definition
    and instantiation of an ordered list of instances of such service functions, and
    the subsequent "steering" of traffic flows through those service functions.This
    document describes transport mechanisms that use stitched tunnels to achieve end-to-end
    service chaining. This document specifies two different types of transport encodings,
    one based on SR-MPLS and another based on IP tunnels.</p>
