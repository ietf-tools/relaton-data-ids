abstract:
- content: "<p>The WebDAV protocol defines facilities for adding properties to Web
    resources. These properties consist of name/value pairs interchanged using XML.
    The protocol includes the PROPFIND method for accessing properties, and the PROPPATCH
    method for updating and removing properties. Experience building both WebDAV clients
    and a WebDAV server indicates the need for three minor extensions to the current
    properties protocol: 1) allow PROPPATCH to create and initialize the properties
    of a resource that did not exist, 2) distinguish between adding a new property,
    and setting the value of an existing property of a resource, and 3) give client
    applications more control in specifying how PROPPATCH errors should be handled.</p>"
