abstract:
- content: "<p>While it is a necessary feature that the home agent tunnels multicast
    packets to mobile nodes away from home, it can cause severe network congestion
    on the forward path between the home agent and the care-of address nodes, because
    of the unicast tunneling of multicast packets. Multicast avalanche avoidance in
    Mobile IP (MAAMIP) is designed to avoid the network congestion by using of Explicit
    multicast tunneling. Explicit multicast tunneling in Mobile IP enables avoidance
    of network congestion and realizes the true bandwidth saving, which is the primitive
    goal of multicast.</p>"
