abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Mime (S/MIME) defined a method of placing security labels on
    a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) object. These labels are placed as part of
    the data signed and validated by the parties. This means that the message content
    is visible to the recipient prior to the label enforcement. In [EPS-WS-TRUST]
    a new model has been presented where a third party is used as the enforcement
    point of the label. This document provides the details needed to implement the
    new Plasma model in the CMS infrastructure. Additional benefits of using the Plasma
    module include moving responsibility of building lock boxes to the server and
    determining, based on policy, who should be a message recipient. The document
    describes and details how the encryption process is performed, defines a new lock
    box attribute to hold the information needed to valid the label and to obtain
    the keys needed to decrypt the message. The document does not cover the protocol
    between the client and the Plasma policy enforcement server.</p>"
