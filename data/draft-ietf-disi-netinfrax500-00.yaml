abstract:
- content: "<p>As the OSI Directory progresses into an operational structure which
    is being increasingly used as a primary resource for Directory Information, it
    was perceived that having the Internet Site Contacts and some limited network
    information in the Directory would be immediately useful and would also provide
    the preliminary framework for some distributed NIC functions. This paper describes
    the interim schema used to contain this information.</p>"
