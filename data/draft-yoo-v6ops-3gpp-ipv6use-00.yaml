abstract:
- content: "<p>3GPP PS (Packet Switched) domain Standard states the usage of IPv6
    as its network protocol to compensate the shortage of Internet address and to
    use the enhanced network protocol functions. In case of the current IPv6 usage
    in 3GPP packet domain standards, they have unique IPv6 address allocation scheme
    which is somewhat different from the one of IETF due to its 3G equipments and
    packet network elements. Meanwhile, IETF presents 'recommendations to 3GPP networks
    (RFC3314 [2])' to satisfy compatibility between IETF IPv6 and IPv6 of 3GPP networks
    and to lift up the IPv6 capabilities. In this situation, this document provides
    a new IPv6 address allocation scheme in 3GPP networks satisfying IETF' recommendations.
    Provided scheme keeps rules of recommendations of IETF standards and guarantees
    backward compatibility with the legacy 3GPP IPv6 autoconfiguration.</p>"
