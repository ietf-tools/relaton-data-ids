abstract:
- content: "<p>Data centers are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by
    gateway routers. One data center typically has more than one gateway for commercial,
    load-balancing, and resiliency reasons. Other sites, such as access networks,
    also need to be connected across backbone networks through gateways. This document
    defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to allow data
    center gateway routers to advertise routes to the prefixes reachable in the site,
    including advertising them on behalf of other gateways at the same site. This
    allows segment routing to be used to identify multiple paths across the Internet
    or backbone network between different gateways. The paths can be selected for
    load-balancing, resilience, and quality purposes.</p>"
