abstract:
- content: <p>The Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture describes
    how Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through an IPv6 or MPLS
    network using the source routing paradigm. Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end
    node to select any path without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g.,
    LDP or RSVP-TE). It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by Link- State
    IGPs. A Segment Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including
    an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path Computation
    Element (PCE). Since, Segment Routing can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding
    plane, a PCE should be able to compute SR-Path for both MPLS and IPv6 forwarding
    plane. This draft describes the extensions required for Segment Routing support
    for IPv6 data plane in Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP).</p>
