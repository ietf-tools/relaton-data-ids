abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the need for a new IANA Diameter Command Code
    to be used in a vendor-specific new application for invocation of Policy Processing
    (Policy Evaluation, or Evaluation and Enforcement). This application is needed
    as one of the implementations of the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation,
    Enforcement and Management (PEEM) enabler, namely for the PEM-1 interface used
    to send a request/response for Policy Processing. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
