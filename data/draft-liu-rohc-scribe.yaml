abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an efficient, robust, and scalable scheme for
    message compression when the transmission path between the compressor and decompressor
    is unreliable, i.e. prone to errors, losses, and misordering. The scheme is applicable
    in particular to compression of SIP, RTSP, SDP, and HTTP messages. A major case
    of application is the compression of SIP protocol messages over bandwidth limited
    links, such as cellular links.</p>"
