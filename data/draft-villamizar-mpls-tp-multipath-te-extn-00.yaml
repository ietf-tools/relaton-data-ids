abstract:
- content: "<p>Extensions to OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE, and RSVP-TE are defined in support
    of carrying LSP with strict packet ordering requirements over multipath and and
    carrying LSP with strict packet ordering requirements within LSP without violating
    requirements to maintain packet ordering. LSP with strict packet ordering requirements
    include MPLS-TP LSP. OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE extensions defined here indicate node
    and link capability reagrding support for ordered aggregates of traffic, multipath
    traffic distribution, and abilities to support multipath load distribution differently
    per LSP. RSVP-TE extensions either identifies an LSP as requiring strict packet
    order, or identifies an LSP as carrying one or more LSP that requires strict packet
    order at a given depth in the label stack, or identifies an LSP as having no restrictions
    on packet ordering except the restriction to avoid reordering microflows. In addition
    an extension indicates whether the first nibble of payload will reliably indicate
    whether payload is IPv4, IPv6, or other type of payload, most notably pseudowire
    using a pseudowire control word.</p>"
