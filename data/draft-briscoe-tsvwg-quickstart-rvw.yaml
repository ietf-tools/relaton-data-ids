abstract:
- content: "<p>This review thoroughly analyses draft 01 of the Quick-Start proposal,
    focusing mostly on security issues. It is argued that the recent new QS nonce
    proposal gives insufficient protection against misbehaving receivers, and a new
    approach is suggested. But it would be perverse to strengthen protection against
    malicious receivers too much when the protocol only works if all senders can be
    trusted to comply. The review argues this is an inevitable result of choosing
    to have routers allocate rate to senders without keeping per-flow state. The paper
    also questions whether Quick-Start's under-utilisation assumption defines a distinct
    range of operation where fairness can be ignored. Because traffic variance will
    always blur the boundary, we argue that under-utilisation should be treated as
    the extreme of a spectrum where fairness is always an issue to some extent. If
    we are to avoid per-flow state on routers, the review points to an alternative
    direction where endpoints allocate rate to themselves. Counter-intuitively, this
    allows scalable security and a spectrum of fairness to be built in from the start,
    but rate allocation is less deterministic. Issues not related to security are
    also raised, including the possibility of a catastrophic overload if path delays
    are atypical. A solution to this is offered, as well as solutions to scalability
    issues with the range and precision of the Rate Request field. Many other more
    minor review comments are given.</p>"
