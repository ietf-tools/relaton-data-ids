abstract:
- content: "<p>Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS) provides a way to generate N shares
    from a value, so that any M of those shares can be used to reconstruct the original
    value, but any M-1 shares provide no information about that value. This method
    can provide shared access control on key material and other secrets that must
    be strongly protected. This note defines a threshold secret sharing method based
    on polynomial interpolation in GF(256) and a format for the storage and transmission
    of shares. It also provides usage guidance, describes how to test an implementation,
    and supplies test cases.</p>"
