abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the requirements for the architecture and a
    distributed framework for end-point firewall control (DEFCon). This draft also
    discusses requirements for the individual pieces in the framework. Perimeter firewalls
    are predominant in enterprise networks but do not provide the protection a mission
    critical network needs against misuse or abuse from nodes inside the network.
    Additionally, A wireless infrastructure makes every host vulnerable since in that
    case access is not fundamentally restricted by infrastructure. Likewise, traffic
    is increasingly being encrypted end-to-end using SSL, IPSec, etc. where viruses/worms/confidential
    information can also be hidden from the security components. This requires the
    perimeter firewall to become a man-in-the-middle for all secure sessions, which
    breaks the end-to-end principle and thus renders many protocols useless since
    they are inevitably blocked. A host-based firewall on nodes in the enterprise
    network protects the network from inside out. This approach does not preclude
    perimeter firewalls. Instead, it provides defense-in-depth and reduces the load
    on perimeter firewalls. The host-based approach also upholds the end-to-end theme
    since it allows traffic to be securely encrypted end-to-end and yet assures safety
    from infection, compromise and attack.</p>"
