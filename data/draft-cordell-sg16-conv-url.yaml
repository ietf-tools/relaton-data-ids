abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolving technologies for real-time conversation over the Internet
    require URLs to provide user contact information. As there are many protocols
    (including some that are not Internet based) that can be used for inter-user conversation,
    this document describes a two stage transaction process for obtaining a URL that
    can be used to initiate conversation. The first stage involves retrieving a list
    of protocol specific URLs in a MIME encoded file. The MIME type enables an appropriate
    application to be launched which will analyse the presented URLs and select the
    most appropriate one. The second stage involves interpreting the protocol specific
    URL and initiating the conversation. The protocol specific URLs are encoded in
    a URL form so that they can be embedded directly into HTML pages. This allows
    the first stage to be omitted. The document describes the format of the MIME encoded
    list of URLs, and the format of a number of protocol specific URLs.</p>"
