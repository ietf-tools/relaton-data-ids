abstract:
- content: "<p>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths
    between peers. MPTCP protocol defines seven subtypes in MPTCP v0 [RFC6824] and
    ten subtypes in MPTCP v1 [RFC8684] to differentiate message types and implement
    some additional functions during a session. This draft proposes an enhancement
    to support Subtype Capability Exchange during MPTCP connection establishment in
    order to improve elastic scalability of MPTCP protocol. It includes: 1) requirements
    for which this kind of capability exchange during handshake is important for a
    MPTCP session; 2) a typical flow for Subtype Capability Exchange between peers;
    3) a feasible solution on protocol design is suggested.</p>"
