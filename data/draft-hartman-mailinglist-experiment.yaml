- content: "<p>Discussion in the community has begun to question whether RFC 3683
    and RFC 3934 provide the appropriate flexibility for managing Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) mailing lists. This document is an RFC 3933 experiment designed
    to allow the community to experiment with a broader set of tools for mailing list
    management while trying to determine what the long-term guidelines should be.
    This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
