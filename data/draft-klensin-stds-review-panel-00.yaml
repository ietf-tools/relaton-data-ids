abstract:
- content: '<p>Somewhat over a decade ago, the IETF responded to a series of perceived
    problems with the then-IAB by restructuring the way in which the IAB and IESG
    were constituted and assigning all standards- approval and closely-related processes
    to the IESG. In retrospect, that decision has had serious downsides: among them
    are the observations that the IESG has become overloaded to the point that the
    role requires an unreasonable level of investment and that the intertwining of
    managing WGs and then reviewing and approving their products has led to confusion
    and the risk, and sometimes the appearance, of inherent conflicts of interest
    and abuses. This document proposes to re-separate the "steering" and "WG management"
    functions that were orginally the IESG''s responsibility from the "final review
    and standards approval" roles and respecifies the standards approval process in
    that context. The general concepts outlined in this document have been discussed
    informally in the community for some time. This document is provided as a specific
    proposal to facilitate a focused discussion.</p>'
