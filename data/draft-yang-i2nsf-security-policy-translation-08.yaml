abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a scheme of security policy translation (i.e.,
    Security Policy Translator) in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF)
    Framework. When I2NSF User delivers a high-level security policy for a security
    service, Security Policy Translator in Security Controller translates it into
    a low-level security policy for Network Security Functions (NSFs). For this security
    policy translation, this document specifies the mapping between a high-level security
    policy based on the Consumer-Facing Interface YANG data model and a low-level
    security policy based on the NSF-Facing Interface YANG data model. Also, it describes
    an architecture of a security policy translator along with an NSF database, and
    the process of security policy translation with the NSF database.</p>"
