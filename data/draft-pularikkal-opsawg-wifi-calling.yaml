abstract:
- content: "<p>Carrier Wi-Fi Calling is a solution that allows mobile operators to
    seamlessly offload mobile voice signaling and bearer traffic onto Wi- Fi access
    networks, which may or may not be managed by the mobile operators. Mobile data
    offload onto Wi-Fi access networks has already become very common, as Wi-Fi access
    has become more ubiquitous. However, the offload of mobile voice traffic onto
    Wi-Fi networks has become prevalent only in recent years. This was primarily driven
    by the native Wi-Fi Calling client support introduced by device vendors. The objective
    of this document is to provide a high level deployment reference to Mobile Operators
    and Wi- Fi Operators on Carrier Wi-Fi Calling.</p>"
