abstract:
- content: "<p>The current MVPN specifications do not define encoding and procedures
    for advertising in a single route binding of multiple multicast streams of a given
    MVPN customer to a single provider's tunnel. This document defines such encoding
    and procedures. These procedures allow in certain situations to reduce MVPN control
    plane load (note though that these procedures have no impact on the data plane
    load). The procedures specified in this document assume that BGP is used for transmission
    of MVPN customers' routing information within the service provider(s) infrastructure.
    Specification of Requirements</p>"
