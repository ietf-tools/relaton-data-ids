abstract:
- content: "<p>Networks and network applications must be robust and reliable. For
    many applications and services, such as packetized voice, correcting a failure
    must be almost instantaneous. The first step in correcting a failure is, of course,
    detecting that it occurred. IP routing protocols and signaling protocols as well
    as many application layer protocols incorporate their own keepalive mechanisms
    to detect failures. Typically, these protocols detect failures on the order of
    seconds or tens of seconds. While there are some physical and link layer technologies
    that inherently supply link outage detection, not all link layers do this. In
    order to provide for fast failure detection over any type of lower layer, an IP
    layer fast keepalive protocol can be used. This draft describes such a protocol
    for quickly detecting when a network layer interface of a peer has failed.</p>"
