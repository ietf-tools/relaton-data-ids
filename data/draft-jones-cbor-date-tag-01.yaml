abstract:
- content: '<p>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
    format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size,
    fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.
    In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 defines
    two tags for time: CBOR tag 0 (RFC 3339 date/time string) and tag 1 (Posix "seconds
    since the epoch"). Since then, additional requirements have become known. This
    specification defines a CBOR tag for an RFC 3339 date text string, for applications
    needing a textual date representation without a time. It also defines a CBOR tag
    for days since the Posix epoch, for applicaitons needing a numeric date representation
    without a time. It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration
    of the CBOR tags defined.</p>'
