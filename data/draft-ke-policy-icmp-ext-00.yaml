abstract:
- content: "<p>ping/traceroute and other network diagnostic tools are widely used
    in the IP networks to diagnose the network reachability, IP packet routing and
    routing failure location. However, the existing ping/traceroute tools are adaptable
    only to the pure networks where the routing is based on destination address. When
    an IP packet passes a certain equipment based on ACL policy routing, the ping/traceroute
    packet routing MAY be different from the real traffic flow routing. This will
    lead to an erroneous diagnostic result.</p>"
