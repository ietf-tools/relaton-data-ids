abstract:
- content: "<p>In the year following the publication of the PPPoE protocol much operational
    experience and customer feedback was gathered. One problem that access providers
    usually mention is that in order to change QoS on a connection for a specific
    user, they have to provision some central database (for instance, Radius) and
    also have do it every time the user wants to make a change.</p>"
