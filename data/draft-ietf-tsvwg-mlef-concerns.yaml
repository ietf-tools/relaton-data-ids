abstract:
- content: '<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States Department
    of Defense, with its contractors, has proposed a service architecture for military
    (NATO and related agencies) telephone systems. This is called the Assured Service,
    and is defined in two documents: "Architecture for Assured Service Capabilities
    in Voice over IP" and "Requirements for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice
    over IP". Responding to these are three documents: "Extending the Session Initiation
    Protocol Reason Header to account for Preemption Events", "Communications Resource
    Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol", and the "Multi-Level Expedited
    Forwarding Per Hop Behavior" (MLEF PHB). MLEF, as currently defined, has serious
    problems, which this draft seeks to discuss.</p>'
