abstract:
- content: <p>This document presents a taxonomy of a set of "Alternative Network Deployments"
    that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity
    to people or providing a local communication infrastructure to serve various complementary
    needs and objectives. They employ architectures and topologies different from
    those of mainstream networks and rely on alternative governance and business models.
    The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, and their
    differing architectural characteristics, including a set of definitions and shared
    properties. The classification considers models such as Community Networks, Wireless
    Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by individuals but leased out
    to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved
    population, networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of
    the users, and rural utility cooperatives.</p>
