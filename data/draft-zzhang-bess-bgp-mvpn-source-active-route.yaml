abstract:
- content: <p>RFC6514 specifies the protocol and procedures for multicast in MPLS/
    BGP IP VPNs. In the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) case, the section "14. Supporting
    PIM-SM without Inter-Site Shared C-Trees" specifies that the Provider Edge that
    serves as a customer Rendezvous Point or runs Multicast Source Discovery Protocol
    advertises Source Active (SA) routes for ASM flows when it discovers those flows.
    This document describes a situation where an optional enhancement to the advertisement
    of SA routes is desired and specifies the procedures. It updates RFC6514.</p>
