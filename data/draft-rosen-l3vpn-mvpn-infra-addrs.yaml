abstract:
- content: <p>To provide Multicast VPN service, a provider edge router originates
    "MCAST-VPN" BGP routes. These routes encode addresses from the customer's address
    space as well as addresses from the provider's address space. The customer's address
    space may be either IPv4 or IPv6. Independently, the provider's address space
    may be either IPv4 or IPv6. The MCAST-VPN BGP routes always contain an "address
    family" field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4 addresses
    or whether they are IPv6 addresses. However, there is no field that explicitly
    specifies whether the provider addresses are IPv4 addresses or whether they are
    IPv6 addresses. The existing specifications do not explicitly say how to determine
    whether a given provider address is IPv4 or IPv6, and there are differing precedents
    about the method used to encode IPv4 addresses in messages that also contain IPv6
    addresses. This document removes any ambiguity by specifying that MCAST-VPN routes
    always encode provider IPv4 addresses as four-octet addresses, and that the distinction
    between an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address is signaled solely by the length of
    the address field.</p>
