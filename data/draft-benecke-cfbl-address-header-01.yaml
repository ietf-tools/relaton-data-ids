abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a method to allow a mail sender to specify
    a complaint feedback loop address as an email header and how a mail receiver can
    use it. This document also defines the rules for processing and forwarding such
    a complaint. The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a standardized
    and automated way to provide a complaint feedback loop address to mailbox providers.
    Currently, providing and maintaining such an address to a mailbox provider is
    a manual and time-consuming process.</p>"
