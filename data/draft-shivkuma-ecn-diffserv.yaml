abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the use of one bit in the DS-byte to facilitate
    ECN-type control in the differentiated services architecture. Specifically during
    periods of congestion along a flow's path (indicated using the one-bit mechanism),
    the out-of- profile packets of the flow (packets for which the 'In profile' bit
    is cleared) can be either delayed or dropped by the ingress network edge routers.
    This scheme would allow interior routers to preserve their resources for processing
    in-profile packets during congestion and guard against certain types of denial-of-service
    attacks. The proposed mechanism could also be used to build differentiated services
    networks with lower average delay, and aid the implementation of congestion-based
    pricing schemes in such architectures. The mechanism interoperates well with the
    baseline differentiated services architecture and can also interoperate with ECN-TCP
    and future ECN-enabled transports/applications. Further, the ECN-type flow control
    can be deployed within a differentiated services network even if end-to-end ECN
    support is unavailable, allowing a quick migration path.</p>"
