abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).
    HIP allows consenting hosts to securely establish and maintain shared IP-layer
    state, allowing separation of the identifier and locator roles of IP addresses,
    thereby enabling continuity of communications across IP address changes. HIP is
    based on a Sigma- compliant Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using public key identifiers
    from a new Host Identity namespace for mutual peer authentication. The protocol
    is designed to be resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MitM)
    attacks. When used together with another suitable security protocol, such as the
    Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP), it provides integrity protection and optional
    encryption for upper-layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP. This document obsoletes
    RFC 5201 and addresses the concerns raised by the IESG, particularly that of crypto
    agility. It also incorporates lessons learned from the implementations of RFC
    5201.</p>"
