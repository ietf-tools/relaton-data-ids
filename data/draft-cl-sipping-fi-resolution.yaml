abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet applications have been enhanced with many features. A feature
    may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, having a self-contained
    role. However, the introduction and modification of features may result in undesired
    behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction - FI for short. This
    document specifies the architecture of a distributed feature mana- ger that proposes
    the resolution of feature interactions. The resolu- tion may be done locally,
    or with cooperation between different nodes. The resolution method is left to
    the implementation. In this document we provide an example of one resolution method,
    based on feature interdiction, as described by a set of deontic formulas.</p>"
