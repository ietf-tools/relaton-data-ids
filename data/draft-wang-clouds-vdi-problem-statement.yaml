abstract:
- content: "<p>The Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is a technology to separate local
    desktop and remote computing and storage resources, which was initially derived
    from the remote desktop administration but with new business models and very different
    use cases. Most of existing VDI systems are based on proprietary implementation,
    and positioning different market with different features. Since virtual desktop
    technology is believed that it will become a mainstream application delivery method
    similar to the http protocol with regard to web applications, so it's important
    to make the virtual desktop access protocol open and standard. This draft summarizes
    the limitations of existing virtual desktop systems, and proposes the intent standardization
    work in IETF.</p>"
