abstract:
- content: "<p>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 supports a mobile node to perform inter- technology
    handover as well as multihoming. However the inter- technology handover requires
    the new interface to use the same network prefix with the old one and all the
    IP address/prefix at the old interface are removed. These requirements disable
    multihoming function which requires different network prefixes for different interfaces.
    In this Internet draft we address this problem and suggest the necessary changes
    in PMIPv6 operations to support a mobile node to perform multihoming as well as
    seamless inter technology handover with virtual interface.</p>"
