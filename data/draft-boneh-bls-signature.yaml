abstract:
- content: "<p>The BLS signature scheme was introduced by Boneh-Lynn-Shacham in 2001.
    The signature scheme relies on pairing-friendly curves and supports non-interactive
    aggregation properties. That is, given a collection of signatures (sigma_1,...,
    sigma_n), anyone can produce a short signature (sigma) that authenticates the
    entire collection. BLS signature scheme is simple, efficient and can be used in
    a variety of network protocols and systems to compress signatures or certificate
    chains. This document specifies the BLS signature and the aggregation algorithms.</p>"
