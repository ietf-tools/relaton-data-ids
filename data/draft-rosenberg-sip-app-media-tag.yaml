abstract:
- content: "<p>The caller preferences specification for the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) allows a caller to express preferences that the call be routed to a User
    Agent (UA) with particular capabilities. Similarly, a specification exists to
    allow a UA to indicate its capabilities in a registration. Amongst those capabilities
    are the type of media streams the agent supports, described as top-level MIME
    types. The 'application' MIME type is used to describe a broad range of stream
    types, and it provides insufficient granularity as a capability. This specification
    allows a UA to indicate which application subtypes the agent supports. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
