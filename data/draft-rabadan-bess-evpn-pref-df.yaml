abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC7432 defines the Designated Forwarder (DF) in (PBB-)EVPN networks
    as the PE responsible for sending broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic
    (BUM) to a multi-homed device/network in the case of an all-active multi-homing
    ES, or BUM and unicast in the case of single-active multi-homing. The DF is selected
    out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the Ethernet Segment Identifier
    (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to the 'service-carving' algorithm. While
    'service-carving' provides an efficient and automated way of selecting the DF
    across different EVIs or ISIDs in the ES, there are some use-cases where a more
    'deterministic' and user-controlled method is required. At the same time, Service
    Providers require an easy way to force an on-demand DF switchover in order to
    carry out some maintenance tasks on the existing DF or control whether a new active
    PE can preempt the existing DF PE. This document proposes an extension to the
    current RFC7432 DF election procedures so that the above requirements can be met.</p>"
