abstract:
- content: "<p>draft-rswg-rfc7990-updates, the successor to RFC 7990, defines the
    definitive version of an RFC as a published RFC with is in RFCXML. It defines
    publication versions of the RFC as published RFCs in the publication formats such
    as PDF, plain text, and HTML. draft-rswg- xml2rfcv3-implemented is updating the
    specification for the RFCXML format. This document updates some of the publication
    formats, specifically updating RFC 7992, RFC 7994, RFC 7995, and RFC 8153. Because
    RFC 7990 mentions some of the features of the publication formats, this document
    also updates RFC 7990. There is a repository for this draft at https://github.com/paulehoffman/pub-format-updates
    (https://github.com/paulehoffman/pub-format-updates).</p>"
