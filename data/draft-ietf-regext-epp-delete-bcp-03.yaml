abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) includes commands for clients
    to delete domain and host objects, both of which are used to publish information
    in the Domain Name System (DNS). EPP also includes guidance for deletions that
    is intended to avoid DNS resolution disruptions and maintain data consistency.
    However, operational relationships between objects can make that guidance difficult
    to implement. Some EPP clients have developed operational practices to delete
    those objects that have unintended impacts on DNS resolution and security. This
    document describes best practices to delete domain and host objects that reduce
    the risk of DNS resolution failure and maintain client-server data consistency.</p>"
