abstract:
- content: "<p>There are requirements for the support of networks ccomprising LSRs
    with different data plane switching layers controlled by a single Generalized
    Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane instance, referred to as
    GMPLS Multi-Layer Networks/Multi-Region Networks (MLN/MRN). This document defines
    extensions to GMPLS routing and signaling protocols so as to support the operation
    of GMPLS Multi-Layer/Multi-Region Networks.</p>"
