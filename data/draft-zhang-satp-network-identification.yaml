abstract:
- content: "<p>There is currently a lack of a standard network identification or numbering
    for digital asset networks. This deficiency makes it difficult for the transfer
    of digital assets from one network to another, due among others, to the possibility
    in the collision in the numbering of the remote networks. This document proposes
    a globally unique 32-byte identifier for each asset network based on some unique
    inherent characteristics of each network.</p>"
