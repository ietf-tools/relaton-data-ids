abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an enhanced mechanism for Link Management Protocolâ€™s
    Link Verification procedure that is independent of the data encoding type. It
    can be used for any point-to-point link, including both Optical Links and SONET/SDH
    Links. The general proposal is to use the transmission of light by the sender
    and recognition of the presence or absence of light by the receiver to identify
    port mapping. The proposal includes minor extensions to the existing messages
    to implement this extension to the link verification procedure.</p>"
