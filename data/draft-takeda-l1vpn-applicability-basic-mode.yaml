abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an applicability statement on the use of Generalized
    Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to support Basic
    Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). L1VPNs provide customer services
    and connectivity at layer 1 over layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is
    divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode where the Basic Mode of operation
    does not feature any exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network
    and the customer domain. This document examines how GMPLS protocols can be used
    to satisfy the requirements of a Basic Mode L1VPN.</p>"
