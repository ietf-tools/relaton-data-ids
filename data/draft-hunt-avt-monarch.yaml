abstract:
- content: <p>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP
    XR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media transmission or
    reception quality, as proposed in draft-ietf-avt-rtcp-guidelines (work in progress
    [replace with RFC number]). This memo suggests that a new block should contain
    a single metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of
    interest or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt
    to provide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application.
    Applications may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their
    set of concerns. Where possible, a specific block should be designed to be re-usable
    across more than one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio
    and video.</p>
