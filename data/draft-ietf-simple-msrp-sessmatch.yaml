abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an MSRP extension, Connection Establishment for
    Media Anchoring (CEMA). Support of the extension is optional. MSRP endpoints can
    implement the extension in order to allow MSRP communication in networks where
    Middleboxes anchor the MSRP connection, without the need for the Middleboxes to
    enable MSRP B2BUA functionality in most cases. The document also defines a Session
    Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute, a=msrp-cema, that can be used
    by MSRP endpoints to indicate support of the CEMA extension.</p>"
