abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for establishing trust across a
    multihop federation within the Application Bridging for Federation Beyond the
    Web (ABFAB) framework. This document introduces a new entity, the Trust Router.
    Trust Routers exchange information about the availability of Trust Paths across
    a multihop federation. They can be queried by a Relying Party to obtain the best
    Trust Path to reach an Identity Provider. They also provide temporary identities
    that can be used by a Relying Party to traverse a Trust Path.</p>"
