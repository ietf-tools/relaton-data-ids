abstract:
- content: "<p>Scheduling schemes play a key role in the performance of multipath
    transport protocols. A path-aware scheduling scheme for latency- sensitive applications
    is proposed, which always schedules data in the path with the lowest One-Way Latency
    (OWL). The OWLs of all paths are obtained by employing the redundant transmission
    periodically.</p>"
