abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host Identity Protocol implements the identifier locator separation
    by introduing a new name space and a new layer to the IP stack. The new structure
    insulates the transport layer protocols from the internetworking layer, thereby
    allowing transport sessions to remain unaffected even if the underlying IP addresses
    change. That, in turn, seems to make it easier to solve the so called site multi-homing
    problem than without introducing such an indirection layer. This document discusses
    how the proposed HIP mobility and multi-homing solution, described separately,
    would fit to the IETF multi6 working group requirements.</p>"
