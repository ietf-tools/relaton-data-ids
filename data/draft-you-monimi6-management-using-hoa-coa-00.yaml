abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes a simple method that multiple HoAs obtained by
    each of heterogeneous interfaces should be registered to home agents as like CoAs
    to support benefits of multihoming, such as ubiquitous accessibility, redundancy,
    and inter interface handover. However, a protocol for using HoA as CoA was already
    referred by [ID.Multi_PB]. In this draft, we should extend situation that HoAs
    are used as like CoAs, and modify registration protocol for multiple CoAs [ID.MCoA]
    [ID.MMI] to support reliable and robust network connectivity.</p>"
