abstract:
- content: "<p>The IPv6 address range of 0::/64 is reserved for loopback addresses.
    This expands from the single loophack address already defined for IPv6, ::1, to
    allow for a set of addresses to be used when packets are intended to stay within
    a host system. Multiple loopback addresses allow for simultaneous varied uses
    of the loopback addresses as has proven, albeit in limited ways, in IPv4. And
    exception is made to accomodate the ::0/128, already defined as The Unspecified
    Address.</p>"
