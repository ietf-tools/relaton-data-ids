abstract:
- content: "<p>HTTP 1.1 [2] defines 20 status codes: 100-101, 200-206, 300-305, 400-415,
    and 500-505. The WebDAV RFC [3] adds six more: 102, 207, 422, 423, 424 and 507.
    However, WebDAV implementers have found this to be insufficient. The space of
    status codes available is limited, but even if it were not, additional information
    would often be very helpful. WebDAV clients frequently need to be able to present
    distinct options and helpful information to users, and sometimes cients might
    even be able to deal with errors automatically.</p>"
