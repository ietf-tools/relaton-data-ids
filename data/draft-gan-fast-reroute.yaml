abstract:
- content: "<p>In this document, we introduce a method to establish backup LSP tunnels
    in large-scale networks. Two additional RSVP objects are proposed. These objects
    together make possible for routers using RSVP to create detours that can route
    around downstream links and nodes. As a result, an LSP can quickly and automatically
    repair itself, while redirecting the user traffic to the pre-computed and pre-
    established detour routes in event of network link and node failures. Packet loss
    is therefore minimized.</p>"
