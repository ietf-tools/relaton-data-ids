abstract:
- content: "<p>The current HTTP/1.1 (RFC2068) specification introduces a new Warning
    header, meant to carry status information about a request that cannot or should
    not be carried by the response status code. The existing specification for the
    interaction between Warning and HTTP caches is faulty, in that it may allow incorrect
    results after cache validation operations. This document identifies two separate
    (but related) problems, and proposes revisions of the HTTP/1.1 specification to
    solve these problems.</p>"
