abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO), which
    obsoletes the TCP MD5 Signature option of RFC 2385 (TCP MD5). TCP-AO specifies
    the use of stronger Message Authentication Codes (MACs), protects against replays
    even for long-lived TCP connections, and provides more details on the association
    of security with TCP connections than TCP MD5. TCP-AO is compatible with either
    a static Master Key Tuple (MKT) configuration or an external, out-of-band MKT
    management mechanism; in either case, TCP-AO also protects connections when using
    the same MKT across repeated instances of a connection, using traffic keys derived
    from the MKT, and coordinates MKT changes between endpoints. The result is intended
    to support current infrastructure uses of TCP MD5, such as to protect long-lived
    connections (as used, e.g., in BGP and LDP), and to support a larger set of MACs
    with minimal other system and operational changes. TCP-AO uses a different option
    identifier than TCP MD5, even though TCP-AO and TCP MD5 are never permitted to
    be used simultaneously. TCP-AO supports IPv6, and is fully compatible with the
    proposed requirements for the replacement of TCP MD5. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
