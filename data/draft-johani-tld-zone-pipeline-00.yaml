abstract:
- content: '<p>Today most TLD registries publish DNSSEC signed zones. The sequence
    of steps from generating the unsigned zone, via DNSSEC signing and various types
    of verification is referred to as the "zone pipeline". The robustness and correctness
    of the zone pipeline is of crucial importance and the zone pipeline is one of
    the most critical parts of the operations of a TLD registry. After a serious incident
    in 2022, the.SE Registry decided to re- evaluate the requirements on the zone
    pipeline. This has led to several new design choices and a decision to create
    a more robust implementation from scratch. The goal of this document is to describe
    the requirements that the.SE Registry choose in preparation for the implementation
    of the new zone pipeline. The document also describes some of the design consequences
    that follow from the requirements. Hence this document is intended to work as
    a guide for understanding the actual implementation, which is planned to be released
    as open source. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github
    at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline).
    The most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all
    be available there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</p>'
