abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a protocol whereby a user can acquire cryptographic
    credentials (e.g., private keys, PKCS #15 structures) from a credential server,
    using a workstation that has locally trusted software installed, but with no user-specific
    configuration. The protocol's payloads are described in XML. This memo also specifies
    a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) profile of the protocol. Security
    requirements are met by mandating support for TLS and/or DIGEST-MD5 (through BEEP).
