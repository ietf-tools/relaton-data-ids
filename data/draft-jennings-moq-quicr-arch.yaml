abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification outlines the design for a media delivery protocol
    over QUIC. It aims at supporting multiple application classes with varying latency
    requirements including ultra low latency applications such as interactive communication
    and gaming. It is based on a publish/subscribe metaphor where entities publish
    and subscribe to data that is sent through, and received from, relays in the cloud.
    The information subscribed to is named such that this forms an overlay information
    centric network. The relays allow for efficient large scale deployments.</p>"
