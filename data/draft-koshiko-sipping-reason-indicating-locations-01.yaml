abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to indicate the location of the SIP element
    which issued a certain SIP message. This capability enables many enhanced services
    by providing the information as to how and why a SIP message arrives at a specific
    application, user, or proxy server. This draft defines new reason-params for the
    protocol field of the Reason header field in RFC3326 [1].</p>"
