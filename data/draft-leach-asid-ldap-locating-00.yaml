abstract:
- content: "<p>The LDAPv3 protocol (as specified in [1]) is designed to be a lightweight
    access protocol for directory services supporting X.500 models. This may be the
    X.500 directory itself, but the LDAP specification explicitly allows it to be
    a different directory. Let us define a 'native LDAP server' to be one that is
    not a front end to the X.500 directory service. Let us further define an 'Internet
    based organization' as one that has a domain name, and an 'Internet LDAP server'
    to be one containing a directory entries for such an organization. A native LDAP
    server can not rely upon the X.500 directory's knowledge base to locate the appropriate
    server to service a request on an object in a part of the directory tree (DIT)
    other than the naming context(s) it stores. This draft defines a way that native
    Internet LDAP servers can make use of the DNS's knowledge base (which it stores
    as 'glue' records) to perform the same function, while still supporting integration
    with the X.500 directory.</p>"
