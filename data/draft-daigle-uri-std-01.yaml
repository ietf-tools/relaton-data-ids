abstract:
- content: "<p>The pieces of the specification of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs),
    and subsets thereof, span several documents which have evolved independently over
    time. This memo provides the definitive overview of the (currently) relevant documentation.
    As such, it acts as a definition of the core standard for URIs, incorporating
    existing standards documents by reference.</p>"
