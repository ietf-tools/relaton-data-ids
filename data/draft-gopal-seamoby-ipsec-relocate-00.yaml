abstract:
- content: "<p>Seamless offering of security to a Mobile Node (MN) during handovers
    is crucial for enabling a variety of application services in the Mobile Internet.
    Handovers also imply that a terminal such as a MN may perform network access authentication
    in order to obtain connectivity and access to network features such as QoS, header
    compression etc. Security context associated with several Security Associations
    (SA) may need to be transferred in order to achieve this. This enables the MN
    to regain authenticated connectivity and establish new SAs without having to reinitiate
    time-consuming operations.</p>"
