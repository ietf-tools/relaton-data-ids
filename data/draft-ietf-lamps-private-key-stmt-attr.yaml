abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an attribute for a statement of possession
    of a private key by a certificate subject. As part of X.509 certificate enrollment,
    a Certification Authority (CA) typically demands proof that the subject possesses
    the private key that corresponds to the to-be-certified public key. In some cases,
    a CA might accept a signed statement from the certificate subject. For example,
    when a certificate subject needs separate certificates for signature and key establishment,
    a statement that can be validated with the previously issued signature certificate
    for the same subject might be adequate for subsequent issuance of the key establishment
    certificate.</p>"
