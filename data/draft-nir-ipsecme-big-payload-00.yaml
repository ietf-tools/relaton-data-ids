abstract:
- content: "<p>The messages of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol
    are made up of payloads. The current protocol limits each of these payloads to
    64KB by having a 2-byte length field. While this is usually enough, several of
    the payloads may need to be larger. This document defines an extension to IKEv2
    that allows larger payloads.</p>"
