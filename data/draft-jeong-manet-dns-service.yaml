abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an architecture of DNS service system for mobile
    ad hoc network which might be connected to the Internet. The resolution of DNS
    names of mobile nodes within mobile ad hoc network is performed by multicast DNS
    and that of DNS names of nodes in the Internet is performed through DNS autoconfiguration
    of recursive DNS server. In the former, each mobile node plays a role of DNS name
    server for the DNS resource records associated with DNS name of which authority
    it has. The latter allows mobile node to receive the global Internet service,
    such as web service, by providing global DNS resolution in mobile ad hoc network
    connected to the Internet. These two kinds of DNS name resolution are processed
    automatically without the intervention of users in mobile ad hoc network. Also,
    this document specifies how to authenticate DNS message as well as how to provide
    ad hoc users with service discovery based on multicast DNS.</p>"
