abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF specifications may not receive significant review, especially
    beyond a single working group, until they are submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant
    problems with a specification often are not detected until a problematic approach
    has been adopted and considerable effort has been spent developing and documenting
    this approach. Major changes to address problems identified late in the process
    take considerable effort and significantly delay a document that its authors believed
    to be ready for publication. The procedure described in this document is intended
    to solve, or palliate, a number of related problems that have been observed in
    the IETF process. The basic model is to create a team of Senior IETF Reviewers
    (SIRS), and have all documents receive a certain number of reviews by SIRs, prior
    to being submitted for publication. Review by SIRs at a very early stage is strongly
    encouraged.</p>"
