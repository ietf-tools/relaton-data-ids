abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to Generalized
    MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS traffic engineered (TE) control
    plane to a GMPLS control plane. An appropriate migration strategy can be selected
    based on various factors including the service provider's network deployment plan,
    customer demand, available network equipment implementation, operational policy,
    etc. In the course of migration, several interworking cases may exist where MPLS
    and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. During the migration process, standard
    interworking functions are needed to allow graceful deployment of GMPLS technologies
    while keeping existing IP/MPLS networks unaffected. Since GMPLS signaling and
    routing protocols are different from the MPLS control protocols, in order for
    MPLS and GMPLS to interwork, we need mechanisms to compensate for the differences
    between MPLS and GMPLS. This document provides a landscape of techniques, practices
    and an overview of interworking between MPLS and GMPLS in support of IP/MPLS to
    GMPLS migration, which is also beneficial for graceful deployment of GMPLS technologies
    into existing IP/MPLS networks. We discuss issues, models, migration scenarios,
    operation, and requirements.</p>"
