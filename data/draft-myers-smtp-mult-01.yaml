abstract:
- content: "<p>SMTP [SMTP] [HOST-REQ] and its service extensions [ESMTP] provide a
    mechanism for transferring mail reliably and efficiently. The design of the SMTP
    protocol effectively requires the receiver-SMTP to manage a mail delivery queue.
    In some limited circumstances, outside the area of mail exchange between independent
    hosts on public networks, it is desirable to implement a system where a mail receiver
    does not manage a queue. This document describes an extension command which modifies
    the SMTP protocol to accommodate this situation. This extension is one which should
    be used only by specific prior arrangement and configuration. Its use by a sender-SMTP
    should not be triggered by availability, therefore the extension is not given
    an ESMTP EHLO keyword.</p>"
