abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an experiment in which two new IPv6 Routing
    headers are implemented and deployed. Collectively, they are called the Compact
    Routing Headers (CRH). Individually, they are called CRH-16 and CRH-32. One purpose
    of this experiment is to demonstrate that the CRH can be implemented and deployed
    in a production network. Another purpose is to demonstrate that the security considerations,
    described in this document, can be addressed with access control lists. Finally,
    this document encourages replication of the experiment.</p>"
