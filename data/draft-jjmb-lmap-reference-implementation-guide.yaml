abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a software architecture and reference implementation
    guidelines for the framework for Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance
    (LMAP). The IETF-LMAP working group proposed a draft that details a logical architecture
    for performance measurements in broadband networks on a large scale. The IETF-LMAP
    proposal contains the operational concepts for such a platform. However, since
    the standardization is in the initial stages with no official existing implementation,
    the proposal leaves many details of the specification up to the implementer to
    discover.</p>"
