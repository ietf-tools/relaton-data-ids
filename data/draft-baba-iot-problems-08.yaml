abstract:
- content: <p>This document contains opinions gathered from enterprises engaging in
    the IoT business as stated in the preceding version hereof, and also examines
    the possibilities of new social problems in the IoT era. Recognition of the importance
    of information security has grown in step with the rising use of the Internet.
    Closer examination reveals that the IoT era may see a new direct physical threat
    to users. For instance, the situation at a smart house may lead it to judge that
    the owner has only temporarily stepped out, causing it to unlock the front door,
    which in turn makes it easier for thieves to enter. These kinds of scenarios may
    occur without identity fraud, hacking, and other means of compromising information
    security. Therefore, for the purpose of this document, this issue shall be referred
    to as "IoT Safety" to distinguish it from Information Security. We believe that
    it is necessary to deepen our understanding of these new IoT-related threats through
    discussion and ensure there are measures to address these threats in the future.
    At the same time, we must also coordinate these measures with the solutions to
    the problems described in the previous version of this document.</p>
