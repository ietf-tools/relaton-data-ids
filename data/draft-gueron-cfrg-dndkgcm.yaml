abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an authenticated encryption algorithm called
    Double Nonce Derive Key AES-GCM (DNDK-GCM) that operates with a 32- byte root
    key and encrypts with a 24-byte random nonce, and optionally provides for key
    commitment. Encryption takes the root key and a random nonce, derives a fresh
    encryption key and a key commitment value, invokes AES-GCM with the derived key
    and a 12-byte zero nonce, and outputs the ciphertext, authentication tag and the
    key commitment value. The low collision probability with 24-byte random nonces
    extends the lifetime of the root key and this supports processing up to 2^64 bytes
    under one root key. DNDK-GCM involves a small overhead compared to using AES-GCM
    directly, and its security relies only on the standard assumption on AES as a
    pseudorandom permutation.</p>"
