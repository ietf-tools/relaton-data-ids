abstract:
- content: "<p>With the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication protocol
    (TESLA) a protocol for providing source authentication in multicast scenarios
    was introduced. A mapping for TESLA to the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
    (SRTP) has been published which assumes that some TESLA parameters are made available
    by out-of-band mechanisms. This document describes payloads for bootstrapping
    these parameters with the help of the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) protocol.</p>"
