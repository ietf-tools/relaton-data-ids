abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism that builds on Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and enables peers to
    provide a proof of ownership of an identity, such as an X.509 certificate. This
    proof can be exported by one peer, transmitted out-of-band to the other peer,
    and verified by the receiving peer.</p>"
