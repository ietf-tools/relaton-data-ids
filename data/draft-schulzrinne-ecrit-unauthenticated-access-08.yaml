abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the calling device
    has acquired rights to use the access network or that no authentication is required
    for the access network, such as for public wireless access points. Subsequent
    protocol interactions, such as obtaining location information, learning the address
    of the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself are
    largely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures. In some cases,
    the device does not have credentials for network access, does not have a VoIP
    provider or application service provider (ASP), or the credentials have become
    invalid, e.g., because the user has exhausted their prepaid balance or the account
    has expired. This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminology
    and describes an extension for the base IETF emergency services architecture to
    address these scenarios.</p>"
