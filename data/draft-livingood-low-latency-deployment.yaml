abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized experimental
    RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and new Non-Queue-Building
    (NQB) per hop behavior. These documents do a good job of describing a new architecture
    and protocol for deploying low latency networking. But as is normal for many such
    standards, especially those in experimental status, certain deployment decisions
    are ultimately left to implementers. This document explores the potential implications
    of key deployment decisions and makes recommendations for those decisions that
    may help drive adoption.</p>"
