abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures that enhance OSPF Traffic Engineering
    (TE) extensions for advertising a router's local addresses. This is needed to
    enable other routers in a network to compute traffic engineered MPLS LSPs to a
    given router's local addresses. Currently, the only addresses belonging to a router
    that are advertised in TE LSAs are the router's local addresses on links enabled
    for TE, and the Router ID.</p>"
