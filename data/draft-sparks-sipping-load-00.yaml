abstract:
- content: "<p>As deployments of services based on the Session Initiation Protocol
    increase in scope, managing load across the systems providing their services becomes
    increasingly important. This document looks at generic load management requirements
    and the tools to address them currently available in the protocol. Potential new
    tools to better meet the requirements are proposed.</p>"
