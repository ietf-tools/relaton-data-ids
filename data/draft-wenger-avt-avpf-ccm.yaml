abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a few extensions to the messages defined in
    the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF). They are helpful primarily in conversational
    multimedia scenarios where centralized multipoint functionalities are in use.
    However some are also usable in smaller multicast environments and point-to-point
    calls. The extensions discussed are Full Intra Request, Temporary Maximum Media
    Bit-rate and Temporal Spatial Trade-off.</p>"
