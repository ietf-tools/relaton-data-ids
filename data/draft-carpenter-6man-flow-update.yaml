abstract:
- content: "<p>Various published proposals for use of the IPv6 flow label are incompatible
    with its existing specification in RFC 3697. Furthermore, very little practical
    use is made of the flow label, partly due to some uncertainties about the correct
    interpretation of the specification. This document proposes changes to the specification
    in order to clarify it, making it clear what types of usage are possible, and
    to introduce some additional flexibility.</p>"
