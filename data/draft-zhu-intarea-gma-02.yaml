abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication
    networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures
    like WiFi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. In such scenario, it is desirable to combine multiple
    access networks to improve quality of experience. For example, an IP flow may
    be delivered over both LTE and Wi-Fi network for higher end-to-end throughput.
    In another example, lost packets may be retransmitted when the device switches
    from Wi-Fi to LTE. However, such multi- access optimization requires inserting
    additional control information, e.g. Sequence Number, into each IP packet. Unfortunately,
    there is no existing IP protocol for such purpose. As a result, IP-over-IP tunneling
    has been used in today's solutions, e.g. [LWIPEP] [GRE], to insert the GRE header,
    and then encode additional control information in the GRE header fields, e.g.
    Key, Sequence Number. However, there are two main drawbacks with this approach:
    1) IP-over-IP tunneling leads to higher overhead especially for small packet.
    For example, the overhead of IP-over- IP/GRE tunneling with both Key and Sequence
    Number is 32 Bytes, which is 80% of a 40 Bytes TCP ACK packet; 2) It is difficult
    to introduce new control fields using the existing GRE header format. This document
    presents a new light-weight and flexible encapsulation protocol to support multi-access
    solutions [ATSSS] [MAMS] [LWIPEP] without IP-over-IP tunneling.</p>"
