abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new per-hop behavior (PHB) for Differentiated
    Services, the so-called 'Expedited Forwarding with Dropping' PHB. Packets marked
    for this PHB are forwarded with the same low-delay, low-jitter characteristics
    as packets marked with the Expedited Forwarding PHB, but may experience a certain
    probability of packet loss. This PHB is especially suited to provide low-delay
    services in cellular wireless networks</p>"
