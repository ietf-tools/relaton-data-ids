abstract:
- content: <p>CAA "security" tags are a type of CAA record (defined in RFC 6844) with
    the critical flag set that specify that for a certificate to be issued, the issuance
    process must be conducted in a manner that is robust against global man-in-the-middle
    adversaries by leveraging authenticated communication between a CA and a domain.
    Cryptographic domain validation procedures are authenticated and resilient against
    attacks by both on-path and off-path network attackers which may be between the
    CA and the domain contained in the certificate. This document defines the syntax
    of "security" CAA records as well as acceptable means for validating domains in
    a cryptographic manner.</p>
