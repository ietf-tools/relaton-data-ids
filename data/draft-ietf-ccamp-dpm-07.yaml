abstract:
- content: "<p>When setting up a label switched path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS and
    MPLS/TE networks, the completion of the signaling process does not necessarily
    mean that the cross connection along the LSP have been programmed accordingly
    and in a timely manner. Meanwhile, the completion of signaling process may be
    used by applications as indication that data path has become usable. The existence
    of the inconsistency between the signaling messages and cross connection programing,
    and the possible failure of cross connection programming, if not properly treated,
    will result in data loss or even application failure. Characterization of this
    performance can thus help designers to improve the application model and to build
    more robust applications. This document defines a series of performance metrics
    to evaluate the connectivity of data path in the signaling process.</p>"
