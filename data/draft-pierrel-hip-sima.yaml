abstract:
- content: "<p>A Host Identity Protocol supporting host is able to use multiple interfaces
    simultaneously when it implements the Mobility and Multihoming HIP extensions.
    The protocol defines currently simultaneous usage via multiple interfaces only
    towards different peer hosts. Simultaneously using multiple interfaces towards
    one peer node was not defined due to e.g. potential problems with upper layer
    congestion control algorithms. The limitation of that protocol is that it allows
    only one interface to be used at a time between the multi-homed host and the peer
    host. There is no mechanism to separate the flows between two hosts and to allow
    them to use different interfaces independent from each other. This memo presents
    a method where two HIP hosts, of which at least one is multi-homed, can separate
    different upper layer data flows such as TCP and UDP between the hosts and allow
    them to use different interfaces at the multi-homed host.</p>"
