abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a set of supplementary tests for networking interconnection
    devices (switches) that can be used to evaluate and compare their performance
    when used with streaming media. The Media Delivery Index (MDI) [i3] measurement
    is employed as a convenient stream quality indicator of input and output streams
    to indicate cumulative stream jitter and packet loss under test load conditions.
    Typical operating profiles are defined to focus test efforts on common switch
    applications for unidirectional streaming media to reduce the amount of testing
    required and to encourage device and system evaluation in advance of deployment
    through use of a set of reference tests. The supplementary tests defined in this
    memo are intended for Information only.</p>"
