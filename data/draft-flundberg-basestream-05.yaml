abstract:
- content: "<p>BaseStream is a simple binary stream format that serves as a common
    base for binary formats like XML provides a base for text formats. The binary
    format consists of typed and possibly named data elements. An instance of the
    BaseStream format has a corresponding XML representation that makes it possible
    to use existing XML tools to view, edit, validate, and transform BaseStream data.</p>"
