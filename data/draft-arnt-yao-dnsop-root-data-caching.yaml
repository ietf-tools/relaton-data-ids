abstract:
- content: "<p>Some DNS recursive resolvers have long round trip times to the nearest
    DSN root server, which has been an obstacle to DNS query performance. In order
    to decrease root record fetch time without introducing a new source of errors,
    this document proposes a root- specific modification to the caching rules.</p>"
