abstract:
- content: "<p>Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like Squid support
    event logging using a common log format. The logs produced using these de-facto
    standard formats are invaluable to system administrators for trouble-shooting
    a server and tool writers to craft tools that mine the log files and produce reports
    and trends. Furthermore, these log files can also be used to train anomaly detection
    systems and feed events into a security event management system. The Session Initiation
    Protocol does not have a common log format, and as a result, each server supports
    a distinct log format that makes it unnecessarily complex to produce tools to
    do trend analysis and security detection. We propose a common log file format
    for SIP servers that can be used uniformly for proxies, registrars, redirect servers
    as well as back-to-back user agents.</p>"
