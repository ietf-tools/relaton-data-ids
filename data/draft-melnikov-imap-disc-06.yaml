abstract:
- content: '<p>This document attempts to address some of the issues involved in building
    a disconnected IMAP4 client. In particular, it deals with the issues of what might
    be called the "driver" portion of the synchronization tool: the portion of the
    code responsible for issuing the correct set of IMAP4 commands to synchronize
    the disconnected client in the way that is most likely to make the human who uses
    the disconnected client happy. This note describes different strategies that can
    be used by disconnected clients and shows how to use IMAP protocol in order to
    minimize the time of the synchronization process. This note also lists IMAP extensions
    that a server should implement in order to provide better synchronization facilities
    to disconnected clients. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>'
