abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes extensions to the format of electronic mail
    messages and a public-key infrastructure to permit verification of the source
    of messages by either mail transport agents (MTAs) or mail user agents (MUAs).
    This may be used to implement a policy which, for example, favors the delivery
    of identified messages over messages lacking signatures or having incorrect signatures.
    Mechanisms by which signing of messages and verification of signatures can be
    performed by trusted MTAs, in order to minimize impact on end users, are also
    presented.</p>"
