abstract:
- content: "<p>BGP [RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability between
    domains and between the edges of a domain. To support IPv6 reachability, BGP relies
    heavily on its Multiprotocol Extensions as defined in [RFC2545], which is crucial
    for enabling BGP-4 to advertise IPv6 routes alongside IPv4. This extension not
    only permits the exchange of IPv6 routing information but also establishes the
    structure for IPv6 next hop handling within BGP updates. As such, BGP assumes
    the next hop towards any reachable destination may not reside on the advertising
    speaker, but rather may either be through a router connected to the same subnet
    as the speaker, or through a router only reachable by traversing multiple hops
    through the network. [RFC2545] introduced the ability to advertise a global IPv6
    address as the BGP next hop. When the advertising system is directly attached,
    it may include both a global and an IPv6 link-local address or only a global address,
    when next hop length is set to 16 bytes. This document updates the specification
    to clarify the encoding of the BGP next hop when the advertising system is directly
    attached and only an IPv6 link-local address is available. This clarification
    applies specifically to IPv6 link-local addresses and does not pertain to IPv4
    link-local addresses as defined in [RFC3927].</p>"
