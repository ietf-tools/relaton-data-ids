abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for new functionality to be added
    to the IETF Datatracker tool to make it possible for Working Group (WG) Chairs
    and their Delegates to input and update the status of the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds)
    associated with their WGs. After these requirements are implemented, WG Chairs
    will be able to use the Datatracker to provide everyone with more information
    about the status and progression of WG I-Ds than is currently possible. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
