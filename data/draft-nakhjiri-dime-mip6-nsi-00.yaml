abstract:
- content: "<p>Dime working group is designing a procedure for bootstrapping Mobile
    IPv6 using Diameter. In order to reduce the complexity of Diameter Mobile IPv6
    application, the process of Mobile IPv6 service authorization is being separated
    from the initial mobile node authentication. This This allows for outsourcing
    the authentication process to another application such as Diameter EAP[RFC4072].
    The process can have security considerations, if the authorizing server does not
    have a clear assurance that the MN has actually been authenticated before, especially
    if the authorizing server is different from the authenticating server. In this
    document we provide a procedure and number of extensions to Mobile IPv6 and Diameter
    signaling to address those considerations. Specifically a new Network Service
    Identifier (NSI) is defined to assist the interaction between the authorizing
    and authenticating procedures and servers.</p>"
