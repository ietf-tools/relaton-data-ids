abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a secure method to configure/reconfigure a key
    for a resource constrained node when it initially joins to network that is currently
    in operation. The method is suited for a scenario, where resource constrained
    nodes are interconnected with each other and thus form a network called Internet
    of Things. It is assumed that communications for all nodes are based on TCP/IP
    protocols and the nodes use the constrained application protocol (CoAP). The presented
    method does not cover all operations of secure bootstrapping for IoT networks,
    but it is intended to securely support self-reconfiguration of the pre-installed
    temporary key of joined node.</p>"
