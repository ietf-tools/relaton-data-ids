abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes some of the open problems in Internet congestion
    control that are known today. This includes several new challenges that are becoming
    important as the network grows, as well as some issues that have been known for
    many years. These challenges are generally considered to be open research topics
    that may require more study or application of innovative techniques before Internet-scale
    solutions can be confidently engineered and deployed. This document is not an
    Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
