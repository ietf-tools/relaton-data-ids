abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo was written to make application developers and network operators
    aware of the significant possibility that IPv6 packets containing fragmentation
    extension headers may fail to reach their destination. Some protocol or application
    assumptions about the ability to use messages larger than a single packet may
    accordingly not be supportable in all networks or circumstances. This memo provides
    observational evidence for the dropping of IPv6 fragments along a significant
    number of paths, explores the operational impact of fragmentation and the reasons
    and scenarios where drops occur, and considers the effect of fragment drops on
    applications where fragmentation is known to occur, particularly including DNS.</p>"
