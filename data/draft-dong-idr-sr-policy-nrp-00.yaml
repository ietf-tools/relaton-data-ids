abstract:
- content: "<p>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting
    of one or more segment lists and the associated information. The header of a packet
    steered in an SR Policy is augmented with an ordered list of segments associated
    with that SR Policy. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a set of network resources
    allocated in the network which can be used to instantiate a virtual transport
    network (VTN) for one or a group service traffic. In scenarios where multiple
    Network Resource Partitions (NRPs) exist in the network, the NRP in which an SR
    policy is instantiated may also need to be specified, so that the header of the
    packet can be augmented with the information associated with the NRP. An SR Policy
    candidate path can be distributed using BGP SR Policy. This document defines extensions
    to BGP SR policy to specify the NRP in which the SR policy is instantiated.</p>"
