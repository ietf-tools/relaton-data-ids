abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies mechanims for hosts to dynamically discover
    Network Rate-Limit Policies (NRLPs). This information is then passed to applications
    that might adjust their behaviors accordingly. Networks already support mechanisms
    to advertize a set of network properties to hosts (e.g., link MTU (RFC 4861) and
    PREFIX64 (RFC 8781)). This document complements these tools and specifies a Neighbor
    Discovery option to be used in Router Advertisements (RAs) to communicate NRLPs
    to hosts. For address family parity, a new DHCP option is also defined. The document
    also discusses how Provisioning Domains (PvD) can be used to notify hosts with
    NRLPs.</p>"
