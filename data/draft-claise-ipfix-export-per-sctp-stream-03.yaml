abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an improvement to the use of SCTP as specified
    in the IPFIX specifications in order to be able to deduce the data record loss
    per template record in case of partially-reliable SCTP export. This specification
    offers several extra advantages: immediate export of the template withdrawal message,
    immediate reuse of template ID within a stream, and the collecting process's job
    is easier.</p>"
