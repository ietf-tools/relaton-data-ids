abstract:
- content: "<p>Wireless IP-based systems will be increasingly used for building control
    systems in the future where wireless devices interconnect with each other, forming
    low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). The CoAP/6LoWPAN standards are emerging as
    the de-facto protocols in this area for resource-constrained devices. Both multicast
    and security are key needs in these networks. This draft presents a method for
    securing multicast communication in LLNs based on the DTLS security protocol which
    is already present in CoAP devices. This is achieved by using unicast DTLS-protected
    communication channel to distribute keying material and security parameters to
    group members. Group keys consisting of a Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) and a Traffic
    Authentication Key (TAK) are generated by group members based on the keying material
    received. A group member uses its DTLS record layer implementation to encrypt
    a multicast message and provide message authentication using the group keys before
    sending the message via IP multicast to the group.</p>"
