abstract:
- content: "<p>Remote industrial processes enable control &amp; operations from the
    software-defined application logic. In order to support process automation remotely,
    not only Deterministic Networks (DetNet) are needed but an interface between the
    application endpoints to the devices over a DetNet infrastructure is also required.
    This document describes an interface to deterministic networks from the view of
    end-points to support process control and operations.</p>"
