abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces the requirements and use cases for IP RAN
    (Radio Access Networks). To support the requirements, the document provides an
    architecture with centralized control plane as well as separation of control plane
    and data plane. The document also describes techniques for IP RAN network initialization
    and construction; interfacing to management plane and third party applications.
    This document can be used as a guideline for central controlled IP RAN design
    and development.</p>"
