abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an open and extensible log format to be used
    by any cloud entity or cloud application to log and trace activities that occur
    in the cloud. It is equally applicable for cloud infrastructure (IaaS), platform
    (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services. CloudLog is defferent in content, but
    not in nature from the traditional logging as it takes in account transient nature
    of identities and resources in the cloud.</p>"
