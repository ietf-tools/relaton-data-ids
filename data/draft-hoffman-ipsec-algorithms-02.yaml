abstract:
- content: "<p>The IKEv2 protocol [IKEv2] relies on security algorithms to provide
    privacy and authentication between the initiator and responder. There are many
    such algorithms available, and two IKEv2 systems cannot interoperate unless they
    are using the same algorithms. This document specifies an initial set of algorithms
    for registration with IANA, and specifies which are mandatory to implement. This
    document also specifies optional suites of algorithms and attributes that can
    be used to simplify the administration of IKEv2.</p>"
