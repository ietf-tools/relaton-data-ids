abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN) extensions
    and procedures that allow fast failover for upstream failures by allowing upstream
    Provider Edges (PEs) to determine a single forwarder for a VPN multicast flow,
    without the downstream PEs' duplication prevention. The fast failover is accomplished
    by using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798] or similar technologies
    for the upstream PEs to determine a single desinated fowarder. Also, this document
    introduces a new BGP Extended Community called "Upstream Forwarder Selection",
    carried by BGP VPN route so that the upstream PEs can inform downstream PEs the
    election behavior. The downstream PEs, accordingly, send C-multicast routes to
    both the primary and standby upstream PEs and forward the multicast flow comming
    from both sides to the CEs.</p>
