abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a proposed extension to SIP. This document
    proposes a mechansim to encrypt/hide Record-Route and Route entries in or to support
    confidentiality of SIP proxy routing information. The functionality of the Record-Route
    and Route headers are preserved. The introduction of this extension allows a set
    of trusted SIP proxies to cooperatively hide the route that SIP PDUs transit from
    untrusted proxies and user agents.</p>"
