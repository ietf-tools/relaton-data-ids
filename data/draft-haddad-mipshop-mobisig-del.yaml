abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a mechanism which delegates the exchange of mobility
    signaling messages between the mobile and correspondent nodes to the network infrastructure.
    Goals outlining the proposed delegation are to further reduce the IP handoff latency
    and to relieve the mobile node from exchanging a considerable amount of signaling
    messages with correspondent nodes while retaining full control on the critical
    ones.</p>"
