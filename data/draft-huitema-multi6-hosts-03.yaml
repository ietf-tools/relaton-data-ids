abstract:
- content: "<p>A way to solve the issue of site multihoming is to have a separate
    site prefix for each connection of the site, and to derive as many addresses for
    each hosts. This approach to multi-homing, which we call Host-Centric IPv6 Multihoming,
    has the advantage of minimal impact on the inter-domain routing fabric, since
    each site prefix can be aggregated within the larger prefix of a specific provider;
    however, it opens a number of issues, which we will discuss in this memo, including
    the problem created by the interaction between ingress filtering and multihoming,
    which we analyze in detail. We then propose a set of specific solutions that enable
    host centric multihoming, and we review how these solutions meet the requirements
    of IPv6 site multihoming.</p>"
