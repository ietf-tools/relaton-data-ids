abstract:
- content: "<p>Dynamic Tasking Control Protocol is a message-based interface by which
    an authorized client may connect to a server -- usually a network element (NE)
    or security policy enforcement point (PEP) -- and issue dynamic requests for data.
    These tasking requests contain, among other parameters, packet matching criteria
    that may apply to certain packets flowing through that network element. The primary
    intent of the tasking request is to instruct that network element to send copies
    of packets matching those criteria to a destination (usually via tunneling) for
    further inspection or other action. The protocol contains a security architecture
    to address client or server spoofing as well as replay prevention. The protocol
    assumes that multiple clients may simultaneously control a single server.</p>"
