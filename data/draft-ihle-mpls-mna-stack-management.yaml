abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework provides a general mechanism
    for the encoding and processing of network actions and their data. This document
    introduces a network action to the MPLS Network Action (MNA) framework for stack
    management operations including MOVE-N-LSE and POP-N-LSE. The MOVE-N-LSE operation
    elevates a specified number of LSEs within the stack and the POP-N-LSE operation
    removes a specified number of LSEs. The stack management operations can be used
    to facilitate various applications. As an example, a mechanism called HBH preservation
    which reduces the readable label depth (RLD) requirement in nodes is presented.</p>"
