abstract:
- content: <p>This specification clarifies "Capabilities Update" in OPEN state defined
    in RFC 3588bis. Capabilities update in OPEN state can reuse commands CER/CEA commands
    for re-negotiation between Diameter peers when one of them changes its capabilities.It
    is a very important function in Diameter. However, RFC 3588 has defined a mechanism
    of containing capabilities list both in CER and CEA commands and the peer should
    update its local database whenever it receives CER/CEA. This makes the process
    complex and redundant when they are used in OPEN state. So this draft proposes
    a simpler solution based on CER/CEA commands to deal with this problem.</p>
