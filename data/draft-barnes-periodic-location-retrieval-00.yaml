abstract:
- content: "<p>The base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol includes options
    for retrieving location information from a LIS by a Device. Some networks require
    the ability for the device to periodically request location information from the
    LIS and/or for the LIS to periodically request location information from the device.
    Extensions to base HELD allow a Device to establish a context with a LIS and negotiate
    capabilities of the Device in terms of providing location information. The measurement
    extensions to base HELD allow the LIS to request location information from a Device.
    This document provides an overview of the requirements and a solution using HELD
    and HELD extensions to support the periodic request of location information, both
    by a Device from an LIS and by the LIS from a Device, depending upon the specific
    scenario and measurement capabilities of the Device.</p>"
