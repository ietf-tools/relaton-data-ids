abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is
    chartered for source address validation within the first hop from end hosts, i.e.,
    preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address of another node in the same
    IP link. However, since SAVI requires the edge routers or switches to be upgraded,
    the deployment of SAVI will need a long time. During this transition period, some
    source address validation techniques beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be needed
    to complement SAVI and protect the networks from spoofing based attacks. In this
    document, we first propose three desired features of the SAVI-BF techniques. Then
    we analyze the problems of the current SAVI-BF technique, ingress filtering. Finally,
    we discuss the directions that we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.</p>"
