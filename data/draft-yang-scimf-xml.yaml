- content: "<p>The purpose of the Security Components Message Exchange Format (SCIMF)
    is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of security
    components, and for the management systems which may need to interact with each
    other. This Internet-Draft describes a data model to represent information exported
    by alert-make systems, and explains the rationale for using this model. An implementation
    of the data model in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is presented, an XML
    Document Type Definition is developed, and examples are provided.</p>"
