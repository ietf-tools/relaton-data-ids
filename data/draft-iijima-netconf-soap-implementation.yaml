abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes how the authors developed a SOAP (Simple Object
    Access Protocol)-based NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) client and server.
    It describes an alternative SOAP binding for NETCONF that does not interoperate
    with an RFC 4743 conformant implementation making use of cookies on top of the
    persistent transport connections of HTTP. When SOAP is used as a transport protocol
    for NETCONF, various kinds of development tools are available. By making full
    use of these tools, developers can significantly reduce their workload. The authors
    developed an NMS (Network Management System) and network equipment that can deal
    with NETCONF messages sent over SOAP. This document aims to provide NETCONF development
    guidelines gained from the experience of implementing a SOAP-based NETCONF client
    and server. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
