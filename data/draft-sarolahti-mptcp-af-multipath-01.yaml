abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new address family to be used for sockets
    that are bound to more than one IP address, as motivated by the Multipath TCP
    work in the IETF. The goal is to use the same set of function calls as traditionally,
    but by new address family make it possible for them to express multiple addresses
    to connect or bind to. The document gives a high-level definition of the behavior
    of the traditional function calls, but a detailed specification of the API syntax
    is not in the scope of this document.</p>"
