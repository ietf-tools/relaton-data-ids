- content: "<p>This document describes location-based service scenarios for Geopriv.
    It complements the Geopriv Requirements document by providing a set of examples
    in which the Geopriv Location Object (LO) may be used. Thus this documents serves
    as a basis to discuss and analyze the security (authentication, authorization,
    integrity and confidentiality) and privacy issues and requirements associated
    with location-based services. To be useful, these scenarios include details of
    location computation, which helps to identify the entities involved on an abstract
    level and where privacy issues like control, consent, access, and security arise.</p>"
