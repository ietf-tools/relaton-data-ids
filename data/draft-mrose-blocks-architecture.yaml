abstract:
- content: "<p>Blocks is an architecture for managing metadata. The architecture supports
    two models: the Blocks exchange model organizes information into navigation spaces,
    whilst the Blocks convergence model allows for bulk synchronization and knowledge
    management. This document, at present, focuses on the first model. To subscribe
    to the Blocks discussion list, send e-mail[17]; there is also a developers' site[18].</p>"
