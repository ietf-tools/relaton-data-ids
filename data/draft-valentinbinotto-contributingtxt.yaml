- content: "<p>Open source projects rely on the cooperation of third parties. Other
    websites also rely on user feedback, for example, when bugs occur. There are various
    platforms that enable effective collaboration. However, this diversity also presents
    a challenge. Where should users who have discovered an error report it? Or how
    can third parties participate in a project? This document presents one way to
    communicate such information in a consistent manner.</p>"
