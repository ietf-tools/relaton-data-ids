abstract:
- content: "<p>In interdomain routing environment, it is often observed Multiple Origin
    ASes and it causes instability in interdomain routing. To work around its problem,
    this draft describes the mechanism of automatically integrity check about origin
    AS. In this approach, BGP router compares with the origin AS in BGP UPDATE and
    origin AS in IRR database. Also this draft defines messages between BGP router
    and IRR-DB to transmit query and reply packet. And by introducing the cache mechanism
    in BGP router, it can apply route flapping environment.</p>"
