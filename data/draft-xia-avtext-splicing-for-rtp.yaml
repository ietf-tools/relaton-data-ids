abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines RTP splicing. Splicing is a process that replaces
    the content of the main multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers
    the substitutive multimedia content to receiver for a period of time. This memo
    provides some RTP splicing use cases, then we enumerate a set of requirements
    and analyze whether an existing RTP level middlebox can meet these requirements,
    at last we provide concrete guidelines for how the chosen middlebox works to handle
    RTP splicing.</p>"
