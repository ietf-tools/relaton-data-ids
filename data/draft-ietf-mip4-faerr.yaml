abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new extension for use by Foreign Agents operating
    Mobile IP for IPv4. Currently, a foreign agent cannot supply status information
    without destroying the ability for a mobile node to verify authentication data
    supplied by the home agent. The new extension solves this problem by making a
    better place for the foreign agent to provide its status information to the mobile
    node. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
