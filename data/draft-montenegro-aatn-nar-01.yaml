abstract:
- content: "<p>Network address (and port) translation is a useful technology. However,
    several shortcomings have been identified (Mobile IP, IPSEC and QOS flows). In
    these cases, NAT may be complemented by the use of NAR (Negotiated Address Reuse).
    The negotiation phase in NAR is currently based on SOCKS.</p>"
