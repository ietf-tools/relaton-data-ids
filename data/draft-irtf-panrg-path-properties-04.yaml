abstract:
- content: "<p>Path properties express information about paths across a network and
    the services provided via such paths. In a path-aware network, path properties
    may be fully or partially available to entities such as hosts. This document defines
    and categorizes path properties. Furthermore, the document specifies several path
    properties which might be useful to hosts or other entities, e.g., for selecting
    between paths or for invoking some of the provided services.</p>"
