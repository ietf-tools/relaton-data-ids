abstract:
- content: "<p>The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol describes an XML-
    based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial or civic location
    information to service contact Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). LoST servers
    can be located anywhere, but a placement closer to the end host, e.g., in the
    access network, is desirable. In disaster situations with intermittent network
    connectivity, such a LoST server placement provides benefits regarding the resiliency
    of emergency service communication. This document describes how a LoST client
    can discover a LoST server using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
