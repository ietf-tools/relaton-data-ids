- content: "<p>This memo addresses RTCP reporting by and through RTP translators.
    It collects existing guidance from RFC 3550, systematises translators' reporting
    behaviour by considering potential sources of information and the policy-controlled
    forwarding of such information, considers naming issues in labelling reports,
    considers methods of control of reporting behaviour, and presents some examples
    of architectures for reporting.</p>"
