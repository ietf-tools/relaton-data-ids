abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it provides information on the management requirements of PacketCable(TM)/IPCablecom
    specific devices and defines a framework in which PacketCable MIBs are defined.
    This document does not precede any previously issued document. It is, however,
    intended to support and complement the actual Packetcable MIB documents, which
    are issued separately.</p>"
