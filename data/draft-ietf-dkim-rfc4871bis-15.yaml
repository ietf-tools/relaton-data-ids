abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization
    that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating
    the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational
    relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of
    the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion
    of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying
    the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit
    from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive
    change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature. This memo
    obsoletes RFC 4871 and RFC 5672. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
