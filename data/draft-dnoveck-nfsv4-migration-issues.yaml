abstract:
- content: "<p>The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for
    a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to clients.
    Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the existing specification
    for this feature. This document discusses the issues which have arisen and explores
    the options available for curing the issues via clarification and correction of
    the NFSv4.0 specification.</p>"
