abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo presents a solution to solve IPv4 address shortage and ease
    IPv4-IPv6 interconnection. The document presents a set of incremental steps for
    the deployment of IPv6 as a means to solve IPv4 address exhaustion. Stateless
    IPv4/IPv6 address mapping functions are introduced and IPv4-IPv6 interconnection
    scenarios presented. This memo advocates for a more proactive approach for the
    deployment of IPv6 into operational networks. This memo specifies the IPv6 variant
    of the A+P. Both encapsulation and translation scheme are covered. Moreover, two
    modes are elaborated: the binding mode (compatible mode with DS-lite) and the
    stateless mode.</p>"
