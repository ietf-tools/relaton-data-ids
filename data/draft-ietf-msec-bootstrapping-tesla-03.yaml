abstract:
- content: "<p>TESLA, the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication protocol,
    provides source authentication in multicast scenarios. TESLA is an efficient protocol
    with low communication and computation overhead that scales to large numbers of
    receivers and also tolerates packet loss. TESLA is based on loose time synchronization
    between the sender and the receivers. Source authentication is realized in TESLA
    by using Message Authentication Code (MAC) chaining. The use of TESLA within the
    Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) has been published, targeting multicast
    authentication in scenarios where SRTP is applied to protect the multimedia data.
    This solution assumes that TESLA parameters are made available by out-of-band
    mechanisms. This document specifies payloads for the Multimedia Internet Keying
    (MIKEY) protocol for bootstrapping TESLA for source authentication of secure group
    communications using SRTP. TESLA may be bootstrapped using one of the MIKEY key
    management approaches, e.g., by using a digitally signed MIKEY message sent via
    unicast, multicast, or broadcast. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
