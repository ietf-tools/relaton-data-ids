- content: "<p>This document specifies the TCP Seamless Mobility Option (TCP-SMO)
    with variable length identifiers. TCP-SMO allows mobility with session continuity,
    when either of the TCP endpoint change its IP address. This is being done securely
    and without any additional round trips during mobility event.</p>"
