abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new approach for realizing Ethernet LAN (ELAN)
    services with an objective of leveraging Segment Routing Control plane to achieve
    high scalability, faster network convergence, and reduced operational complexity.
    Furthermore, it naturally brings the benefits of All-Active multihoming as well
    as MAC learning in data-plane.</p>"
