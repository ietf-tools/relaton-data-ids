abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides both a functional description and a detailed
    specification of the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA)--a distributed
    routing protocol for multihop networks. A key concept in the protocol's design
    is an attempt to de-couple the generation of far-reaching control message propagation
    from the dynamics of the network topology. The basic, underlying algorithm is
    neither distance-vector nor link-state; it is a member of a class referred to
    as link-reversal algorithms. The protocol builds a loop-free, multipath routing
    structure that is used as the basis for forwarding traffic to a given destination.
    The protocol can simultaneously support both source-initiated, on-demand routing
    for some destinations and destination-initiated, proactive routing for other destinations.</p>"
