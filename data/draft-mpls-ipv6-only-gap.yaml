abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reviews the MPLS protocol suite in the context of IPv6
    and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS- related protocols
    and applications to be used with IPv6-only networks. This document is not intended
    to highlight a particular vendor's implementation (or lack thereof) in the context
    of IPv6-only MPLS functionality, but rather to focus on gaps in the standards
    defining the MPLS suite.</p>"
