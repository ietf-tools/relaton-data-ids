abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPLS source routing paradigm provides path control for both intra-
    and inter- Autonomous System (AS) traffic. In most MPLS deployments the ingress
    of a MPLS tunnel is an IP router. Availability of MPLS forwarding stacks for host
    operating systems is extending the MPLS perimeter to Hypervisors and Servers.
    Recent Data Center designs are using an IGP-less routing paradigm based on massive
    ECMP multi path using external BGP. This documents outlines how Hypervisors and
    Servers may interact with the MPLS control- and data plane using extensions to
    the BGP labeled unicast protocol (BGP- LU).</p>"
