abstract:
- content: "<p>While conventional wisdom has it that wireless Access Points are strictly
    Layer 2 bridges, such devices today perform some higher functions that are performed
    by routers or switches in wired networks in addition to bridging between wired
    and wireless networks. For example, in 802.11 networks, Access Points can function
    as Network Access Servers. For this reason, Access Points have IP addresses and
    can function as IP devices.</p>"
