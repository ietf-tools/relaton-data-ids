- content: "<p>This document describes several potential price and charge issues in
    CDN interconnection. It discusses some optional charge models when CDNs are interconnected
    and presents a need from Content Service Providers (CSP) or CDNs to optimize their

    and protocols support price, charge and policy information exchanging.</p>"
