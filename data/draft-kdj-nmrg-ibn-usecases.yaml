abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes several use cases of Intent-Based Networking
    (IBN) and the methodologies to differ each use case by following the lifecycle
    of a real IBN system. It includes the initial system awareness and data collection
    for the IBN system and the construction of the IBN system, which consists of intent
    translation, deployment, verification, evaluation, and optimization. Practice
    learnings are also summarized to instruct the construction of next generation
    network management systems with the integration of IBN techniques.</p>"
