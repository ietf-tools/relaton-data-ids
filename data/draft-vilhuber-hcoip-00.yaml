abstract:
- content: "<p>Bandwidth consumption of RTP flows can be reduced by tunneling and
    compressing headers. This draft defines an IP protocol number and a header which
    can be used to transport IP Header Compressed [IPHC], Compressed RTP [CRTP], and
    Enhanced Compressed RTP [ECRTP] packets over an arbitrary IP tunnel (IP-in-IP
    or ESP, for example) to reduce bandwidth consumption for RTP flows.</p>"
