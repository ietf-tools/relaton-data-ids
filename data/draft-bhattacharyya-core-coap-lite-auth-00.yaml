abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft presents a work-in-progress on a challenge-response based
    lightweight authentication scheme to mutually authenticate CoAP client and server
    for establishing a secure unicast communication channel. The draft discusses the
    generic idea behind the proposed authentication scheme, as well as presents its
    CoAP specific adoption. The proposed scheme has low communication overhead and
    can be a robust alternative against the usual DTLS based connection initiation
    scheme with PSK.</p>"
