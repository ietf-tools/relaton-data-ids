abstract:
- content: "<p>This contribution describes a discovery protocol that can be used between
    gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra- ITAD communications
    environment. The entities work in peer-to-peer mode to discover each other. A
    peer can find which peer(s) to register with based on policy. Each peer can also
    decide whether capabilities should also be taken into consideration during the
    discovery process before they proceed for registration. The discovery protocol
    will be a part for building a single unified intra-ITAD protocol described in
    a following contribution. The message formats of the intra-ITAD protocol including
    the discovery message are similar to TRIP.</p>"
