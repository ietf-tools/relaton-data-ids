abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a Diameter authorization extension that is
    used for the delivery of Service-Flow Charging Rules. These Service-Flow Charging
    Rules identify service flows that can be used within a credit control environment
    for distinguishing individual packet flows for which credit control applies. Multiple
    Service-Flows can be provided which then enable independent rating of the individual
    packet flows. Service-Flows can be provided at authentication and may be dynamically
    updated throughout the lifetime of an AAA session.</p>"
