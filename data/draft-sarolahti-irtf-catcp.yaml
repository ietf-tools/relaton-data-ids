abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Content- and Cache-Aware TCP (CATCP) that allows
    caching of TCP segments to be re-used between different connections transmitting
    same data. When there is redundant data to multiple receivers, this can lead to
    significant load reductions and performance improvements.</p>"
