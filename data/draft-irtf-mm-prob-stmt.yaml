abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobile IP [1] has been developed in the IETF for a number of years
    already. It's simplicity and scalability give it a growing success within the
    IETF as several Internet drafts are proposed to extend various improvements for
    Mobile IP and its counterpart designed for IPv6, Mobile IPv6 [2]. Mobile IP suffers
    from several well-known weaknesses that have led to the definition of the macro/micro-mobility
    architecture. Such an architecture implies the division of the mobility architecture
    into two different parts: mobility management at a large scale, between the different
    domains (macro-mobility), and, on the other hand, at a local scale, inside these
    domains (micro-mobility). Each type of mobility is then managed by specific mechanisms
    and protocols. The macro-micro approach results in many advantages that all micro-mobility
    protocols will have; thereby effectively addressing weaknesses that plague Mobile
    IP. This document discusses the micro-mobility problem, and is an attempt to enumerate
    some of the concepts and approaches defining the micromobility problem space.
    This draft will serve to document the problem space and definition of micro-mobility
    for discussion in the IRTF micro-mobility working group.</p>"
