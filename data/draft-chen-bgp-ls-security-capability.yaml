abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal is to collect the security capabilities of nodes, which will
    be one of the factors to form the routing topology, and use the routing programming
    capabilities to form a secure routing path. The BGP-LS protocol is extended to
    carry the security capabilities of the node. The controller collects topology
    information, forms a topology path with security capabilities according to security
    requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending to execute node forwarding through
    programming.</p>"
