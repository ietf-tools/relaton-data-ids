abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo takes a look at some of the work on policy-driven networks
    currently being done in several IETF working groups. The proposed solutions (like
    COPS and PIBs) focus on solving local problems of policy management. It is the
    view of the authors that while local solutions like COPS can be more effective
    than more general ones, the advantages to effective management through the use
    of a single integrated management framework (an improved SNMP) outweigh the gains
    of locally optimized solutions.</p>"
