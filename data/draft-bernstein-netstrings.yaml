abstract:
- content: "<p>A netstring is a self-delimiting encoding of a string. Netstrings are
    very easy to generate and to parse. Any string may be encoded as a netstring;
    there are no restrictions on length or on allowed bytes. Another virtue of a netstring
    is that it declares the string size up front. Thus an application can check in
    advance whether it has enough space to store the entire string. Netstrings may
    be used as a basic building block for reliable network protocols. Most high-level
    protocols, in effect, transmit a sequence of strings; those strings may be encoded
    as netstrings and then concatenated into a sequence of characters, which in turn
    may be transmitted over a reliable stream protocol such as TCP.</p>"
