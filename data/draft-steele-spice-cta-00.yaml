abstract:
- content: "<p>Requirements for physical supply chain credentials are subject to frequent
    changes due to regulatory, logistic and market pressures. Preventing fraud and
    counterfeiting requires strong cryptographic assurance and binding to identities
    for people, organizations, vehicles and devices. New information regarding a credential
    subject needs to be conveyed by holders to verifier, after credential issuance.
    This specification describes the role of credential types or schemas in supporting
    changing requirements and realtime information regarding digital credentials.</p>"
