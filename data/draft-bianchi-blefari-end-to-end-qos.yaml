abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a new admission control paradigm, called GRIP
    (Gauge&amp;Gate Reservation with Independent Probing), devised to transparently
    operate over DiffServ domains. GRIP relies the decision to admit a new flow upon
    the successful and timely delivery, through the Internet, of probe packets independently
    generated by the end points.</p>"
