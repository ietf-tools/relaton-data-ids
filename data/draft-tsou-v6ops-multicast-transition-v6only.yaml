abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a multicast transition solution from the old
    IPv4 only network to the IPv6 only network. It enumerates the transition steps
    and then analyzes the transition cost in various dimensions. This document is
    intended to eventually meet the criteria for a specification in the series envisioned
    by the v4-to-v6 transition framework.</p>"
