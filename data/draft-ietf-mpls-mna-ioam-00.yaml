abstract:
- content: "<p>In situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM), defined
    in RFC 9197, is an on-path telemetry method to collect and transport the operational
    state and telemetry information using, for example, Preallocated or Incremental
    IOAM Option, that can be used to calculate various performance metrics. RFC 9326
    defined the IOAM Direct Export (IOAM-DEX) Option in which the operational state
    and telemetry information are collected according to the specified profile and
    exported in a manner and format defined by a local policy. MPLS Network Actions
    (MNA) techniques are meant to indicate actions to be performed on any combination
    of Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS packets, and the node itself, and also to
    transfer data needed for these actions. This document explores the MNA mechanisms
    to collect and transport the on-path operational state, and telemetry information
    IOAM data fields, including IOAM-DEX Option.</p>"
