abstract:
- content: "<p>As a SIP request is processed along its route to the destination, the
    initial request-URI can be altered without callers’ notice or consent. The caller
    may concern both the final call recipient’s identity and the authorities of the
    SIP intermediaries that alter the request-URI. Especially when the caller does
    not know the final call recipient, simply giving his/her identity to the caller
    will not help the caller to decide the legitimacy of the call. Without a secure
    retarget mechanism, the end-to-end security of SIP cannot be guaranteed. This
    document proposes a security mechanism to provide the caller with credentials
    of SIP intermediaries that retarget a request and the final recipient’s identity
    through response.</p>"
