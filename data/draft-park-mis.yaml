abstract:
- content: "<p>In this draft, we discuss how to make use of multiple interfaces in
    a single mobile router. We will focus on the scenario in which each interface
    is attached to different access network. Especially, we propose how a mobile router
    selects proper interfaces to provide services to different traffic flows. We suggest
    a new option carried in IPv6 hop-by-hop options header to maintain and advertise
    the flow requirment and characteristics. New option contains a service type value
    and a preference value. A servie type value is used for traffic classification,
    and a preference value enables mobile router to control the traffic in detail.
    The propsed multiple interface selection mechanism in a multihomed mobile router
    (MMR) chooses an appropriate interface for each flow, depending on traffic requirements
    and access network characteristics.</p>"
