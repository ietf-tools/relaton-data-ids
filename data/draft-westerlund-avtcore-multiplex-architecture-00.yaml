abstract:
- content: "<p>RTP has always been a protocol that supports multiple participants
    each sending their own media streams in an RTP session. Thus relying on the three
    main multiplexing points in RTP; RTP session, SSRC and Payload Type for their
    various needs. However, most usages of RTP have been less complex often with a
    single SSRC in each direction, with a single RTP session per media type. But the
    more complex usages start to be more common and thus guidance on how to use RTP
    in various complex cases are needed. This document analyzes a number of cases
    and discusses the usage of the various multiplexing points and the need for functionality
    when defining RTP/RTCP extensions that utilize multiple RTP streams and multiple
    RTP sessions.</p>"
