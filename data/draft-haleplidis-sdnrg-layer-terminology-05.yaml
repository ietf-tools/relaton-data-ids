abstract:
- content: "<p>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can in general be defined as a new
    approach for network programmability. Network programmability refers to the capacity
    to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open
    interfaces as opposed to relying on closed-box solutions and propietary-defined
    interfaces. SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks through the
    introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so,
    separates it from the control plane. This separation allows faster innovation
    cycles at both planes as experience has already shown. However, there is increasing
    confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer structure in an SDN architecture
    and how do layers interface with each other. This document aims to answer these
    questions and provide a concise reference document for SDNRG, in particular, and
    the SDN community, in general, based on relevant peer-reviewed literature and
    documents in the RFC series.</p>"
