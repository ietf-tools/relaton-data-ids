abstract:
- content: "<p>This file is a proposal for location and discovery of filter resources
    selected by search-conditions. The peers,which are virtually grouped, construct
    n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical tree overlay network. With cached addresses
    of peers, the overload of traffic in tree structure can be avoided. The resources
    are classified into hierarchical domains, and registered into the peers which
    are located in the same domain virtual groups as the resources'. This proposal
    supports flexible queries by a SQL-like query statement.</p>"
