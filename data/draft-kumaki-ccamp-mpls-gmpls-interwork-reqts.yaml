abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements
    for operating Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineering (TE) networks
    over Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Operation of an MPLS-TE network as a client
    network to a GMPLS network has enhanced operational capabilities than provided
    by a co- existent protocol model (ships in the night). The GMPLS network may be
    a packet or a non-packet network, and may itself be a multi-layer network supporting
    both packet and non-packet technologies. A MPLS-TE Label Switched Path (LSP) originates
    and terminates on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR). The GMPLS network provides
    transparent transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP. Specification of solutions
    is out of scope for this document.</p>"
