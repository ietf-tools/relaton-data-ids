abstract:
- content: "<p>The Simple Extensible Data Format (SXDF) defined in this document aims
    to combine the nice properties of XML (of providing a universal, text-based data
    format which allows adding additional data fields without breaking existing application
    programs) with a simple syntax which can be parsed efficiently by computer programs.
    This data format is intended for over-the-wire use in webservice protocols, where
    there is generally no interest in being able to directly modify the representation
    of the data with a standard text editor.</p>"
