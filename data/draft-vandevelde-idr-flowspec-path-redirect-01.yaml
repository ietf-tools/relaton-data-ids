abstract:
- content: "<p>Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination
    of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications but the
    primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic filtering
    actions for DDoS mitigation. The flow-spec standard RFC5575 [2] defines a redirect-to-VRF
    action for policy-based forwarding but this mechanism is not always sufficient,
    particular if the redirected traffic needs to be steered into an engineered path
    or into a service plane. This document defines a new redirect-to-INDIRECTION_ID
    (32-bit or 128-bit) flow-spec action to provide advanced redirection capabilities.
    When activated, the flowspec Indirection-id is used to identify the next-hop redirect
    information within a router locallized Indirection-id table. This allows a flowspec
    controller to signal redirection towards a next-hop IP address, a shortest path
    tunnel, a traffic engineered tunnel or a next-next-hop (traffic engineered) tunnel
    egress interface.</p>"
