abstract:
- content: "<p>The increase in complexity of modern networks makes it challenging
    to deploy new services and to keep networks up to date whilst maintaining stability
    and availability for critical business services. This is a major challenge that
    network operators (service providers, SME, etc) face today. The operators aim
    of streamlining both operations and the deployment of new services, is being met
    by increasingly relying on (1) software abstractions to simplify the design and
    configuration of monitoring and control operations and (2) the use of programmatic
    control over the configuration and operation of such networks. In this context,
    providing network operators with a generic policy- based management model that
    can be used to express policies on top of arbitrary configuration data models
    is essential. In particular, SUPA addresses the needs of operators and application
    developers to use a generic policy-based management model for defining and representing
    multiple types of policy rules.</p>"
