abstract:
- content: <p>One of the main challenges in inter-domain federation of Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) calls is that many domains continue to utilize phone numbers, and
    not email-style SIP URI. Consequently, a mechanism is needed that enables secure
    mappings from phone numbers to domains. The main technical challenge in doing
    this securely is to verify that the domain in question truly is the "owner" of
    the phone number. This specification defines the PSTN Validation Protocol (PVP),
    which can be used by a domain to verify this ownership by means of a forward routability
    check in the PSTN. Legal This documents and the information contained therein
