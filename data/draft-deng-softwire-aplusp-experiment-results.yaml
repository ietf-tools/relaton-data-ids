abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an implementation of A+P in a provider's IPv6-
    only network. It provides details of the implementation, network elements, configurations
    and test results as well. Besides traditional port range A+P, a scattered port
    sets flavor of A+P is also implemented to verify feasibility of offering non-continuous
    port sets with A+P approach. The test results consist of the application compatibility
    test, UPnP 1.0 extensions and UPnP 1.0 friendly port allocation for A+P, port
    usage and BitTorrent behaviors with A+P. This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor
    of A+P.</p>"
