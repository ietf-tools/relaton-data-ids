abstract:
- content: "<p>Cloud computing is rapidly gaining importance, not only because of
    being ubiquitous, but also, due to ease of management of hugely increasing data,
    specially, multimedia contents. The next era is going to be of cloud federation,
    in which services would be brought up to the user through multiple clouds, creating
    an Inter-Cloud computing environment. On the other hand, increase in multimedia
    content requires much better service provisioning, responsiveness, and efficient
    transcoding. Thoroughly designing the architecture of Media Cloud Inter-Cloud
    Computing is today's requirement. This document focuses on this important issue
    and presents architectural fundamentals and key concerns in Media Cloud Inter-Cloud
    Computing.</p>"
