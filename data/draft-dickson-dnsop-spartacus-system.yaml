abstract:
- content: "<p>This is the SPARTACUS DNS gateway system. It is designed to facilitate
    the transport of DNS messages opaquely, across problematic sections of the Internet.
    It uses JSON encoding, and HTTP(S) as the protocol for transport. The main criteria
    of SPARTACUS is that it preserve DNS messages verbatim, and that only properly
    formatted DNS messages are passed. There are two modes (so far) defined: DNS forwarder
    (dns clients point to a local gateway, which forwards to a remote gateway for
    sending to a DNS resolver); and transparent proxy (DNS packets are intercepted,
    passed to a local gateway, which sends them to the remote gateway, with original
    destination IP address etc. encoded, and used by the remote gateway as the destination).
    DNS messages are NAT-friendly, so changes to IP or UDP headers do not impact them.
    Thus, SPARTACUS does not interfere with TSIG, SIG(0), or Eastlake Cookies. This
    document describes the system, the components, and behavior, with examples.</p>"
