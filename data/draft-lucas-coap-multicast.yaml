abstract:
- content: "<p>Multicast is a preferred approach to send a single message to multiple
    recipients but it is typically lossy. CoAP is the choice of messaging for IoT.
    If using multicast to transmit CoAP messages there is a risk they get lost and
    a further risk that sequences of messages get disrupted and leave the system in
    an unknown or unpleasant state. In the device world we might want to guarantee
    that a whole sequence of commands arrives at the device. For example a sequence
    to Open, Report, Do some action, and Close. It is better that all of these messages
    arrive or all of them do not arrive rather than have some of them arrive and to
    not know which ones failed. CoAP messages tend to be small due to constrained
    resources on the recipient devices. Existing frame sizes though are relatively
    large so it is possible to pack these frames with several smaller CoAP messages
    and send them as a group. CoAP Multicast proposes the simplest way to do this.
    It is a device independent method and adds no need for encryption channels.</p>"
