abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines an abstract model for Digital Products and
    their relationships with each other in order to establish a basic abstraction
    on which the lifecycle of Digital Products and collaborations around them can
    be expressed. In addition, this specification defines a number of message formats
    and hypermedia controls, to enable the creation of tools and application in the
    space of Digital Product Life Cycle Management.</p>"
