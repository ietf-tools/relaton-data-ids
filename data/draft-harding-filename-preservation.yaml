abstract:
- content: "<p>The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an
    Informational RFC. The EDIINT [AS1], [AS2] and [AS3] message formats do not currently
    contain any provisions for preservation of the filename of a transmitted EDI business
    document from one Trading Partner to another. However,within certain trading communities,
    it is not uncommon for Trading Partners to require a specific filenames for EDI
    business documents to trigger specific backend processing. So it is the goal of
    this informational document to outline the procedures and mechanisms required
    to preserve filenames of EDI business documents.</p>"
