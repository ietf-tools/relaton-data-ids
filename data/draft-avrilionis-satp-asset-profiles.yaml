abstract:
- content: <p>A definition of asset schema and profiles is needed to provide a semantic
    definition of tokenized assets. The Asset schema is an abstract construct at the
    root hierarchy of more specific "asset profiles". Asset profiles describe the
    structure (type) of assets that are specific to a given domain or industry. An
    asset instance that is instantiated in a specific network and is exchanged via
    the SATP protocol has an instance-class relationship (in an ontological sense)
    with a given profile. Asset profiles are essential to the SATP protocol as they
    define the semantics of asset instances to be transferred. Gateways may negotiate
    asset transfers based on the nature and abilities of the assets as defined according
    to their profile. The current document discusses the definition of the asset schema
    and profile.</p>
