abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the principles of Traffic Engineering (TE) in the
    Internet. The document is intended to promote better understanding of the issues
    surrounding traffic engineering in IP networks, and to provide a common basis
    for the development of traffic engineering capabilities for the Internet. The
    principles, architectures, and methodologies for performance evaluation and performance
    optimization of operational IP networks are discussed throughout this document.
    This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002. This document obsoletes
    RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in line with current best
    practices for Internet Traffic Engineering and to include references to the latest
    relevant work in the IETF.</p>"
