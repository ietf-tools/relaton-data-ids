abstract:
- content: "<p>DMARC introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and
    preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting. The DMARC mechanism
    can encounter interoperability issues when messages originate from third party
    sources, are modified in transit, or are forwarded enroute to their final destination.
    Collectively these email flows are referred to as indirect email flows. This document
    describes interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows. Possible
    methods for addressing interoperability issues are presented.</p>"
