abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the motivation for benchmarking the Bidirectional
    Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. The BFD protocol is a relatively new protocol
    intended to detect failures in the bidirectional path between two network elements,
    with potentially very low latency [BFD, BFD-GEN]. The BFD protocol is being implemented
    by several vendors and is being deployed extensively by the service providers.
    Hence, it is imperative that common understanding is established for performance
    and conformance benchmarks as well as interoperability. This draft seeks to generate
    interest on this topic in the working group. If there is sufficient interest on
    this topic, drafts that address the Methodology and Terminology for the BFD protocol
    could be proposed; before BMWG could make this an official working group item.</p>"
