abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension for the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP), which enables end-to-end security of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    together with firewall/Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal. This solution
    relies on Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME) and the middlebox
    communications (MIDCOM) protocol. The user authorises a proxy server to encrypt
    the session description on behalf of the user. The proxy determines the capabilities
    of the receiving party and encrypts the SDP for a SIP proxy server in the receiving
    domain. Using MIDCOM, each proxy can dynamically control its firewall to open
    pinholes or request NAT bindings for the media flows. As long as each end-user
    may contact its trustworthy SIP proxy via a secure connection and authorise this
    proxy to encrypt the signalling data, the session information is secured end-to-end.</p>"
