abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper explains the problems created by Network Address Translators
    (NATs) in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlays and recommends some NAT traversal techniques
    appropriate for P2PSIP networks. Two P2PSIP overlay architectures that accommodate
    the presence of NATs are described and analyzed. The first is the super-peer scheme
    used in a number of p2p file-sharing systems today. The second is a scheme where
    all peers play an equal role in the overlay.</p>"
