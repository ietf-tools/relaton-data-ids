abstract:
- content: "<p>QUIC uses UDP as its transport layer protocol. Many existing NAT routers
    rely on observing TCP SYN, ACK, and FIN packets to determine the establishment
    and termination of connections, thereby precisely maintaining the lifecycle of
    NAT mapping entries. For QUIC, NAT devices can only manage mapping entries based
    on ordinary UDP aging mechanisms, which may cause NAT entries for long-lived QUIC
    connections to be prematurely aged and re-bound, resulting in changes to source
    ports. This document proposes a solution that extends the IP header options field
    to identify QUIC connections, facilitating NAT devices that do not recognize QUIC
    to accurately determine the lifecycle of QUIC connections and prevent random aging
    and re-mapping of long-lived QUIC connections.</p>"
