abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the LEMONADE work to define extensions to the IMAP and SMTP
    protocols that provide optimizations in a variety of settings, the this document
    describes an alternative, optional binding for IMAP and SMTP showing how HTTP
    can be used to transfer commands and responses. This binding is intended to facilitate
    the use of IMAP and SMTP in deployments involving a variety of intermediaries.
    Bindings to SOAP, REST and WebDAV are also provided.</p>"
