- content: "<p>This document provides a use-case and requirements that address the
    need for facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes virtually
    prepared multiple networks and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation
    one to a backup one during scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as a network
    disaster. Specifically, the necessity of interfaces to establish consistent end-to-end
    data transmission paths over multiple domain networks is addressed.</p>"
