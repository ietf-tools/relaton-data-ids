abstract:
- content: "<p>ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable routing,
    enhancing mobility and privacy in IP based internet infrastructure. When we consider
    IP based vehicular networks, ID/Location separation architecture is expected to
    offer benefits. In this draft, we analyze whether ID/Location separation protocols
    can adjust into IP based vehicular networks and solve requirements.</p>"
