abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes Generalized Segment Routing over IPv6 (G-SRv6)
    Networking Programming for SRv6 compression. G-SRv6 can reduce the overhead of
    SRv6 by encoding the Generalized SIDs(G-SID) in SID list, and it also supports
    to program SRv6 SIDs and G-SIDs in a single SRH to support incremental deployment
    and smooth upgrade. G-SRv6 is fully compatible with SRv6 with no modification
    of SRH, no new address consumption, no new route creation, and even no modification
    of control plane. G-SRv6 for Compression is designed based on the Compressed SRv6
    Segment List Encoding in SRH [I-D.filsfilscheng-spring-srv6-srh-compression] framework.</p>"
