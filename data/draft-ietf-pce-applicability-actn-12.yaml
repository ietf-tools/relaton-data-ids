abstract:
- content: "<p>Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the set of
    virtual network (VN) operations needed to orchestrate, control, and manage large-scale
    multidomain TE networks so as to facilitate network programmability, automation,
    efficient resource sharing, and end-to-end virtual service-aware connectivity
    and network function virtualization services. The Path Computation Element (PCE)
    is a component, application, or network node that is capable of computing a network
    path or route based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.
    The PCE serves requests from Path Computation Clients (PCCs) that communicate
    with it over a local API or using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
    (PCEP). This document examines the applicability of PCE to the ACTN framework.</p>"
