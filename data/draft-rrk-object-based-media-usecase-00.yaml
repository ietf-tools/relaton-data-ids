abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the challenges and use cases for the deployment
    and operation of Object-Based Media (OBM), also known as Flexible Media (FM),
    across the Internet. It discusses key considerations such as compute-aware traffic
    steering, metric usage, bandwidth optimization, and latency reduction techniques.
    The intention of this document is to highlight specific challanges or areas where
    IETF investigation and applicable solutions are needed for the optimal deployment
    of OBM-based media services.</p>"
