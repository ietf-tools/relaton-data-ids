abstract:
- content: "<p>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is an authorization strategy in which
    an entity's permission to access and manipulate targeted resources is determined
    by the entity's role or function within a certain organizational context. RBAC's
    principal motivation is to streamline security policy administration. Many discrete
    authoriza- tions can be aggregated within a defined role. One or many roles may
    be assigned or attributed to individuals. This draft describes LDAP object classes
    and attributes which support RBAC. Adoption of this schema across multiple LDAP
    implementations will enable RBAC intero- perability among heterogeneous underlying
    directory services.</p>"
