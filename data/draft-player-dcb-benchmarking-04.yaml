abstract:
- content: <p>Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that
    networking devices will impartially drop network traffic at their performance
    limits. Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however, will attempt to throttle
    prioritized traffic from network endpoints before those limits are reached in
    order to minimize the probability of frame loss for high value traffic. Hence,
    existing methodologies based around indiscriminate frame loss are inappropriate
    for DCB devices. This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based on loss
    and extends them to support "lossless" Ethernet devices.</p>
