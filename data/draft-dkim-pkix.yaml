- content: "<p>This document describes a mechanism for using X.509v3 certificates
    that comply with the PKIX profile with Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM). An
    email signer MAY inform potential relying parties that a key described in a DKIM
    key record has a corresponding PKIX certificate or certificate path by means of
    an attribute in the key record that provides the URL of the certificate data.
    An email verifier MAY choose to make use of this information in deciding the disposition
    of the signed email message.</p>"
