abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a implementation standard for mapping wallets
    to domain names using the new WALLET RRType, while allowing for TXT record fallback.
    The goal is to provide a secure and scalable way to associate wallets with domain
    names, enabling seamless lookup as well as suggesting required authentication
    mechanism. The proposal relies on DNSSEC or security successors to ensure trust
    and security. We also will propose a mechanism for mapping a wallet back to a
    domain name.</p>"
