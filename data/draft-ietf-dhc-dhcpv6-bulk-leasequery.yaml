abstract:
- content: "<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has been
    extended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to request information
    about DHCPv6 bindings. That mechanism is limited to queries for individual bindings.
    In some situations individual binding queries may not be efficient, or even possible.
    This document expands on the Leasequery protocol, adding new query types and allowing
    for bulk transfer of DHCPv6 binding data via TCP. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
