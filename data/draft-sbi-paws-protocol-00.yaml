abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines an application protocol for WSDB services provided
    to TV Band Devices (TVBDs). The protocol complies with FCC Rules/Requirements
    [FCC 10-174] and in the context of operating an FCC certified database, it also
    complies with requirements defined by IETF PAWS [IETF-PAWS-03]. We believe this
    protocol can be easily extended to include the remaining requirements not already
    satisfied from the IETF PAWS requirements.</p>"
