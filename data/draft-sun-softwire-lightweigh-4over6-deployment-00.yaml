abstract:
- content: "<p>Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation function
    from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators (B4s), and hence reduces the mapping
    scale on the concentrator to per-customer level. This document discusses various
    deployment models of lightweight 4over6. It also describes the deployment considerations
    and applicability of the lightweight 4over6 architecture.</p>"
