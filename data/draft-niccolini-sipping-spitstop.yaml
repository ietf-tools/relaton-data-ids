abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo discusses the need for standards that support SPam over Internet
    Telephony (SPIT) prevention applications. After explaining the general need for
    SPIT prevention applications the memo provides a reference scenario for potential
    communication between entities that may be involved in SPIT prevention. Within
    this scenario the need for standardizing communication is analyzed for each pair
    of communicating entities. The analysis is intended to serve as a starting point
    for discussing the requirements for signaling standards as well as for architectural
    considerations, that support SPIT prevention applications. This memo is not intended
    to suggest any solution of SPIT signaling issues. Such work, if necessary at all,
    should be object of separate documents.</p>"
