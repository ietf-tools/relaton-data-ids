abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects
    to Internet. After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains,
    the current trend is to develop a common, "thin waist" of protocols forming a
    unified, defragmented IoT platform. Such a platform will make objects accessible
    to applications across organizations and domains. Towards this goal, quite a few
    proposals have been made to build a unified IoT platform as an overlay on top
    of today's Internet. Such overlay solutions, however, are inadequate to address
    the important challenges posed by a heterogeneous, global scale deployment of
    IoT, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and communication reliability,
    due to the inherent inefficiencies of the current Internet. To address this problem,
    we propose to build a common set of protocols and services, which form an IoT
    platform, based on the Information Centric Network (ICN) architecture, which we
    call ICN-IoT. ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides
    seamless mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery.
    This draft sets the IoT requirements and ICN challenges to realize a unified ICN-IoT
    framework. Towards this, we first identify a list of important requirements which
    a unified IoT architecture should have to support tens of billions of objects.
    Then we analyze the current state of art deployment model and discuss important
    and popular IoT scenarios including the "smart" home, campus, grid, transportation
    infrastructure, healthcare, Education, and Entertainment. Though we see most of
    these requirements are met by ICN, we discuss specific challenges ICN has to address
    to satisfy them considering heterogeneity in IoT environments and scenarios.</p>
