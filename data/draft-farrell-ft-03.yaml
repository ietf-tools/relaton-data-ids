abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an optional, fast-track way to progress a working
    group document to IESG review. It is provided as a process experiment as defined
    in RFC 3933 for use when working group chairs believe that there is running code
    that implements a working group Internet-Draft. The motivation is to have the
    IETF process explicitly consider running code, consistent with the IETF's overall
    philosophy of running code and rough consensus. In this process all of working
    group last call, IETF last call, and Area Director review are carried out in the
    same two week period. Only comments that meet IESG Discuss criteria need to be
    addressed during this stage, and authors are required to make any changes within
    two weeks. This experiment will run for one year.</p>"
