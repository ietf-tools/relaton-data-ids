- content: "<p>The Ident protocol [RFC-1413], specifies a method for a host to request
    from a remote host an assertion of an identifier associated with a TCP connection
    between the two hosts. This memo specifies extensions to Ident to support strong
    (i.e., cryptographic) authentication methods. The extensions are based on the
    Simple Authentication and Security Layer [RFC-2222].</p>"
