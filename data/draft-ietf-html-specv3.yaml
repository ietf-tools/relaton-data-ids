abstract:
- content: "<p>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used
    to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another.
    HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate
    for representing information from a wide range of applications. HTML markup can
    represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options;
    database query results; simple structured documents with inlined graphics and
    hypertext views of existing bodies of information. This specification defines
    the capabilities of HTML version 3.0 and provides additional capabilities over
    previous versions such as tables, text flow around figures and math. It is backwards
    compatible with HTML 2.0.</p>"
