abstract:
- content: "<p>Network telemetry is the technology for gaining network insight and
    facilitating efficient and automated network management. It engages various techniques
    for remote data collection, correlation, and consumption. This document provides
    an architectural framework for network telemetry, motivated by the network operation
    challenges and requirements. As evidenced by some key characteristics and industry
    practices, network telemetry covers technologies and protocols beyond the conventional
    network Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM). It promises better flexibility,
    scalability, accuracy, coverage, and performance and allows automated control
    loops to suit both today's and tomorrow's network operation. This document clarifies
    the terminologies and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry
    system from several different perspectives. The framework and taxonomy help to
    set a common ground for the collection of related work and provide guidance for
    related technique and standard developments.</p>"
