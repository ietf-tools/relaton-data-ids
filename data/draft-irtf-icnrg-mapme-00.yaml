abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility has become a basic premise of network communications, thereby
    requiring a native integration into 5G networks. Despite numerous efforts to propose
    and standardize effective mobility- management models for IP, the result is a
    complex, poorly flexible set of mechanisms. The natural support for mobility offered
    by ICN (Information Centric Networking) makes it a good candidate to define a
    radically new solution relieving limitations of the traditional approaches. If
    consumer mobility is supported in ICN by design, in virtue of its connectionless
    pull-based communication model, producer mobility is still an open challenge.
    In this document, we focus on two prominent ICN architectures, CCN (Content Centric
    Networking) and NDN (Named Data Networking) and describe MAP-Me, an anchor-less
    solution to manage micro-mobility of content producers via a name- based CCN/NDN
    data plane, with support for latency-sensitive applications.</p>"
