abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a base profile of SSH for use with the U.S. Commercial
    National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory published
    by the United States Government which outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic
    algorithm policy for U.S. national security applications. This profile applies
    to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of U.S. National
    Security Systems that employ SSH. It is also appropriate for all other U.S. Government
    systems that process high-value information. This profile is made publicly available
    for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</p>"
