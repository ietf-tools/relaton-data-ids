abstract:
- content: <p>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined how the WebRTC
    framework can be used to provide access to IMS services. Users can use "web credentials"
    (e.g. a username and password) to obtain an authorization token (e.g. an OAuth
    2.0 access token), which is included in the user registration request sent towards
    the IMS network. 3GPP has specified a requirement, that the eP-CSCF shall be able
    to include a string value, representing the identity of the WAF, in the REGISTER
    request forwarded towards the S-CSCF. The S-CSCF can use the identity for e.g.
    policy decisions. This document defines a new Authorization header field parameter,
    'authorization-entity', which the eP-CSCF can include in a REGISTER request in
    order to convey the identity of the WAF towards the S-CSCF.</p>
