abstract:
- content: "<p>Originally, a BGP speaker was only allowed to advertise one path to
    any given address prefix. If the BGP speaker advertised a second path to a given
    prefix, the second path was considered to be a replacement for the first. The
    BGP ADD-PATH capability was defined to enable a BGP speaker to advertise multiple
    paths to a given address prefix, without one path replacing any of the others.
    However, whether a BGP speaker advertises multiple paths for any given prefix
    is always a matter of local policy for that BGP speaker. In certain situations,
    it is desirable to allow a BGP speaker to signal to its peers that the peers may
    advertise multiple simultaneous paths for certain prefixes but not for others.
    This document defines a new BGP capability, the Selective ADD-PATH capability,
    that allows a BGP speaker to signal to its peers whether a particular prefix is
    or is not eligible to have multiple paths advertised.</p>"
