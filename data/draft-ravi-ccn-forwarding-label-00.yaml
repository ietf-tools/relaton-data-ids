abstract:
- content: "<p>This document motivates the need for a forwarding-label which is another
    name that can be used in forwarding, in addition to the mandatory name in a CCNx
    Interest message. Forwarding-label once inserted by a edge router can be modified
    en-route towards the producer. Forwarding-label can be used for several purposes
    such as to support routing scalability, producer mobility, multi-protocol support,
    or for fast forwarding. We describe its encoding format, and rules followed by
    a forwarder while processing it. We also illustrate its use by applying it towards
    producer mobility. This draft scopes the use of forwarding-label within a closed
    trusted domain, while the use of it by applications is not ruled out.</p>"
