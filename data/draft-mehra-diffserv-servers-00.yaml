abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft motivates and presents architectural considerations for
    Differentiated Services [DSARCH] support in servers (referred to as DiffServ servers).
    We discuss possible deployment scenarios for Differentiated and Integrated Services,
    and highlight the benefits of supporting DiffServ functions on servers. We outline
    the requirements for DiffServ-enabled servers and propose a policy-based architecture
    that allows IntServ and DiffServ functions to coexist on DiffServ servers. We
    then propose a DiffServ API that can be used by applications to influence installed
    system policies on an application-specific basis, and can serve as a candidate
    for standardization. We also describe a number of host-specific DiffServ functions
    that can be efficiently supported on servers.</p>"
