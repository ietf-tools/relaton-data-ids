abstract:
- content: "<p>This document reports on the work of the 2008-2009 IETF nominating
    committee (NomCom). This draft summarizes the process steps that were used this
    year, and the work that was done. This is followed by a discussion of process
    issues which caused difficulties for the committee, but which require community
    agreement to before changes can be made. Finally, there are some observations
    about things which can help future committees, and which may help the community
    to understand.</p>"
