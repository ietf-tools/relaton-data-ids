abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes CTFRC (Coupon TFRC), an end-to-end congestion
    control mechanism friendly to both continuous streams and TCP flows, based on
    the modification of TFRC protocol and RED protocol. Taking account of the specific
    requirements of continuous streams, CTFRC protocol introduces a coupon function
    into TFRC to represent the bandwidth utilization of each stream, and revises RED
    to adjust drop probability according to the coupon value carried in each packet
    header. It inherits the merits of TFRC and promotes the QoS for continuous streams
    to a much higher level.</p>"
