abstract:
- content: "<p>This document explains how to use existing protocols, registries, code
    points, and algorithms to operate a Bundle Protocol (BP) edge node within a stable,
    non-challenged local underlayer IP network without the need for prior BP-layer
    configuration or long-term state. The purpose of this is to significantly lower
    the barrier to entry for lightweight BP edge nodes intended to act as endpoints
    for one (or only a few) BP applications.</p>"
