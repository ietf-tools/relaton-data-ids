abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has developed the IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
    Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications, such as field
    monitoring, inventory control and so on. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
    was published as [RFC6550] in March 2012. Based on routing metrics and constraints
    [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional
    routes for LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to- point, point-to-multipoint,
    and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from one or more
    roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is partitioned into one or more Destination
    Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible
    routing protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops and lack of a loop free DODAG
    local repair mechanism are two open issues to be addressed. This draft introduces
    an alternative rank and an Objective Function to eliminate DODAG loops in RPL.
    Based on the proposed rank and Objective Function, this draft introduces a loop
    free RPL.</p>"
