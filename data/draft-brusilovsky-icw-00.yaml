abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the issues
    involved in Internet Call Waiting Service (ICW), as part of interconnecting IP
    and Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) with the intent of providing ICW
    service that is much needed by numerous dial-up Internet users. Interworking of
    the IP network and GSTN, based on open well-defined protocols, will promote interoperability
    of both the networks and systems built by different vendors. This Internet Draft
    is submitted with the goal of becoming an informational RFC. The rest of this
    document is as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the services offered to the
    end Subscriber. It is the support of these services that necessitates the proposed
    internetworking project. Section 3 describes the scope of the proposed project
    by introducing its overall architecture, identifying the interfaces to be standardized,
    describing experience with SIP for ICW. Sections 4, 5, and 6 respectively address
    security considerations, supply references, and provide the authors address, as
    required by [1]. Section 7 acknowledges individuals providing assistance in the
    creation of this document. Section 8 is the Appendix, which contains IN Tutorial
    and Figure A.</p>"
