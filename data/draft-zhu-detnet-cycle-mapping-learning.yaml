abstract:
- content: "<p>The scaling DetNet (Deterministic Networking) technology based on cyclic
    queuing and scheduling is expected to solve the scalability problem of DetNet.
    One of the key technologies is to accurately obtain the cyclic mapping relationship
    between adjacent nodes and the packets can achieve the end-to-end deterministic
    forwarding. This draft describes the method for nodes to learn the cycle mapping
    relationship through sending learning messages.</p>"
