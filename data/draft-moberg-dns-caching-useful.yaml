abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo suggests that the usage of very small TTL values in SOA RRs
    [1] for dynamic environments such as when using DHCP with DNS dynamic updates
    [2] will affect the performance of the DNS as a whole in a negative manner and
    should therefore be avoided. However, this memo is in no way meant to be an exhaustive
    analysis of the issue, more of an invitation to discuss how to avoid future scalability
    issues while still providing expected service.</p>"
