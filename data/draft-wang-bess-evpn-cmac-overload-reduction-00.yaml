abstract:
- content: "<p>When there are too many customer-MACs (C-MACs), the RRs and/or ASBRs
    will be overloaded by the RT-2 routes for these MACs according to [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services].
    This issue can be simply solved by making the remote C-MAC entries learnt via
    data-plane MAC learning (like what PBB VPLS have been done since [RFC7041]) rather
    than received from RT-2 routes. This simplified solution will works as well as
    PBB VPLS. But this simplified solution will lose many important features that
    based on the ESI concept. Because the ingress-ESI can't be learnt via data-plane
    MAC learning at the egress PE. So when the data packets is forwarded following
    these MAC entries, they can't benefit from the EAD/EVI routes as per RFC7432.
    So the All-Active Redundancy mode for ES can't be supported. This make the simplified
    solution can't work as well as PBB EVPN ([RFC7623]). This document proposes a
    new SRv6 function type and an extension to [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services] to achieve
    all-active mode ES redundancy on TPEs and reduce the C-MAC loads for RRs and ASBRs.
    The new solution will work even more better than PBB EVPN under the help of these
    extensions.</p>"
