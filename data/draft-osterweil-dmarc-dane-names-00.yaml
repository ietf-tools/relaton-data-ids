abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes additions to the Domain-based Message Authentication,
    Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) Tag Registry to enable Mail administrators
    to specify the domain-wide policies for S/ MIME and PGP key usage in their mail
    domains, in conjunction with use of the DANE SMIMEA and OPENPGPKEY resource records.
    This would mean adding to the authentication mechanisms specified in RFC 7489,
    but it would specify only the domain-wide policies for S/MIME and PGP, such as
    what the policies are for signing and encrypting (does the sender mandate it,
    not allow it, etc.). This document also suggests the specification of the type
    of encoding of the left-hand sides used in the DANE resource records.</p>"
