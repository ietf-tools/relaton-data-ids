abstract:
- content: "<p>Forward-RTO recovery (F-RTO) specified in RFC 4138 is an algorithm
    for detecting a spurious retransmission timeout with TCP and SCTP. This document
    describes the advantages of F-RTO and summarizes the experience in its implementations
    and the experiments conducted with it. By analyzing the implications of the spurious
    retransmission timeouts on the regular RTO recovery and Forward-RTO recovery algorithm,
    including a detailed corner case analysis, it shows that F-RTO does not have negative
    impact on the network when used with an appropriate response algorithm even in
    the rare cases where F-RTO falsely declares a retransmission timeout spurious.
    It concludes with a recommendation that F-RTO is to be advanced to the standards
    track.</p>"
