abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF has several working groups that are considering the impact of
    NATs on various protocols. Having a classification of the types of NATs that are
    being developed and deployed is useful in gauging the impact of various solutions.
    This draft records the results of classifying NATs. This draft is not complete
    and has only a few test results but it is worth discussing results are collected.
    The test results here are very old and work is being done to update them with
    more current information. all the testing we wish to do before all the test</p>"
