abstract:
- content: <p>A conferencing system is defined by "A framework and Data Model for
    Centralized Conferencing" and represents a container for administering and managing
    all conference related information. The conference user concept is introduced
    in the framework to identify the entity participating in a conference and manipulating
    conferencing system related properties. This document defines a Conference User
    Identifier and provides some guidelines for identifying a specific conference
    user within a conferencing system. The document also provides some examples of
    the logical mapping of this conference user identifier to protocol and signaling
    interface specific user identifiers.</p>
