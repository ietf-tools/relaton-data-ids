abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolution of 6G networks and the expansion of Internet of Things
    (IoT) environments introduce new challenges in managing diverse networked resources.
    Intent-based management frameworks enable operators to express desired network
    outcomes using high-level intents, often articulated in natural language. However,
    converting these expressions into machine-executable policy configurations remains
    an open challenge. This document defines an intent translation framework designed
    to bridge the gap between user-issued intents and structured policy representations
    for 6G enabled IoT systems. The framework accepts natural language intent as input
    and produces a policy document in a structured format, such as YAML, that aligns
    with the intent model defined in 3GPP in [TS-28.312]. The framework consists of
    modular components responsible for processing input, aligning user intent with
    domain knowledge, evaluating semantic confidence, and generating standardized
    output. This modularity supports transparency, interoperability, and automated
    policy enforcement in next-generation network infrastructures.</p>"
