abstract:
- content: "<p>SenML [I-D.ietf-core-senml] defines an initial set of base and regular
    attributes which are tied to a particular version of SenML. SenML also allows
    the definition of additional attributes by extending the syntax with a new label.
    Allowing the extension of attributes brings the problem of how do endpoints negotiate
    whether the new attribute can be used or not? This document discusses the issue
    and proposes some potential solutions to this issue.</p>"
