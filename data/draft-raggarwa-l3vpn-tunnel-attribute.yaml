abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a mechanism that allows a router to signal the
    identifiers of IP/MPLS Tunnels, for which it is the headend, using Border Gateway
    Protocol (BGP). One application of this mechanism is multicast in BGP - Multi-Protocol-Label
    Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This document also proposes
    a mechanism that allows a router to signal its tunnel enapsulation/decapsulation
    capabilities using BGP. One application of this is signaling MPLS upstream label
    assignment capability when BGP is used to advertise MPLS upstream assigned labels.</p>"
