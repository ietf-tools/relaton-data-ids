abstract:
- content: "<p>As time goes on, more and more groups are extending HTTP's functionality.
    In using HTTP, a decision is made to either use a new method name for new functionality
    or to overload an existing one such as POST. Our belief is that in most cases,
    overloading existing method names, with POST as a particularly troublesome example,
    is a bad idea. We, as a group of individuals, suggest that the default requirement
    for new HTTP functionality must be to create a new method name.</p>"
