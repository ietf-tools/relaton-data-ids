abstract:
- content: "<p>Operating the global routing ecosystem entails a divers set of interacting
    components, while operational practice evolved over time. In that time, terms
    emerged, disappeared, and sometimes changed their meaning. To aid operators and
    implementers in reading contemporary drafts, this document provides an overview
    of terms and abbreviations used in the global routing operations community. The
    document explicitly does not serve as an authoritative source of correct terminology,
    but instead strives to provide an overview of practice.</p>"
