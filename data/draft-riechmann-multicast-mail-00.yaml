abstract:
- content: "<p>P_Mul is a proposal for an application protocol for the transfer of
    messages using a connectionless transport protocol. The objectives of this protocol
    are first to take advantage of the bandwidth saving feature of using the multicast
    service as supported by modern computer networks and second to allow message transfer
    under EMCON conditions. EMCON (Emission Control) means that, although receiving
    nodes are able to receive messages, they are not able to acknowledge the receipt
    of messages. The protocol described below has already been applied to the transfer
    of messages between X.400 Message Transfer Agents (MTA). But it is not only restricted
    to this application and can easily be applied to the transfer of RFC822 messages.</p>"
