abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the associativity-based long-lived routing
    (ABR) protocol for ad hoc mobile networks. It is a simple and bandwidth-efficient
    distributed routing protocols which does not attempt to consistently maintain
    routing information in every node. In an ad hoc wireless network where mobile
    hosts are acting as routers and where routes are made inconsistent by mobile hosts'
    movement, we propose an Associativity-based routing scheme where a route is selected
    based on nodes having associativity states that imply periods of spatial, temporal,
    connection and signal stability. In this manner, the routes selected are likely
    to be long-lived and hence there is no need to restart frequently, resulting in
    higher attainable throughput. Our proposed protocol is based on source-initiated
    on-demand routing. Route requests are broadcast on a per-need basis. To discover
    shorten the route discovery time when the association property is violated, the
    localized- query and quick-abort mechanisms are respectively incorporated into
    the protocol. The association property also allows the integration of ad hoc routing
    into a base station oriented wireless LAN environment, providing the fault tolerance
    in times of base station failures. This draft will describe the protocol functions
    and information about packet headers and routing tables.</p>"
