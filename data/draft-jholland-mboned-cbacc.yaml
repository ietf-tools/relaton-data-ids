abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion Control
    (CBACC). CBACC enables fast-trip Circuit Breakers by publishing rate metadata
    about multicast channels from senders to intermediate network nodes or receivers.
    The circuit breaker behavior is defined as a supplement to receiver driven congestion
    control systems, to preserve network health if receivers subscribe to a volume
    of traffic that exceeds capacity policies or capability for a network or receiver.</p>"
