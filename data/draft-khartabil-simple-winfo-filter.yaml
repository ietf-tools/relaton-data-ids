abstract:
- content: "<p>Watcher information template-package for the SIP event framework refers
    to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event
    package. The Watcher Information I-D does not describe a mechanism of how filtering
    of watcher information can be achieved. This document defines a watcher info filter.
    It provides the mechanism whereby a watcherinfo subscriber can specify the watcher
    info event filtering rules, using XML, for the notifier and how that notifier
    is to behave when receiving such filter.</p>"
