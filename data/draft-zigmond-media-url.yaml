abstract:
- content: "<p>World-Wide Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of consumer
    electronic devices, such as televisions and both cellular and wireline telephones.
    On these devices, some of the URL schemes described in [1] are inappropriate.
    For example, many of these devices lack local storage, so the 'file' scheme is
    of little use. However, these devices usually have access to other sources of
    information, such as television broadcasts and voice telephone services. This
    draft proposes three new URL schemes for accessing such information on appropriate
    devices.</p>"
