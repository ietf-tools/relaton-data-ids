abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates used
    to enable validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border Gateway Protocol
    (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol known as BGPsec. BGP is the standard
    for inter-domain routing in the Internet; it is the "glue" that holds the Internet
    together. BGPsec is being developed as one component of a solution that addresses
    the requirement to provide security for BGP. The goal of BGPsec is to provide
    full AS path validation based on the use of strong cryptographic primitives. The
    end-entity (EE) certificates specified by this profile are issued (to routers
    within an Autonomous System). Each of these certificates is issued under a Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Certification Authority (CA) certificate. These
    CA certificates and EE certificates both contain the AS Identifier Delegation
    extension. An EE certificate of this type asserts that the router(s) holding the
    corresponding private key are authorized to emit secure route advertisements on
    behalf of the AS(es) specified in the certificate. This document also profiles
    the format of certification requests, and specifies Relying Party (RP) certificate
    path validation procedures for these EE certificates. This document extends the
    RPKI; therefore, this documents updates the RPKI Resource Certificates Profile
    (RFC 6487).</p>
