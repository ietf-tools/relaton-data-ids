abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses how to build the large-scale mobile IPv6 network
    along with the MPLS network. It proposes that CR-LDP/RSVP-TE can be applied to
    set up the QoS guaranteed Label switched path (LSP) tunnels between an LER of
    mobile node and an LER of correspondent node. It means that the IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels
    can be replaced by one or multiple LSPs on the MPLS network. This follows design
    principles such as idle mobile node consideration and QoS guarantee, smooth handoff,
    no change of Mobile IPv6 etc.</p>"
