abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
    of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by a TRILL switch
    of sets of addresses. Each set of addresses reports all of the addresses that
    designate the same interface (port) and also reports the TRILL switch by which
    that interface is reachable. For example, a 48-bit MAC (Media Access Control)
    address, IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding to
    the same interface reachable by a particular TRILL switch. Such information could
    be used in some cases to synthesize responses to, or bypass the need for, the
    Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol,
    or the flooding of unknown MAC addresses.</p>"
