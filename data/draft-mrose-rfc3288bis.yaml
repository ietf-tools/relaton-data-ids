abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding
    to the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) core. A SOAP binding describes
    how SOAP messages are transmitted in the network. The SOAP is an XML-based (eXtensible
    Markup Language) messaging protocol used to implement a wide variety of distributed
    messaging models. It defines a message format and describes a variety of message
    patterns, including, but not limited to, Remote Procedure Calling (RPC), asynchronous
    event notification, unacknowledged messages, and forwarding via SOAP intermediaries.
