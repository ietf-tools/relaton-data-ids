abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet Draft aims at providing general guidelines for the AUTOCONF
    solution space, through providing a set of evaluation considerations for IP autoconfiguration
    mechanisms in MANETs. These evaluation considerations conform to the AUTOCONF
    problem statement draft and the MANET architecture draft. The main objective of
    this draft is to illustrate some key features and highlight some important behaviours
    for the different autoconf mechanisms, and thus aiming to help solution developers
    during mechanisms' design and to help implementers in the choice of the autoconf
    mechanism that fits better their particular requirements, taking into consideration
    a number of important factors that are discussed in this draft.</p>"
