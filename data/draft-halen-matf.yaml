abstract:
- content: "<p>This informational independent submission to the RFC series describes
    a means to use TLS 1.3 to perform machine-to-machine mutual authentication within
    federations. This memo is not a standard. It does not modify the TLS protocol
    in any way, nor does it require changes to common TLS libraries. TLS is specified
    and standardized by the IETF's TLS working group. The framework enables interoperable
    trust management for federated machine-to-machine communication. It introduces
    a centrally managed trust anchor and a controlled metadata publication process,
    ensuring that only authorized members are identifiable within the federation.
    These mechanisms support unambiguous entity identification and reduce the risk
    of impersonation, promoting secure and policy-aligned interaction across organizational
    boundaries.</p>"
