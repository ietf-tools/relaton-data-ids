abstract:
- content: "<p>In an EVPN network, EVPN PEs provide VPN bridging and routing service
    to connected CE devices based on BGP EVPN control plane. At present, there is
    no PE-CE control plane defined for an EVPN PE to learn CE MAC, IP, and any other
    routes from a CE that may be distributed in EVPN control plane to enable unicast
    flows between CE devices. As a result, EVPN PEs rely on data plane based gleaning
    of source MACs for CE MAC learning, ARP/ND snooping for CE IPv4/IPv6 learning,
    and in some cases, local configuration for learning prefix routes behind a CE.
    A PE-CE control plane alternative to this traditional learning approach, where
    applicable, offers certain distinct advantages that in turn result in simplified
    EVPN operation. This document defines a PE-CE control plane as an optional alternative
    to traditional non-control-plane based PE-CE learning in an EVPN network. It defines
    PE-CE control plane procedures and TLVs based on L3DL as the base protocol, enumerates
    advantages that may be achieved by using this PE-CE control plane, and discusses
    in detail EVPN use cases that are simplified as a result.</p>"
