abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines Epoch Markers as a means to establish a notion
    of freshness among actors in a distributed system. Epoch Markers are similar to
    "time ticks" and are produced and distributed by a dedicated system known as the
    Epoch Bell. Systems receiving Epoch Markers do not need to track freshness using
    their own understanding of time (e.g., via a local real-time clock). Instead,
    the reception of a specific Epoch Marker establishes a new epoch that is shared
    among all recipients. This document defines Epoch Marker types, including CBOR
    time tags, RFC 3161 TimeStampToken, nonce-like structures, and a CWT Claim to
    embed Epoch Markers in RFC 8392 CBOR Web Tokens, which serve as vehicles for signed
    protocol messages.</p>
