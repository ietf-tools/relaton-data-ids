abstract:
- content: "<p>The draft makes performance analysis in two kinds of resource exchange
    and discovery methods, tracker based and DHT based architectures in P2P streaming.
    Our analysis shows that centralized tracker solution for resource discovery (and
    chunk lookup) has much shorter response time than highly distributed DHT approach.</p>"
