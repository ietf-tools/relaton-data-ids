abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a method for improving the quality of experience
    (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using features and functions
    of the end-point only, that is, without requiring any upgrade to the network transport
    infrastructure. Any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure not only incurs
    significant costs, these are also time consuming and technology- dependent. Therefore,
    these QoE improvement mechanisms are significantly more attractive to both network
    operators and service providers.</p>"
