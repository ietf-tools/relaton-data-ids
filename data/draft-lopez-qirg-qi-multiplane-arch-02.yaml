abstract:
- content: "<p>A consistent reference architecture model for the Quantum Internet
    is required to progress in its evolution, providing a framework for the integration
    of the protocols applicable to it, and enabling the advance of the applications
    based on it. This model has to satisfy three essential requirements: agility,
    so it is able to adapt to the evolution of quantum communications base technologies,
    sustainability, with open availability in technological and economical terms,
    and pliability, being able to integrate with the operations and management procedures
    in current networks. This document proposes such an architecture framework, with
    the goal of providing a conceptual common framework for the integration of technologies
    intended to build the Quantum Internet infrastructure and its integration with
    the current Internet. The framework is based on the already extensive experience
    in the deployment of QKD network infrastructures and on related initiatives focused
    on the integration of network infrastructures and services.</p>"
