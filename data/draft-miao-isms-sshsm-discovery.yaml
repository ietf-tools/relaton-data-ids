abstract:
- content: <p>This document discusses several possible mechanisms of SNMP engine discovery
    when SSH is deployed as transport mapping for SNMP. The document proposes a discovery
    mechanism using UDP transport and User Based Security Model(USM) with a feature
    of SSH host key distribution. The mechanism tries to reduce discovery cost and
    in the same time improve SSH host key distribution efficiency. The draft is in
    "discussion" nature. Maybe there is text that is implementation-related, but the
    author believes it was not specific to a certain implementation.</p>
