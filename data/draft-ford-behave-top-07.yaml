abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies two deployment scenarios that have arisen
    from the unconventional network topologies formed using Network Address Translator
    (NAT) devices. First, the simplicity of administering networks through the combination
    of NAT and DHCP has increasingly lead to the deployment of multi-level inter-connected
    private networks involving overlapping private IP address spaces. Second, the
    proliferation of private networks in enterprises, hotels and conferences, and
    the wide-spread use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to access an enterprise
    intranet from remote locations has increasingly lead to overlapping private IP
    address space between remote and corporate networks. This document does not dismiss
    these unconventional scenarios as invalid, but recognizes them as real and offers
    recommendations to help ensure these deployments can function without a meltdown.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
