abstract:
- content: "<p>The Geolocation header introduces a mechanism to send a device location
    over an HTTP Secure Context from a user agent to a server. The Geolocation-Request
    header is used by a server to inform the user agent when a Geolocation header
    is requested to be sent. This mechanism, through persistent Geolocation-Requests,
    provides a single-roundtrip solution to obtain location-aware responses for location-aware
    services, as oposed to existing JS-based Geolocation API that require two round
    trips.</p>"
