abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant and disruption-tolerant
    networks, and is an evolution of the architecture originally designed for the
    Interplanetary Internet, a communication system envisioned to provide Internet-like
    services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration.
    This document describes an architecture that addresses a variety of problems with
    internetworks having operational and performance characteristics that make conventional
    (Internet-like) networking approaches either unworkable or impractical. We define
    a message- oriented overlay that exists above the transport (or other) layers
    of the networks it interconnects. The document presents a motivation for the architecture,
    an architectural overview, review of state management required for its operation,
    and a discussion of application design issues. This document represents the consensus
    of the IRTF DTN research group and has been widely reviewed by that group. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
