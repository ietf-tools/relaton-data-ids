abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes new challenges such as strict latency, constrained
    network bandwidth and devices, intermittent connectivity, privacy and security,
    for IoT services originated from the IoT environmental changes. In order to address
    those new challenges, the integration of Edge computing and IoT has been emerged
    as a promising solution. This document discribes the concept of IoT integrated
    with Edge computing as well as its use cases. It also discusses benefits and challenges
    of Edge computing. The direction of Edge computing for IoT should be discussed
    in the IETF/IRTF.</p>"
