abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes some circumstances that are common in SIP deployments
    which lack a rigorous authorization model, and points out some ways in which this
    has resulted in poor security characteristics. The purpose of this document is
    to stimulate discussion of the identified problem and proposed requirements for
    any solution. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the DISPATCH working
    group list at 'dispatch@ietf.org'.</p>"
