abstract:
- content: "<p>To allow interoperability between the existing telephone network and
    Internet Telephony (IT) it is necessary for the signaling performance to be comparable
    to that of the current standards to avoid introducing degradation in the service.
    In this Internet Draft, we discuss the performance requirements for TCAP signaling
    across an IP network. We also highlight the dependency on the SCP database location
    and thus problems related in providing high-quality service for TCAP based appli-
    cations.</p>"
