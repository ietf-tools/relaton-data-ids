abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes using the SCITT (Supply Chain, Integrity, Transparency,
    and Trust) protocol to record, communicate and coordinate the lifecycle of Virtual
    Conversations (vCons), which are standardized containers for conversational data
    like call recordings, transcripts, and chat logs. While vCons enable capturing
    and sharing conversation details for AI analysis and business purposes, they lack
    mechanisms for proving compliance with privacy regulations and consent management.
    SCITT addresses this by providing an immutable, append-only transparency ledger
    that records key lifecycle events—from vCon creation and consent management to
    call recording, as well as data processing and deletion—enabling entities to demonstrate
    regulatory compliance and maintain trust across distributed systems. The framework
    specifically addresses consent management challenges under regulations like GDPR
    and CCPA, where consent can be revoked at any time, requiring coordinated deletion
    across all parties that have received the vCon. By combining vCons with SCITT,
    organizations can build scalable, transparent governance systems that protect
    personal data rights while enabling responsible use of conversational data for
    AI and business applications.</p>"
