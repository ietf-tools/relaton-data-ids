abstract:
- content: "<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) introduced a mechanism whereby a
    mail operator can affix a signature to a message that validates at the level of
    the signer's domain name. It specified two possible ways of converting the message
    body to a canonical form, one intolerant of changes and the other tolerant of
    simple changes to whitespace within the message body. The provided canonicalization
    schemes do not tolerate changes in a message such as conversion between transfer
    encodings or addition of new message content. It is useful to have these capabilities
    to allow for transport through gateways, and also for transport through handlers
    (such as mailing list services) that might add content that would invalidate a
    signature generated using the existing canonicalization schemes. This document
    presents a mechanism for declaring that a message underwent one of a handful of
    well-defined transformations, so that a verifier might rewind such a modification
    and thereby confirm that the signature still verifies against the original content.</p>"
