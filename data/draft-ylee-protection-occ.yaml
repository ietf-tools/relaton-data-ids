abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper provides a framework for a protection scheme in the context
    of optical channel concatenation (OCC). The need and requirements for optical
    channel concatenation is addressed in a separate IETF draft, draft-damle-optical-channel-concatenation-00.txt,which
    has been submitted concurrently. This paper bascially provides mechanisms for
    faster failure detection and propagation of failure for concatenated optical channels.
    Standard-based MPLS protection schemes can be employed for the actual rerouting
    of traffic utilizing the detection and propagation mechanisms demonstrated in
    this paper.</p>"
