abstract:
- content: "<p>Microloops are transient packet loops that occur in the network following
    a topology change (link- down, link up, node fault, or metric change events).
    Microloops are caused by the non-simultaneous convergence of different nodes in
    the network. If a converged node sends traffic to a neighbor node that has not
    converged yet (or vice versa), traffic may be looped between these nodes, resulting
    in packet loss, jitter, and packet disorder. This document presents some optional
    implementation methods aimed at loop avoidance in different scenarios of IGP network
    convergence.</p>"
