abstract:
- content: <p>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allows multihoming
    by using multiple addresses. When communication between the initially chosen addresses
    for a transport session is no longer possible, a "shim" layer makes it possible
    to switch to a different set of addresses without breaking current transport protocol
    assumptions. This draft discusses the issues of detecting failures in a currently
    used address pair between two hosts and picking a new address pair to be used
    when a failure occurs. The input for these processes are ordered lists of local
    and remote addresses that are reasonably likely to work. (I.e., not include addresses
    that are known to be unreachable for local reasons.) These lists must be available
    at both ends of the communication, although the ordering may differ. Building
    these address lists from locally available information and synchronizing them
    with the remote end are outside the scope of this document. This text is for the
    most part based on discussions on the multi6 list, several multi6 design team
    lists and the shim6 list, with notable contributions from Erik Nordmark, Marcelo
    Bagnulo and Jari Arkko. Suggestions and additions are more than welcome.</p>
