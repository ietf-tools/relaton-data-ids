abstract:
- content: "<p>During the last few years, a number of proposals for extensions or
    improvements to email have run into trouble with a side-effect of mail relaying.
    In the current Internet Mail model, every SMTP server is required to break strict
    layering by inserting one or more additional 'trace' headers into the message
    headers which are actually part of the SMTP payload. Since the headers are altered
    in transit, header-signing is not an available option, various anti-spam and internationalization
    strategies are infeasible or much more complex, and so on. This document proposes
    to change the Internet mail model to place the in-transit trace information in
    the envelope, removing the requirement that relaying systems modify the message
    payload.</p>"
