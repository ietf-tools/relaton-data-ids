abstract:
- content: "<p>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) (RFC5245) defines protocol
    machinery for two peers to discover each other and establish connectivity in order
    to send and receive Media Streams. This draft raises some issues inherent in the
    assumptions with ICE and proposes a lightweight receiver driven protocol for asymmetric
    connectivity establishment.</p>"
