abstract:
- content: "<p>OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a communication protocol for industrial
    automation developed by the OPC Foundation. Compared with OPC, OPC UA provides
    a complete set of security mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality, data integrity
    and data availability. With the development of industrial internet of things,
    more and more nodes are expected to be implemented OPC UA, which are resource
    constrained. This draft discusses OPC UA security mechanisms and the applicability
    in a constrained environment. An outline of a lightweight security mechanism for
    OPC UA using in constrained device is proposed.</p>"
