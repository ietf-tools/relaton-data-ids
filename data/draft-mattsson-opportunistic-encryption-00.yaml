abstract:
- content: "<p>Following the recent pervasive monitoring revelations, one of the discussed
    remedies has been opportunistic encryption. In this paper, we give an overview
    of various opportunistic and unauthenticated encryption techniques, discuss their
    benefits, limits, and disadvantages, and try to conclude how effective they are
    as a mean to thwart pervasive monitoring.</p>"
