abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a method for making random selections in such
    a way as to promote public confidence in the unbiased nature of the choice. This
    method is referred to in this document as "verifiable selection". It focuses on
    the selection of the voting members of the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom)
    from the pool of eligible volunteers; however, similar or, in some cases, identical
    techniques could be and have been applied to other cases. This document obsoletes
    RFC 3797.</p>
