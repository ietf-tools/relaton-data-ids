abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses security threats to network-based localized
    mobility management. Threats may occur on two interfaces: the interface between
    a localized mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway, as well as the interface
    between a mobile access gateway and a mobile node. Threats to the former interface
    impact the localized mobility management protocol itself. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
