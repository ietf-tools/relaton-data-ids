- content: "<p>The Label-switched paths (LSPs) play fundument role in MPLS domain.
    Traditionally Label-switched paths (LSPs) are established by the network operator
    via CLI, SNMP or NETCONF for a variety of purposes, such as to create network-based
    IP virtual private networks or to route traffic along specified paths through
    the network. Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces
    provides an alternate way to create and maintain the LSPs.This document describes
    requirement and use case for which I2RS can be used for LSPs management.</p>"
