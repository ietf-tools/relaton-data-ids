abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
    support for the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), an authentication framework
    which supports multiple authentication mechanisms. In the proposed scheme, the
    Network Access Server (NAS) forwards EAP packets to and from the RADIUS server,
    encapsulated within EAP-Message attributes. This has the advantage of allowing
    the NAS to support any EAP authentication method, without the need for method-
    specific code, which resides on the RADIUS server. While EAP was originally developed
    for use with PPP, it is now also in use with IEEE 802. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
