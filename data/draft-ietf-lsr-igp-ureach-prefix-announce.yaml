abstract:
- content: "<p>In the presence of summarization, there is a need to signal loss of
    reachability to an individual prefix covered by the summary in order to enable
    fast convergence away from paths to the node which owns the prefix which is no
    longer reachable. This document describes how to use the existing protocol mechanisms
    in IS-IS and OSPF, together with the two new flags, to advertise such prefix reachability
    loss.</p>"
