abstract:
- content: "<p>The present invention Internet Protocol Version 16 (IPv16) service
    for allowing relates to the creation of an extended new version of Internet Protocol
    version 16 and its supports to current technologies and future technologies too
    without any interrupt. I propose New Internet Protocol version for technology
    upgradation and limitless end user connectivity and create new classes F and Class
    H, and Class I for extended to present classes and its performed Public, private,
    protected environment access with UWW for at the User Level, it is performed to
    operate both I and H Classes for Unlimited and Infinity High Security with multicast
    and Virtual IP address each block connectivity for an universal users and interstellar
    and expand universe users allocations. IP Address is run single IP address inherited
    desired Sub-IP address and extended upto X power n with Virtual IP and IP subsequences
    upto 2 power of x-n,proposed new series of 1024.1024.1024.1024 and VirtualIP works
    similar current way,and introduce Universal Wide Web (UWW) also Communicate Interstellar
    objects and Galaxies using Radio Signals are integrated with the proposed architecture,
    and Virtual IP - IPv16 to expand the internal space communications very quickly
    with secured allocated channels. Secured allocated individualrecognized block
    channels are connected with Internet and resolve tointerrupt signals and message
    transfer delayed problem, transfer data with secure way along with working mechanism
    the same existing technologies and IPv16 will adapt identifiedand undefined problems
    of IPv6 computer technology and network transmission problems to resolve the gaps
    between IPv6 to IPv16 and supports upcoming future technologies and versions too.</p>"
