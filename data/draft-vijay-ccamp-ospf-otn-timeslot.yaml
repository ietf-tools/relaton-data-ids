abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the extensions needed to OSPF for advertising
    the constraints that exists in some OTN switches while switching timeslots between
    ports. This advertisement would be needed for computing path of LSP through these
    switches taking into account the above mentioned constraint. This document proposes
    extensions to existing OSPF for advertising the timeslots available on each OTN
    port in a new sub-tlv and the connectivity matrix representing the capability
    of the device to cross connect these timeslots in another new sub-tlv</p>"
