abstract:
- content: "<p>[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication of
    LDAP directory contents. This document describes the information model and schema
    elements which support LDAP Replication Services which conform to [LDUP Model].
    Directory schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries, and attributes
    to describe areas of the namespace which are under common administrative authority,
    units of replication (ie, subtrees, or partitions of the namespace, which are
    replicated), servers which hold replicas of various types for the various partitions
    of the namespace, which namespaces are held on given servers, and the progress
    of various namespace management and replication operations. Among other things,
    this knowledge of where directory content is located will provide the basis for
    dynamic generation of LDAP referrals for clients who can follow them. The controlling
    framework by which the relationships, types, and health of replicas of the directory
    content will be defined so that, as much as possible, directory content is itself
    used to monitor and control the environment. Security information, including access
    control policy identifiers and information will be treated as directory content
    by the replication protocols when specified by the LDAPEXT group. The information
    model will describe required and optional house- keeping duties for compliant
    systems to implement, such as garbage collection of deleted objects, reconciliation
    of moved and renamed objects, update sequencing and transaction bracketing of
    changes, etc.</p>"
