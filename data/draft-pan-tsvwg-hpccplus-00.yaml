abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency,
    high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks. However, the existing
    high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations for reaching these goals. In this
    document, we describe HPCC++ (High Precision Congestion Control), a new high-speed
    CC mechanism which achieves the three goals simultaneously. HPCC++ leverages in-network
    telemetry (INT) to obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely.
    By addressing challenges such as delayed INT information during congestion and
    overreaction to INT information, HPCC++ can quickly converge to utilize free bandwidth
    while avoiding congestion, and can maintain near-zero in-network queues for ultra-low
    latency. HPCC++ is also fair and easy to deploy in hardware, implementable with
    commodity programmable NICs and switches.</p>"
