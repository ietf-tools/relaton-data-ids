abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines a method to reset a YANG datastore to its factory-default
    content. The reset operation may be used e.g. during initial zero-touch configuration
    or when the existing configuration has major errors, so re-starting the configuration
    process from scratch is the best option. A new reset-datastore RPC is defined.
    Several methods of documenting the factory-default content are specified. Optionally
    a new "factory-default" read-only datastore is defined, that contains the data
    that will be copied over to the running datastore at reset.</p>
