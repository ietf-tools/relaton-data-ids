abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes
    to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for bulk data transfer over
    IP multicast. This document defines a framework for the definition of the information
    that needs to be communicated in order to use an FEC code for bulk data transfer,
    in addition to the encoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes
    for communication of that information. Both information communicated with the
    encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band'
    are considered. The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information
    communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with
    the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described. The requirements
    on Content Delivery Protocols that wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework
    are also defined. The companion document titled "The Use of Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) in Reliable Multicast" describes some applications of FEC codes for delivering
    content. This document obsoletes RFC 3452. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
