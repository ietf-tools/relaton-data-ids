abstract:
- content: "<p>In a Layer 3 (L3) handoff procedure, one of the biggest components
    in terms of delay is introduced by the DHCP address acquisition time required
    for obtaining a valid IP address for the new subnet. Duplicate Address Detection
    (DAD) is the most time consuming part of the whole DHCP procedure. In this document
    we propose a new DAD scheme which has been proven to be effective without introducing
    any significant delay. By using such a scheme we can avoid duplicate address and
    at the same time keep the address acquisition time in the order of a few milliseconds.
    Using the new procedure will also permit to detect an unauthorized use of a particular
    IP address even if no duplicate IP has yet occurred.</p>"
