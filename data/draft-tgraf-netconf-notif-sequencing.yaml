abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a new YANG module that augment the NETCONF
    Event Notification header to support hostname, publisher ID and sequence numbers
    to identify from which network node and at which time the message was published.
    This allows the collector to recognize loss, delay and reordering between the
    publisher and the downstream system storing the message.</p>"
