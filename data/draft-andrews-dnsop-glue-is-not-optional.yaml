abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNS uses glue records to allow iterative clients to find the addresses
    of nameservers that live within the delegated zone. Glue records are expected
    to be returned as part of a referral and if they cannot be fitted into the UDP
    response, TC=1 MUST be set to inform the client that the response is incomplete
    and that TCP SHOULD be used to retrieve the full response.</p>"
