abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes mapping the RTP payload type to the port number
    of transport layer. The purpose of this mapping is to let UDP header information
    distinguish the payload type of a RTP packet. Packet classification using the
    UDP header information is a widely accepted method of applying QoS to the Internet
    traffic. The proposed method in this document does not require any changes of
    UDP packet format. Any method of classifying packets is outside the scope of this
    specification.</p>"
