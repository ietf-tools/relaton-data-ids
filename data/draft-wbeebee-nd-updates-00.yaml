abstract:
- content: "<p>RFC 2461 [ND] describes host data forwarding and address resolution.
    However, nine years after the ND protocol became an RFC, IPv6 hosts still do not
    fully comply with RFC 2461 [ND]. In particular, hosts incorrectly implement on-
    vs. off-link data forwarding. The set of new requirements beyond what has been
    specified in RFC 2461 [ND] and RFC 2462 [ADDRCONF] is restricted to clarifications
    deemed necessary to facilitate correct implementation. The intention of this document
    is to incorporate normative changes into</p>"
