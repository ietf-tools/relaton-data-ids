- content: "<p>This document addresses those requirements for IP spatial location
    protocol that emerges from the situation where mobile hosts (MH) use location
    information in the inter-domain mobility management. While IP spatial location
    protocol has many other usage cases, this document focuses on the requirements
    for mobile IP device that needs to know the whereabouts of IP subnetwork to be
    visited in order to prepare for handoff. Three inter-technology handoff (ITHO)
    scenarios and the related problems are presented, and the requirements for the
    system architecture, terminal and IP spatial location protocol are outlined.</p>"
