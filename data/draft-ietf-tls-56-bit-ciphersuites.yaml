abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes several cipher suites to be used with the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol. Changes in US export regulations in 1999 permitted
    the export of software programs using 56-bit data encryption and 1024-bit key
    exchange. The cipher suites described in this document were designed to take advantage
    of this change in the regulations.</p>"
