abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces a fast rerouting architecture for enhancing
    network resilience through rapid failure detection and swift traffic rerouting
    within the programmable data plane, leveraging in-band network telemetry and source
    routing. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the control plane and face significant
    delays in traffic rerouting, the proposed architecture utilizes a white-box modeling
    of the data plane to distinguish and analyze packet losses accurately, enabling
    immediate identification for link failures (including black- hole and gray failures).
    By utilizing real-time telemetry and SR- based rerouting, the proposed solution
    significantly reduces rerouting times to a few milliseconds, offering a substantial
    improvement over existing practices and marking a pivotal advancement in fault
    tolerance of datacenter networks.</p>"
