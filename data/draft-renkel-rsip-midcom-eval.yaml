    framework and protocol against the evaluation criteria provided by the MIDCOM

    in experimental RFCs 3102 (Realm Specific IP: Framework) [3] and 3103 (Realm Specific
    IP: Protocol Specification) [4]; see also RFCs 3104 (RSIP Support for End-to-end
    IPsec) [5] and 3105 (Finding an RSIP Server with SLP) [6] for more information
