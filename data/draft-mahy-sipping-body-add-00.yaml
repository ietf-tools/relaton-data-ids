abstract:
- content: "<p>The SIPPING Working Group has developed requirements for session policy
    (including bandwidth and codec restrictions, logging, and middlebox traversal),
    request history, and identity. This document discusses the pros and cons of allowing
    intermediaries to add SIP message bodies to address these requirements. It is
    intended to provoke serious discussion rather than as a complete proposal.</p>"
