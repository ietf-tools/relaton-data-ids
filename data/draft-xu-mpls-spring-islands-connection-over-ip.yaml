abstract:
- content: "<p>MPLS-SPRING is an MPLS-based source routing paradigm in which a sender
    of a packet is allowed to partially or completely specify the route the packet
    takes through the network by imposing stacked MPLS labels to the packet. To facilitate
    the incremental deployment of this new technology, this document describes a mechanism
    which allows the outermost LSP be replaced by an IP-based tunnel.</p>"
