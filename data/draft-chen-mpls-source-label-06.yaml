abstract:
- content: "<p>A MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) label was originally defined
    to identify a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). A packet is assigned to a specific
    FEC based on its network layer destination address, and optionally Class of Service.
    It's difficult or even impossible to derive the source identity information from
    the label. For some applications, source identification is a critical requirement.
    For example, performance monitoring, where the monitoring node needs to identify
    where a packet was sent from. This document introduces the concept of Source Identifier
    (SI) that identifies the ingress Label Switching Router (LSR) of a Label Switched
    Path (LSP). A SI is unique within a domain that is referred to as Source Identifier
    Administrative Domain (SIAD). This document also introduces the concept of Source
    Label (SL) that is carried in the label stack and carries the SI of the ingress
    LSR of an LSP. Source Label is preceded by a Source Label Indicator (SLI) when
    included the label stack and is not used for forwarding.</p>"
