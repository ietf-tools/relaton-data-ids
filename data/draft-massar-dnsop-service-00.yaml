abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new domain, _service., which can be used for
    automatic service configuration and discovery. The associated anycast prefixes
    can be used to configure a default DNS server, which provides lookups for a local
    _service. domain but also acts as a (caching) recursive DNS server, thus allowing
    DNS clients to use this well-known address as their default DNS server as well
    as to use it to find various well known services, thus avoiding manual configuration.</p>"
