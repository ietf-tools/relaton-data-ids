abstract:
- content: "<p>In traditional Internet architectures, current centralized mobility
    management solutions face scalability issues due to the creation of network bottlenecks
    and a single mobility agent of failures. To address these issues, we propose a
    Distributed Mobility Management solution in Locator/ID Separation Protocol (DMMLISP).
    We divide the network into many domains according to the area of Autonomous Systems
    (ASs). Each domain consists of a Mapping Server and several Tunnel Routers (xTRs).
    The Mapping Server stores global mappings between EID (Endpoint Identifier) prefixes
    and AS Numbers (ASNs) to lookup the mobile nodes'(MNs') home domain. Meanwhile,
    the Mapping Server also contains ASN-to-xTR mappings so that it can forward Map-
    Register and Map-Request messages to any xTR of the MN's home domain, thus enhancing
    reliability. In addition, the xTRs in each domain constitute one-hop DHT (Distributed
    Hash Table). Moreover, any xTR in the MN's home domain may be the home agent of
    MNs, and the MNs' EID-to-RLOC (Routing Locator) mapping is stored in two xTRs
    using two hash functions. In this way, it not only supports quick lookup but also
    improves scalability and survivability.</p>"
