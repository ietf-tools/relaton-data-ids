abstract:
- content: <p>This memo registers the Enumservice "foaf" using the URI schemes "http"
    and "https" according to the IANA Enumservice registration process defined in
    RFC3671. The Enumservice "foaf" is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain name
    to the location of a FOAF RDF file using the corresponding E.164 telephone number.
    Clients may use data retrieved from a FOAF RDF file to provide caller or callee
    with information available within the Friend-Of-A-Friend (FOAF) Semantic Web application.
    For example, the caller might be presented with personal information on the callee
    (e.g. name, gender and various online attributes) as well as information on the
    callee's social context (e.g. relations to friends or colleagues). Information
    collected from FOAF can be used before, during or after a communication is established.</p>
