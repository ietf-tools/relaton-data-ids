abstract:
- content: "<p>The proliferation of AI agents requires robust mechanisms for secure
    discovery. This document introduces the Agent Name Service (ANS), a novel architecture
    based on DNS addressing the lack of a public agent discovery framework. ANS provides
    a protocol-agnostic registry mechanism that leverages Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) certificates for verifiable agent identity and trust. The architecture features
    several key innovations: a formalized agent registration and renewal mechanism
    for lifecycle management; DNS-inspired naming conventions with capability-aware
    resolution; a modular Protocol Adapter Layer supporting diverse communication
    standards (A2A, MCP, ACP, etc.); and precisely defined algorithms for secure resolution.
    This specification describes structured communication using JSON Schema and includes
    a comprehensive threat analysis. The result is a foundational agent directory
    service protocol addressing the core challenges of secure discovery and interaction
    in multi-agent systems, paving the way for future interoperable, trustworthy,
    and scalable agent ecosystems.</p>"
