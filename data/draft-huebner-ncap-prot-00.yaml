abstract:
- content: "<p>This document outlines the protocol used by the NetIQ Common Agent
    as part of its NetIQ Common Agent Protocol (NCAP). This binary protocol is used
    over standard TCP sockets and provides both real-time event delivery and common
    RPC services to the NetIQ Common Agent Framework. These messages may be encrypted
    via SSL based on the handshake received during intial negotiation. Messages consist
    primarily of a standardized header and a variable-length body. Both message header
    and content are stored in sender-native form, pursuant to a reader-makes-right
    data flow.</p>"
