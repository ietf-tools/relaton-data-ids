abstract:
- content: "<p>The rapid development of Internet has driven more and more enterprises
    or individuals encapsulate operations on key data entities we call data service
    (DS). Due to the different fields between enterprise or individual, resulting
    in the description of data services appear semantic heterogeneity. In this paper,
    we propose a more principled approach to the problems of heterogeneous data service
    on the Web. We start with a data service description document pre-processing.
    Finally, we propose a unified description language model for data service, the
    Unified Description Language for Data Service (UDL4DS).</p>"
