abstract:
- content: "<p>The current SR FRR such as TI-LFA provides fast re-route protection
    for the failure of a node on an SR-MPLS path by the neighbor upstream node as
    point of local repair (PLR) of the failed node. However, once the IGP converges,
    the SR FRR is no longer sufficient to forward traffic of the path around the failure,
    since the non-neighbor upstream node of the failed node will no longer have a
    route to the failed node. This document describes a simple mechanism to extend
    the fast re-route protection for the failure on an SR-MPLS path after the IGP
    converges. The mechanism protects the node SID, adjacency SID and binding SID
    of the failed node on the path.</p>"
