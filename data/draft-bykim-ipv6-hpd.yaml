abstract:
- content: "<p>Stateless Autoconfiguration enables IPv6 hosts to send a request for
    a prefix, a network identifier to a router on the subnet. Using this ability a
    host can configure its IPv6 address. Likewise, by defining a way to request for
    a prefix to an upper level router, a router can get a prefix to be assigned to
    its subnet. This document describes a protocol for prefix delegation between routers.
    It allows routers get prefixes from its upstream routers, enabling the entire
    network and its belonging hosts autoconfigure their own addresses.</p>"
