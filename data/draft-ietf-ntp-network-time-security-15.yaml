abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Network Time Security (NTS), a collection of
    measures that enable secure time synchronization with time servers using protocols
    like the Network Time Protocol (NTP) or the Precision Time Protocol (PTP). Its
    design considers the special requirements of precise timekeeping which are described
    in Security Requirements of Time Protocols in Packet Switched Networks [RFC7384].</p>"
