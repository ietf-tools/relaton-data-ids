abstract:
- content: "<p>This document details an RSVP Policy Element that provides a mechanism
    by which RSVP reservation establishment can be reliably confirmed, end-to-end.
    This Policy Element provides a status update with each PATH message refresh, useful
    for determining the lifetime of a reservation end-to-end. Such a policy element
    will be useful for accounting and billing applications that are interested in
    reliably knowing when a reservation has been successfully established end-to-end
    and when a reservation is finally removed.</p>"
