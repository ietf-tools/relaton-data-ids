abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) is essential
    for network diagnostics but is vulnerable to off-path spoofing attacks, especially
    when error messages relate to stateless transport protocols like UDP. An attacker
    can forge these messages to degrade performance or enable Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
    This document explores solutions to this problem by first presenting a straightforward
    but flawed stateful challenge-response mechanism. It explains how this "strawman"
    approach, while preventing simple spoofing, introduces a severe vulnerability
    to state-exhaustion Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Building on this analysis,
    the document then proposes a robust, stateless challenge-response mechanism inspired
    by TCP SYN-Cookies. This proposal eliminates the need to store per-challenge state
    by computationally generating challenges. It limits state management to minimal
    flags on existing sockets or a bounded probabilistic data structure. This approach
    effectively authenticates ICMPv6 error messages while inherently resisting both
    off-path spoofing and state- exhaustion DoS attacks, thus improving the robustness
    of ICMPv6.</p>
