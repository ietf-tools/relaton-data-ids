abstract:
- content: "<p>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is the network-based mobility management
    protocol where access network supports the mobility of a mobile node on behalf
    of the MN. In PMIPv6, the location information of the MN should be registered
    to Localized Mobility Anchor and communication must be established via the LMA.
    Therefore, the performance can be degraded due to traffic concentration and congestion
    possibility. One method to overcome the above problems is to exploit the distributed
    mobility management (DMM) mechanism to distribute the LMA function to all access
    routers within the PMIPv6 domain. This document presents a fully distributed mobility
    management mechanism in PMIPv6-based network. In this mechanism, there is no need
    for the location management function to register the location of the MN.</p>"
