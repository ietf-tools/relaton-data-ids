abstract:
- content: "<p>Certain application protocols are highly transactional and require
    substantial care when dealing with latency. Queries for versioning information
    are, in these circumstances, costly. In addition, there is a desire to allow for
    a means to specify a lightweight means to alternative transport protocols, such
    as making use of SCTP instead of TCP. This memo specifies a new DNS RR with an
    eye toward the least necessary roundtrips to determine various protocols, port
    numbers, and options for a given service instance.</p>"
