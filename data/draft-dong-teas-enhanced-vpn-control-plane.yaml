abstract:
- content: "<p>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the
    needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated
    with 5G services. An enhanced VPN may be used for 5G transport network slicing,
    and will also be of use in more generic scenarios. [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn]
    describes the framework and candidate component technologies for providing enhanced
    VPN services. This document describes the control plane requirements, functions
    and considerations to enable VPN+ services. Specifically, the scalability of control
    plane is analyzed, and the proposed optimization mechanisms are described.</p>"
