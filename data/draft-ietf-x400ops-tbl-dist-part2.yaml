abstract:
- content: "<p>Mapping between X.400 and Internet mail and X.400 routing are normally
    done using a table-based approach. In practise tables are normal (ASCII) files.
    In order to function properly tables must be coordinated carefully. One major
    problem is the lack of automated procedures. This memo - together with it's companion
    document - proposes one possible solution. This memo discusses the over-all structure
    aspects, while the companion document discusses the transactions between two nodes.
    The same solution can be used to transport binary files. This way it is possible
    to mirror an entire archive with an e-mail only connectivity.</p>"
