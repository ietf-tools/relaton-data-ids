abstract:
- content: "<p>An organization that owns web content often prefers to delegate hosting
    of this content to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). To serve HTTP content securely,
    it needs to be protected with TLS. This document proposes a way for the CDN to
    request constrained certificates so that it can serve web content on behalf of
    the content owner, without having the owner's long term certificate.</p>"
