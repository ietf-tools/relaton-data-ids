abstract:
- content: "<p>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software-
    Defined Networking (SDN) systems. The PCE has been identified as an appropriate
    technology for the determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE
    Label Switched Paths (LSPs). A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify
    the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of
    SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the P2MP LSP can be
    calculated/set up/initiated and the label-forwarding entries can also be downloaded
    through a centralized PCE server to each network device along the P2MP path, while
    leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This document specifies
    the procedures and Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions
    for using the PCE as the central controller for provisioning labels along the
    path of the static P2MP LSP.</p>"
