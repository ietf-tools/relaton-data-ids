abstract:
- content: "<p>The Public Switched Telephone Network includes several mechanisms that
    increase the probability of completion for telephone calls made by authorised
    disaster relief personnel during emergencies such as hurricanes or terrorist attacks.
    This memo describes the security requirements of providing this functionality
    in private and public IP networks, and how these requirements can be met using
    existing protocols. It also specifies which enhancements are necessary to these
    protocols to allow enhanced functionality such as roaming access.</p>"
