abstract:
- content: "<p>Announcements in the past decade of better-than-expected collision
    attacks in popular hash algorithms have caused some people to question whether
    common Internet protocols need to be changed, and if so, how. This document summarizes
    the use of hashes in many protocols, discusses how the collision attacks affect
    and do not affect the protocols, shows how to thwart known attacks on digital
    certificates, and discusses future directions for protocol designers. It also
    gives rationales for moving away from some hash algorithms altogether and for
    choosing when to start using newer, presumably better, hash algorithms in Internet
    protocols. This document obsoletes RFC 4270 and introduces significant new material
    that has been learned since the publication of that document.</p>"
