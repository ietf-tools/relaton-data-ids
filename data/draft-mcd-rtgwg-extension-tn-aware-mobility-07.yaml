abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY]
    draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems' Slice and Service
    Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths between gNBs (generalized
    Node-B) and UPFs (User Plane Functions).The focus of that work is limited to the
    3GPP domain (i.e., gNB &lt;-&gt; UPFs) and doesn't cover the network between the
    UPFs and the services hosted in data centers. This document describes a framework
    for extending the mobility-aware transport network characteristics from the 3GPP
    domain through the IP Data Networks to the service destinations. Extending the
    framework to the data centers where the services are hosted becomes necessary
    to maintain the end-to-end transport network characteristics between UEs and their
    application servers.</p>"
