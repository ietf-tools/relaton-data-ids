abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes the intra-domain SAVNET architecture, which
    achieves accurate source address validation (SAV) in an intra-domain network by
    an automatic way. Compared with uRPF-like SAV mechanisms that only depend on routers'
    local routing information, SAVNET routers generate SAV rules by using both local
    routing information and SAV-specific information exchanged among routers, resulting
    in more accurate SAV validation in asymmetric routing scenarios. Compared with
    ACL rules that require manual efforts to accommodate to network dynamics, SAVNET
    routers learn the SAV rules automatically in a distributed way.</p>"
