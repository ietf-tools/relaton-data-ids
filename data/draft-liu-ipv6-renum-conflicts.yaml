abstract:
- content: "<p>While an IPv6 site is being renumbered, both DHCPv6 and ND may be used
    to reconfigure the host addresses. This may cause potential address configuration
    conflicts during renumbering procedure. The issue mainly include two situations:
    a) Address configuration method conflict, which means a host receives a new prefix
    comes from another address configuration protocol. b) Address prefix conflict,
    a host receives both DHCPv6 and ND address configuration messages which assign
    different address prefixes. This documents analyzes the conflict issues and proposes
    a conflict report mechanism for hosts to report the conflicts to DHCPv6 servers.</p>"
