abstract:
- content: "<p>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
    directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type). A syntax definition specifies
    how attribute values conforming to the syntax are normally represented when transferred
    in LDAP operations. This representation is referred to as the LDAP\\-specific
    encoding to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values. This
    document defines an attribute option, the binary option, that can be used to specify
    that the associated attribute values are instead encoded according to the Basic
    Encoding Rules (BER) used by X.500 directories. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
