abstract:
- content: "<p>[RFC7873] left the construction of Server Cookies to the discretion
    of the DNS Server (implementer) which has resulted in a gallimaufry of different
    implementations. As a result, DNS Cookies are impractical to deploy on multi-vendor
    anycast networks, because the Server Cookie constructed by one implementation
    cannot be validated by another. This document provides precise directions for
    creating Server Cookies to address this issue. Furthermore, [FNV] is obsoleted
    as a suitable Hash function for calculating DNS Cookies. [SipHash-2.4] is introduced
    as a new REQUIRED Hash function for calculating DNS Cookies. This document updates
    [RFC7873]</p>"
