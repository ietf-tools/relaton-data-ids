abstract:
- content: "<p>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that
    rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network
    access, the need for a standardized credentials provisioning and management framework
    is paramount. The 802.1x architecture allows for entities (e.g., devices, applications,
    etc.) to authenticate to the network by providing a communication channel where
    different methods can be used to exchange different types of credentials. However,
    the need for managing these credentials (i.e., provisioning and renewal) is still
    a hard problem to solve. EAP-CREDS, if implemented in Managed Networks (e.g.,
    Cable Modems), could enable our operators to offer a registration and credentials
    management service integrated in the home WiFi thus enabling visibility about
    registered devices. During initialization, EAP- CREDS also allows for MUD files
    or URLs to be transferred between the EAP Peer and the EAP Server, thus giving
    detailed visibility about devices when they are provisioned with credentials for
    accessing the networks. The possibility provided by EAP-CREDS can help to secure
    home or business networks by leveraging the synergies of the security teams from
    the network operators thanks to the extended knowledge of what and how is registered/authenticated.
    This specifications define how to support the provisioning and management of authentication
    credentials that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired, WiFi,
    cellular, etc.) to users and/or devices by using EAP together with standard provisioning
    protocols.</p>"
