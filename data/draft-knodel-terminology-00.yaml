abstract:
- content: "<p>This document argues for and describes alternatives that shift specific
    language conventions used by RFC Authors and RFC Editors to avoid oppressive terminology
    in the technical documentation of the RFC series. Specifically, this document
    details two sets of terms that are normalised on the technical level but oppressive
    on a societal level. First, arguments are presented for why any oppressive terms
    should be avoided by the IETF/IRTF. Second, problem statements for both sets of
    terms are presented and alternatives are proposed. There is a third section on
    additional considerations and general action points to address the RFC series,
    past and future. Lastly, a summary of recommendations is presented.</p>"
