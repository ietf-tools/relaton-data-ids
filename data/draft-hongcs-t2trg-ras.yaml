abstract:
- content: "<p>An efficient resource allocation scheme directly affects the overall
    system's network utilization, and notably, the wireless resource such as bandwidth
    is itself an expensive commodity. In this regards, to address the requirement
    of massively increased IoT traffic at the edge, as a solution approach, a number
    of small cell base stations (SBSs) have been deployed with certain computational
    capabilities. However, it is still limited, and any inappropriate resource allocation
    scheme for the associated nodes with traffic characterized by ultra-reliability
    and low-latency (URLLC) requirements can impact the system's resource utilization
    and performance. Considering a reserve resource for such kind of traffic, the
    resource allocation problem in each time slot behaves as a node selection problem
    with contention amongst active nodes for the resource. In this paper, we have
    formulated this as an index problem, and with simulation results have shown that
    the cumulative reward in terms of network utility is maximized following this
    approach.</p>"
