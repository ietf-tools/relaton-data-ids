abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes procedures for carrying MPLS PWs [PWARCH, LDP-CONTROL]
    over IP, GRE or IPsec tunnels. The outermost PSN tunnel encapsulation of the PW
    is IP, GRE or IPsec, instead of a MPLS label when the PW is carried over an MPLS
    network. This enables the PW packets to be carried over non-MPLS networks.</p>"
