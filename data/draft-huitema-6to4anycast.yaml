abstract:
- content: "<p>The operation of 6to4 routers require either that participation in
    IPv6 inter-domain routing, or that the routers be provisioned with a default route.
    This memo proposes a standard method to define the default route. It requires
    that IANA assign a '6to4 Relay anycast prefix' from which 6to4 routers can derive
    the static '6to4 anycast address'. In order to enable efficient management of
    the '6to4 Relay anycast prefix' in IPv4 inter-domain routing, this memo also requests
    the reservation by IANA of a '6to4 Autonomous System ID.' With this definition,
    the proposed scheme guarantees that 6to4 packets will be automatically routed
    to the nearest available router. It allows the managers of the 6to4 relay routers
    to control the sources authorized to use their resource. It makes it easy to set
    up a large number of 6to4 relay routers, thus enabling scalability.</p>"
