abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes a compact and fast hybrid signature scheme that
    can be used to solve the problem of packet source authentication for multicast.
    The scheme can be viewed as an improvement to off-line/on-line signature schemes,
    in that the signature size overhead is much smaller although still significant.
    This scheme offers several advantages over other schemes for multicast source
    authentication. Firstly, the scheme provides the same security guarantees as regular
    public key signatures, but the signature computation is an order of magnitude
    faster. Secondly, this scheme permits each individual packet to be signed independently
    and efficiently, thus avoiding sender side latency found in schemes which need
    to spread a signature computation over several outgoing packets in order to achieve
    efficiency. This makes the scheme suitable in highly interactive settings where
    latency is an issue. This feature also make the scheme useful in settings where
    several different signatures need to be computed for by a single server machine
    for several different, low rate flows. Thirdly, this is an off-line/on-line scheme
    where most of the computational load is in the off-line stage, thus the scheme
    is ideally suited to situations where the signer machine has very irregular load.
    Finally, the scheme produces fixed sized authentication information (or signatures)
    so that applications know a-priori the authentication overhead.</p>"
