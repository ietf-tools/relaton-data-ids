abstract:
- content: <p>This document extends the PASSporT object to convey cryptographically-signed
    assertions of authorization for communications 'Resource-Priority'. It extends
    PASSporT to allow cryptographic-signing of the SIP 'Resource-Priority" header
    field which is used for communications resource prioritization. It also describes
    how the PASSPorT extension is used in SIP signaling to convey assertions of authorization
    of the information in the SIP 'Resource-Priority' header field.</p>
