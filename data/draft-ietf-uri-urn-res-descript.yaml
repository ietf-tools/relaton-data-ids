abstract:
- content: "<p>This document gives an overview of how Uniform Resource Names (URNs)
    will be resolved. It describes how different URN resolution schemes will fit together,
    the requirements for the multiple URN schemes, expectations for URN clients, and
    other general resolution issues. This document does not cover any specific resolution
    schemes, the syntax for URNs, or the format of resolution results. It is expected
    that these issues (and other URN-related topics) will be covered in different
    Internet Drafts submitted to the IETF URI Working Group.</p>"
