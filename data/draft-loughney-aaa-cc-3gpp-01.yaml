abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the IANA's allocation of a block of Diameter
    Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 5. This
    document does not pass judgment on the usage of these command codes. Further more,
    these command codes are for use for Release 5. For future releases, these codes
    cannot be reused, but must be allocated according to the Diameter Base specification.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
