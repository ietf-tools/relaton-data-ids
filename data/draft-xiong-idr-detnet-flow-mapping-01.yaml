abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes extensions to BGP Flow Specification for the
    flow mapping of Deterministic Networking (DetNet) when interconnected with IEEE
    802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). The BGP flowspec is used for the filtering
    of the packets that match the DetNet newtworks and the mapping between TSN streams
    and DetNet flows in the control plane.</p>"
