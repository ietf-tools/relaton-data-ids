abstract:
- content: "<p>Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform
    the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on the same flow.
    In order to make ConEx information useful, reliable auditing is necessary to provide
    a strong incentive to declare ConEx information honestly. However, there is always
    a delay between congestion events and the respective ConEx signal at the audit.
    In order to also provide a signal for risking congestion in the future, in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech]
    it is proposed to use credit signals sent in advance. This document defines how
    the signals are interpreted by an audit and lists requirements for an audit implementation.
    It also discusses the security of the proposed system and lists potential attacks
    on it.</p>"
