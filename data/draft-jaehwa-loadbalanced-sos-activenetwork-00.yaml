abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure overlay services (SOS) architecture has been proposed to provide
    reliable communication between clients and a target under DDoS attacks. The SOS
    architecture employs a set of overlay nodes arranged in three hierarchical layers
    that controls access to the target. Although the architecture is novel and works
    well under simple congestion based attacks, we observe that it is flimsy after
    it resisted the DDoS for a period of time and it didn't pay attention to the endurance
    of the Nodes. We propose an Algorithm to improve the secure overlay services (SOS)
    both on load balance and resilient.</p>"
