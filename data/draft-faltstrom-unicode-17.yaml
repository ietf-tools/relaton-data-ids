abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the changes between Unicode 12.0.0 and Unicode
    17.0.0 in the context of IDNA2008. Some additions and changes have been made in
    the Unicode Standard that affect the values produced by the algorithm IDNA2008
    specifies. The review assigns the derived property value "UNDER REVIEW" to certain
    code points. This is added as exceptions to the algorithm for IDNA2008 that allows
    adding exceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility exceptions. This
    document provides the necessary tables to IANA to make its database consistent
    with Unicode 17.0.0.</p>
