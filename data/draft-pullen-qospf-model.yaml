abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a detailed simulation model of a sizable IPmc/RSVP
    network using the Quality of Service Extensions to OSPF and the performance predictions
    produced by the model. The model was developed using the OPNET simulation package
    with procedures defined in the C language. The model was developed to allow investigation
    of scaling characteristics of QoS routing by the Internet multicast/resource reservation
    community. We are making our model publicly available for this purpose.</p>"
