abstract:
- content: "<p>IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy
    Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications, such as field
    monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
    has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551],
    RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes
    for LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point.
    RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from one or more roots that act as
    sinks. As a result, a DAG is partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented
    DAGs (DODAGs), one DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing
    protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops caused by local DODAG repair mechanism
    is an issues to be addressed. This draft introduces a loop free local DODAG repair
    mechanism. This draft also introduces a piggybacked data option for transferring
    delay sensitive data during route repair process. The piggybacked data can be
    included in DODAG Repair Request (DRQ) message or DODAG Information Solicitation
    (DIS) message.</p>"
