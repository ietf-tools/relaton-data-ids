abstract:
- content: "<p>In IPv6, the current IPv4 site multihoming practises have been operationally
    disabled, to prevent a creation of an unmanageable swamp of more specific routes.
    Some argue that the lack of a comprehensive site multihoming solution is hindering
    the deployment of IPv6. This memo presents a few proposals for end-sites with
    autonomous system (AS) number to be able to derive a provider independent block
    of addresses from the first half of the 16-bit AS- number space. This could enable
    a temporary IPv6 site multihoming solution for those that already employ similar
    mechanisms in IPv4.</p>"
