abstract:
- content: "<p>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been extended to encompass
    point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). As with point-to-point
    MPLS LSPs, the requirement to detect, handle, and diagnose control and data plane
    defects is critical. For operators deploying services based on P2MP MPLS LSPs,
    the detection and specification of how to handle those defects are important because
    such defects not only may affect the fundamentals of an MPLS network, but also
    may impact service level specification commitments for customers of their network.
    This document describes requirements for data plane operations and management
    for P2MP MPLS LSPs. These requirements apply to all forms of P2MP MPLS LSPs, and
    include P2MP Traffic Engineered (TE) LSPs and multicast LSPs. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>"
