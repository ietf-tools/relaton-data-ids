abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents steps undertaken for developing a methodology
    to map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion
    and protection of Human Rights, particularly the right to freedom of expression
    and association. It feeds upon and is intended to facilitate the work done by
    the proposed Human Rights Protocol Considerations research group, as well as other
    authors within the IETF. Exemplary work [RFC1984] [RFC6973] [RFC7258] has already
    been done in the IETF on privacy issues that should be considered when creating
    an Internet protocol. But, beyond privacy considerations, concerns for freedom
    of expression and association were also a strong part of the world-view of the
    community involved in developing the first Internet protocols. Indeed, promoting
    open, secure and reliable connectivity is essential for these rights. But how
    are this concepts addressed in the protocol level? Are there others? This ID is
    intended to explain research work done so far and to explore possible methodological
    approaches to move further on exploring and exposing the relations between standards
    and protocols and the promotion and protection of the rights to freedom of expression
    and association. Discussion on this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org // https://www.irtf.org/mailman/admindb/hrpc</p>"
