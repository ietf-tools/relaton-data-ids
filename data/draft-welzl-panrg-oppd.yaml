abstract:
- content: <p>This document surveys possibilities for On-Path Proxy Discovery (OPPD).
    It is meant to help the conversation in a planned side meeting at IETF-121 in
    Dublin (see the github page linked under "About This Document" for coordinates).
    The draft title indicates PANRG as a target of this document just because we thought
    that PANRG should be informed. What a suitable target is, and if this is even
    the right type of document, should all be discussed at the side meeting.</p>
