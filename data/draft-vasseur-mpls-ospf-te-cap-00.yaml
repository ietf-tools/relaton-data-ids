abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes OSPF traffic engineering capability TLVs. Two capability
    TLVs are defined in the current draft: the Path Computation Server Discovery (PCSD)
    TLV that allows a router to announce its Path Computation Server capability to
    other LSRs within an OSPF area or a routing domain and the Mesh-group TLV used
    by an LSR to indicate its desire to participate to a mesh of Traffic Engineering
    Label Switched Path (this mesh of TE LSPs is identified by a mesh-group number).
    They are both used in the context of MPLS Traffic Engineering. Additional OSPF
    TE capability TLVs may be added in further revision of this draft. Those OSPF
    TE capability TLVs will be carried within the OSPF router information LSA (opaque
    type of 4, opaque ID of 0) defined in [18].</p>"
