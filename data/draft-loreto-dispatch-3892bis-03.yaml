abstract:
- content: "<p>SIP Referred-By header field conveys the referrer identity of a request.
    This header field may be used when exploding a SIP MESSAGE or a SIP INVITE request
    to a pre-defined group URI and the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header
    field in the exploded SIP requests needs to carry another value (e.g. the URI
    of a pre- defined group, or a conference focus URI). In those cases, the Referred-By
    header field in the resulting exploded requests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity
    or to the From header field value of the original SIP request received before
    exploding, so as to convey to the receiver the identity of the original inviting
    sender. RFC 3892 restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI. However
    the P-Asserted-Identity header field currently allows two URI values and may be
    expanded in the future to carry more than two values as described in RFC5876.
    This document extends the Referred-By definition to support more than one value
    as well.</p>"
