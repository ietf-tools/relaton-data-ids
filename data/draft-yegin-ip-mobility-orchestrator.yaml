abstract:
- content: "<p>Host stacks can support mobility at multiple layers. Mobility protocols
    operating at different layers constitute alternate solutions with various pros
    and cons, and they can also have adverse affects on each other when used simultaneously.
    Optimal results in terms of seamless handover and data-path optimization can be
    achieved when execution of these protocols are coordinated.</p>"
