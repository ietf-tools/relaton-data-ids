abstract:
- content: "<p>As the BGP is deployed in a single Autonomous System for network convergence
    such as Seamless MPLS, it is desirable for BGP to carry more information to help
    select routing more intelligently. It can reduce the cost proposed by complex
    policy control design on BGP routes and adapt to network change easily. This document
    proposed a new path attribute for BGP routes that can record the next hop path
    for the route to help BGP route selection and network management.</p>"
