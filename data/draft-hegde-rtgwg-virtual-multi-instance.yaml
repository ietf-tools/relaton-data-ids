abstract:
- content: "<p>In networks with routers of different capabilities, some routers may
    not be able to participate fully in supporting new features or handling large
    databases and the associated flooding. In some cases, these restrictions can cause
    severe scalability issues for the network in general. This document proposes virtual
    multi-instances, a generic mechanism for OSPF and IS-IS, that allows groups of
    routers in specific topologies to have a reduced database and reduces the topology
    changes that are seen. The virtual multi-instances are specified so that no software
    or protocol changes are required in the restricted routers. Due to the potential
    number of virtual multi- instances in a network, the configuration is limited
    and is not specified per virtual instance.</p>"
