abstract:
- content: "<p>The Observe Option allows a CoAP client to observe changes in the state
    of resources and obtain a current representation of the last resource state. To
    be an observer of an origin server's resources, the client is required to register
    its interest with the server. A successful registration will make the client added
    into the server's observation list, while a failed one MAY drive the client to
    re- register. However, repeated and frequent re-registrations cannot guarantee
    the client to eventually become an observer of the target server. In the case
    that the server is unable or unwilling to accept an observer, the time-intensive
    re-registrations will just bring redundant messages in the constrained network
    and considerable energy consumption on both the client and the server. This memo
    defines a new CoAP option, State, for providing stateful observation on the resources
    of CoAP servers. By observing the state of the server in terms of the Observe
    Option, a client can explicitly learn when the server will not actively reject
    an observation registration, and then can wisely performs the re-registration.
    This avoids the potential registration flooding that causes considerable network
    overhead and energy consumption on the constrained nodes.</p>"
