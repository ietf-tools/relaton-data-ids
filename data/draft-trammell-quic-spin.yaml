abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes the addition of a "spin bit", intended for explicit
    measurability of end-to-end RTT, to the QUIC transport protocol. It proposes a
    detailed mechanism for the spin bit, as well as an additional mechanism, called
    the valid edge counter, to increase the fidelity of the latency signal in less
    than ideal network conditions. It describes how to use the latency spin signal
    to measure end-to-end latency, discusses corner cases and their workarounds in
    the measurement, describes experimental evaluation of the mechanism done to date,
    and examines the utility and privacy implications of the spin bit.</p>
