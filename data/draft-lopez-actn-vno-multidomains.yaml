abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for facilitating
    the application of virtual network abstractions to network operation. These abstractions
    shall create a virtualized environment supporting operators in viewing and controlling
    different domains as a single virtualized network. Each domain can be created
    due to the applied technology, administrative zones, or vendor-specific technology
    islands).Such an approach will facilitate the deployment of NFV (Network Function
    Virtualization) mechanisms, and accelerate rapid service deployment of new services,
    including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve overall network operations
    and scaling of existing services. This use-case considers the application of these
    abstractions within the network of a single operator.</p>"
