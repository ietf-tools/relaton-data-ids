abstract:
- content: "<p>Cache consistency is a major impediment to scalable content delivery,
    because periodical revalidating objects one by one is unacceptable in terms of
    performance and/or cache consistency. This document describes the Web Cache Invalidation
    Protocol (WCIP). WCIP uses invalidations and updates to keep changing objects
    up to date in web caches. It thus enables proxy caching and content distribution
    of large amounts of frequently changing web objects.</p>"
