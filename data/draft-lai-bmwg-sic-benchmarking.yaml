abstract:
- content: <p>Entering the "NewSpace" era, satellite Internet constellations (SIC)
    are scaling up at a fast pace. Emerging satellite networks constructed upon SICs
    enable great opportunities for ubiquitous and low-latency Internet services globally.
    It should be useful for satellite service providers to run various laboratory
    experiments to comprehensively and systematically benchmark the network performance
    of their new network techniques before launching them to the outer space. However,
    existing benchmarking methodologies for terrestrial networks either achieve fidelity
    but lack flexibility or achieve flexibility but lack fidelity. This draft describes
    our basic considerations as specifications to guide the network performance benchmark
    for SICs. A satellite network constructed upon emerging SICs in low earth orbit
    has many unique characteristics as compared to existing terrestrial networks.
    Specifically, our considerations include multiple networking models of emerging
    SICs, a data-driven benchmarking approach which may enable testers to build a
    laboratory benchmark environment with acceptable flexibility and fidelity to support
    various experiments, critical configuration parameters that might affect the SIC
    network performance, and several suggested test cases for network performance
    benchmarking.</p>
