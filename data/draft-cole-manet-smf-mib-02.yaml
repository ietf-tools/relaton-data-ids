abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
    for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular,
    it describes objects for configuring aspects of the Simplified Multicast Forwarding
    (SMF) process. The SMF MIB also reports state information, performance metrics,
    and notifications. In addition to configuration, this additional state and performance
    information is useful to management stations troubleshooting multicast forwarding
    problems.</p>"
