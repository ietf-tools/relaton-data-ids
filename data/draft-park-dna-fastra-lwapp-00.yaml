abstract:
- content: "<p>To provide fast handover in mobile environment, mobile node has to
    discover neighbor router in visited network because of configuring new IPv6 address
    as care-of address. This document proposes new method so as to reduce time delay
    when mobile node moves to a new link particularly supporting LWAPP. This extension
    is targeted to Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) as well as to LWAPP.</p>"
