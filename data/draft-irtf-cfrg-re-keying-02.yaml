abstract:
- content: "<p>If encryption is performed under a single key, there is a certain maximum
    threshold amount of data that can be safely encrypted. This amount is called key
    lifetime. This specification contains a description of a variety of methods to
    increase the lifetime of symmetric keys. It provides external and internal re-keying
    mechanisms based on hash functions and on block ciphers that can be used with
    such modes of operations as CTR, GCM, CCM, CBC, CFB, OFB and OMAC.</p>"
