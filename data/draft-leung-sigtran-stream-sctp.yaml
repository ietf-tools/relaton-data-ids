abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes two stream function extensions to SCTP (Stream
    Transmission Control Protocol) [SCTP]. These extensions are to allow dynamic modifications
    of stream status when U-SCTP (Unreliable Extension to SCTP) [USCTP] is activated
    and on demand insertion/deletion of streams within a SCTP association. These extensions
    will provide a better support of multimedia applications since they allow users
    to set and modify communication options, say the choices of transport and reliability
    requirements, on the fly.</p>"
