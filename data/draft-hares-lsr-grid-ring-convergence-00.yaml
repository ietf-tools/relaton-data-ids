abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft describes problems with IGP convergence time in some IPRAN
    networks that use a physical topology of grid backbones that connect rings of
    routers. Part of these IPRAN network topologies exist in data centers with sufficient
    power and interconnections, but some network equipment sits in remote sites impacted
    by power loss. In some geographic areas these remote sites may be subject to rolling
    blackouts. These rolling power blackouts could cause multiple simultaneous node
    and link failures. In these remote networks with blackouts, it is often critical
    that the IPRAN phone network re- converge quickly. The IGP running in these networks
    may run in a single level of the IGP. This document seeks to briefly describe
    these problems to determine if the emerging IGP technologies (flexible algorithms,
    dynamic flooding, layers of hierarchy in IGPs) can be applied to help reduce convergence
    times. It also seeks to determine if the improvements of these algorithms or the
    IP-Fast re-route algorithms are thwarted by the failure of multiple link and nodes.</p>"
