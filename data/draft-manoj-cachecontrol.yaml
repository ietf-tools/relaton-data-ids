abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cache-Control general-header field of HTTP/1.1 [1] is used to specify
    directives that must be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response
    chain. This document details an extension to the cache-control header to enable
    caching of resources for dynamic sets of users who are grouped under certain attributes.
    Also this document specifies user-defined header extensions of HTTP/1.1 [1], which
    allow these clients to be served from the group caches.</p>"
