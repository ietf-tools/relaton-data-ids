abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a novel network address encoding scheme, called
    Network Geoidentifier (NGID), which aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy
    of network device management by directly embedding geolocation information (latitude
    and longitude) into IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. This approach provides a native support
    for the geolocation of network devices and is expected to have a significant impact
    on the future of network management and service positioning.</p>"
