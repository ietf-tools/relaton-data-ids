abstract:
- content: "<p>This document analyses the routing requirements of different types
    of clients, and then proposes a P2P client routing mechanism for REsource LOcation
    And Discovery (RELOAD). This mechanism is designed to solve the issues in one
    of the client routing options described in the RELOAD Base protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base],
    where clients are allowed to connect with arbitrary peers. The solution is to
    store the information of a client's Attached Peer in the overlay together with
    the registration data of the client. The extension could be deployed on SIP usage
    of RELOAD easily [I-D.draft-ietf-p2psip-sip].</p>"
