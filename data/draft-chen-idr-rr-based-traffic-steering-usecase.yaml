abstract:
- content: "<p>Route Reflection based Traffic Steering (RRTS) is an idea that leverages
    the BGP route reflection mechanism to realize traffic steering in the network,
    therefore the operators can conduct their traffic to transmit/receive through
    specific nodes, domains and/or planes as demand. This document introduces the
    requirements and use cases of RRTS.</p>"
