abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange Protocol
    Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take place while computing
    a shared secret during a Security Association (SA) setup. The primary application
    of this feature in IKEv2 is the ability to perform one or more post-quantum key
    exchanges in conjunction with the classical (Elliptic Curve) Diffie-Hellman (EC)DH
    key exchange, so that the resulting shared key is resistant against quantum computer
    attacks. Since there is currently no post-quantum key exchange that is trusted
    at the level that (EC)DH is trusted against conventional (non-quantum) adversaries,
    performing multiple key exchanges with different post-quantum algorithms along
    with the well-established classical key exchange algorithms addresses this concern,
    since the overall security is at least as strong as each individual primitive.
    Another possible application for this extension is the ability to combine several
    key exchanges in situations when no single key exchange algorithm is trusted by
    both initiator and responder. This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange
    to perform multiple key exchanges when an IKE SA is being established and introduces
    a new IKEv2 exchange IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE to perform them when IKE SA is up (during
    rekeys or creating additional Child SAs). This document updates RFC7296 by renaming
    a transform type 4 from "Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)" to "Key Exchange Method (KE)"
    and renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from "Diffie-Hellman Group Num"
    to "Key Exchange Method". It also renames an IANA registry for this transform
    type from "Transform Type 4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs" to "Transform
    Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform IDs". These changes generalize key exchange
    algorithms that can be used in IKEv2.</p>
