abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an IPv6-IPv4 compatibility aggregatable global
    unicast address format and its application for incremental IPv6 deployment for
    hosts and routers within predominantly IPv4-based Intranets. This document assumes
    that, during the IPv4 to IPv6 co- existence and transition phase, many sites will
    deploy IPv6 incrementally (not all at once) on hosts and routers within their
    pre-existing IPv4 interior routing domains; especially those sites which have
    large and complex pre-existing IPv4 infrastructures. In such cases, the address
    format and methods described in this document will enable IPv6 deployment for
    hosts and routers which do not share a common multiple access datalink with their
    default IPv6 gateways.</p>"
