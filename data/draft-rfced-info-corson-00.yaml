abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes the problem of routing and resource reservation
    in mobile mesh networks and presents architectural recommendations necessary for
    Internet protocols to operate effectively in these environments. A 'mobile mesh'
    network is an autonomous system of mobile routers connected by wireless links,
    the union of which form an arbitrary graph. The routers are free to move randomly;
    thus, the network's wireless topology may change rapidly and unpredictably. The
    memo first describes the generic operation of mobile networks and highlights their
    key characteristics: randomly changing network connectivity and congested operation.
    Next, it focuses on routing and concludes that highly adaptive, multipath routing
    is necessary for congestion avoidance in mobile networks. It then focuses on the
    process of route selection and reservation setup and advocates an integrated approach
    for supporting quality-of-service-based delivery in the presence of congestion.
    Finally, it puts forth recommendations for an efficient architecture for supporting
    unicast and multicast delivery of best effort and reservation-based traffic in
    mobile networks.</p>"
