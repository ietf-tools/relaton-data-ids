abstract:
- content: "<p>The Domain Name System is a global distributed lookup system with delegation.
    In the original specification of the DNS [RFC 1035], CLASSes were described as
    parallel data structures within a single namespace but with potentially different
    delegations of authority. [BCP 42] defines a different vision, in which different
    CLASSes represent fundamentally different namespaces. Though [BCP 42] includes
    procedures for assignment of CLASSes, there has been little use of this axis of
    extensibility; in practice, CLASS IN is the only widely deployed CLASS in the
    DNS. The ubiquity of CLASS IN for name to IP address mapping has caused a vicious
    cycle in which extensions are placed within that CLASS to take advantage of its
    global deployment, with each addition further increasing its gravitational attraction.
    This document describes a Resource Record for use within CLASS IN that contains
    a pointer to a CLASS outside of IN. This mechanism is intended to allow administrators
    to indicate that a named resource identified within CLASS IN is also present in
    a different namespace, potentially under a different name. This cross-class pointer
    will allow the DNS to handle new namespaces with mechanisms appropriate to those
    namespaces while providing a connection to the globally deployed CLASS IN namespace.</p>"
