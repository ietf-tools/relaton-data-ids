abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF's Inter-Domain Multicast Routing (IDMR) working group has
    produced several multicast routing protocols, including Core Based Trees [CBT]
    and Protocol Independent Multicasting [PIMARCH]. In addition, the IDMR WG has
    formalized the specification of the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol
    [DVMRP]. Various specifications for protocol inter-operation have also been produced
    (see, for example, [THALER96] and [PIMMBR]). However, none of these protocols
    seems ideally suited to the inter-domain routing case; that is, while these protocols
    are appropriate for the intra-domain routing environment, they break down in various
    ways when applied in to the multi-provider inter-domain case. This document considers
    some of the scaling, stability and policy issues that are of primary importance
    in a inter-domain, multi- provider multicast environment.</p>"
