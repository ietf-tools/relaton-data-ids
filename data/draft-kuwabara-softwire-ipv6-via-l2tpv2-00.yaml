abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo covers two topics: a brief summary of NTT Communications''
    commercial IPv6 service named "OCN IPv6", and a digest of the architecture, which
    includs the user network interface specification and some service specific parameters,
    of the service. For NTT Communications'' commercial IPv6 access service, IPv6
    tunnel is created over the exiting IPv4 network by Layer two tunneling protocol
    [RFC2661]. By using L2TP, almost all the problems, which is described in Softwire
    Problem Statement [I-D. ietf-softwire-problem- statement], is solved. The NTT
    Communications service and the architecture is one of a commercial grade solution
    example for softwire problem statement.</p>'
