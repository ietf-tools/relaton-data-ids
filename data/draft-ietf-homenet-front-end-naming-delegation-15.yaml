abstract:
- content: "<p>Home owners often have IPv6 devices that they wish to access over the
    Internet using names. Outsourcing the DNS servers to a DNS infrastructure protects
    against possible DDoS attacks as well as sudden renumbering of the home network.
    It has been possible to register and populate a DNS Zone with names since DNS
    became a thing, but it has been an activity typically reserved for experts. This
    document automates the process through creation of a Homenet Naming Authority
    (HNA), whose responsibility is to select, sign and publish names to a set of publicly
    visible servers. This document describes the mechanism that enables the HNA to
    outsource the naming service to the DNS Outsourcing Infrastructure (DOI) via a
    Distribution Manager (DM). In addition, this document deals with publication of
    a corresponding reverse zone.</p>"
