abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes a trusted browser security model intended to
    secure the mutual automated consent between the end-user and the content provider
    before allowing a web browser to engage the services of an arbitrary third-party
    add-on, extension or service. Properly implemented, this proposed security model
    would create a standardized API across all browsers to further the security of
    e-commerce and other on-line transactions.</p>"
