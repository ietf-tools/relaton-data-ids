abstract:
- content: "<p>Streaming video on P2P overlays puts extremely high demands and stress
    on the underlying network, especially in case of TV and live streaming. The EU
    research project NAPA-WINE has devised an overall architecture for live video
    streaming that supports the needs of the users and content providers, while being
    respective of network-level needs, as reducing inter-AS traffic using ALTO-like
    services. In this document, we describe generic elements of this software architecture
    for P2P live streaming and derive the corresponding implications for standardizing
    a Peer-to-Peer streaming protocol.</p>"
