    level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.
    This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages, as expressed by request
    methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields,
    along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms
    for content negotiation. This document obsoletes RFC 7231.</p>"
