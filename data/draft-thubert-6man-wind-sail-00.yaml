abstract:
- content: "<p>This draft proposes an extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to exchange
    Stateful Address Identification and Location between State Maintaining Entities
    located over a backbone link about attached nodes that are attached to the backbone
    via a Wireless Link, in order to maintain all the entities up-to-date and maintain
    reachability as the attached nodes move.</p>"
