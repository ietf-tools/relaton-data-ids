abstract:
- content: "<p>New protocols or protocol extensions are best designed with due consideration
    of the functionality needed to operate and manage the protocols. Retrofitting
    operations and management is sub-optimal. The purpose of this document is to provide
    guidance to authors and reviewers of documents that define new protocols or protocol
    extensions regarding aspects of operations and management that should be considered.
    This document obsoletes RFC 5706, replacing it completely and updating it with
    new operational and management techniques and mechanisms, and introduces a requirement
    for an “Operational and Management Considerations” section in Internet-Drafts,
    before they are progressed as publication as RFCs.</p>"
