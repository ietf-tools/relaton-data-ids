abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a simple Hashed Message Authentication Code
    (HMAC)-based key derivation function (HKDF), which can be used as a building block
    in various protocols and applications. The key derivation function (KDF) is intended
    to support a wide range of applications and requirements, and is conservative
    in its use of cryptographic hash functions. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
