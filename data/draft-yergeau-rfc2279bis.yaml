abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the Universal
    Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems. The
    originally proposed encodings of the UCS, however, were not compatible with many
    current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of UTF-8,
    the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic of preserving the full US-ASCII
    range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that
    rely on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo obsoletes
    and replaces RFC 2279.</p>"
