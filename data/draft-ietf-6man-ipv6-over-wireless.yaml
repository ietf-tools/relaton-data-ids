abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents an architecture and framework for IPv6 access
    networks that decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and Subnets
    from the link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast domains, and limits
    the reliance on link-layer broadcasts. This architecture is suitable for IPv6
    over any network, including non-broadcast networks, which is typically the case
    for intangible media such as wireless and virtual networks such as overlays. A
    study of the issues with IPv6 ND over intangible media is presented, and a framework
    to solve those issues within the new architecture is proposed.</p>"
