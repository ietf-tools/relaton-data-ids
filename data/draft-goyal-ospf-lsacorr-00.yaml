abstract:
- content: "<p>OSPF requires a router to recalculate its routing table whenever it
    receives a new router or network LSA. However, a topology change, such as a router
    down event, may cause a number of new LSAs to be generated. These LSAs may arrive
    at a router at different times. In order to avoid several routing table calculations
    in quick succession in such cases, commercial routers enforce a hold time between
    successive routing table calculations. The hold time based schemes, while limiting
    the number of routing table calculations, may also cause undesirable delays in
    convergence to the topology change. This ID describes an alternate approach to
    schedule routing table calculations, called LSA Correlation. Rather than using
    individual LSAs as triggers for routing table calculations, LSA Correlation scheme
    correlates the information in the LSAs to identify the topology change. A routing
    table calculation can be performed when the topology change has been identified,
    which could span multiple LSAs.</p>"
