abstract:
- content: <p>HTTP Cookies, as originally defined by Netscape in [NETSC] and as later
    updated by [RFC2109] , [RFC2965], and [I-D.ietf-httpstate-cookie] did not address
    the issue of how to restrict for which domains a server is allowed to set a cookie.
    This is particularly a problem for servers hosted in top-level domains having
    subdomains that are controlled by registries and not by domain owners, e.g., "co.uk"
    and "city.state.us" domains. In such situations, unless the client uses some kind
    of domain black-list, it is possible for a malicious server to set cookies, so
    they are sent to all servers in a domain the attacker does not control. These
    cookies may adveresly affect the function of servers receiving them. The primary
    reason this is a problem is that the server receiving the cookie has no way of
    telling which server originally set it; therefore it is not able to distinguish
    reliably an invalid cookie from a valid one. This document proposes a new attribute,
    "$Origin", that is associated with each cookie and sent in all client cookie headers
    in the requests sent to the server. Servers recognizing the attribute may then
    check to see if the cookie was set by a server, which is allowed to set cookies
    for the server and, if necessary, ignore the cookie. This document updates RFC
    2109 and RFC 2965.</p>
