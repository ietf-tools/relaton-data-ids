abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes a mechanism to advertise IPv6 prefixes in BGP
    which are associated with Color Extended Communities to establish end-to-end intent-aware
    paths for SRv6 services. Such IPv6 prefixes are called "Colored Prefixes", and
    this mechanism is called Colored Prefix Routing (CPR). In SRv6 networks, the Colored
    prefixes are the SRv6 locators associated with different intent. SRv6 services
    (e.g. SRv6 VPN services) with specific intent could be assigned with SRv6 SIDs
    under the corresponding SRv6 locators, which are advertised as Colored prefixes.
    This allows the SRv6 service traffic to be steered into end-to-end intent-aware
    paths simply based on the longest prefix matching of SRv6 Service SIDs to the
    Colored prefixes. In data plane, dedicated transport label or SID for the inter-domain
    path is not needed, thus the encapsulation efficiency could be optimized. The
    existing IPv6 Address Family could be used for the advertisement of IPv6 Colored
    prefixes, thus this mechanism is easy to interoperate and can be deployed incrementally
    in multi-domain networks.</p>
