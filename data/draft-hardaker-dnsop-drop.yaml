abstract:
- content: "<p>When DNS replies to be sent over UDP exceed the requestor's UDP payload
    size, servers are expected to set the Truncated bit (TC) and remove remove additional
    information from the response. Clients receiving the TC bit might choose to retry
    the request over TCP to fetch the removed information. Sometimes this extra information
    is not important to the DNS resolution process and retrying over TCP may not be
    needed. This document defines the DP bit to indicate that the dropped information
    that caused the TC bit was supplemental information. This is useful, for example,
    in the case of Extended DNS Error information which may be mostly debugging related
    information.</p>"
