abstract:
- content: "<p>Some NAT boxes/routers allow the establishment of IPv6 tunnels from
    systems in the private LAN (using private IPv4 addresses) to routers or tunnel
    servers in the public Internet. As far as we know this is not a common way of
    use IPv6 tunnels; the usual way is to finish the tunnel directly in a device with
    an IPv4 public address. This behavior provides a big opportunity to rapidly deploy
    a huge number of IPv6 nodes and networks, without the need of new transition mechanism.
    This option is very important to facilitate the IPv6 deployment. This document
    describes this behavior and provides hints that should be applied in the NAT boxes
    and tunnel brokers to facilitate it.</p>"
