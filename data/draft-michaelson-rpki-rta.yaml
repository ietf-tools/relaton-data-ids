    a general purpose Resource Tagged Attestation (RTA), for use with the Resource
    Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The objective is to allow an attestation, in

    validation to provide an outcome of "valid with resources". The profile is intended
    to provide for the signing of an attestation with an arbitrary set of resources.</p>
