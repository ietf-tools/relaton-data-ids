abstract:
- content: "<p>An SDF specification can describe the definition of Things, i.e., physical
    objects and their associated interactions, and express the various information
    that is exchanged for these interactions. Therefore, the SDF format can be used
    to define the behavior of an object and its associated data model and interaction
    model in a digital twin system that includes the object as a component. In a digital
    twin system, interactions between physical and virtual objects, as well as interactions
    of objects existing in different digital twin systems, are performed over a network,
    making it important to provide location information of objects during interactions.
    This document specifies the extension of SDF to represent the location information
    of objects.</p>"
