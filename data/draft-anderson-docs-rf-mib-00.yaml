abstract:
- content: "<p>This Internet-Draft outlines the Radio Frequency (RF) Interface Management
    Information Bases (MIBs) for high-speed data-over-cable systems developed by the
    MCNS Data Over Cable Services working group. Two Simple Network Management Protocol
    (SNMP) MIBs are defined. The first is the MCNS Interface MIB and defines objects
    that enable management of the CATV MAC and PHY layer interfaces. The second is
    the MCNS Cable Modem (CM) MIB and defines objects that enable management of CMs
    and Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).</p>"
