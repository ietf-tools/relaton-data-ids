abstract:
- content: <p>There are many deployment scenarios that require an egress Label Switching
    Router (LSR) to receive binding of the Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic
    Engineering (RSVP-TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) to an application and a payload
    identifier using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This document defines protocol
    mechanisms to address this requirement. The procedures described in this document
    are equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
    LSPs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
