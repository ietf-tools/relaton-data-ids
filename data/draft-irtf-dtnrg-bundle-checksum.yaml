abstract:
- content: "<p>The Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol includes a custody transfer
    mechanism to provide acknowledgements of receipt for particular bundles. No checksum
    is included in the basic DTN Bundle Protocol, however, so at intermediate hops,
    it is not possible to verify that bundles have been either forwarded or passed
    through convergence layers without error. Without assurance that a bundle has
    been received without errors, the custody transfer receipt cannot guarantee that
    a correct copy of the bundle has been transferred, and errored bundles are forwarded
    when the destination cannot use the errored content, and discarding the errored
    bundle early would have been better for performance and throughput reasons. This
    document addresses that situation by defining new ciphersuites for use within
    the existing Bundle Security Protocol's Payload Integrity Block (formerly called
    the Payload Security Block [ED: remove old name before RFC]) to provide error-detection
    functions that do not require support for other, more complex, security-providing
    ciphersuites that protect integrity against deliberate modifications. This creates
    the checksum service needed for error-free reliability, and does so by separating
    security concerns from the few new reliability-only ciphersuite definitions that
    are introduced here. The reliability- only ciphersuites given here are intended
    to protect only against errors and accidental modification; not against deliberate
    integrity violations. This document discusses the advantages and disadvantages
    of this approach and the existing constraints that combined to drive this design.</p>"
