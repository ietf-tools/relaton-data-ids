abstract:
- content: "<p>As described in [I-D.xiong-rtgwg-precise-tn-requirements], the deterministic
    networks not only need to offer the Service Level Agreements (SLA) guarantees
    such as low latency and jitter, low packet loss and high reliability, but also
    need to support the precise services such as flexible resource allocation and
    service isolation so as to the Precise Transport Networking. However, under the
    existing IP network architecture with statistical multiplexing characteristics,
    the existing deterministic technologies are facing long-distance transmission,
    queue scheduling, dynamic flows and per- flow state maintenance and other controversial
    issues especially in Wide Area Network (WAN) applications. This document analyses
    the problems in existing deterministic technologies to provide precise services
    in various industries such as 5G networks.</p>"
