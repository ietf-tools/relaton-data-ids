abstract:
- content: "<p>When certificates are used as credentials to attest the assignment
    or ownership of telephone numbers, some mechanism is required to convey certificate
    freshness to relying parties. Certififcate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are commonly
    used for this purpose, but for certain classes of certificates, including delegate
    certificates conveying their scope of authority by-reference in Secure Telephone
    Identity Revisited (STIR) systems, they may not be aligned with the needs of relying
    parties. This document specifies the use of the Online Certificate Status Protocol
    (OCSP) as a means of retrieving real-time status information about such certificates,
    defining new extensions to compensate for the dynamism of telephone number assignments.</p>"
