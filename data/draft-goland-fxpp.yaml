abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an independent reference for the XML processing
    profile developed by the WebDAV WG in [RFC2518]. It does this by copying Section
    14 and Appendix 4 as well as examples from Appendix 3 of [RFC2518] and editing
    out any WebDAV specific parts. This information has been broken out into its own
    independent reference in order to make it easier for other standards to reference
    just the WebDAV XML processing profile without having to reference the entire
    WebDAV standard or require their readers to understand which parts of the profile
    are WebDAV specific and which parts are not.</p>"
