abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration systems
    poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and client_secret, can
    be complex and error-prone. Instead of manual provisioning these credentials the
    industry has moved to a federation-based approach where credentials of the underlying
    workload platform are used as assertions towards an OAuth authorization server
    leveraging the Client Assertion Flow [RFC7521], in particular [RFC7523]. This
    specification describes a meta flow in Section 3.1, gives security recommendations
    in Section 4 and outlines concrete patterns in Appendix A.</p>"
