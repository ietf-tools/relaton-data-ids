abstract:
- content: "<p>To support real-time services such as VoIP in Mobile IPv4/v6, several
    fast handover methods have been proposed. The fast handover method using BET is
    one of them and was chosen as an alternate protocol to FMIPv6 version 4. BET has
    advantage in reducing the handover latency because it does not perform the layer
    3 registration. However, the long BET in certain situation could be not acceptable.
    In that case, a mechanism is needed to limit the tunnel length of BET. In this
    draft, we propose to group the ARs by predefined value to limit the tunnel length
    of BET. An anchor router is changed whenever a MN changes its associated group.</p>"
