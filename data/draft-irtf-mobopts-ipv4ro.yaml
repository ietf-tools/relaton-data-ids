abstract:
- content: "<p>The motivation for this document comes from considerations in implementing
    IPv6 Return Routability in an IPv4 network, especially where the Mobile Node and
    the Correspondent Nodes are capable of performing IPv6-in-IPv4 tunneling. As a
    result, this document proposes an IPv4 Address extension to Mobile IPv6 Return
    Routability procedure which can provide route optimization for IPv4 traffic.</p>"
