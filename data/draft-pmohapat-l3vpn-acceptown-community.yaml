abstract:
- content: "<p>Under certain conditions it is desirable for a BGP route reflector
    to be able to modify the Route Target list of a VPN route that is distributed
    by the route reflector, enabling the route reflector to control how a route originated
    within one VRF is imported into other VRFs. This technique works effectively as
    long as the VRF that exports the route is not on the same PE as the VRF(s) that
    import the route. However, due to the constraints of the BGP protocol, it does
    not work if the two are on the same PE. This document describes a modification
    to the BGP protocol allowing this technique to work when the VRFs are on the same
    PE, allowing the technique to be used in a standard manner throughout an autonomous
    system.</p>"
