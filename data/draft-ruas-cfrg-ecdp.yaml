abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Elliptic Curve Data Protocol (ECDP), a
    peer-to-peer (P2P) communication protocol tailored for decentralized networks.
    ECDP utilizes elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for encryption, employs the Elliptic
    Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for message authentication, and leverages
    the Diffie-Hellman key exchange using elliptic curves for secure session initialization.
    The protocol supports a variety of elliptic curves (e.g., secp256k1, secp384r1)
    with varying key sizes, and is designed to operate over both TCP and UDP. Additionally,
    it utilizes SHA-256 or SHA-512 for cryptographic hash verification to ensure message
    integrity.</p>"
