abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes mechanisms and introduces a protocol for the management
    of cryptographic keys as required for the management of security associations
    in IPSP and IPv6. Our key management scheme adheres to a modular approach, namely,
    the scheme is separated into two modules: An upper module in which a long-lived
    (``master'') key is exchanged between the communicating parties, and a lower module,
    in which the already shared (master) key is used for the derivation, sharing and/or
    refreshment of additional short-lived keys to be used for the cryptographic transformations
    applied to the data. In this draft, we concentrate on the management module for
    short-lived keys, and indicate how proposed variants of public key-based master
    key exchange protocols can be accommodated in the upper module.</p>"
