abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a data model for managing Sieve scripts on a
    server using JMAP. Open Issues o Do we need/want both "content" and "blobId" in
    the SieveScript object? It may be simpler to have just one way of specifying content
    and "blobId" is more versatile and doesn't require JSON- encoding of the content.
    Furthermore, use of the forthcoming(?) Blob/set method would avoid the extra roundtrip
    of having to upload the blob first. o Should changes made by onSuccessActivateScript
    be reported in the response to the client-initiated request, or via a second implicit
    SIeveScript/set response? o The strawman for SieveScript/test only uses blobIds.
    Will this have to change once the issue regarding content/blobId in SieveScript
    is resolved?</p>
