abstract:
- content: "<p>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements
    in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
    against outside observers and attackers. Privacy has also been a key focus area,
    and understanding the privacy implications of new Internet technology is an important
    factor when IETF works on such technologies. One key aspect of privacy is minimization
    of data disclosed to other parties. This document highlights the need for a particular
    focus with respect to data minimization. Avoiding data leakage to outside parties
    is of course important, but it can also be necessary to limit it among the primary
    protocol participants. This is because is necessary to protect against endpoints
    that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the
    interests of users. It is important to consider the role of a participant and
    limit any data provided to it according to that role.</p>"
