abstract:
- content: "<p>The Network Control Protocol (NCP) facilitates the configuration and
    rapid reconfiguration of mobile wireless beam-formed networks. It controls the
    operation of a network of omni-directional packet radios (orderwire) that overlays
    the mobile wireless network. Each network element in this network uses Global
    Positioning System (GPS) information to control a beamforming antenna subsystem
    which provides for spatial reuse. The GPS information is shared among the network
    elements over the orderwire and an optimal topology for the beam-formed links
    is determined.</p>"
