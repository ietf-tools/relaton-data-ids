abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose a diff-serv per hop behavior (PHB) for the transport of
    non-real time traffic with a guaranteed rate (GR). This proposal is based on principles
    developed for the specification of the Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR) service category
    currently being specified for ATM [TM5]. It is shown that a diff-serv network
    using the GR PHB together with a explicit routing capability can support edge-to-edge
    guaranteed rate service. Interconnection of diff-serv networks deploying GR to
    achieve end-to-end service and interworking with ATM's GFR service are also discussed.</p>"
