abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint
    (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs. Cryptographic
    digests provide a means of uniquely identifying static data without the need for
    a registration authority. A fingerprint is a form of presenting a cryptographic
    digest that makes it suitable for use in applications where human readability
    is required. The UDF fingerprint format improves over existing formats through
    the introduction of a compact algorithm identifier affording an intentionally
    limited choice of digest algorithm and the inclusion of an IANA registered MIME
    Content-Type identifier within the scope of the digest input to allow the use
    of a single fingerprint format in multiple application domains. Alternative means
    of rendering fingerprint values are considered including machine-readable codes,
    word and image lists. This document is also available online at http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-udf.html
