abstract:
- content: <p>Consider a BGP free core scenario with LDP running in the core. Suppose
    the edge BGP speakers PE1 and PE2 know about a prefix P/m via the external routers
    CE1 and CE2. If the edge LSR PE1 crashes or becomes totally disconnected from
    the core, it is desirable for a core LSR "P", that is carrying traffic to the
    failed edge LSR PE1, to immediately restore traffic by re-routing packets destined
    to the prefix P/m from the LSP terminating on PE1 to be forwarded over the LSP
    terminating on PE2, until BGP reconverges. If the packets originally flowing to
    the failed edge LSR PE1 are BGP labeled, then the repairing core LSR P must swap
    the label (corresponding to prefix P/m) advertised by the failed edge LSR PE1
    with the label advertised for the same prefix by the edge LSR PE2 before re-routing
    the packets through an LSP terminating on PE2. To implement BGP edge node protection
    in a BGP-free LDP core, this document proposes an extension to LDP. This extension
    allows an LDP speaker running on a Edge LSR Node (e.g. PE1) to inform the LDP
    speakers running on core LSRs about the "Repair" edge LSR (e.g. PE2), as well
    as Repair LSR's label for prefix P/m, if any.</p>
