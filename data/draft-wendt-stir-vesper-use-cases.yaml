abstract:
- content: "<p>This document discusses a set of use cases and requirements for an
    extension to Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) called VESPER (Verifiable
    STI PERsona). VESPER enhances STIR by incorporating a trust framework that associating
    a responsible business entity and/or human with the assignment and right-to-use
    a telephone number. Important to the use-cases and requirements are mechanisms
    for the preservation of privacy and explicit choice to reveal information beyond
    the communications service provider you have chosen to assign the telephone number
    with. Core to this premise is the ability to represent and prove the right to
    use a telephone number resource via the legitimate holder of the Vesper token.
    Additional metadata and attributes can be vetted and attested via vetting policies
    and Know- Your-Customer (KYC) processes that are not defined as part of this effort
    but should follow jurisdiction specific best practices and policies that may exist.
    The framework allows for the leveraging of trusted and identified issuers to create
    a signed credential known as a VESPER token that will be defined including associated
    claims and potential paths for extensibility in the future. In addition, transparency
    mechanisms are explored to provide public logs or registries of certificates,
    keys, entity information, or telephone number details, if desired by the telephone
    number holder to improve trustability, visibility and accountability within the
    telephone ecosystem. This document covers various scenarios in which VESPER can
    be used to enhance trust in communications, focusing on common real-world deployments
    and corresponding requirements. This work is intended to complement and align
    with the framework described currently as a work in progress in [I-D.wendt-stir-vesper].</p>"
