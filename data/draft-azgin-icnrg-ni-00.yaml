abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this proposal is to introduce the notion of network
    identifier (NI) in the ICN architecture. This is in addition to the existing names
    (i.e., content identifiers, CIs, or application identifiers, AIs, in general)
    that are currently used for both naming and routing/forwarding purposes. Network
    identifiers are needed considering the requirements on future networking architectures
    such as: (i) to support persistent names (or persistently named objects) and large-scale
    and high-speed mobility of any network entity (i.e, devices, services, and content),
    (ii) to accommodate different types of Internet of Things (IoT) services, many
    of which require low- latency performance, and enabling edge computing to support
    service virtualization, which will require support for large scale migration and
    replication of named resources, and (iii) to scale the ICN architecture to future
    Internet scale considering the exponentially increasing named entities. These
    considerations also require enabling a network based name resolution service for
    efficient and scalable routing. In the current draft, we begin by highlighting
    the issues associated with ICN networking when utilizing only the AIs, which include
    persistently named content, services, and devices. Next we discuss the function
    NI serves, and provide a discussion on the two current NI-based proposals, along
    with their scope and functionalities. This is with the objective of having a single
    NI construct for ICN that is flexible enough to adapt to different networking
    contexts.</p>"
