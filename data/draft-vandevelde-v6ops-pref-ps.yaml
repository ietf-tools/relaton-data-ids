abstract:
- content: "<p>Within an administrative realm, especially during an IPv6 implementation
    period, the network operator has interest to have control on the IP protocol version
    (IPv4 or IPv6) used by the end systems and network devices. This document provides
    a problem statement about both protocol preference and protocol selection many
    network operators face when implementing IPv6 in a controlled process.</p>"
