abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a
    piece of software, and conveying that delegation to the software. This delegation
    can include access to a set of APIs as well as information passed directly to
    the software. This document has been prepared by the GNAP working group design
    team of Kathleen Moriarty, Fabien Imbault, Dick Hardt, Mike Jones, and Justin
    Richer. This document is input into the GNAP working group and includes many notes
    on areas of discussion and decision that need to be made by the GNAP working group.
    Many of the features in this proposed protocol can be accomplished in a number
    of alternative ways, and where possible, the editor has included notes and discussion
    from the design team regarding the options as understood. The design team believes
    that this document represents a reasonable starting point for the working group
    and submits all content to the working group for consensus building.</p>"
