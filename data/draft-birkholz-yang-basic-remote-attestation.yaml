- content: "<p>This document defines a YANG RPC and a minimal datastore tree required
    to retrieve attestation evidence about integrity measurements from a composite
    device with one or more roots of trust for reporting. Complementary measurement
    logs are also provided by the YANG RPC originating from one or more roots of trust
    of measurement. The module defined requires a TPM 2.0 and corresponding Trusted
    Software Stack included in the device components of the composite device the YANG
    server is running on.</p>"
