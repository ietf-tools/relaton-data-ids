abstract:
- content: <p>Today, a BGP speaker can advertise one nexthop for a set of NLRIs in
    an Update. This nexthop can be encoded in either the BGP-Nexthop attribute (code
    3), or inside the MP_REACH attribute (code 14). For cases where multiple nexthops
    need to be advertised, BGP-Addpath is used. Though Addpath allows basic ability
    to advertise multiple- nexthops, it does not allow the sender to specify desired
    relationship between the multiple nexthops being advertised e.g., relative-preference,
    type of load-balancing. These are local decisions at the receiving speaker based
    on local configuration and path-selection between the various additional-paths,
    which may tie- break on some arbitrary step like Router-Id or BGP nexthop address.
    Some scenarios with a BGP-free core may benefit from having a mechanism, where
    egress-node can signal multiple-nexthops along with their relationship, in one
    BGP route, to ingress nodes. This document defines a new BGP attribute "MultiNexthop
    (MNH)" that can be used for this purpose. This attribute can be used for both
    labeled and unlabled BGP families. The MNH can be used to advertise MPLS label
    along with nexthop for unlabeled families (e.g. Inet Unicast, Inet6 Unicast).
    Such that, mechanisms at the transport layer can work uniformly on labeled and
    unlabled BGP families. Service route scale can be confined closer to the service
    edge nodes, making the transport layer nodes light and nimble. They dont have
    any service route state, only have service end-point state. The MNH plays different
    role in "downstream allocation" scenario than "upstream allocation" scenario.
    E.g. for RFC8277 families that advertise downstream allocated labels, the MNH
    can play the "Label Descriptor" role, describing the forwarding semantics of the
    label being advertised. This can be useful in network visualization and controller
    based traffic engineering (e.g. EPE).</p>
