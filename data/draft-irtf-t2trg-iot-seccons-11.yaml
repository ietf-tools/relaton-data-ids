abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard
    Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.
    The security needs for IoT systems are well- recognized and many standardization
    steps to provide security have been taken, for example, the specification of Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).
    However, security challenges still exist, not only because there are some use
    cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices and systems
    have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities. In this
    document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. Next,
    we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might
    face to protect against these threats. Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed
    to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems. This document can be used
    by IoT standards specifications as a reference for details about security considerations
    applying to the specified protocol. This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing
    Research Group (T2TRG).</p>"
