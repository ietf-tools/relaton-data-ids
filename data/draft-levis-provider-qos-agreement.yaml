abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo analyzes provider-to-provider Quality of Service (QoS) agreements
    suitable for a global QoS-enabled Internet. It defines terminology relevant to
    inter-domain QoS models. It proposes a new concept denoted by Meta-QoS-Class (MQC).
    This concept could potentially drive and federate the way QoS inter-domain relationships
    are built between providers. It opens up new perspectives for a QoS- enabled Internet
    that retains, as much as possible, the openness of the existing best-effort Internet.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
