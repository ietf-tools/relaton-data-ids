abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents the Service Management Architecture, an architectural
    framework for defining SNMP MIB modules for Customer Network Management (CNM)
    of network services over connection-oriented networks. The work is motivated by
    the fundamental differences in management views and functionality between a service
    provider and a service customer. Differences between service provider and service
    customer include whole-network vs. network-portion view, direct vs. indirect management,
    and physical vs. logical view. These fundamental differences suggest a difference
    in philosophy between Service Management and Device Management. Much work has
    been done and experience gained in writing Device MIB modules for hands-on management
    of physical devices, but defining Service MIB modules is a relatively new area
    and requires the development of a new architectural framework.</p>"
