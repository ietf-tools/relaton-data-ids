abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends the MPLS
    control plane to encompass layer 2, time-division, wavelength and spatial switching.
    Along with the current development on IP over optical switching, considerable
    advances in optical transport systems based on the multiple optical switching
    granularities have been developed. Currently, GMPLS considers two layers of optical
    granularity using wavelengths and fibers. By introducing an extended definition
    of waveband switching, this document specifies the corresponding GMPLS extensions,
    to further integrate optical multi-granularity and benefit from the features of
    the corresponding switching layers.</p>"
