abstract:
- content: <p>It is commonly acknowledged that one of the issues raised by the current
    Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) design is that some packets are likely to
    be lost in specific situations such as the absence of a mapping entry in the mapping
    cache maintained by an ITR. This issue is usually referred to as the "first packet
    loss" problem. This document specifies a new LISP capability called Triggered
    Map- Request which aims at addressing the "first packet loss" issue. Also, it
    proposes to extend the LISP mapping entries with names instead of achieving RLOC
    resolution based upon EID prefixes only.</p>
