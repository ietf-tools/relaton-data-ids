- content: "<p>This document gives an overview of the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS)
    framework and protocol suite created by the NSIS Working Group during the period
    of 2001-2010. It also includes suggestions on how the industry can make use of
    the new protocols and how the community can exploit the extensibility of both
    the framework and existing protocols to address future signaling needs. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
