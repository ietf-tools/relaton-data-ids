abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes Cisco's Overlay Management Protocol (OMP).
    OMP is a routing information management and distribution protocol that enables
    overlay networks by separating service from transport. OMP is closely modeled
    and related to BGP. Primary usage for OMP is in Software Defined Networks, where
    all the routers are in the same administrative domain. OMP is used as the routing
    protocol in Cisco's Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) solution.</p>"
