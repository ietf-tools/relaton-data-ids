- content: "<p>The PPP protocol allows data transfer thru asynchronous or synchronous
    connections. But the prevalent Public Switched Data Networks (PSDNs) support connections
    between asynchronous and synchronous protocols. This document defines extensions
    to the PPP protocol to support asynchronous PAD to synchronous X.25 protocols
    on PSDNs.</p>"
