abstract:
- content: "<p>Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) introduces a scoped unicast addressing
    architecture, including the concept of site-local addressing. Although site-local
    addresses were originally defined for use in networks that were not yet connected
    to the Internet, there has been work underway for several years to expand the
    use of site-local addresses to globally connected IPv6 networks and nodes. The
    use of site-local addresses on globally connected networks and nodes raises complex
    technical issues for many parts of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Many of these issues
    are caused by the fact that IPv6 sites are private address spaces, and site-local
    addresses are unreachable or ambiguous outside the borders of their originating
    site. Site-local addresses also add significant complexity at the IP layer and
    at other layers of the protocol stack. In addition, many of the benefits of site-local
    addressing can be achieved using mechanisms that are significantly less complex
    and that cause fewer problems than IPv6 site-local addressing. This document makes
    a recommendation to limit the use of site-local addresses to isolated, single-site
    networks, and offers suggestions for less complicated mechanisms to achieve many
    of the benefits currently attributed to IPv6 site-local addressing.</p>"
