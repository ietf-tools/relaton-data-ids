abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the
    space of federated access management. Most of this effort has focused on two use-cases:
    network access and web-based access. However, the solutions to these use-cases
    that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few common building blocks in
    common. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the
    commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non- federated access
    management, including the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
    and the Diameter protocol, the Generic Security Service (GSS), the GS2 family,
    the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and the Security Assertion Markup
    Language (SAML). The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management
    to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers
    of identity providers, relying parties, and federations.</p>"
