abstract:
- content: "<p>For Mobile IPv6 service, the mobile node first connects to an Access
    Router and obtain an IPv6 address to use it as a Care-of-Address. In many networks,
    the Access Router sends Router Advertisement to the mobile node to convey various
    information. If the Access Router has the knowledge of the mobile nodes home info
    such as home agent address, the Access Router can convey that info to the mobile
    node along with the Router Advertisement. This document proposes a method that
    will allow the Access Router to include home info of the mobile node in the Router
    Advertisement message.</p>"
