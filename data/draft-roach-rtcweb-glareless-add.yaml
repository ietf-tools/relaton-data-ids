abstract:
- content: <p>One of the ongoing challenges in dealing with the massive number of
    streams that RTCWEB implementations may wish to instantiate and manipulate is
    the ability to add and remove streams in a way that avoids the condition known
    as "glare." This document describes a non-normative set of behaviors that RTCWEB
    implementations can implement to completely avoid inducing a glare condition.</p>
