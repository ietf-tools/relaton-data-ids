abstract:
- content: <p>The IETF QUIC working group has been chartered to produce extensions
    that would "enable ... multipath capabilities" since the working group was formed
    in 2016, but because multipath was an extension, work on multipath, and the other
    extensions named in the charter, waited while work proceeded on the core QUIC
    protocol specifications. After the QUIC working group chairs requested publication
    for the core QUIC protocol specifications, they scheduled a virtual interim meeting
    to understand the use cases that various groups inside and outside the IETF were
    envisioning for multipath with QUIC. As part of that discussion, it became obvious
    that people had a variety of ideas about how multiple paths would be used, because
    they weren't looking at the same use cases, and so had different assumptions about
    how applications might use QUIC over multiple paths. This document is intended
    to capture questions that have come up in discussions, with some suggested answers,
    to inform further discussion in the working group.</p>
