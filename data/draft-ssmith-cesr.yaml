abstract:
- content: "<p>The Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) is dual text-
    binary encoding format that has the unique property of text-binary concatenation
    composability. This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse
    of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining
    separability of individual primtives. This enables convenient usability in the
    text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain. CESR primitives are
    self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing
    and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. CESR supports composable text-binary
    encodings for general data types as well as suites of cryptographic material.
    Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while
    less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable
    types. CESR streams also support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations.
    CESR is a universal encoding that uniquely provides dual text and binary domain
    representations via composable conversion.</p>"
