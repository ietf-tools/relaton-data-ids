abstract:
- content: "<p>End-to-end applications have difficulty distinguishing between packets
    that have been passed through a Network Address Translator (NAT) and packets that
    have been passed along a clear end-to-end path. We propose mechanisms for IPv4
    and IPv6 whereby NAT devices explicitly signal their operation as a means of allowing
    applications to distinguish the presence of otherwise undetected NATs in the end-
    to-end path.</p>"
