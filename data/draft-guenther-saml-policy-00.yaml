abstract:
- content: "<p>Rules of an authorization policy prescribe under which conditions an
    entity or subject has which permissions. Existing policies support identity-based
    authorization by matching the authenticated identity of the entity requesting
    access to a resource with the available policies. This document is about formulating
    policy rules that express conditions with respect to SAML assertions, thereby
    supporting non-identity-based authorization and anonymity.</p>"
